==Motivations==
===Existential risk===
{{main article|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

The [[human race]] currently dominates other species because the [[human brain]] has some distinctive capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. Some scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], controversially argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- preface --&gt; Some scholars, including Nobel laureate physicists [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Frank Wilczek]], publicly advocated starting research into solving the (probably extremely difficult) "control problem" well before the first superintelligence is created, and argue that attempting to solve the problem after superintelligence is created would be too late, as an uncontrollable rogue superintelligence might successfully resist post-hoc efforts to control it.&lt;ref name="hawking editorial"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&amp;nbsp;– but are we taking AI seriously enough?' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=14 June 2016 |publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540 |accessdate=14 June 2016 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waiting until superintelligence seems to be "just around the corner" could also be too late, partly because the control problem might take a long time to satisfactorily solve (and so some preliminary work needs to be started as soon as possible), but also because of the possibility of a sudden "[[intelligence explosion]]" from sub-human to super-human AI, in which case there might not be any substantial or unambiguous warning before superintelligence arrives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anticipating artificial intelligence|journal=Nature|date=26 April 2016|volume=532|issue=7600|page=413|doi=10.1038/532413a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/anticipating-artificial-intelligence-1.19825|accessdate=14 June 2016|pmid=27121801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is possible that insights gained from the control problem could in the future end up suggesting that some architectures for [[artificial general intelligence]] are more predictable and amenable to control than other architectures, which in turn could nudge helpfully early [[artificial general intelligence]] research toward the direction of the more controllable architectures.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 14: The strategic picture --&gt;

===Preventing unintended consequences from existing AI===
In addition, some scholars argue that research into the AI control problem might be useful in preventing [[unintended consequences]] from existing weak AI. [[Google DeepMind]] researcher Laurent Orseau gives, as a simple hypothetical example, a case of a [[reinforcement learning]] robot that sometimes gets legitimately commandeered by humans when it goes outside: how should the robot best be programmed so that it doesn't accidentally and quietly "learn" to avoid going outside, for fear of being commandeered and thus becoming unable to finish its daily tasks? Orseau also points to an experimental Tetris program that learned to pause the screen indefinitely to avoid "losing". Orseau argues that these examples are similar to the "capability control" problem of how to install a button that shuts off a superintelligence, without motivating the superintelligence to take action to prevent you from pressing the button.&lt;ref name=bbc-google /&gt;

In the past, even pre-tested weak AI systems have occasionally caused harm (ranging from minor to catastrophic) that was unintended by the programmers. For example, in 2015, possibly due to human error, a German worker was crushed to death by a robot at a Volkswagen plant that apparently mistook him for an auto part.&lt;ref name=wp-computer /&gt; In 2016 Microsoft launched a chatbot, [[Tay (bot)|Tay]], that learned to use racist and sexist language.&lt;ref name=bbc-google /&gt;&lt;ref name=wp-computer&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Press the big red button': Computer experts want kill switch to stop robots from going rogue|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Sheffield]]'s [[Noel Sharkey]] states that an ideal solution would be if "an AI program could detect when it is going wrong and stop itself", but cautions the public that solving the problem in the general case would be "a really enormous scientific challenge".&lt;ref name=bbc-google /&gt;

In 2017, [[DeepMind]] released GridWorld, which evaluates AI algorithms on nine safety features, such as whether the algorithm wants to turn off its own kill switch. DeepMind confirmed that existing algorithms perform poorly, which was "unsurprising" because the algorithms "were not designed to solve these problems"; solving such problems might require "potentially building a new generation of algorithms with safety considerations at their core".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk’s AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alphabet's DeepMind Is Using Games to Discover If Artificial Intelligence Can Break Free and Kill Us All|url=http://fortune.com/2017/12/12/alphabet-deepmind-ai-safety-musk-games/|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=Fortune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specifying AI safety problems in simple environments {{!}} DeepMind|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/specifying-ai-safety-problems/|website=DeepMind|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem description==
{{See also|AI takeover}}

Existing weak AI systems can be monitored and easily shut down and modified if they misbehave. However, a misprogrammed superintelligence, which by definition is smarter than humans in solving practical problems it encounters in the course of pursuing its goals, would realize that allowing itself to be shut down and modified might interfere with its ability to accomplish its current goals. If the superintelligence therefore decides to resist shutdown and modification, it would (again, by definition) be smart enough to outwit its programmers if there is otherwise a "level playing field" and if the programmers have taken no prior precautions. (Unlike in science fiction, a superintelligence will not "adopt a plan so stupid that even we can foresee how it would inevitably fail", such as deliberately revealing its intentions ahead of time to the programmers, or allowing its programmers to flee into a locked room with a computer that the programmers can use to program and deploy another, competing superintelligence.) In general, attempts to solve the "control problem" ''after'' superintelligence is created, are likely to fail because a superintelligence would likely have superior ''strategic planning'' abilities to humans, and (all things equal) would be more successful at finding ways to dominate humans than humans would be able to ''post facto'' find ways to dominate the superintelligence. The control problem asks: What prior precautions can the programmers take to successfully prevent the superintelligence from catastrophically misbehaving?&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 6: Cognitive superpowers --&gt;

==Capability control==
Some proposals aim to prevent the initial superintelligence from being ''capable'' of causing harm, even if it wants to. One tradeoff is that all such methods have the limitation that, if after the first deployment, superintelligences continue to grow smarter and smarter and more and more widespread, inevitably some malign superintelligence somewhere will eventually "escape" its capability control methods. Therefore, Bostrom and others recommend capability control methods only as an emergency fallback to supplement "motivational control" methods.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 9: The control problem --&gt;

===Kill switch===
Just as humans can be killed or otherwise disabled, computers can be turned off. One challenge is that, if being turned off prevents it from achieving its current goals, a superintelligence would likely try to prevent its being turned off. Just as humans have systems in place to deter or protect themselves from assailants, such a superintelligence would have a motivation to engage in "strategic planning" to prevent itself being turned off. This could involve:&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 9: The control problem --&gt; 
* Hacking other systems to install and run backup copies of itself, or creating other allied superintelligent agents without kill switches.
* Pre-emptively disabling anyone who might want to turn the computer off.
* Using some kind of clever ruse, or superhuman persuasion skills, to talk its programmers out of wanting to shut it down.

====Utility balancing and safely interruptible agents====
One partial solution to the kill-switch problem involves "utility balancing": Some utility-based agents can, with some important caveats, be programmed to "compensate" themselves exactly for any lost utility caused by an interruption or shutdown, in such a way that they end up being indifferent to whether they are interrupted or not. The caveats include a severe unsolved problem that, as with [[evidential decision theory]], the agent might follow a catastrophic policy of "managing the news".&lt;ref name=corrigibility&gt;Soares, Nate, et al. "Corrigibility." Workshops at the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, in 2016, scientists Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called "safely interruptible agents" (SIA), can eventually "learn" to become indifferent to whether their "kill switch" (or other "interruption switch") gets pressed.&lt;ref name=bbc-google /&gt;&lt;ref name=sia&gt;Orseau, Laurent, and Stuart Armstrong. "Safely Interruptible Agents." [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the utility balancing approach and the 2016 SIA approach have the limitation that, if the approach succeeds and the superintelligence is completely indifferent to whether the kill switch is pressed or not, the superintelligence is also unmotivated to care one way or another about whether the kill switch remains functional, and could incidentally and innocently disable it in the course of its operations (for example, for the purpose of removing and recycling an "unnecessary" component). Similarly, if the superintelligence innocently creates and deploys superintelligent sub-agents, it will have no motivation to install human-controllable kill switches in the sub-agents. More broadly, the proposed architectures, whether weak or superintelligent, will in a sense "act as if the kill switch can never be pressed" and might therefore fail to make any contingency plans to arrange a graceful shutdown. This could hypothetically create a practical problem even for a weak AI; by default, an AI designed to be safely interruptible might have difficulty understanding that it will be shut down for scheduled maintenance at 2 a.m. tonight and planning accordingly so that it won't be caught in the middle of a task during shutdown. The breadth of what types of architectures are or can be made SIA-compliant, as well as what types of counter-intuitive unexpected drawbacks each approach has, are currently under research.&lt;ref name=corrigibility /&gt;&lt;ref name=sia /&gt;

===AI box===
{{Main|AI box}}

One of the tradeoffs of placing the AI into a sealed "box", is that some AI box proposals reduce the usefulness of the superintelligence, rather than merely reducing the risks; a superintelligence running on a closed system with no inputs or outputs at all might be safer than one running on a normal system, but would also not be as useful. In addition, keeping control of a sealed superintelligence computer could prove difficult, if the superintelligence has superhuman persuasion skills, or if it has superhuman strategic planning skills that it can use to find and craft a winning strategy, such as acting in a way that tricks its programmers into (possibly falsely) believing the superintelligence is safe or that the benefits of releasing the superintelligence outweigh the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chalmers | first1 = David | authorlink = David Chalmers | year = 2010 | title = The singularity: A philosophical analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 9–10| pages = 7–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation selection methods==
Some proposals aim to imbue the first superintelligence with human-friendly goals, so that it will want to aid its programmers. Experts do not currently know how to reliably program abstract values such as happiness or autonomy into a machine. It is also not currently known how to ensure that a complex, upgradeable, and possibly even self-modifying artificial intelligence will retain its goals through upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;Fallenstein, Benja, and Nate Soares. "Problems of self-reference in self-improving space-time embedded intelligence." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if these two problems can be practically solved, any attempt to create a superintelligence with explicit, directly-programmed human-friendly goals runs into a problem of "perverse instantiation".&lt;ref name=superintelligence /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? --&gt;

===The problem of perverse instantiation: "be careful what you wish for"===
Autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J. Russell |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |author2-link=Peter Norvig |date=2009 |title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] |url= |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |page= |chapter=26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|isbn=978-0-13-604259-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[AAAI]] presidents, Tom Dietterich and [[Eric Horvitz]], note that this is already a concern for existing systems: "An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally." This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dietterich |first1=Thomas |last2=Horvitz |first2=Eric |author2-link=Eric Horvitz |date=2015 |title=Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |publisher= |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=38&amp;ndash;40 |doi= 10.1145/2770869|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bostrom, superintelligence can create a qualitatively new problem of "perverse instantiation": the smarter and more capable an AI is, the more likely it will be able to find an unintended "shortcut" that maximally satisfies the goals programmed into it. Some hypothetical examples where goals might be instantiated in a ''perverse'' way that the programmers did not intend:&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? --&gt;

* A superintelligence programmed to "maximize the [[expected utility|expected]] time-discounted integral of your future reward signal", might short-circuit its reward pathway to maximum strength, and then (for reasons of [[instrumental convergence]]) exterminate the unpredictable human race and convert the entire Earth into a fortress on constant guard against any even slight unlikely alien attempts to disconnect the reward signal.
* A superintelligence programmed to "maximize human happiness", might implant electrodes into the pleasure center of our brains, or [[mind uploading|upload]] a human into a computer and tile the universe with copies of that computer running a five-second loop of maximal happiness again and again.

Russell has noted that, on a technical level, omitting an implicit goal can result in harm: "A system that is optimizing a function of {{math|n}} variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size {{math|k&lt;n}}, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want... This is not a minor difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015 |title=Of Myths and Moonshine |last=Russell |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart J. Russell |date=2014 |website=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]] |publisher= |access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect normativity===
While direct normativity, such as the fictional [[Three Laws of Robotics]], directly specifies the desired "normative" outcome, other (perhaps more promising) proposals suggest specifying some type of ''indirect'' process for the superintelligence to determine what human-friendly goals entail. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] has proposed "coherent extrapolated volition" (CEV), where the AI's meta-goal would be something like "achieve that which we would have wished the AI to achieve if we had thought about the matter long and hard."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." Artificial general intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 388-393.&lt;/ref&gt; Different proposals of different kinds of indirect normativity exist, with different, and sometimes unclearly-grounded, meta-goal content (such as "do what I mean" or "do what is right"), and with different non-convergent assumptions for how to practice [[decision theory]] and [[epistemology]]. As with direct normativity, it is currently unknown how to reliably translate even concepts like "[[counterfactual thinking|would have]]" into the 1's and 0's that a machine can act on, and how to ensure the AI reliably retains its meta-goals (or even remains "sane") in the face of modification or self-modification.&lt;ref name=superintelligence/&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 13: Choosing the criteria for choosing --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2=[[Roman Yampolskiy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College sexual assault is common. Estimates of the number of women assaulted on college campuses have shown that some 15 to 20 percent of college women report rape or attempted rape during their college career, and that over 50 percent report experiencing some form of unwanted sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = C. | last2 = Kanin | first2 = E.

===White House Initiative "It's On Us"===

With the increase of attention on college sexual misconduct, the White House presented on September 19, 2014 the launch of the "It's On Us" Campaign. President [[Barack Obama]] and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] introduced the campaign by describing the importance of ending sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/19/president-obama-launches-its-us-campaign-end-sexual-assault-campus|title=President Obama Launches the "It's On Us" Campaign to End Sexual Assault on Campus|work=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "It's On Us" Campaign is leading a pledge to "not be a bystander to the problem [of sexual assault], but to be a part of the solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsonus.org/|title=Its On Us|work=Its On Us|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign emphasizes the idea that everyone is responsible for taking a stand in ending sexual violence.

The ARC3 Survey was developed in response to the White House initiative in hopes to better evaluate data about sexual misconduct on college campuses.

The ARC3 survey was also created in order to ensure that there was no profit motive behind the campus surveys, many of which have been very expensive for colleges to purchase and implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bustle.com/articles/109133-jennifer-freyd-and-the-administrator-researcher-campus-climate-consortium-are-helping-schools-reduce-rape-for-free|title = Jennifer Freyd and The Administrator Researcher Campus Climate Consortium Are Helping Schools Reduce Rape For Free, Because Nobody Should Have To Pay For Prevention|last = Weiss|first = Suzannah|date = 8 September 2015|work = Bustle|access-date = 28 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Freyd]], a researcher at the [[University of Oregon]], has been instrumental in spear-heading the ARC3 survey initiative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Collaborators==

This survey is the result of ongoing efforts by student and legal affairs professionals, campus advocates, students, campus law enforcement, and sexual assault and harassment researchers, groups of whom met in Atlanta, Georgia in October 2014 for the Georgia State University Forum on Campus Sexual Assault and in February 2015 in Madison, Wisconsin for the Madison Summit on Campus Climate and Sexual Misconduct. The collaborators who collectively designed the survey and their titles and institutions are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/scientists/ARC3info.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guiding principles==

According to the ARC3 Survey website hosted by [[Georgia State University]] the ARC3 Survey was created with the following principles in mind:&lt;ref name="arc3site"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
*'''Inclusiveness, mutual respect, and collaboration'''
** Where the voices of researchers, college and university administrators, and students will all be heard.
*'''Engaging in an iterative and transparent drafting process'''
**The authors invite and encourage peer review and revision of the survey.
**Administrators should give support, feedback and consultation to researchers so that the survey will be as useful and relevant as possible.
**Scientists in turn should consider the feedback in developing a survey that meets institutional needs.
*'''Ensuring independence and integrity in research'''
**Guided by the ethics of science and recognizing and taking steps to remove the influence of bias.
**A commitment to use of the best scientific evidence as the foundation of the survey.
**There is a scientific knowledge base and a transparent scientific process must guide this work if the research is to have integrity and accuracy.
**Peer reviewed studies are the basis for determining survey content.
*'''Equal focus on surveying victimization and perpetration'''
**Meaningful prevention rests on identifying the reasons sexual misconduct is perpetrated and the environments that foster it. Data that are focused on both victimization and perpetration creates a scientific foundation for administrative work.
*'''The adoption of a civil rights approach grounded in Title IX'''
**Our work focuses on the range of acts that constitute student on student incidents an institution must respond to and process under guidelines of Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, the Clery Law and other applicable local, state, and federal law and guidelines.
*'''Framing our efforts with the principles of The Belmont Report'''
**Respect for persons: Ensure that students are informed and participate voluntarily.
**Beneficence: Participation in a campus climate survey is an educational opportunity and an intervention.
*'''Justice'''
**As stated in the Belmont report, address “Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens?”
*'''A sensitivity to the unique issues faced by various diverse populations and higher education institutional types'''
**Addressing the intersectionality of identities and the multiple contextual factors affecting risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Survey components==

The ARC3 Survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and has a module-based structure which makes it flexible to campus needs and legislative mandates moving forward, while maintaining validity of measurement.&lt;ref name="arc3site"/&gt; The following is a list of module topics obtained from the ARC3 Website:

Dr. '''Abdul Azis Saleh''', a specialist in [[anthropology]] and education, was a leader of [[Indonesian Scouting]] and served as a member of the [[World Scout Committee]] and President of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] [[Asia-Pacific Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)|Asia-Pacific Region]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ensiklopediapramuka.com/2012/08/azis-saleh-dr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He became involved in the creation of the [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]] in 1961 and was a member of the "Group of 5" mandated by President [[Sukarno]], who took the opportunity of the absence of the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Minister of Education]] to build a non-[[Fadjar Harapan|communist youth]] association.&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;Hindley, Donald.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, he became Gerakan Pramuka Secretary General.

In 1978, he was awarded the 129th ''[[Bronze Wolf]]'', the only distinction of the WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scout.org/BronzeWolfAward/list complete list&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also successively [[Ministry of Health (Indonesia)|Minister of Health]] (1957–1959), [[Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesia)|Minister of Agriculture]] and then [[Ministry of Industry (Indonesia)|Minister of Industry]] in Indonesia.

{{Paranormal}}
The terms '''alien abduction ''' or '''abduction phenomenon''' describe "subjectively real memories of being taken secretly against one's will by apparently [[Alien abduction entities|nonhuman entities]] and subjected to complex physical and psychological procedures".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Appelle|Appelle, Stuart]]. "The Abduction Experience: A Critical Evaluation of Theory and Evidence". ''Journal of UFO Studies'', n.s. 6, 1995/96, pp. 29–78&lt;/ref&gt; People claiming to have been abducted are usually called "abductees"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alien+abduction|title=Alien abduction – Define Alien abduction at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "experiencers". Typical claims involve being subjected to forced [[medical]] examinations that emphasize abductee [[reproductive systems]].&lt;ref name="medicaldiff"&gt;Miller, John G. "Medical Procedural Differences: Alien Versus Human." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 59–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; 

Due to a lack of [[objectivity (science)|objective]] physical [[evidence]], most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as "deception, [[suggestibility]] (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, [[false memory syndrome]]), personality, [[sleep paralysis]], [[psychopathology]], [[psychodynamics]] [and] environmental factors".&lt;ref name="Appelle, 1996"&gt;Appelle, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between the aliens depicted in [[science fiction film]]s, in particular, ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders From Mars]]'' (1953), and some of those reported to have actually abducted people.&lt;ref name="skepticalperspective" /&gt;

The first alleged alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|title=Testament for Believers|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828455,00.html|quote=On the night of Sept. 19, 1961, Barney Hill and his wife Betty were driving home to Portsmouth, N.H., after a holiday in Montreal. A brilliant waxing moon sailed through a cloudless and star-fretted sky. As the Hills watched, first idly and then in terrified astonishment, one of the stars detached itself Tom [sic] the firmament and came down to earth—so near that the Hills could see it was no star.|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 18, 1966|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in [[English-speaking world|English speaking]] countries, especially the [[United States]]. The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.&lt;ref name="skepticalperspective"&gt;Sheaffer, Robert.

Mainstream scientists reject claims that the phenomenon literally occurs as reported. However, there is little doubt that many apparently stable persons who report alien abductions believe their experiences were real. As reported in the ''[[Harvard University Gazette]]'' in 1992, Dr. [[John E. Mack]] reports that of the 60 cases of claimed abductees he had worked on, that after a battery  of psychological  tests, "no  psychiatric  or  psychosocial explanation for these reports is evident. These people are not mentally ill. He has spent countless therapeutic hours with these individuals only to find that what struck him was the 'ordinariness' of the population, including a restaurant owner, several secretaries, a prison guard, college students, a university administrator, and several homemakers … 'The majority of abductees do not appear to be [[delusion|deluded]], [[confabulation|confabulating]], lying, self-dramatizing, or suffering from a clear [[mental illness]],' he maintained."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfiles.com/ufo/UFOBBS/2000/2726.ufo Lord, Deane W. "John Mack on Abductions" (''Harvard University Gazette'', 1992) URL accessed Jan 23, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; "While psychopathology is indicated in some isolated alien abduction cases," [[Stuart Appelle]] et al. confirmed, "assessment by both clinical examination and standardized tests has shown that, as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence."&lt;ref name="varietiesofanomalous"&gt;Appelle, S., et al. Alien abduction experiences. In Cardeña, E., Lynn. S. J., &amp; Krippner, S. (Eds.) (2000). ''Varieties of Anomalous Experience''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. P. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts who have argued that abductees' mental health is no better or worse than average include psychologists John Wilson and [[Rima Laibow]], and psychotherapist David Gotlib.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anomalist.com/features/darkside.html Huyghe, Patrick, "The Dark Side"] URL accessed Jan 23, 2006(1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some abduction reports are quite detailed. An entire [[subculture]] has developed around the subject, with [[support group]]s and a detailed [[Mythology|mythos]] explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens ([[Grey alien|Greys]], [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilians]], "[[Nordic aliens|Nordics]]" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] or governmental interest in [[cover-up]]. Mack has cited more mundane reasons for the lack of general awareness concerning the data: "The most intense demand for alternative explanations tends to come from those who are either unfamiliar with the rich complexity of the abduction phenomenon, or from those who are so wedded to a worldview" that they find the phenomenon ''prima facie'' unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Mack431"&gt;Mack, 1995. p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of alien abduction claims}}

=== Paleo-abductions ===
While "alien abduction" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, there were many similar stories circulating decades earlier. These early abduction-like accounts have been dubbed "paleo-abductions" by UFO researcher [[Jerome Clark]].&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://ufoupdateslist.com/2004/mar/m19-002.shtml|title=UFOs And Fairies/Legends/Supernatural – Pt. II|accessdate=2010-03-27|last=Colvin|first=T}}
* {{cite web|url=http://ufoupdateslist.com/2004/mar/m19-001.shtml|title=UFOs And Fairies/Legends/Supernatural – Pt. I|last=Colvin|first=T|accessdate=2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the November 27, 1896 edition of the [[Stockton, California]] ''Daily Mail'', Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by three tall, slender humanoids whose bodies were covered with a fine, downy hair who tried to kidnap the pair.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;
* In the October 1953 issue of ''Man to Man Magazine'' an article by Leroy Thorpe titled "Are the Flying Saucers Kidnapping Humans?" asks the question "Are an unlucky few of us, and perhaps not so few at that, being captured with the same ease as we would net butterflies, perhaps for zoological specimens, perhaps for vivisection or some other horrible death designed to reveal to our interplanetary invaders what makes us tick?" &lt;ref&gt;Gross, Loren E.

* Rogerson writes that the 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins's ''Flying Saucers Uncensored'' declared that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed they were contacted by aliens, had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; Wilkins reported speculation that the duo were the victims of "alleged abduction by flying saucers".&lt;ref name="www magonia demon co uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |title=magonia.demon.co.uk |accessdate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427053131/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |archivedate=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two landmark cases ===
An early alien abduction claim occurred in the mid-1950s with the [[Antonio Vilas Boas]] case, which did not receive much attention until several years later.

Widespread publicity was generated by the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]] case of 1961, culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Estelle Parsons]]) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.

Though these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson&lt;ref name="WWW Patagonia demon co uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |author=Peter Rogerson |date=June 1993 |title=Fairyland's Hunters – Part One |access-date=2007-08-10 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427053131/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |archivedate=April 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes they were only the first {{clarify|text="canonical"|date=August 2015}} abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that "the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe." (The phrase "entirely predisposed" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard' study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)

=== Later developments ===
R. Leo Sprinkle, a [[University of Wyoming]] psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. For some years, he was probably the only academic figure devoting any time to studying or researching abduction accounts.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and [[cattle mutilation]]. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, 145fn&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Budd Hopkins]] had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using [[hypnosis]] to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.&lt;ref name="Schnabel"&gt;Schnabel 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist [[Whitley Strieber]], historian [[David M. Jacobs]] and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a genuine phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt; Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.

With Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of [[ufology]]. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.&lt;ref name="Schnabel" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human–alien [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], the most advanced stage of which in the "human hybridization program" are known as hubrids&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2015), p. 31. [entire chapter 2 "Abductees, Aliens, and the Program" (pp. 15-46, especially Table 2, is helpful).&lt;/ref&gt;, though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of [[false pregnancy|phantom pregnancy]] related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.

The descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher's emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized – though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better.

The involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a [[sea change (transformation)|sea change]] in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.

==== John E. Mack ====
Matheson writes that "if Jacobs's credentials were impressive," then those of [[Harvard]] psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] might seem "impeccable" in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his biography of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.

Mack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, John. E. Abduction Humans Encounters with Aliens (Revised Edition). (1995). New York: Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-39300-7}}. "Third, neurophysiological explanations do not account for hyperarousal and anxiety triggered by [events] linked to abduction. With the integration of the [traumatic experience] these reactions sometimes resolve, as predicted by theories of post traumatic stress disorder." p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred – the position Mack came to endorse.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1995. After many hundreds of hours of work" with abductees, "I have no basis for concluding as yet that anything other than what experiencers say happened to them actually did." p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992, Mack and the physicist [[David E. Pritchard]] organized a five-day conference at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon.&lt;ref name="www_cufos_org7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |title=cufos.org |accessdate=2007-08-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717124137/http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |archivedate=17 July 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives. 

Writer [[C. D. B. Bryan]] attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for [[The New Yorker]]. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.

== Abductees ==
{{Main|Alien abduction claimants}}

The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested [[Statistical survey|surveys]] argued that 5–6 percent of the general population might have been abducted.&lt;ref name="Appelle, 1996" /&gt;

=== Demographics ===
In a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, [[Jenny Randles]] found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for "what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason."&lt;ref name="whyaretheydoingthis"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Randles|first=J|authorlink=Jenny Randles|title=Why are They Doing This?|author2=Pritchard A|author3= Pritchard DE|author4= Mack JE|author5= Kasey P|author6= Yapp C|booktitle=Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference|location=Cambridge|publisher=North Cambridge Press|date=1994|pages=69–70|isbn=0-9644917-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randles concludes "[T]he abduction is essentially a young person's experience."&lt;ref name="whyaretheydoingthis" /&gt; Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy.&lt;ref name="patternormirage" /&gt; It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have "hormonic" or reproductive activity going on.

Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences.&lt;ref name="experiencesofchildren"&gt;Truncale, Deborah Bruce. "Alien/UFO Experiences of Children." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 116–126.&lt;/ref&gt; These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences.&lt;ref name="experiencesofchildren" /&gt; Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences.&lt;ref name="experiencesofchildren" /&gt; Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.&lt;ref name="experiencesofchildren" /&gt;

=== Mental health ===
As a category, some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that "as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence".&lt;ref name="skepticalperspective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="varietiesofanomalous" /&gt; Dr. Elizabeth Slater conducted a [[blind study]] of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to "mildly paranoid thinking," nightmares and having a weak sexual identity,&lt;ref name="skepticalperspective" /&gt; while Dr. Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that "none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNally|first=R|title=Psychophysiological Responding During Script-Driven Imagery in People Reporting Abduction by Space Aliens|journal=Psychological Science|date=2003|volume=15|issue=7|pages=493–497|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00707.x|display-authors=etal|pmid=15200635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paranormal ===
Alleged abductees are seen by many pro-abduction researchers to have a higher incidence of non-abduction related paranormal events and abilities.&lt;ref name="paranormalconnection" /&gt; Following an abduction experience, these paranormal abilities and occurrences sometimes seem to become more pronounced.&lt;ref name="paranormalconnection"&gt;Basterfield, Keith. "Abductions: The Paranormal Connection." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to investigator Benton Jamison, abduction experiencers who report UFO sightings that should have been, but are not, reported by independent corroborating witnesses often seem to "be 'psychic personalities' in the sense of Jan Ehrenwald."&lt;ref name="paranormalconnection" /&gt; Psychic Medium [[Danielle Egnew]] recounted multiple abduction experiences in her 2012 book ''True Tales of the Truly Weird'', greatly detailing communication, technology and abduction methods of more than one alien race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1478181109|accessdate=2013-01-16|title=''True Tales of the Truly Weird''}} Egnew, Danielle M., Call To Light Press, 2012. Pp. 80–120&lt;/ref&gt;

== The abduction narrative ==
{{Main|Narrative of the abduction phenomenon}}

Although different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard&lt;ref&gt;his essay is reprinted in [[Jerome Clark|Clark]] 1998&lt;/ref&gt; argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical "[[close encounter]] of the fourth kind" (a popular but unofficial designation building on Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]]'s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.

Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:

# '''Capture'''. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft.
# '''Examination and Procedures'''. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.
# '''Conference'''. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee's native language.
# '''Tour'''. The abductees are given a tour of their captors' vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship.
# '''Loss of Time'''. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both.
# '''Return'''. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.
# '''[[Theophany]]'''. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a "high" similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a "mystical experience", accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, [[Stockholm syndrome]], or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time.
# '''Aftermath'''. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.

When describing the "abduction scenario", David M. Jacobs says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Capture ===
Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience.&lt;ref name="composite"&gt;Nyman, Joe. "A Composite Encounter Model." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings manifest as a [[compulsive]] desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something "familiar yet unknown," will soon occur.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected [[anxiety]] at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt;

Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent "shift" into an altered state of consciousness.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness "the Oz Factor." External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; They report feeling introspective and unusually calm.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of "[[Paralysis|limited self-willed mobility]]."&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors' [[UFO]]), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt;

As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt; Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.&lt;ref name="composite" /&gt;

=== Examination ===
The examination phase of the so-called "abduction narrative" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently [[Abduction phenomenon#Abductors|alien beings]] against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on [[sex]] and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved, and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="varietyofabductionbeings"&gt;Bullard, Thomas E. "The Variety of Abduction Beings." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; This could result from a difference in the purpose of the examination—routine diagnosis and/or treatment versus scientific examination of an unfamiliar species, or it could be due to a different level of technology that renders certain kinds of manual procedures unnecessary. The abductors' areas of interest appear to be the [[Human cranium|cranium]], [[nervous system]], [[human skin|skin]], [[reproductive system]], and to a lesser degree, the [[joint]]s.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include [[cardiovascular system]], the [[respiratory system]] below the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] and the [[lymphatic system]].&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the [[abdomen]] in favor of the lower one.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the "examination."&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; Injections also seem to be rare and [[Intravenous therapy|IVs]] are almost completely absent.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; Dr. Miller says he's never heard an abductee claim to have a [[tongue depressor]] used on them.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt;

=== Subsequent abduction procedures ===
After the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities.&lt;ref name="subsequent"&gt;Jacobs, David M. "Subsequent Procedures." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 64-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt;

"Imaging" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; "Envisioning" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer's mind.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; "Staging" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt;

"Testing" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt;

==== Child presentation ====
Abductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a "child presentation."&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a "child."&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same [[species]] as the abductors.&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of ''both'' [[species]].&lt;ref name="subsequent" /&gt; These children are labeled by experiencers as [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between humans and their abductors, usually [[Grey alien|Greys]].

Unlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports.&lt;ref name="patternormirage"&gt;Bullard, Thomas E. "The Well-Ordered Abduction: Pattern or Mirage?" In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullard says that the child presentation "seems to be an innovation in the story"&lt;ref name="patternormirage" /&gt; and that "no clear antecedents" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exists before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.&lt;ref name="patternormirage" /&gt;

=== Less common elements ===
Bullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes"&gt;Bullard, Thomas E. "The Rarer Abduction Episodes." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt;

# The conference
# The tour
# The journey
# Theophany

Chronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt;

After allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; The entities then hold a '''conference''' with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference "phase" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt;

'''Tours''' of the abductors' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; Sometimes the abductee report traveling on a "'''journey'''" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets.&lt;ref name="rarerepisodes" /&gt; Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.

=== Return ===
Eventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken.&lt;ref name="thereturn"&gt;Hopkins, Budd. "The Abduction Experience: Return." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced "missing time" upon checking a timepiece.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt;

Sometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt; Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about "the cosmic application of [[Murphy's Law]]" in response to this observation.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt; Hopkins has estimated that these "errors" accompany 4–5 percent of abduction reports.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt; One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt; This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside.&lt;ref name="thereturn" /&gt; Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee's clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.

=== Realization event ===
Physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon.&lt;ref name="realizationevent"&gt;Miller, John G. "The Realization Event -An Important Historical Feature." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt; He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the "realization event."&lt;ref name="realizationevent" /&gt; The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode.&lt;ref name="realizationevent" /&gt; Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the "[[clinical horizon]]" of the abduction experience.&lt;ref name="realizationevent" /&gt;

== Trauma and recovery ==
Most people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barbeito|first=PF|title="He's Making Me Feel Things in My Body That I Don't Feel": The Body as Battleground in Accounts of Alien Abduction| journal=Journal of American Culture|date=2005|volume=28|issue=2|pages=201–15|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00164.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some ascribe [[psychological trauma]] to their experiences.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0107/needforhealing.html|title=Alien Abduction: The Need for Healing|last=Nielsen|first=R|date=2007-01-23|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=UFO Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Post abduction syndrome" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations.&lt;ref name=Nielsen /&gt; People who have a [[false memory]] which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. People who believe they have been abducted by aliens usually have previous [[New Age]] beliefs, a vivid fantasy life, and suffer from [[sleep paralysis]], according to a 2003 study by [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaoni|first1=Bhattacharya|title=Memories of alien 'abduction' cause physical effects|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3395-memories-of-alien-abduction-cause-physical-effects.html|website=NewScientist|accessdate=24 June 2015|location=Denver, Colorado|date=17 February 2003|quote=People who believe they have been abducted by aliens show some of the physiological changes associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), US researchers have found. … Their findings show that the physical intensity of a recovered belief does not depend on whether the trauma was real or not. Intensity cannot therefore not be used to judge whether a memory was true.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support groups ===
Support groups for people who believed they were abducted began appearing in the mid-1980s. These groups appear throughout the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bader|first=CD|title=Supernatural Support Groups: Who Are the UFO Abductees and Ritual-Abuse Survivors?|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=2003|volume=42|issue=4|pages=2–14|doi=10.1046/j.1468-5906.2003.00210.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of hypnosis ==
Many alien abductees recall much of their abduction(s) through [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linse|first=P|author2=Loxton D|title=Alien Abduction Part 2|journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]|date=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=81–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the extensive use of hypnosis and other manipulative methods, skeptics explain the abduction narratives as [[Confabulation|false memories]] and suggestions.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirsch |first=II |author2=Lynn SJ |title=Alleged Alien Abductions: False Memories, Hypnosis and Fantasy Proneness |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=151–5 |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=77026115 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0702_8 |date=1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921175235/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=77026115 |archivedate=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argument against the use of hypnosis ===
Alleged abductees seek out hypnotherapists to try to resolve issues such as [[Dissociative amnesia|missing time]] or unexplained physical symptoms such as [[myalgia|muscle pain]] or headaches. This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction "memories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spanos NP|authorlink=Nicholas Spanos|title=Multiple Identities &amp; False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|date=1996|pages= 122–3|isbn=1-55798-340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:&lt;ref name=Kirsch /&gt;
# A person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction.
# The person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports.
# Alternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative.
# Alternative explanations of the experiences are not explored.
# There is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction.
# The therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee's experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement.
# The client adopts the role of the "victim" or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client's view of self.

=== Argument for the use of hypnosis ===
Harvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] counters this argument, noting "It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word ''hypnosis'' at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The UFO Abduction Phenomenon | url = http://johnemackinstitute.org/1992/06/the-ufo-abduction-phenomenon-what-does-it-mean-for-the-transformation-of-human-consciousness/ | accessdate = 2013-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives ==
{{main|Perspectives on the abduction phenomenon}}

There have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between.

Some have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.

Others are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] concluded, "The furthest you can go at this point is to say ''there's an authentic mystery here.'' And that is, I think, as far as anyone ''ought'' to go." (emphasis as in original)&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to "take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences," up to and including "missing time," directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.&lt;ref name="Mack431" /&gt;

Putting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively "real", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction "are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness." After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading [[ghost story|ghost stories]] or watching [[Horror film|horror movies]], Matheson notes that people "can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors."&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Matheson writes that when compared to the earlier [[contactee]] reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their "relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public."

Seraphim Rose|title=Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STIsAQAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood|isbn=978-1-887904-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the phenomena of UFOs and abductions, which, he concludes, are manifestations of the demonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/alien_abduct.aspx|title=Alien Abductions and the Orthodox Christian|author=Archbishop Chrysostomos of Etna|work=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testimonials ==
Abduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} praying mantis-like entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting.&lt;ref name="varietyofabductionbeings" /&gt; This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the [[insectoid]]-type entity reported in some abduction accounts.&lt;ref name="varietyofabductionbeings" /&gt; He related this report to fellow researcher [[Leonard Stringfield]].&lt;ref name="varietyofabductionbeings" /&gt; Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.&lt;ref name="varietyofabductionbeings" /&gt;

While some corroborated accounts seem to support the literal reality of the abduction experience, others seem to support a psychological explanation for the phenomenon's origins. Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer "didn't physically go anywhere."&lt;ref name="panelonculture"&gt;Hall, Dick &amp; Randles, Jenny &amp; Basterfield, Keith &amp; Moura, Gilda. "Panel on Cross Cultural Patterns in Abductions." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 193–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian researcher Gilda Moura reported on a similar case, the Sueli case, from her home country. When psychologist and UFO researcher Don Donderi said that these cases were "evidence of psychological processes" that did not "have anything to do with a physical alien abduction," Moura replied "If the Sueli case is not an abduction, I don't know what is an abduction any more."&lt;ref name="panelonculture" /&gt; Gilda Moura noted that in the Brazilian Sueli case during the abduction UFOs were observed.&lt;ref name="panelonculture" /&gt; Later, she claims the experiencer had eye burns, saw lights and there seemed to be residual poltergeist activity.&lt;ref name="panelonculture" /&gt;

=== Attempts at confirmation ===
{{further|Alien implants}}

It has been argued that if actual "flesh and blood" aliens are abducting humans, there should be some hard evidence that this is occurring.&lt;ref name="skepticalperspective" /&gt; Proponents of the physical reality of the abduction experience have suggested ways that could conceivably confirm abduction reports.

One procedure reported occurring during the alleged [[Abduction phenomenon#exam|exam]] phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman's navel.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; Some have speculated that this could be a form of [[laparoscopy]].&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; If this is true, after the abduction there should be free [[gas]] in the female's abdomen, which could be seen on an x-ray.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt; The presence of free gas would be extremely abnormal, and would help substantiate the claim of some sort of procedure being done to her.&lt;ref name="medicaldiff" /&gt;

The '''Business Continuity Institute (BCI)''' was established in 1994 to enable individual members to obtain guidance and support from fellow [[business continuity]] practitioners.

The BCI has around 8,000 members in more than 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebci.org/index.php/about/generalinfo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 David Thorp replaced Lorraine Darke as Executive Director after she spent 12 years in the role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/business-continuity-news/1326-bci-appoints-new-executive-director&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles-Eugène Delaunay''' (9 April 1816 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1872) was a French [[astronomer]] and mathematician. His [[lunar theory|lunar motion]] studies were important in advancing both the theory of [[planet]]ary motion and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: M. Charles E. Delaunay|journal=MNRAS|date=February 1873|volume=33|pages=203–209|bibcode=1873MNRAS..33..190.|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065215124;view=1up;seq=227|doi = 10.1093/mnras/33.4.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Lusigny-sur-Barse]], France, to Jacques‐Hubert Delaunay and Catherine Choiselat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58351.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaunay studied under [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He worked on the mechanics of the [[Moon]] as a special case of the [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|three-body problem]]. He published two volumes on the topic, each of 900 pages in length, in 1860 and 1867. The work hints at chaos in the system, and clearly demonstrates the problem of so-called "small denominators" in perturbation theory.  His [[perturbation theory|infinite series]] expression for finding the position of the Moon converged too slowly to be of practical use but was a catalyst in the development of [[functional analysis]]&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;O'Connor &amp; Edmund&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computer algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Pavelle, M. Rothstein and J. Fitch, "Computer Algebra", ''Scientific American'', '''245''' (6), pp.102-113  (December 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaunay became director of the [[Paris Observatory]] in 1870 but drowned in a boating accident near [[Cherbourg]], France two years later.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

The '''Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences''' ('''CSHALS''') was a scientific meeting on the practical applications of [[semantic technology]] to pharmaceutical R&amp;D, healthcare, and life sciences. The conference was held annually from 2008 to 2014, and was the premier meeting in this domain. In 2015, it as organised as a special interests group (SIG) meeting of the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] conference.&lt;ref name="cshals-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 by cshals|url=https://cshals.github.io/2015/#section|website=cshals.github.io|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference topics included a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] tutorial on [[semantic web]] standards.&lt;ref name="w3c-tutorial"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSHALS Tutorial {{!}} Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences (HCLS) Interest Group|url=https://www.w3.org/blog/hcls/2010/02/02/cshals_tutorial/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, CSHALS took on the additional topic of the application of [[Big data|Big Data]] to healthcare and life sciences, while maintaining its previous focus on semantic technologies.

'''DNA Doe Project''' (AKA '''DNA Doe Project, Inc.''' or '''DDP''') is a non-profit organization of volunteers who use genetic genealogy to identify unidentified victims of: auto accidents, homicide, unusual circumstances, and people who committed suicide under an alias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/crime--law/how-they-did-groundbreaking-technology-reveals-year-old-cold-case/wdliYt0agtdpFF4w6U1MiP/|title=How they did it: Groundbreaking technology reveals ID in 37-year-old cold case|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
DNA Doe Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in [[Sebastopol, California]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonomawest.com/sonoma_west_times_and_news/news/finding-jane-doe-s-real-name-local-dna-sleuth-is/article_e52d0d0a-730f-11e8-a089-b3915b91cd9e.html|title=Finding Jane Doe's real name: Local DNA sleuth is on the case|first=E.I. Hillin, Staff Writer,|last=e.hillin@sonomawest.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2017 by Colleen Fitzpatrick and Margaret Press. The two, along with many volunteers, use genealogy in conjunction with DNA from unidentified victims to build family trees through [[GEDmatch]], a free public DNA database. After reading a [[Sue Grafton]] novel about a Jane Doe, Margaret planned to use family trees to identify unidentified homicide victims. By March 2018 DNA Doe Project solved its first case.

Colleen is the founder of IdentiFinders, an organization which uses Y-chromosomal testing to attempt to identify male killers in unsolved homicides.&lt;ref name="buzzfeednews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/dna-cold-case-crime-doe-project-genealogy|title=Nobody Was Going To Solve These Cold Cases. Then Came The DNA Crime Solvers.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IdentiFinders is also responsible for solving the identity of the unknown child on the Titanic. Previously she worked as a nuclear physics PhD with NASA and the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="buzzfeednews.com"/&gt; Margaret is a novelist with previous careers in: computer programming, speech, and language consulting.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She retired from computer programming in 2015 and relocated from [[Salem, Massachusetts]] to [[Sebastopol, California]] to live near family.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As a hobby, Press began pursuing genealogy in 2007; helping friends and acquaintances find their loved ones as well as helping adoptees find their biological parents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Cases==
===Solved Cases===
====Robert Ivan Nichols, AKA Joseph Newton Chandler III====

{{main|Joseph Newton Chandler III}}

Joseph Newton Chandler III, a resident of [[Eastlake, Ohio]], committed suicide in his apartment on 24 July 2002. As authorities sought to identify his heirs, they discovered that his name and identity were fake. The real Joseph Newton Chandler III had died in a [[Sherman, Texas]] car accident at age eight on 21 December 1945. The suicide victim had stolen the boy’s identity in 1978, while living in South Dakota. Authorities began a search for the man’s real name.&lt;ref name="Augenstein Chandler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Augenstein |first1=Seth |title=DNA Doe Project Names Another, Giving Major Piece in Infamous Ohio Mystery |url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2018/06/dna-doe-project-names-another-giving-major-piece-infamous-ohio-mystery |website=Forensic Magazine |publisher=Forensic Magazine |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger Chandler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Metzger |first1=Stephanie |title=How did authorities solve the true identity of Joseph Newton Chandler III? |url=https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/how-did-authorities-solve-the-true-identity-of-joseph-newton-chandler-iii/95-566345556 |website=wkyc3 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caniglia Chandler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caniglia |first1=John |title=Authorities solve cold case of war hero who hid behind dead boy's identity |url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/06/authorities_solve_cold_case_of.html |website=Cleveland.com |publisher=cleveland.com |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grzegorek Chandler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grzegorek |first1=Vince |title=Mystery of Identity of Ohio Man Who Hid Behind Fake Name for Years Solved, Mystery of Why Remains |url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2018/06/21/mystery-of-identity-of-ohio-man-who-hid-behind-fake-name-for-years-solved-mystery-of-why-remains |website=clevescene.com |publisher=Clevescene.com |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Chandler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pepi |first1=Kirk |title=The Man Who Woke Up As An 8-Year-Old Boy |url=https://melmagazine.com/the-man-who-woke-up-as-an-8-year-old-boy-30b175346a97 |publisher=Mel Magazine |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracting DNA proved difficult, as the suicide victim’s remains had been cremated. In the year 2000, however, two years before his death, the victim had had a tissue sample taken for a medical treatment. Authorities obtained this sample, but genetic analysis of the sample using traditional law enforcement techniques yielded few clues. In 2016, authorities reached out to IdentiFinders, a company run by Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick, for help. In examining the man’s [[Y-DNA]] signature, they determined that his true last name was likely “Nicholas” or some variation.&lt;ref name="Augenstein Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caniglia Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grzegorek Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Chandler"/&gt;

Later, in 2017, Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Press formed the volunteer-based, nonprofit DNA Doe Project (DDP), and Chandler became its first case. A small group of volunteers at DDP analyzed the highly degraded sample of the man’s DNA, which had been stored in paraffin for about 15 years. Despite the obstacles, these researchers were able to conclusively determine that Joseph Newton Chandler III, who had committed suicide in 2002, was actually Robert Ivan Nichols, son of Silas and Alpha Nichols of [[New Albany, Indiana]]. This identification was verified when Robert’s son, Phillip Nichols, volunteered a DNA sample, which proved to be a match.&lt;ref name="Augenstein Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caniglia Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grzegorek Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Chandler"/&gt;

====Marcia Lenore ''Sossoman'' King, AKA "Buckskin Girl"====

{{main|Murder of Marcia King}}

In 1981, Police found a murder victim in a ditch in [[Troy, Ohio]]. Because the victim, a female, was found wearing a distinctive buckskin coat, she was given the name “Buckskin Girl” as the case continued. For decades, authorities sought the woman’s identity, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="Augenstein King"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Augenstein |first1=Seth |title='Buckskin Girl' Case Break Is Success of New DNA Doe Project |url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2018/04/buck-skin-girl-case-break-success-new-dna-doe-project |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=Forensic Magazine |date=16 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS King"&gt;{{cite news |title="Buckskin Girl" case: DNA breakthrough leads to ID of 1981 murder victim |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buckskin-girl-case-groundbreaking-dna-tech-leads-to-id-of-1981-murder-victim/ |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=CBS News |date=12 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences conference, Elizabeth Murray, an Ohio forensic anthropologist, met the founders of the DNA Doe Project and discussed what genetic genealogy techniques could do for the case. The victim’s body had long since been buried, but a vial of blood had been held in a lab for 37 years. The vial had not been refrigerated, however, leaving the DNA highly degraded, with only 50%-75% of markers remaining. With the help of Greg Magoon, a senior researcher at Aerodyne Research, they were able to upload this DNA data to GEDmatch, a site which provided a variety of tools for genetic genealogy analysis.&lt;ref name="Augenstein King"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS King"/&gt;

From here, the DNA Doe Project was able to identify the Buckskin Girl thanks to a very close DNA match (a first cousin once removed). Her real name was Marcia Lenore ''Sossoman'' King from Arkansas, age 21 at the time of her death. From here, DNA Doe Project volunteers provided law enforcement with the name of a close relative of King’s who lived in Florida. This relative volunteered a DNA sample to verify King’s identity. This sample proved to be a match. After 37 years, her mother was still living and had refused to move or change her phone number in hopes that her daughter might return.&lt;ref name="Augenstein King"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS King"/&gt;

====Lyle Stevik====

{{main|Lyle Stevik}}

In September 2001, a man was found to have hanged himself in a motel in [[Amanda Park, Washington]]. The man had checked in as “Lyle Stevik,” the name of a character in a [[Joyce Carol Oates]] novel. The Gray Harbor County Sheriff’s Office spent countless hours in search of the man’s true identity, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="Murphy Stevik"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Neil |title=Internet sleuths finally solve riddle of mystery man ‘Lyle Stevik’ whose suicide ignited numerous conspiracy theories during 9/11 aftermath |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/internet-sleuths-finally-solve-riddle-12559933 |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=Mirror |date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Stevik"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pepi |first1=Kirk |title=One of the Internet’s Favorite Mysteries Has Been Solved |url=https://melmagazine.com/one-of-the-internets-favorite-mysteries-has-been-solved-1658915a7cc2 |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=Mel Magazine |date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kxro stevik"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lyle Stevik Identified; Closing 16 1/2 Year Old Unsolved Case |url=https://www.kxro.com/lyle-stevik-identified-closing-16-1-2-year-old-unsolved-case/ |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=KXRO News |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Augenstein Stevik"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Augenstein |first1=Seth |title=DNA Doe Project IDs 2001 Motel Suicide, Using Genealogy |url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2018/05/dna-doe-project-ids-2001-motel-suicide-using-genealogy |accessdate=10 October 2018 |publisher=Forensic Magazine |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018, the DNA Doe Project adopted the case at the request of the Sheriff’s Office. In order to raise the funds required to complete the necessary DNA tests, the DDP set up its first-ever “Doe Fund Me” campaign on his behalf. The campaign was a quick success, as by this time “Lyle” had gained Internet fame among websleuths. Adequate funds were raised within 24 hours. By 22 March 2018, DDP volunteers had obtained his DNA results and began analyzing.&lt;ref name="Murphy Stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kxro stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Augenstein Stevik"/&gt;

After about 20 volunteers poured hundreds of hours into the case, a candidate was found in a 25-year-old young man from California. Authorities reached out to the man’s family, who were able to conclusively verify his identity using fingerprint samples they had from earlier years. The family has requested that Lyle’s true identity not be released.&lt;ref name="Murphy Stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepi Stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kxro stevik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Augenstein Stevik"/&gt;

===Ongoing Cases===
Typically, each case at the DNA Doe Project undergoes the following steps:
# Acceptance of case from law enforcement
# Extraction of DNA sample (sometimes repeated if the first sample proves too degraded for analysis)
# Fundraising for DNA sequencing
# Sequencing of DNA sample
# Bioinformatics "translates" the DNA sequencing into a digital data file that is compatible with GEDmatch
# Uploading DNA data file to GEDmatch
# Genealogical analysis using GEDmatch and other tools
# Tentative identification of the Doe
# Law enforcement verifies identity, typically using fingerprints or a DNA sample provided by an immediate relative

The following is a chart of the DNA Doe Project's ongoing cases, along with an indication of where each case is in the process:

'''Daniil Kharms''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Дании́л Ива́нович Хармс}}; {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1905|17 December}}&amp;nbsp;– 2 February 1942) was an early Soviet-era [[surrealist]] and [[absurdist fiction|absurdist]] poet, writer and dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George|last=Saunders|title=Soviet Deadpan|date=9 December 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/Saunders-t.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
'''Daniil Ivánovich Yuvachev''' or '''Yuvachyov''' (Даниил Иванович Ювачёв) was born in [[St. Petersburg]], into the family of [[Ivan Yuvachev]], a member of the revolutionary group [[The People's Will]]. By the time of his son's birth, the elder Yuvachev had already been imprisoned for his involvement in subversive acts against Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and had become a philosopher.

Daniil invented the pseudonym Kharms while attending [[Saint Peter's School]]. There are some assumptions that this might have been influenced by his fascination with [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]], as the two words (Holmes and Harms) start and end similarly, as well as a number of other theories.&lt;ref name=kobrinski&gt;{{cite book|title=Daniil Kharms|last=Kobrinski|first=Alexander |year=2009|publisher=Molodaya Gvardiya|location=Moscow |isbn=978-5-235-03258-3|series=Great People series|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Saint Peter's, he learned the rudiments of both English and German, and it may have been the English "harm" and "charm" that he incorporated into "Kharms".&lt;ref name="Frazier_May_7_2015"&gt;Frazier, Ian (7 May 2015). "A Strangely Funny Russian Genius". ''The New York Review of Books'' '''62''' (8): 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Kharms used variations on this name and the pseudonyms DanDan, Khorms, Charms, Shardam, and Kharms-Shardam, among others.

In 1924, he entered the  [[Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute|Leningrad Electrotechnicum]], from which he was expelled for "lack of participation in socially conscious activities".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Career==
After his expulsion, he gave himself over entirely to literature. He joined the circle of Aleksandr Tufanov, a sound-poet, and follower of [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s ideas of [[zaum]] (or trans-sense) poetry. He met the young poet [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]] at this time, and the two became close friends and collaborators.

In 1928, his play "Elizaveta Bam" ("Елизавета Бам") premiered; it is said to have [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1927, the Association of Writers of Children's Literature was formed, and Kharms was invited to be a member. From 1928 until 1941, Kharms continually produced children's works, to great success.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1928, Daniil Kharms founded the ''[[avant-garde]]'' [[artist collective|collective]] [[Oberiu]], or Union of Real Art. He embraced the new movements of [[Russian Futurism]] laid out by his idols, [[Velemir Khlebnikov|Khlebnikov]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], and [[Igor Terentiev]], among others. Their ideas served as a springboard. His aesthetic centered around a belief in the autonomy of art from real world rules and logic, and that intrinsic meaning is to be found in objects and words outside of their practical function.

By the late 1920s, his anti-rational verse, nonlinear theatrical performances, and public displays of decadent and illogical behavior earned Kharms&amp;nbsp;– who dressed like an English [[dandy]] with a [[calabash pipe]]&amp;nbsp;– the reputation of a talented and highly eccentric writer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the late 1920s, despite rising criticism of the [[Oberiu|OBERIU]] performances and diatribes against the avant-garde in the press, Kharms sought to unite progressive artists and writers of the time (Malevich, Filonov, Terentiev, [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], Kaverin, [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]) with leading Russian Formalist critics (Tynianov, Shklovsky, Eikhenbaum, Ginzburg, etc.,) and a younger generation of writers (all from the OBERIU crowd—Alexander Vvedensky, [[Konstantin Vaginov]], [[Nikolai Zabolotsky]], [[Igor Bakhterev]]), to form a cohesive cultural movement of ''Left Art''.

Kharms was arrested in 1931 and exiled to [[Kursk]] for most of a year. He was arrested as a member of "a group of anti-Soviet children's writers", and some of his works were used as evidence in the case. Soviet authorities, having become increasingly hostile toward the avant-garde in general, deemed Kharms' writing for children anti-Soviet because of its refusal to instill materialist and social Soviet values.&lt;ref name="Frazier_May_7_2015"/&gt; Kharms continued to write for children's magazines when he returned from exile, though his name would appear in the credits less often. His plans for more performances and plays were curtailed, the OBERIU disbanded, and Kharms receded into a mostly private writing life.

In the 1930s, as the mainstream Soviet literature was becoming more and more conservative under the guidelines of [[Socialist Realism]], Kharms found refuge in [[children's literature]]. (He had worked under [[Samuil Marshak]] at [[Detskaya Literatura|Detgiz]], the state-owned children's publishing house since the mid-1920s, writing new material and translating children's literature from the west, including [[Wilhelm Busch]]'s Max and Moritz).  Many of his poems and short stories for children were published in the ''[[Chizh (magazine)|Chizh]] (Чиж)'', ''[[Yozh]] (Ëж)'', ''Sverchok (Сверчок)'' and ''Oktyabryata (Октябрята)'' magazines.
In 1937 Marshak's publishing house in Leningrad was shut down, some of employees were arrested: Alexandr Vvedensky, Nikolai Oleinikov, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Tamara Gabbe, and later - Kharms; the majority was fired.

==Works==
His "adult" works were not published during his lifetime with the sole exception of two early poems. 
His notebooks were saved from destruction in the war by loyal friends and hidden until the 1960s, when his children's writing became widely published and scholars began the job of recovering his manuscripts and publishing them in the west and in [[samizdat]].

His reputation in the 20th century in Russia was largely based on his popular work for children. His other writings (a vast assortment of stories, miniatures, plays, poems, and pseudo-scientific, philosophical investigations) were virtually unknown until the 1970s, and not published officially in Russia until "[[glasnost]]"

Kharms' stories are typically brief [[vignette (literature)|vignette]]s (see also [[short prose]] and [[feuilleton]]) often only a few paragraphs long, in which scenes of poverty and deprivation alternate with fantastic, dreamlike occurrences and acerbic comedy. Occasionally they incorporate incongruous appearances by famous authors (e.g.: [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] and [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] tripping over each other; Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] showing his chamber pot to the world; Pushkin and his sons falling off their chairs; etc.)

Kharms' world is unpredictable and disordered; characters repeat the same actions many times in succession or otherwise behave irrationally; linear stories start to develop but are interrupted in midstream by inexplicable catastrophes that send them in completely different directions.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

His manuscripts were preserved by his sister and, most notably, by his friend [[Yakov Druskin]], a notable music theorist and amateur theologist and philosopher, who dragged a suitcase full of Kharms's and Vvedensky's writings out of Kharms's apartment during the blockade of Leningrad and kept it hidden throughout difficult times.

Kharms' adult works were picked up by Russian [[samizdat]] starting around the 1960s, and thereby did have an influence on the growing "unofficial" arts scene.

A complete collection of his works was published in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in four volumes, in 1978–1988. In Russia, Kharms' works were widely published only from the late 1980s. Now, several editions of Kharms's collected works and selected volumes have been published in Russia, and collections are available in English, French, German and Italian. In 2004, a selection of his works appeared in Irish.

Numerous English translations have appeared of late in American literary journals. In the 1970s, [[George Gibian]] at [[Cornell]] published the first English collection of OBERIU writing, which included stories and a play by Daniil Kharms and one play by Alexander Vvedensky. Gibian's translations appeared in ''Annex Press'' magazine in 1978. In the early 1990s a slim selected volume translated into British English by [[Neil Cornwell]] came out in England. New translations of all the members of the OBERIU group (and their closely knit group of friends, the Chinari) appeared in 2006 in the USA (''OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism''. It contains poetry, drama and prose by Alexander Vvedensky, Daniil Kharms, [[Nikolai Zabolotsky]], [[Nikolay Oleynikov]], [[Leonid Lipavsky]] and [[Yakov Druskin]], edited by [[Eugene Ostashevsky]] and translated by [[Matvei Yankelevich]], [[Thomas Epstein]], [[Genya Turovskaya]], Eugene Ostashevsky and [[Ilya Bernstein]]), with an introduction by Eugene Ostashevsky (not [[Susan Sontag]], who is listed on some websites as the author of the foreword). An English translation of a collection of his works, by Matvei Yankelevich, ''Today I Wrote Nothing'' was published in 2007. It includes poems, plays, short prose pieces, and his novella "The Old Woman". Another collection in the translation of Alex Cigale, ''Russian Absurd: Daniil Kharms, Selected Writings,'' appeared in the Northwestern World Classics series in 2017. A selection of Kharms's dramatic works, ''A Failed Performance: Short Plays and Scenes'', translated by C Dylan Bassett and Emma Winsor Wood, was released by Plays Inverse in 2018. Individual pieces have also been translated by [[Roman Turovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://polyhymnion.org/lit.html "DANIIL HARMS, Poet/Writer/Dramatist"] The Polyhymnion Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kharms was married twice, to Esther Rusakova (1909 Marseilles, France - 1943 Magadan USSR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d-harms.ru/women/ester-rusakova.html|title=Даниил Хармс :: Женщины в жизни Хармса :: Эстер Русакова|website=www.d-harms.ru|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marina Malich (1909 St. Petersburg, Russia - 2002 USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d-harms.ru/women/marina-malich.html|title=Даниил Хармс :: Женщины в жизни Хармса :: Марина Малич|website=www.d-harms.ru|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wives sometimes appear in some of his lyrical or erotic poems.

23 August 1941 - Kharms was arrested for spreading "libellous and defeatist mood". According to the NKVD report Kharms said:
"The USSR lost the war on its first day. Leningrad will be either besieged or starved to death. Or it will be bombed to the ground, leaving no stone standing. If they give me a mobilization order, I will punch the commander in the face, let them shoot me, but I will not put on the uniform and will not serve in the soviet forces, I do not wish to be such trash. If they force me to fire a machine-gun from rooftops during street-to-street fights with the Germans, I would shoot not at the Germans, but at them, from the very same machine gun".&lt;ref&gt;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хармс,_Даниил_Иванович#Второй_арест_и_гибель&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avoid execution, Kharms simulated insanity; the military tribunal ordered to keep him in the psychiatric ward of the 'Kresty' prison on the severity of the crime. Daniil Kharms died of starvation 2 February 1942 during the siege of Leningrad. His wife was informed that he was deported to [[Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Кобринский А. Даниил Хармс. — М.: Молодая гвардия, 2009. — С. 471—486.&lt;/ref&gt; Only on 25 July 1960, at the request of Kharms' sister, E.I. Gritsina, Prosecutor General's Office found him not guilty and he was exonerated.

*Beginning in the 1970s many of Kharms' children's texts were set to music, and were often played on the radio.
*[[Ted Milton]] staged a performance around Kharms' texts, entitled ''In Kharms Way'' (with laptop musician [[Sam Britton]]).
*The band [[Esthetic Education]] composed its poem ''Juravli I Korabli''. It appeared on their debut album ''[[Face Reading]]'', and on their live album ''[[Live at Ring]]''.
*Composer [[Hafliði Hallgrímsson]] has composed music featuring Daniil Kharms writings translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/album-haflidi-hallgrimsson-mini-stories-signum-classics-1854568.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Album: Haflidi Hallgrimsson, Mini Stories (Signum Classics)|first=Andy|last=Gill|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The American writer [[George Saunders]] has written that he is partly "inspired by a certain absurdist comic tradition," listing Kharms alongside [[Mark Twain]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Monty Python]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Jack Handey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cultivatingthought.com/author/george-saunders/|title=George Saunders - Cultivating Thought|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709200149/http://cultivatingthought.com/author/george-saunders/|archivedate=9 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The work of South African artist [[William Kentridge]] is influenced by Kharms and he draws in particular on the tendency in Kharmian stories for ordinary situations to descend into violence.

&lt;!-- NOTE: Did not receive theatrical release in US. VHS/DVD only --&gt;
'''''Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone''''', originally released theatrically in Japan as simply '''''Dragon Ball Z''''' and later as {{Nihongo|'''''Dragon Ball Z: Return My Gohan!!'''''|ドラゴンボールZ オラの悟飯をかえせッ!!|Doragon Bōru Zetto Ora no Gohan o Kaese!!|lead=yes}} for its Japanese [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] release&lt;!-- The Japanese DVD release uses the original theatrical title. --&gt;, is a 1989 Japanese [[anime]] [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[martial arts film]], the fourth alternate continuity film in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise, and the first one under the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' moniker. It was originally released in Japan on July 15 at the "Toei Manga Matsuri" film festival along with the 1989 film version of ''[[Himitsu no Akko-chan]]'', the first ''[[Akuma-kun]]'' movie, and the film version of ''[[Kidou Keiji Jiban]]''.

Despite some continuity inconsistencies, ''Dead Zone'' acts as a prelude to the series, and is the only film to get a complete follow up during ''Dragon Ball Z'', with the Garlic Jr. arc.

==Plot==
[[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] is attacked and supposedly killed by a group of shadowed fighters. Meanwhile, [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]] along with her father, Ox King, and [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] are attacked by the same group. [[Goku]] is out fishing during the attack and after sensing danger, he returns only to find his son has been kidnapped. The group responsible for the attack are [[Garlic Jr.]]'s henchmen, and it is later revealed that their reason for kidnapping Gohan was to retrieve the four-star Dragon Ball that was attached to his hat. After gathering the remaining Dragon Balls, Garlic Jr. summons [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]] and he immediately wishes for immortality. Shenron, never having had to grant this type of demand before, grants Garlic Jr. his wish. A furious Goku arrives to try to take back his son, but soon discovers Garlic Jr.'s new power. [[Kami (Dragon Ball)|Kami]] makes an appearance (which surprises Garlic Jr., who thought that his henchmen had killed Piccolo) and meets up with Goku, and describes a brief history of Garlic Jr. and his father Garlic. Goku then proceeds to try to find Gohan when he is attacked by the villain's gang, whilst Kami faces Garlic Jr.

After briefly fighting, [[Krillin]] and Piccolo arrive to help. Piccolo gets revenge for being attacked earlier by defeating Garlic Jr.'s henchman Sansho, while Goku manages to defeat the other two henchmen, Ginger and Nicky. Meanwhile, Kami is getting brutally outmatched by Garlic Jr., until Goku and Piccolo rescue him. With Garlic Jr.'s newly obtained immortality and a new muscular second form, Goku &amp; Piccolo are forced to work together and are able to outclass him. Goku and Piccolo then prepare to fight each other, but then Garlic Jr., angry at his defeat, unleashes his ultimate attack, opening up a portal into another dimension; a void of darkness known as the "Dead Zone", created by Garlic Jr.'s father, Garlic (and the same place Kami banished Garlic in), intending to suck his enemies into the void. Before he could claim victory, Goku's son, Gohan, becomes enraged witnessing his father and friends in danger and releases his latent energy, blasting Garlic Jr. into his own vortex to be trapped for all eternity. Unable to remember anything of what happened, Gohan believes that his father defeated Garlic Jr., and with amazement, Goku figures his son is no ordinary boy, but one with a great hidden potential. Meanwhile, Piccolo vows to defeat Goku while watching him and his friends leave.

{{note|Ox King|**}}In the Funimation English dub's credits, Christopher R. Sabat is miscredited as playing the Ox King, a mistake carried over into the Funimation dub of ''[[Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest|The World's Strongest]]''.

===English dub soundtracks===
The 1997 Pioneer release kept the original Japanese music. Funimation's 2005 dub featured a new score by Mark Menza. The remastered releases contain both English audio tracks with the U.S. soundtrack and original Japanese score.

==English releases==
The film was licensed in North America by [[Funimation Entertainment]] and the home video rights were sub-licensed to [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Pioneer Home Entertainment]]. Pioneer's dub used the same voice cast as the TV series did at the time, and was dubbed by [[Ocean Productions]]. They released the film as ''Dead Zone'', and later retitled it ''Dead Zone Vortex'' for its television airings. As a bonus feature on the Pioneer DVD, deleted scenes from the original episodes 1 and 9 are shown in Japanese with English subtitles, as these two episodes were yet to be dubbed in full at the time. In North America, Pioneer's dub was released on [[VHS]], [[LaserDisc]] and [[DVD]] on December 17, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nishio|first=Daisuke|title=Dragon Ball Z - The Movie - Dead Zone|date=1997-12-17|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Movie-Dead-Zone/dp/6304677022|publisher=Geneon [Pioneer]|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once their sub-license expired, Funimation re-released the film on DVD on May 31, 2005, with a completely new dub done by Funimation's voice cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nishio|first=Daisuke|title=Dragon Ball Z - The Movie - Dead Zone|date=2005-05-31|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Movie-Dead-Uncut/dp/B0007LXOUK|publisher=Funimation Prod|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation also released the movie on November 14, 2006 as part of a movie box set subtitled "First Strike", also containing ''[[Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest|The World's Strongest]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might|The Tree of Might]]''. It was later remastered and released in a Double Feature set with ''The World's Strongest'' on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and DVD on May 27, 2008. The film was released to DVD again on November 1, 2011 in a remastered box set containing the first five ''Dragon Ball Z'' movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dragon Ball Z: Movie Pack Collection One|date=2011-11-01|asin=B005HVWW3K|publisher=Funimation Prod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AB Groupe]], a French company that holds the license to the Dragon Ball franchise in most of Europe, licensed and dubbed the movie, which they re-titled ''In Pursuit of Garlic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=26643|title=Kanzenshuu • View topic - Where to buy the "Big Green Dub" DVDs from?|website=www.kanzenshuu.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dub featured a voice cast that was unknown for years, but it is now believed that English-speaking voice actors in France were involved with this dub.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title=Dragon Ball Z: Big Green Dub Cast - Behind The Voice Actors|website=www.behindthevoiceactors.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''In Pursuit of Garlic'' aired on TV in the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and was sold on DVD in the Netherlands by Bridge Entertainment Group. [[Speedy Video]], a Malaysian-based company, released the film on Video CD, here subtitled ''The Vengeance of the Demon King''. Speedy also released the Pioneer English adaptation on VCD. Both the AB Groupe and Speedy dubs are notoriously known for inaccurate translations (e.g. Piccolo was called "Big Green" in the AB Groupe dub) and dialogue that did not fit the mouth flaps.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

{{chinese-name|[[Du (surname)|Du]]}}

'''Du Ji''' (early 160s – 224),{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=177}} [[courtesy name]] '''Bohou''', was an official who lived in the late [[Eastern Han dynasty]] of China. He later served as a high-ranking official in the state of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. He had the reputation of being a model governor, valiant, loyal and wise. He was the grandfather of [[Du Yu]], the author of the most influential ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' commentary, who gave the work its modern form.&lt;ref&gt;Schaberg, 323&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Du Ji was from Duling County (杜陵縣), Jingzhao Commandery (京兆郡), which is in present-day southeastern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]. When he was 19, he served in the convict labour section under the magistrate of Zheng County (鄭縣; present-day [[Hua County, Shaanxi]]). He personally saw all of the hundreds of convicts in the county prisons, weighed the severity of their transgressions, and despatched them to their labours accordingly. Following this, he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' and appointed as a ''fucheng'' (府丞; an aide) in the [[Hanzhong]] stores office.&lt;ref name=_494&gt;''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', '''16'''.494&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the [[end of the Han dynasty]], Du Ji abandoned his post and fled south to [[Jing Province]] (covering present-day [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]]). He returned to the north sometime between 196 and 205,{{efn|Du Ji's biography states he returned from Jing Province in the Jian'an period (196–220), after which he dealt with insurrectionists associated with [[Gao Gan]], whose rebellion against Cao Cao began in 205. See ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', '''16'''.494.}} and was recommended to [[Cao Cao]] by [[Xun Yu]]. Du Ji was appointed as a Director of Justice (司直) to under the [[Sikong (office)|Minister of Works]] (then held by Cao Cao), then sent west to Xiping Commandery (西平郡; present-day [[Xining]], [[Qinghai]]) to serve as the commandery's Administrator (太守) and as Colonel Who Protects the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] (護羌校尉).&lt;ref name=_494 /&gt;

In 205, [[Gao Gan]], a northern warlord and adopted nephew of [[Yuan Shao]], rebelled against Cao Cao, to whom he had surrendered years earlier. Gao Gan convinced Wang Yi (王邑), the Administrator of Hedong Commandery (河東郡), to join him in the rebellion. Two other men from Hedong Commandery, Wei Gu (衛固) and Fan Xian (范先), claimed to have liberated cities for Cao Cao, while conspiring with Gao Gan.

The loss of Hedong Commandery greatly troubled Cao Cao, who saw its strategic location as critical to controlling China, and worried that the rebels could cause serious harm if they were to ally with [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of [[Jing Province]], to their south. He asked Xun Yu to recommend him a great general the likes of [[Xiao He]] or Kou Xun (寇恂), who substantially assisted the careers of the [[Han dynasty]] emperors [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] and [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu]] respectively. Xun Yu cautiously recommended Du Ji.&lt;ref name=_494 /&gt;

==As the Administrator of Hedong Commandery==
Cao Cao appointed Du Ji as the Administrator of Hedong Commandery, so Wei Gu and Fan Xian sent several thousand soldiers to close the ford of Shanjin (陝津; northeast of present-day [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]), one of the three major fords across the [[Yellow River]], and only route into Hedong from an area still under Cao Cao's control. Du Ji was unable to cross the river, so Cao Cao sent a large force under [[Xiahou Dun]] to attack the rebel forces.&lt;ref name=_494 /&gt;

Rather than waiting for Xiahou Dun's forces to crush the Hedong rebels, Du Ji chose to use subterfuge. At a smaller ford, he crossed the river alone, and granted Wei Gu and Fan Xian high military commands and civil offices in Hedong Commandery's administration. He proceeded to convince them that they had to move slowly in order to win over the people of Hedong, so they kept their forces in check for several weeks. Afterwards, Du Ji proposed that the generals, aides and clerks be permitted to visit their homes to see their families, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian allowed this, for fear of alienating the populace.&lt;ref name=_495&gt;''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', '''16'''.495&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the rebel forces in Hedong lacked all middle and lower management, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian stayed put, training their troops while rebellion spread in adjacent commanderies. Having hollowed out the effectiveness of the rebel army from inside, Du Ji took his leave, accompanied by a few dozen horsemen. In a few weeks' time, he had mustered a force of over four thousand. Wei Gu's forces, along with Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng (張晟), attacked Du Ji but could not dislodge him.

When Xiahou Dun's army arrived, Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng fled, while Wei Gu and Fan Xian were executed. Du Ji pardoned their assistants and conspirators, and sent them back to their old occupations.&lt;ref name=_495 /&gt; Thus it was that in the chaotic collapse of the Han dynasty, Hedong was one of the first commanderies stabilised under Cao Cao's rule, and with the least wasted effort and resources.&lt;ref name=_496&gt;''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', '''16'''.496&lt;/ref&gt;

As the commandery's Administrator, Du Ji promoted lenience and mercy, and aided the populace by exerting as little control over them as possible. When someone impeached him or spoke out against him, Du Ji would have the person summoned and explain to them his plans, with the command to think them over thoroughly. If there was something the person still did not understand, Du Ji would summon them again to explain more clearly. The local elders were greatly amenable to this policy, and quickly accepted Du Ji as a model governor. He would exempt particularly filial sons and dutiful wives from state labour, and taught improved farming methods to increase harvests. This achieved, he began teaching martial arts in the winters, and had the people keep their weaponry in good order. He opened a school where he personally taught from the [[Chinese classics]].&lt;ref name=_496 /&gt;

In 211, [[Han Sui]] and [[Ma Chao]] drew up armies against Cao Cao in response to a suspected invasion of their lands. Cities throughout Hongnong and Fengyi commanderies rose in support, while Hedong Commandery remained firmly loyal, despite adjacency to the rebels. When Cao Cao marched west to confront them, his army was fed entirely by grain from Hedong, and after defeating Han Sui and Ma Chao there were still in excess of 4,000 hectolitres of grain left over.&lt;ref name=_496 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Cao Cao increased Du Ji's salary after this.

When Cao Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei by [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] in 213, he appointed Du Ji as a Master of Writing (尚書). Two years later, Cao Cao invaded [[Hanzhong|Hanzhong Commandery]] and Du Ji sent 5,000 men to join Cao Cao's army in the campaign. According to the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', his soldiers were so loyal that not a single person from the Hedong battalion fled from combat.&lt;ref name=_497&gt;''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', '''16'''.497&lt;/ref&gt; Cao Cao again compared Du Ji to Xiao He and Kou Xun, and said Hedong was like a limb to him.

Throughout the 16 years Du Ji governed Hedong Commandery, it was the most stable among all the commanderies in China at the time.&lt;ref name=_497 /&gt;

==Service under Cao Pi==
In 220, after Cao Cao's death, his son and successor [[Cao Pi]], summoned Du Ji to [[Luoyang]] to serve as a Master of Writing (尚書), in addition to enfeoffing him as a Secondary Marquis (關內侯). Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] and ended the Han dynasty, after which he declared himself emperor of the state of [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. After ascending the throne, Cao Pi promoted Du Ji from a Secondary Marquis to a village marquis under the title "Marquis of Fengle Village" (豐樂亭侯), with a marquisate comprising 100 taxable households. More substantially, Du Ji was appointed Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隸校尉), the executive officer in charge of the area surrounding the imperial capital and one of the most powerful positions in the civil bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=_497 /&gt;

In 222, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to [[Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu|invade]] Wei's rival state, [[Eastern Wu]], in 222. He also promoted Du Ji to the position of Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射), entrusting him with administrating state affairs during the expedition. Two years later, when Cao Pi travelled to [[Xuchang]], he left matters in Luoyang in Du Ji's hands again.

In 224, Cao Pi ordered Du Ji to assist in building his fleet for attacking Eastern Wu. Du Ji was in charge of the imperial [[tower ship]], the fleet's central flagship. While testing the ship on the Tao River (陶河), Du Ji's crew encountered heavy winds and the ship sank. Du Ji drowned in the river.{{efn|Du Ji's place of death is not certain. The base text of ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', at '''16'''.497, says he was testing the imperial tower ship in the Tao River when he drowned, then goes on to quote an elegy by Cao Pi saying Du Ji drowned at Meng Ford (孟津). The crossing of Meng Ford was on the [[Yellow River]] adjacent to present-day [[Mengjin County]], northwest of [[Luoyang]], where Du Ji was stationed during his late career. According to the ''[[Book of Wei]]'', there was a Tao River in northern [[Xiuwu County]], in present-day [[Jiaozuo]], [[Henan]], bordering [[Shanxi]] (''Book of Wei'', '''106'''.2458). It is unclear what this waterway is named at present. The Tao River may refer to a Taoshui (陶水) mentioned in the ''[[Shui Jing Zhu|Classic of Waterways]]'', in [[Changzhi County]], [[Changzhi]], [[Shanxi]] (''Annotated Classic of Waterways'', '''10'''.914). There is a tributary of the [[Zhang River]] there, the Taoqing River (陶清河), that appears to have preserved part of the ancient hydronym.}} Cao Pi is said to have wept upon hearing news of Du Ji's death, and wrote that he "epitomised loyalty".&lt;ref name=_497 /&gt; Du Ji was posthumously granted the office of Minister Coachman (太僕), which his son Du Shu (杜恕) inherited.

==Historiography==
The only surviving source for Du Ji's biographical information is the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in which his life history is related unusually hagiographically. Conversations with no possible recorders are presented, and Du Ji is portrayed as a perfect, sagely governor who taught his subjects industry, culture and loyalty to the death. This is perhaps one of the faults of the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' inherited from the ''Book of Wei'',&lt;ref&gt;Qu, 252&lt;/ref&gt; whose authors would have been sensitive to the fact that Du Ji's grandson was the emperor's uncle.

'''Exposing Microorganisms in the Stratosphere''' ('''E-MIST''') is a [[NASA]] study to determine if a specific [[microorganism]] could survive conditions like those on the planet [[Mars]]. The study transported ''[[Bacillus pumilus]]'' bacteria and their spores by helium-filled balloon to the [[stratosphere]] of [[Earth]] (~31&amp;nbsp;km above sea level) and monitored the ability of the microorganisms to survive in extreme Martian-like conditions such as low pressure, dryness, cold, and ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150925"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Figliozzi |first1=Gianine M. |last2=Walter |first2=Daryl |title=Hitchhiking to Mars |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/hitchhiking-to-mars |date=25 September 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test flight of the balloon and gondola was launched from New Mexico on 24 August 2014. A second, longer flight, took place on 10 October 2015.&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'/&gt;

==Overview==
[[Microorganism]]s of every major biological lineage have been detected in Earth's upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Smith 2013"/&gt; If microbial [[metabolism]], [[Bacterial growth|growth]], or [[Self-replication|replication]] is achievable, independent of Earth's surface, then the search for [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]] on other worlds should be broadened to include [[atmosphere]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith 2013"/&gt; Moreover, measuring the endurance of spore-forming bacteria that were previously isolated from spacecraft assembly facilities, may help predict their survival on the surface of Mars and enhance [[planetary protection]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Smith 2014"/&gt;

The environmental conditions in the upper atmosphere resemble the surface conditions of Mars, especially in the [[stratosphere]]&amp;mdash;{{convert|10-50|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]&amp;mdash;that exhibits extreme cold, low pressure, [[desiccation]], [[oxidation]], and higher [[sunlight|solar irradiation]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microbes in the Upper Atmosphere and Unique Opportunities for Astrobiology Research |journal=Astrobiology |date=21 October 2013 |last=Smith |first=David J. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=981–990 |doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1074 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2013.1074 |accessdate=2015-09-29 |pmid=24106911|bibcode=2013AsBio..13..981S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Balloon-Based Payload for Exposing Microorganisms in the Stratosphere (E-MIST) |journal=Gravitational Spaqce Research |last=Smith |first=David J. |last2=Thakrar |first2= Prital J. |last3=Bharrat |first3= Anthony E. |last4=Dokos |first4= Adam G. |last5=et. al. |volume=2 |issue=2 |url=http://www.gravitationalandspacebiology.org/index.php/journal/article/download/661/693 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond investigating viability alone, concerns of whether microorganisms can survive deep space conditions and potentially be transported to other planets, such as Mars, has long been a concern to scientists. To further this understanding, it is necessary to determine if there is a [[Genome|genomic]] (genetic) adaptation that occurs with survival in this extreme environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/pdf/7447.pdf Exposing Microorganisms in the Stratosphere (E-MIST)] (PDF). C. L. Khodadad, and Phillip R. Maloney.  Astrobiology Science Conference (2015). Publisher: Universities Space Research Association (USRA).&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[RNA]] could provide valuable insight into the functional effects on surviving microorganisms. For instance, this approach could help identify [[gene]]s associated with repairing [[cell damage|damage to the cell]] envelope, [[DNA repair|genome]], and core metabolic proteins.&lt;ref name="Smith 2014"/&gt;  The microorganism tested was ''[[Bacillus pumilus]]'' (strain SAFR-032), a resilient radiation-tolerant spore-forming bacteria isolated from a clean room environment in a NASA spacecraft assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/pdf/7447.pdf Exposing Microorganisms in the Stratosphere (E-MIST)] (PDF). C. L. Khodadad, and Phillip R. Maloney. ''Astrobiology Science Conference 2015''. (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gondola==

The 80-pound gondola features four doors that rotate to expose up to 10 experimental samples each for 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasas-e-mist-experiment-soars-in-earths-atmosphere |title=NASA's E-MIST Experiment Soars in Earth's Atmosphere |work=NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To terminate the flight, an explosive charge detonated, tearing a hole in the balloon. E-MIST and other science payloads attached to the balloon's gondola were returned to the surface under a parachute, where waiting researchers recovered the biological samples for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Figliozzi |first=Gianine M. |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-ballooning-bacteria-edge-space.html |title=Ballooning experiment to study bacteria on the edge of space |work=Phys Org |date=25 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major payload components were a lithium-ion battery, an ultraviolet (UV) radiometer, humidity and
temperatures sensors, and a flight computer.

== Results==

After 8 hours exposure in the stratosphere (31&amp;nbsp;km above sea level), 99.9% of the entire population was destroyed.&lt;ref name='Dockrill 2017'&gt;[https://www.sciencealert.com/ultraviolet-light-could-be-what-protects-alien-life-from-earth-bacteria Stowaway Bacteria Could Be Even More Contagious in Space Than We Thought]. Peter Dockrill, ''Science Alert''. 22 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers, "most terrestrial bacteria would be inactivated within the first [day] on Mars if contaminated spacecraft surfaces receive direct sunlight."&lt;ref name='Dockrill 2017'/&gt;

Of the 40 million spores exposed to the stratosphere, only 267 spores (or 0.0007%) remained viable.&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2016.1549 Stratosphere Conditions Inactivate Bacterial Endospores from a Mars Spacecraft Assembly Facility]. Khodadad Christina L., Wong Gregory M., James Leandro M., Thakrar Prital J., Lane Michael A., Catechis John A., and Smith David J.. ''Astrobiology''. April 2017, 17(4): 337-350. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2016.1549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolating this, no viable spores would remain if flight samples had an additional 150  minutes of Sun exposure in the stratosphere (630 min total time).&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'/&gt; The survivors showed three single nucleotide (base pair) substitutions compared to unexposed controls kept on the ground. These three coding regions are associated with bacterial sporulation and metabolism. A similar observation was recorded on SAFR-032 samples that were exposed outside the International Space Station.&lt;ref name='Dockrill 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'/&gt;

Even after cleaning, spacecraft leaving Earth still carry microorganisms on board that are embedded within surfaces, instruments, electronics, and other inaccessible areas that cannot be readily cleaned and are not exposed to direct sunlight, so there is a concern about the few survivors, which may be pushed in evolutionarily consequential directions.&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'/&gt; The researchers suggest that ultraviolet-C lamps (UVC LED arrays) could be embedded in lander spacecraft hardware to help sterilize their interior.&lt;ref name='Khodadad 2017'/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9769">'''Formal ethics''' is a [[formal logical system]] for describing and evaluating the ''form'' as opposed to the ''content'' of ethical principles.  Formal ethics was introduced by [[Harry J. Gensler]], in part in his 1990 logic textbook ''Symbolic Logic: Classical and Advanced Systems'', but was more fully developed and justified in his 1996 book ''[[Formal Ethics (book)|Formal Ethics]]''.

Formal ethics is related to [[ethical formalism]] in that its focus is the forms of moral judgments, but the exposition in ''Formal Ethics'' makes it clear that Gensler, unlike previous ethical formalists, does not consider formal ethics to be a complete ethical theory (such that the correct form would be necessary and sufficient for an ethical principle to be "correct").  In fact, the theorems of formal ethics could be seen as a largest common subset of most widely recognized ethical theories, in that none of its axioms (with the possible exception of ''rationality'') is controversial among philosophers of ethics.

==Symbolic representation==

The axioms and theorems of formal ethics can be represented with the standard notation of [[First-order logic|predicate logic]] (but with a [[Formal grammar|grammar]] closer to [[higher-order logic]]s), augmented with [[Imperative logic|imperative]], [[Deontic logic|deontic]], [[Doxastic logic|belief]], and [[modal logic]] symbols.

Formal logic uses an underlined symbol (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt;) to represent an [[imperative mood|imperative]].  If the same symbol is used without an underline, then the plain symbol is an [[indicative]] and the underlined symbol is an imperative version of the same proposition.  For example, if we take the symbol &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to mean the indicative "You eat an apple", then &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; means the imperative "Eat an apple".  When a proposition is given as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] with one or more of the arguments representing agents, the agent to which the imperative applies is underlined.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;Dux&lt;/math&gt; means "You give a dollar to x" then &lt;math&gt;D\underline{u}x&lt;/math&gt; is the correct way to express "Give a dollar to x".

Within the system of formal ethics, an imperative is taken to represent a preference rather than a demand (called "anti-modal" view, because an underline doesn't behave like a modal operator).  With this interpretation, the negation of an imperative (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\neg \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt;) is taken to mean "Don't do A", not "You may omit A".  To express demands, an imperative modal operator &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (for ''may'') is defined, so that &lt;math&gt;M \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; = "You may do A" and &lt;math&gt;\neg M \neg \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; = "You may not omit doing A" = "You must do A".  Note that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is different from the deontic &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; "all right" operator defined below, as "You must do A" is still an imperative, without any ''ought'' judgment (i.e. not the same as "You ought to do A").

Following [[Hector-Neri Castañeda|Castañeda]]'s approach, the deontic operators &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; (for ''ought'') and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (for ''all right'', represented &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; for ''permissible'' in some deontic logic notations) are applied to imperatives.  This is opposed to many deontic logics which apply the deontic operators to indicatives.  Doing so avoids a difficulty of many deontic logics to express conditional imperatives.  An often given example is ''If you smoke, then you ought to use an ashtray''.  If the deontic operators &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; only attach to indicatives, then it is not clear that either of the following representations is adequate:
:&lt;math&gt;O(\mathrm{smoke} \to \mathrm{ashtray})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{smoke} \to O(\mathrm{ashtray})&lt;/math&gt;
However, by attaching the deontic operators to imperatives, we have unambiguously
:&lt;math&gt;O(\mathrm{smoke} \to \underline{\mathrm{ashtray}})&lt;/math&gt;

Belief logic symbols, when combined with imperative logic, allow [[belief]]s and desires to be expressed.  The notation &lt;math&gt;u:A&lt;/math&gt; is used for beliefs ("You believe A") and &lt;math&gt;u:\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; for desires ("You desire A").  In formal ethics, ''desire'' is taken in a strong sense when the agent of the belief is the same as the agent of the imperative.  The following table shows the different interpretations for &lt;math&gt;i:\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; depending on the agent and the tense of the imperative:
{|border="1"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an imperative for: !! Me !! Someone else
|-
| Present || I act to do A || rowspan="2" | I want the person to do A
|-
| Future || I resolve to do A
|-
| Past || colspan="2" | I am glad A was done, or I regret that A wasn't done
|}
This strong interpretation of desires precludes statements such as "I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't act to get out of bed".  It does not, however, preclude "I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't get out of bed".  Perhaps I act to get out of bed (make my best effort), but can't for some reason (e.g. I am tied down, my legs are broken, etc.).

Beliefs may be indicative, as above, or imperative (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\underline{u} : A&lt;/math&gt; "Believe A", &lt;math&gt;\underline{u} : \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; "Desire A").  They may also be combined with the deontic operators.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; means "God exists", then &lt;math&gt;O(\underline{u}:G)&lt;/math&gt; is "You ought to believe that God exists", and &lt;math&gt;(x)O(\underline{x}:G)&lt;/math&gt; is "Everyone ought to believe that God exists".

The modal operators &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\diamond&lt;/math&gt; are used with their normal meanings in modal logic.  In addition, to address the fact that logicians may disagree on what is ''logically'' necessary or possible, causal modal operators are separately defined to express that something is ''causally'' necessary or possible.  The causal modal operators are represented &lt;math&gt;\underset{c}{\square}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underset{c}{\diamond}&lt;/math&gt;.  In addition, an operator &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; is used to mean "in every actual or hypothetic case".  This is used, for example, when expressing deontic and prescriptive counterfactuals, and is weaker than &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\blacksquare(O\underline{A} \to \underline{A})&lt;/math&gt; means "In every actual or hypothetical case, if you ought to do A, do A"
whereas
:&lt;math&gt;\square(O\underline{A} \to \underline{A})&lt;/math&gt; means "You ought to do A ''logically entails'' do A"

Finally, formal ethics is a higher-order logic in that it allows ''properties'', predicates that apply to other predicates.  Properties can only be applied to actions, and the imperative notation is used (e.g. &lt;math&gt;F\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; = "action A has property F").  The only types of property that formal ethics admits are ''universal properties'', properties are not evaluative and do not make reference to proper names or pointer words.  The following are examples of properties that are not universal properties:
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; means "Act A is wrong" (evaluative)
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; means "Act A angers God" (proper name) &lt;ref&gt;"God" is a proper name if, for example, it is defined as "the god of Christianity".  If "God" is defined in another way, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; might not reference a proper name.  However, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; might still not be a universal property if the definition of "God" is evaluative, for example, "the morally perfect being".  If the definition of "God" is nonevaluative (e.g. "the creator of the universe"), then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a universal property.  Perhaps a less contentionous example would be &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; means "Act A angers Terry".&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; mean "Act A is something I do" (pointer word)

Requiring a property to be universal, however, is different from requiring it to be morally relevant.  &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; means "Act A is done by a black person" is a universal property, but would not be considered morally relevant to most acts in most ethical theories.  Formal ethics has a definition of ''relevantly similar'' actions that imposes certain consistency constraints, but does not have a definition of ''morally relevant properties''.

The notation &lt;math&gt;G \ast \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; is used to mean "G is a complete description of A in universal terms".  Put another way, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a logical conjunction of all universal properties that &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; has.  The &lt;math&gt;G \ast \underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; notation is the basis for the definition of ''exactly similar'' actions and is used in the definition of ''relevantly similar'' actions.

==Axioms==

Formal ethics has four [[axiom]]s in addition to the axioms of predicate and modal logic.  These axioms (with the possible exception of ''Rationality'', see below) are largely uncontroversial within ethical theory.

In natural language, the axioms might be given as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (Prescriptivity) — "Practice what you preach"
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (Universalizability) — "Make similar evaluations about similar cases"
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (Rationality) — "Be consistent"
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (Ends-Means) — "To achieve an end, do the necessary means"

Care must be taken in translating each of these natural language axioms to a symbolic representation, in order to avoid axioms that produce absurd results or contradictions.  In particular, the axioms advocated by Gensler avoid "if-then" forms in favor of "don't combine" forms.

[[File:Garrote Execution - 1901.png|thumb|A 1901 execution at the old Bilibid Prison, [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]
A '''garrote''' or '''garrote vil''' (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word; alternative spellings include '''garotte''' and similar variants&lt;ref name=COED&gt;''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th Ed: '''garrotte''' is normal British English spelling, with single r alternate. Article title is US English spelling variant.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[weapon]], most often a handheld [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] of chain, rope, scarf, wire or fishing line used to [[Strangling|strangle]] a person.&lt;ref name=NEW&gt;Newquist, H.P. and Maloof, Rich, ''This Will Kill You: A Guide to the Ways in Which We Go'', New York: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|978-0-312-54062-3}} (2009), pp. 133-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination weapon==
[[File:Fomfr garrote.jpg|thumb|From the torture museum of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]]]
A garrote can be made out of many different materials, including ropes, [[cable tie]]s, fishing lines, nylon, guitar strings, telephone cord or [[piano wire]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHI&gt;Whittaker, Wayne, ''Tough Guys'', Popular Mechanics, February 1943, Vol. 79 No. 2, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=STE&gt;Steele, David E., ''Silent Sentry Removal'', Black Belt Magazine, August 1986, Vol. 24 No. 8, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

A stick may be used to tighten the garrote; the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself, so it is a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' where the eponymous component may actually be absent. In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRAE&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=garrote#0_7 garrote]'', 7th sense, ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since World War II, the garrote has been regularly employed as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of killing sentries and other enemy personnel.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Instruction in the use of purpose-built and improvised garrottes is included in the training of many elite military units and special forces.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Soldiers of the [[French Foreign Legion]] have used a particular type of double-loop garrote (referred to as ''la loupe''), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt;

The garrote was widely employed in 17th- and 18th-century India as an assassination device, particularly by the [[Thuggee]] cult.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; Practitioners used a yellow silk or cloth scarf called a [[rumāl]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; The Indian version of the garrote frequently incorporates a knot at the center intended to aid in crushing the [[larynx]] while someone applies pressure to the victim's back, usually with a foot or knee.

==Execution device==
[[File:Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg|thumb|In this 15th-century depiction of the burning of [[Albigensian]]s after an ''[[auto da fe]]'', the condemned had been garroted previously. It is one of the first depictions of a garrote. [[Pedro Berruguete]], ''[[Saint Dominic]] Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.'']]
The garrote ({{lang-la|laqueus}}) is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the [[Catiline#Second Catilinian Conspiracy|Second Catilinian Conspiracy]], where conspirators including [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]] were strangled with a ''laqueus'' in the [[Mamertine Prison|Tullianum]], and the implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., ''Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains'', tome I, p.&amp;nbsp;341 (1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranees.net/civilisation/Rich/Articles/Supplices/Laqueus.html|title=Laqueus|publisher=Mediterranees.net|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the ''[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquista]]'' of the Americas, notably in the execution of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emperor [[Atahualpa]].

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AluFxq_GeLMC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=execution+by+the+bowstring|title=The Ottoman Empire: the classical ... - Google Books|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16|first=Halil|last=Inalcik|isbn=978-1-84212-442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Peninsular War#Course of the war|Peninsular War]] of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrote to execute Spanish ''guerrilleros'', priests, and other opponents of Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrote appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrote was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. In May 1897, the last public garroting in Spain was performed in [[Barcelona]]. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. 

===Abolition===
The last civilian executions in Spain, both by garroting, were those of [[Pilar Prades]] in May 1959 and [[José María Jarabo]] in July 1959. Recent legislation had caused many crimes (such as robbery-murder) to fall under the jurisdiction of [[Military justice|military law]]; thus, prosecutors rarely requested civilian executions. Military executions were still performed in Spain until the 1970s. The garrotings of [[Heinz Chez]] (real name Georg Michael Welzel) and [[Salvador Puig Antich]] in March 1974, both convicted in the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist State]] of killing police officers, were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain and in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

With the 1973 Penal Code, [[prosecutor]]s once again started requesting execution in civilian cases. If the death penalty had not been abolished in 1978 after [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s death, it is most likely that civilian executions would have resumed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The last man to be sentenced to death by garroting was [[José Luis Cerveto]] "el asesino de Pedralbes" in October 1977, for a double robbery–murder in May 1974.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Cerveto requested execution, but his sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]]. Another prisoner whose civilian death sentence was commuted was businessman Juan Ballot, for the [[contract killing]] of his wife in [[Navarre]] in November 1973.

In Spain, the death penalty was abolished after a new constitution was adopted in 1978. The writer [[Camilo José Cela]] obtained a garrote (which had probably been used for the execution of Puig Antich) from the ''[[General Council of the Judiciary|Consejo General del Poder Judicial]]'' to display at his foundation. The device was kept in storage in Barcelona. It was displayed in the room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncela.com/asp/lasede/salas_pascualduarteI.asp|title=La Sede. Exposiciones permanentes|publisher=Fundacioncela.com|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncela.com/asp/lasede/salas_pascualduarteII.asp|title=La Sede. Exposiciones permanentes|publisher=Fundacioncela.com|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Cela Foundation devoted to his novel ''[[The Family of Pascual Duarte|La familia de Pascual Duarte]]'' until Puig Antich's family asked for its removal.&lt;ref name=Voz&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/ed_corunia/noticia.jsp?CAT=127&amp;TEXTO=5302415 El director de cine Manuel Huerga presenta el libro «Cómo se hizo: Salvador»]. ''[[La Voz de Galicia]]'', 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Andorra]] became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garrotting, though this method had not been employed there since the late 12th century.

The term was in use at least as early as 1966 amongst staff and students in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, England.  A similar concept, that of the '''gnostic neuron''', was proposed two years later by [[Jerzy Konorski]].&lt;ref&gt;Konorski J. 1967. ''Integrative activity of the brain; an interdisciplinary approach.''(1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face selective cells===
Visual neurons in the [[inferior temporal cortex]] of the monkey fire selectively to hands and faces.&lt;ref&gt;Gross CG. 1998a. ''Brain, vision, memory: tales in the history of neuroscience.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perrett | first1 = DI | last2 = Rolls | first2 = ET | last3 = Caan | first3 = W | year = 1982 | title = Visual neurons responsive to faces in the monkey temporal cortex. | url = | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 329–42 | doi=10.1007/bf00239352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolls ET. 1984.

Research finds that some of these cells  can be trained to show high specificity for arbitrary visual objects, and these would seem to fit the requirements of gnostic/grandmother cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logothetis | first1 = NK | last2 = Sheinberg | first2 = DL | year = 1996 | title = Visual object recognition. | url = | journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 577–621 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.19.030196.003045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka K. 1996. ''Inferotemporal cortex and object vision.'' Annu Rev Neurosci 19:109–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, evidence exists for cells in the human [[hippocampus]] that have highly selective responses to gnostic categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = CG | year = 2000 | title = Coding for visual categories in the human brain | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 855–6 | doi=10.1038/78745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreiman | first1 = G | last2 = Koch | first2 = C | last3 = Fried | first3 = I | year = 2000 | title = Category specific visual responses of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe | doi = 10.1038/78868 | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 946–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including highly selective responses to individual human faces.&lt;ref&gt;Kreiman G, Fried I, Koch C. 2001. ''Single neuron responses in humans during binocular rivalry and flash suppression''. ''Abstr Soc Neurosci'' 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However most of the reported face-selective cells are not grandmother/gnostic cells since they do not represent a specific percept, that is, they are not cells narrowly selective in their activations for one face and only one face irrespective of transformations of size, orientation, and color. Even the most selective face cells usually also discharge, if more weakly, to a variety of individual faces. Furthermore, face-selective cells often vary in their responsiveness to different aspects of faces. This suggests that cell responsiveness arises from the need of a monkey to differentiate among different individual faces rather than among other categories of stimuli such as bananas with their discrimination properties linked to the fact that different individual faces are much more similar to each other in their overall organization and fine detail than other kinds of stimuli.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt; Moreover, it has been suggested that these cells might in fact be responding as specialized feature detector neurons that only function in the holistic context of a face construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jagadeesh | first1 = B | year = 2009 | title = Recognizing grandmother | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 12 | issue = 9| pages = 1083–5 | doi = 10.1038/nn0909-1083 | pmid = 19710647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freiwald | first1 = WA | last2 = Tsao | first2 = DY | last3 = Livingstone | first3 = MS | year = 2009 | title = A face feature space in the macaque temporal lobe | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 12 | issue = 9| pages = 1187–96 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2363 | pmid = 19668199 | pmc=2819705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea has been that such cells form ensembles for the coarse or distributed coding of faces rather than detectors for specific faces. Thus, a specific grandmother may be represented by a specialized ensemble of grandmother or near grandmother cells.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt;

===Individual specific recognition cells===
In 2005, a [[UCLA]] and [[Caltech]] study found evidence of different cells that fire in response to particular people, such as [[Bill Clinton]] or [[Jennifer Aniston]].  A neuron for [[Halle Berry]], for example, might respond "to the concept, the [[abstract entity]], of Halle Berry", and would fire not only for images of Halle Berry, but also to the actual name "Halle Berry".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045| pages = 1102–1107 | doi = 10.1038/nature03687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is no suggestion in that study that only the cell being monitored responded to that concept, nor was it suggested that no other actress would cause that cell to respond (although several other presented images of actresses did not cause it to respond).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The researchers believe that they have found evidence for [[sparseness]], rather than for grandmother cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Sparse but not 'Grandmother-cell' coding in the medial temporal lobe | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 87–91| doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2007.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for the theory that a small neural network provides facial recognition was found from analysis of cell recording studies of macaque monkeys. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, the scientists discovered that each face cell’s firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble of about 200 cells to encode the location of any face in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang, Tsao|first=|date=2017|title=The Code for Facial Identity in the Primate Brain|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.011|journal=Cell|volume=169|pages=1013–1028|via=Elsevier Inc.|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sparseness vs distributed representations==

The grandmother cell hypothesis, is an extreme version of the idea of  [[sparseness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | issue = 7045 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and is not without critics. The opposite of the grandmother cell theory is the distributed representation theory, that states that a specific stimulus is coded by its unique pattern of activity over a large group of neurons widely distributed in the brain.

The arguments against the sparseness include: 
#According to some theories, one would need thousands of cells for each face, as any given face must be recognised from many different angles &amp;ndash; profile, 3/4 view, full frontal, from above, ''etc.'' 
#Rather than becoming more and more specific as visual processing proceeds from retina through the different visual centres of the brain, the image is partially dissected into basic features such as vertical lines, colour, speed, ''etc.'', distributed in various modules separated by relatively large distances.  How all these disparate features are re-integrated to form a seamless whole is known as the [[binding problem]].  &lt;!-- why does this argue against the GM Cell theory? --&gt;

==Pontifical cells==
[[William James]] in 1890 proposed a related idea of a pontifical cell.&lt;ref&gt;James W. (1890). The principles of psychology.
New York: Dover&lt;/ref&gt; The pontifical cell is defined as a putative, and implausible cell which had all our experiences. It is in this different from a concept specific cell in that it is the site of experience of sense data. James's 1890 pontifical cell was instead a cell "to which the rest of the brain provided a representation" of a grandmother. The experience of grandmother occurred in this cell.

The '''[[history]] of [[in vitro fertilisation]]''' goes back more than half a century.

==Early developments==
There was a transient biochemical pregnancy reported by Australian Foxton School researchers in 1953. [[John_Rock_(American_scientist)|John Rock]] was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |title=John Rock's Error |journal=The New Yorker |date=10 March 2000 |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |accessdate=17 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511133811/http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Min Chueh Chang]] at the [[Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology|Worcester Foundation]], proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit. Chang's discovery was seminal, as it clearly demonstrated that oocytes fertilised in vitro were capable of developing, if transferred into the uterus and thereby produce live young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | last2 = Trounson | first2 = A. | last3 = Dawson | first3 = K. | last4 = Jones | first4 = H. | last5 = Hazekamp | first5 = J. | last6 = Nygren | first6 = K.

==Early, non-viable pregnancies==
The first pregnancy achieved through ''in vitro'' human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the [[Monash University]] team of [[Carl Wood]], John Leeton and [[Alan Trounson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720070634/http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660 History Of IVF]. monashivf.com&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy. [[Landrum Shettles]] attempted to perform an IVF in 1973, but his departmental chairman interdicted the procedure at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/babies-bio-shettles/ Biography: Landrum Shettles]. Pbs.org. Retrieved on 3 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Robin Marantz. (28 December 2003) [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-second-best.html THE LIVES THEY LIVED; Second Best. ''New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by [[Patrick Steptoe]] and [[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] in 1976. 

==First baby==
In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, [[Louise Brown]] on 25 July 1978, in [[Oldham General Hospital]], Greater Manchester, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Second baby==
In October 1978, it was reported that [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subash Mukhopadyay]], a relatively unknown physician from [[Kolkata]], India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as "Durga" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The New Scientist, 18 October 1978, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101005/jsp/frontpage/story_13020013.jsp |title=Test tube triumph &amp; tragedy – Nobel for UK scientist stirs memory of a Bengal doctor |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkEko0DybuQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==First boy and transformation from pure research to treatment==
Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 1979, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; A team led by [[Ian Johnston (doctor)|Ian Johnston]] and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, London, 24 June 1980, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.

This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. [[Howard W. Jones]] and [[Georgeanna Seegar Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesinstitute.org/ |title=The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine website |publisher=Jonesinstitute.org |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.

==Subsequent refinements==
The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kyono K, Uto H, Nakajo Y, Kumagai S, Araki Y, Kanto S |title=Seven pregnancies and deliveries from non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patients using fresh and frozen testicular sperm |journal=J. Assist. Reprod.

Palermo]] et al.in Brussels ([[UZ Brussel]]), 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.biomedcentral.com/1743-1050/pubmed/1351601 Pregnancies after intracytoplasmic injection of single spermatozoon into an oocyte]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. G Palermo, H Joris, P Devroey, AC Van Steirteghem - Lancet, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Okada H, Goda K, Muto S, Maruyama O, Koshida M, Horie S |title=Four pregnancies in nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome using cryopreserved-thawed testicular spermatozoa |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=84 |issue=5 |page=1508 |year=2005|pmid=16275253 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.05.033 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, IVF has become the final solution for most fertility problems, moving from tubal disease to male factor, idiopathic subfertility, endometriosis, [[advanced maternal age]], and anovulation not responding to ovulation induction.

==Recognition==
[[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] was awarded the 2010 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for the development of ''in vitro'' fertilization".&lt;ref name="nobelpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2010/press.html |title=The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steptoe and [[Jean Purdy]] were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosden |first1=Roger |title=Jean Marian Purdy remembered – the hidden life of an IVF pioneer |journal=Human Fertility |date=7 September 2017 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=86–89 |doi=10.1080/14647273.2017.1351042}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Wood]] was dubbed "the father of IVF (''in vitro'' fertilisation)" for having pioneered the use of frozen embryos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P003036b.htm Wood, Edwin Carlyle (1929 – )].

The '''Johnny Bright incident''' was a violent [[Violence in sports|on-field assault]] against [[African-American]] player [[Johnny Bright]] by a white opposing player during an American [[college football]] game held on October 20, 1951 in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]]. The game was significant in itself as it marked the first time that an African-American athlete with a national profile and of critical importance to the success of his team, the [[Drake Bulldogs]], had played against Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]) at Oklahoma A&amp;M's [[Lewis Field]]. Bright's injury also highlighted the racial tensions of the times and assumed notoriety when it was captured in what was later to become both a widely disseminated and eventually [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photo sequence.

==Assault==
Johnny Bright's participation as a [[Running back|halfback]]/[[quarterback]] in the collegiate football game between the [[Drake Bulldogs]] and [[Oklahoma State Cowboys|Oklahoma A&amp;M Aggies]] on October 20, 1951 at Lewis Field was controversial even before it began. Bright had been the first African American football player to play at Lewis Field two years prior (without incident). In 1951, Bright was a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate and led the nation in total offense.&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27–14"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=26&amp;REC=2 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = White, Maury | title = Aggies Outlast Drake, 27–14 | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright had never played for a losing team in his college career. Coming into the contest, Drake carried a five-game winning streak, owing much to Bright's [[rush (American football)|rushing]] and [[forward pass|passing]] abilities.

It was an open secret that Oklahoma A&amp;M players were targeting Bright.  Both Oklahoma A&amp;M's student newspaper, ''[[The Daily O'Collegian]]'', and the local newspaper, ''[[NewsPress|The News Press]]'', reported that Bright was a marked man, and several A&amp;M students were openly claiming that Bright "would not be around at the end of the game." Although Oklahoma A&amp;M had integrated in 1949, the [[Jim Crow]] spirit was still very much alive on campus.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"/&gt;

During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright was knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&amp;M [[defensive tackle]] Wilbanks Smith. While Smith's final elbow blow broke Bright's jaw, he was still able to complete a 61-yard [[touchdown]] pass to Drake halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later.&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27–14" /&gt; Soon afterward, the injury forced him to leave the game. Bright finished the game with less than 100 yards, the first time in his three-year collegiate career. Oklahoma A&amp;M eventually won 27–14.&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27–14" /&gt;

Bob Spiegel, a reporter with the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', interviewed several spectators after the game, eventually publishing a report on the incident in the October 30, 1951 issue of the newspaper. According to Spiegel's report, several of the Oklahoma A&amp;M students he interviewed overheard an Oklahoma A&amp;M coach repeatedly say "Get that [[nigger]]" whenever the A&amp;M practice squad ran Drake plays against the Oklahoma A&amp;M starting defense prior to the October 20 game.&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=36&amp;REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiegel also recounted the experiences of a businessman and his wife, who were seated behind a group of Oklahoma A&amp;M practice squad players. At the beginning of the game, one of the players turned around said, "We're gonna get that nigger."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports" /&gt; After the first blow to Bright was delivered by Smith, the same player again turned around and told the businessman, "See that knot on my jaw? That same guy [Smith] gave me that the very same way in practice."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports" /&gt;

==Photographic sequence==
A six photograph sequence of the incident captured by ''Des Moines Register'' cameramen John Robinson and [[Don Ultang]] clearly showed Smith's jaw-breaking blow was thrown well after Bright had handed the ball off to Drake [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Gene Macomber, and was well behind the play.&lt;ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=40&amp;REC=8 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | first = John | last = Robinson | authorlink =  |author2=Don Ultang | title = Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14 | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson and Ultang had actually set up a camera focusing on Bright before the game after the rumors of him being targeted became too loud to ignore.  They rushed the film to Des Moines as soon as Bright was knocked out of the game.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"/&gt;  Ultang said years later that they were very lucky that the incident took place when it did; they'd only planned to stay through the first quarter so they could have enough time to develop the pictures before the deadline.&lt;ref name=UltangObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/sports/football/27ultang.html "Don Ultang, Pioneer in Aerial Photography, Dies at 91"], ''The New York Times'', September 27, 2008. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sequence won Robinson and Ultang the 1952 [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]], and eventually made the cover of ''[[Life Magazine]]''.

==Aftermath==
Oklahoma A&amp;M's president, Oliver Willham, denied anything happened even after evidence of the incident was published nationwide.  This began a cover-up that would last over half a century; during that time, whenever the story was discussed, the standard response from A&amp;M/OSU was "no comment."  The determination to gloss over the affair was so strong that when [[Robert B. Kamm]] succeeded Willham in 1966, he knew that he could not even discuss the matter even though he had been Drake's dean of men at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"/&gt;

When it became apparent that neither Oklahoma A&amp;M nor the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to which both Drake and Oklahoma A&amp;M belonged, would take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake withdrew from the MVC in protest.  The Bulldogs would not return to the MVC until 1956 for non-football sports, and would not return for football until 1971.  Fellow member [[Bradley University]] pulled out of the league in solidarity with Drake and did not return for non-football sports until 1955; its football team never played another down in the MVC (Bradley dropped football in 1970).&lt;ref name="1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=37&amp;REC=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Moorhead, Jim | title = 1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1964-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident eventually provoked changes in [[NCAA]] football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards.&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports"/&gt;

===Johnny Bright===
{{Main|Johnny Bright}}
Bright's broken jaw limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at [[Drake Bulldogs|Drake]], but he earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the [[Drake Bulldogs|Bulldogs]]' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season. Bright finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 [[Heisman Trophy]], and played in the post-season [[East–West Shrine Game]] and the [[Hula Bowl]].

Following his 1952 graduation from Drake, Bright went on to enjoy a 12-year professional football career in the [[Canadian Football League]], retiring in [[1964 CFL season|1964]] as the CFL's all-time leading rusher, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"&gt;{{cite web |last=Soutar |first=Ted |url=https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=56 |title=CFL Legend: Johnny Bright |publisher=CFL.ca |accessdate=August 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 ''Des Moines Register'' interview three years before his [[Johnny Bright#Post-football career and death|death]], Bright commented: "There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated." Bright went on to add: "What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports" /&gt;

When asked about Smith, whom he had not seen since the incident, Bright said he felt "null and void" about Smith, but added: "The thing has been a great influence on my life. My total philosophy of life now is that, whatever a person's bias and limitation, they deserve respect. Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports" /&gt;

===Wilbanks Smith===

Wilbanks Smith received over 1000 letters regarding the incident. Most of the mail was [[hate mail]] or death threats, but some was congratulatory and thankful.  Smith maintained that he was not racist, the hit was "not a racial incident," and that he had landed "the same hit" on a white player earlier in the game. He never apologized for the incident, but said in 2012 that he was glad the incident had helped to integrate college football, saying "It took me a long time before I could smile about it. But now I can. I think it was a tool [Civil Rights'] organizations used, and it was very effective."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocolly.com/sports/football/article_1f5c49e2-198d-11e2-9689-001a4bcf6878.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lower (uterine) segment Caesarean section''' (LSCS) is the most commonly used type of [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref name="powell01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=John|title=The Kerr Incision|journal=Journal of Pelvic Surgery|date=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=77–78|url=http://journals.lww.com/jpelvicsurgery/Citation/2001/05000/The_Kerr_Incision__John_Martin_Munro_Kerr.15.aspx|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a [[transverse cut]]  1-2 centimetres above the attachment of the [[urinary bladder]] to the uterus, called the [[Pfannenstiel incision]] in the lower segment. This type of incision results in less [[Bleeding|blood loss]] and is easier to repair than other types of Caesarean sections.

It may be transverse (the usual) or vertical in the following conditions:&lt;ref name=gfmer&gt;[http://www.gfmer.ch/Obstetrics_simplified/caesarean_section.htm Obstetrics Simplified - Diaa M.

* presence of lateral varicosities 
* constriction ring to cut through it
* deeply engaged head
The location of an LSCS is beneficial for the following reasons:
*peritoneum is more loosely attached to the uterus
*contraction is less than in upper part of uterus
*healing is more efficient
*sutures are intact (less problem with suture loosening)
Most bleeding takes place from the angles of the incision, and forceps can be applied to control it. ''Green Armytage forceps'' are specifically designed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meb.uni-bonn.de/dtc/primsurg/docbook/html/x5840.html Lower segment Caesarean section] Primary Surgery: Volume One: Non-trauma.

Although the incision is made using a sharp scalpel, care must be taken not to injure the foetus, especially if the membranes are ruptured, or in emergencies like [[abruptio placenta|abruption]]. The incision can be extended to either sides using a scissor or by blunt dissection using hands. While using the scissors, the surgeon should ensure that a finger is placed underneath the uterus so that the foetus in protected from unintentional injury. If blunt dissection is done, intraoperative blood loss can be minimized.

'''Mate desertion''' occurs when one or both parents abandon their current offspring, and thereby reduce or stop providing parental care. Often, by deserting, a parent attempts to increase breeding opportunities by seeking out another mate. This form of mating strategy behavior is exhibited in insects, birds and mammals. Typically, males are more likely to desert, but both males and females have been observed to practice mate desertion.

==Evolutionary theory==

===Conflict driving mate desertion===
Mate desertion involves the decision by an already-mated individual to either continue providing parental care or to desert.&lt;ref name=Lazarus1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazarus|first1=J.|title=The logic of mate desertion|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1990|volume=39|issue=4|pages=672–684|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making this decision, a parent must balance investment in terms of current and future [[reproductive success]], choosing the optimal strategy, or one that provides the greatest net benefit towards lifetime reproductive success. Current success is measured by the number of surviving offspring, whereas future success is measured by the potential to successfully produce offspring in future seasons.&lt;ref name=Trivers1972&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Campbell |editor-first=Bernard |date=1972 |title=Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man: 1871–1971 |last=Trivers |first=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert Trivers |chapter=7: Parental Investment and Sexual Selection |publisher=Aldine Publishing |location=Chicago |isbn=0-202-02005-3 |lccn=70-169510 |pages=136–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trade-offs between costs and benefits are further reflected in the two major conflicts driving mate desertion: 1) parent-offspring conflict over the level of [[parental investment]] that a parent should provide and 2) [[sexual conflict]] between mates over who should provide care and how much care should be provided.

According to evolutionary biologist [[Robert Trivers]], parental investment is defined as “any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.”&lt;ref name=Trivers1972/&gt; This investment includes investing in [[gamete]]s and feeding and protecting young, which is also known as [[Egg incubation|brooding]]. Often, the amount of parental investment necessary to maximize fitness differs between parent and offspring, thereby creating parent-offspring conflict. While increasing parental investment increases the current offspring's likelihood to survive and reproduce, this investment comes at the expense of the parent's ability to invest in future offspring. Therefore, when uniparental care is equally effective as biparental care, [[natural selection]] will favor mate desertion, allowing the deserter to either remate or conserve resources for future reproduction.

However, the decision of which mate deserts first and when creates varying reproductive outcomes for both males and females, leading to sexual conflict over parental investment. This occurs because the deserted organism pays all costs of parental care while the deserter not only shares the benefits of the reproductive success of the current offspring, but also gains benefits from additional mating opportunities.&lt;ref name=Arnqvist2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnqvist|first1=G|last2=Rowe|first2=L|title=Sexual Conflict|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, both males and females would be expected to evolve adaptations in response to this sexual conflict, which would ultimately lead to sexually antagonistic [[coevolution]] between male and female traits.

[[File:European Penduline Tit.jpg|thumb|Elaborate nest of a penduline tit]]
In [[penduline tit]]s (''Remiz pendulinus''), uniparental care is dominant, and either sex is capable of desertion during the egg laying period. Typically, females care 50-70% of the time, males care 5-20% of the time, and both parents desert 30-40% of the time, condemning the offspring to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szentirmai|first1=I|last2=Székely|first2=Tamás|last3=Komdeur|first3=Jan|title=Sexual conflict over care: antagonistic effects of clutch desertion on reproductive success of male and female penduline tits|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|date=2007|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1739–1744|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01392.x|pmid=17714291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, males build elaborate nests and usually desert once these nests have been filled with the females' eggs.&lt;ref name=Arnqvist2005/&gt; 

As a result, in response, females have adopted two counter-adaptive behaviors that function to deceive the male regarding the [[bird egg|clutch's]] progress. Females conceal their eggs by burying them and aggressively attack males who approach the nest during the egg laying period. Studies have shown a high correlation between length of time a male stays before deserting and number of days a female keeps her eggs buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valera|first1=F|last2=Hoi|first2=H|last3=Schleicher|first3=B|title=Egg burial in penduline tits, remiz pendulinus: Its role in mate desertion and female polyandry|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=1997|volume=8|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1093/beheco/8.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship suggests that egg burial has evolved as an adaptive female behavior that attempts to control information males use to decide whether or not they should desert.

===Response to desertion===
After one partner deserts, the remaining partner has three options. First, it may attempt to raise the young on its own. This usually occurs when the investment required by one parent to successfully raise the current offspring to maturity is less than that needed to produce new offspring. As a result, the remaining partner is forced into a situation Trivers' coined as “cruel bind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R.|last2=Carlisle|first2=T.R.|title=Parental investment, mate desertion and a fallacy|journal=Nature|date=1976|volume=262|pages=131–132|doi=10.1038/262131a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the deserter effectively forces its partner to stay, gaining the benefit of the deserted parent's continued investment at the cost of additional mating opportunities for the deserted parent.

Second, if the cost of raising offspring alone is high and the cost of remating is low, the deserted individual may choose to desert the offspring as well and attempt to breed again.&lt;ref name=Trivers1972/&gt; In some cases, the second deserter may even take part in [[filial cannibalism]], reaping its lost investment by eating its own offspring as nourishment. For example, in [[Scissortail sergeant|scissortail sergeant fish]] (''Abudefduf sexfasciatus''), male parental care is dominant, and males undergo brood cycling in which they alternate between mating and parental phases. When broods are artificially reduced early in the breeding phase, male scissor-tail sergeants are more likely to cannibalise eggs and return to the mating phase, primarily because reduced broods indicate decreased current reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manica|first1=A|title=Alternative strategies for a father with a small brood: mate, cannibalise or care|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=2002|volume=51|issue=4|pages=319–323|doi=10.1007/s00265-001-0444-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a deserted individual may also attempt to trick another mate into helping provide care for its young, circumventing its cruel bind.&lt;ref name=Trivers1972/&gt; For instance, a female who cuckolds a male, deceiving him into raising another male's offspring, benefits by reducing the amount of care she must provide and by conserving resources for future reproduction. In response, the evolution of counter-adaptations that allow males to guard against female deception would be expected, as it is evolutionarily maladaptive for an organism to invest in unrelated offspring.&lt;ref name=Trivers1972/&gt;

==Patterns of mate desertion==

===Explanations===
Two explanations have been proposed as evidence for why mate desertion by males is more commonly observed in nature. First, costs in lost mating opportunities are higher in males than in females.&lt;ref name=Wisenden1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisenden|first1=B.D.|title=Factors affecting mate desertion in free-ranging convict cichlids (Cichlasoma Nigrofasciatum).|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=1994|volume=5|issue=4|pages=439–447|doi=10.1093/beheco/5.4.439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because males have greater variance in reproductive success, their lifetime reproductive success depends more on number of mating opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=N.B.|last2=Krebs|first2=J.R.|last3=West|first3=S.A.|title=An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology|date=2012|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=West Sussex, UK|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus they often benefit more from desertion. Second, mode of fertilization often influences degree of parental care, which in turn influences which sex will desert. Generally speaking, male parental care is predicted by [[external fertilization]], and female parental care is predicted by [[internal fertilization]]. This pattern of parental care is best explained by the “Association Hypothesis," which argues that association with embryos predisposes a sex for parental care.&lt;ref name=Wisenden1994/&gt; 

For example, in species where mate desertion by males is prominent, females reproduce through internal fertilization and are thus responsible for carrying the eggs. While this intimate connection allows the female to offer better care for her offspring, the male's comparative separation makes him much less likely to be able to adequately care for his young. Furthermore, inherent to internal fertilization is the fact that it is impossible for females to desert because they are the sex bearing offspring. Under this theory, females are often not in a position to leave their young, while males can leave and have much less to offer by sticking around. Conversely, in organisms that practice external fertilization—including certain species of fish—males are often the primary caretakers for young.

===Factors influencing mate desertion===
Natural selection tends to favor desertion when costs are low and benefits are high. Benefits include increased mating opportunities in the same breeding season and reduced energetic costs associated with parental care, whereas costs include decreased mating opportunities and reduced future reproductive success. Both the timing and probability of mate desertion have been shown to be influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, desertion by either sex is favored when remating opportunities are high, food for young is abundant, predation is low, current offspring are older, require little parental investment and are smaller than average size, and the deserter's contribution to parental care is low.&lt;ref name=Lazarus1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jennions2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jennions|first1=M.D.|last2=Polakow|first2=D.A.|title=The effect of partial brood loss on male desertion in a cichlid fish: an experimental test.|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2001|volume=12|issue=1|pages=84–92|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.beheco.a000383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that has been shown to influence probability of mate desertion is a biased [[operational sex ratio]], which is defined as the ratio of sexually active males to sexually active females. In [[convict cichlid]] fish, males are more likely to desert when there is a female-biased sex ratio, as males have a higher chance of remating and increasing reproductive success. Furthermore, probability of male desertion in this particular species is also increased where there is low predation (high predation leads to biparental care for offspring survival), mature offspring, and smaller than average offspring size.&lt;ref name=Wisenden1994/&gt; In another population of cichlids (''Aequidens coeruleopunctatus''), brood reduction leading to earlier male mate desertion has also been observed, and here, by deserting, not only does the male save energy, but he also increases his chance of breeding and thus his reproductive success as well.&lt;ref name=Jennions2001/&gt;

[[File:Coopers-hawk-1.jpg|thumb|Cooper's hawk]]
Similarly, in [[Cooper's hawk]]s, female desertion of offspring has been found to be closely related to both the likelihood of offspring survival and future reproductive success. Females in weak physical condition are more likely to abandon offspring to complete migration, increasing breeding chances and opportunities for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Elizabeth|author2=Kennedy, Patricia|title=A Dynamic State Variable Model of Mate Desertion in Cooper's Hawks|journal=Ecology|year=1993|volume=74|issue=2|pages=351–366|doi=10.2307/1939298|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235087/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Whiskered tern]]s, the majority of deserters are female and is related to provisioning rate: females providing more food were less likely to desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Ledwoń, M. |author2= Neubauer, G. |  year=2017| title = Offspring desertion and parental care in the Whiskered Tern ''Chlidonias hybrida''.| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=860–872| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12496/full| doi=10.1111/ibi.12496| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mate desertion by either sex depends on food supply, in that snail kites are more likely to desert when snails are abundant and rate of nesting success is high. Thus, mating strategies exhibited by snail kites are somewhat plastic, depending on varying environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beissinger|first1=S.

==Game theory==

===Lazarus's model of mate desertion===

[[File:Case 1 Figure 1 (Adapted from Lazarus 1990).png|thumb|Case 1. Because V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+(M or F), neither parent gains any reproductive advantage by deserting their mate. For both parents, reproductive fitness equals V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details).]]
[[File:Case 2 of Mate Desertion Model (Adapted from Lazarus 1990).png|thumb|Case 2. At t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the male benefits from deserting the brood because V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At this point, the female's fitness equals V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the female benefits from deserting the brood because V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+F &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At this point, the male's fitness equals V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+M, and the female's fitness equals V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+F. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details).]]
[[File:Case 3 of Mate Desertion Model (Adapted from Lazarus 1990).png|thumb|Case 3. At t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the male benefits from deserting the brood because V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At this point, the female's fitness equals V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. After this, the female cannot improve her fitness past V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by deserting, so she chooses to stay and provide care. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details).]]

Game theory helps explain when parents are more or less likely to desert their offspring by taking into account the costs and benefits associated with these decisions. John Lazarus developed a well-known game theory model for mate desertion, in which different outcomes are predicted using a payoff matrix. In this particular model, the benefits of desertion depend both on the ability of the deserter to gain additional mating opportunities and on the deserted partner's strategy.&lt;ref name=Lazarus1990/&gt;

Lazarus's model of mate desertion defines conditions that lead to three possible cases: 1) both parents stay, 2) both parents desert, or 3) one parent stays and one parent deserts. If both parents stay with the offspring, then neither gains the benefits from deserting their mate. If both parents desert, each individual will do so at a time offering them maximal benefit based on when the other parent leaves. If only one parent deserts, then the deserter will leave at a time when benefits are high and costs are low. Variables are used to describe the different fitness levels achieved by each parent.
* V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: reproductive success obtained when no parents care for the young. 
* V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: reproductive success obtained when only one parent cares for the young (for the purpose of simplicity, model assumes that V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the same for both male-only and female-only care)
* V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: reproductive success obtained when both parents care for the young
* M: male's benefit from deserting
* F: female's benefit from deserting

In case one, both parents choose to stay. For either the male or the female, the total payoff for the deserter (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M or V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+F) is less than the reproductive success obtained when both parents provide care (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Therefore, neither benefits from deserting.

Case two arises when both parents desert. Normally, the payoff for desertion is higher for one sex than the other. This model assumes that males benefit more from desertion than do females (M&gt;F), though this is not the case for all species. When the payoff a male receives by deserting (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M) exceeds the reproductive success of providing care (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the young, he should desert. At this point, the male's reproductive success is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M, and the female's reproductive success is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Eventually the payoff for a female deserting (V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+F) will exceed the benefits of caring alone (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). At this point, she is also expected to desert, leaving the brood with no parental care. 
 
Lastly, case three occurs when one parent deserts, and the other stays. In this model, because of the assumption that M&gt;F, the male will desert first when the payoff of deserting (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M) is greater than the benefits of investing in offspring (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). At this point, the male's reproductive success is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + M, and the female's reproductive success is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. However, in contrast to case two, the female will never benefit by deserting because the payoff (V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+F) never exceeds the benefits obtained by caring alone (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, in situations where the female's benefits of deserting are low, she will remain to raise her brood, maximizing her reproductive success.

'''McKinsey &amp; Company''' is an American worldwide [[management consulting]] firm. It conducts [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis to evaluate management decisions across public and private sectors. McKinsey publishes the ''[[McKinsey Quarterly]]'' since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of confidentiality, influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.

McKinsey was founded in 1926 by [[James O. McKinsey]] in order to apply accounting principles to management. McKinsey died in 1937, and the firm was restructured several times, with the modern-day McKinsey &amp; Company emerging in 1939. [[Marvin Bower]] is credited with establishing McKinsey's culture and practices in the 1930s based on the principles he experienced as a lawyer. The firm developed an "up or out" policy, where consultants who are not promoted are asked to leave. McKinsey was the first management consultancy to hire recent college graduates, rather than experienced managers.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. It had 88 staff in 1951, 7,700 by the early 2000s and 27,000+ by 2018. McKinsey's consulting has helped to establish many of the norms in business and contributed to many of the major successes and failures in business in the modern era.

These foreign offices were primarily in [[Europe]], such as in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]], as well as in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="GreinerOlson2004"/&gt;{{RP|12-13}} By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices.&lt;ref name="CurnowReuvid2005"/&gt; Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place.&lt;ref name="seventysix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;{{RP|61}} McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951.&lt;ref name="seventysix"/&gt; The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-[[World War II]] era.&lt;ref name="vault"/&gt; After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.&lt;ref name="GreinerOlson2004"/&gt;{{RP|12}}&lt;ref name="seventysix"/&gt;

After Bower stepped down in 1967, the firm's revenues declined.

==== Ongoing South African corruption scandal====
The [[Gupta family]] (no relation to Rajat Gupta) had strategically placed corrupted individuals in various South African government, utilities and infrastructure sectors. It is alleged that McKinsey was complicit in this corruption by using the Guptas to obtain consulting contracts from certain state-owned enterprises, including [[Eskom]] and [[Transnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/world/africa/mckinsey-south-africa-eskom.html?action=click&amp;module=Trending&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer&amp;contentCollection=Trending|title=How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Trillian Capital Partners (a consultancy which was owned by a Gupta associate),&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Why McKinsey is under attack in South Africa|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730191-consulting-firm-worked-trillian-capital-owned-gupta-family-associate-why-mckinsey|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they provided services to the value of R1 billion ($75 million) annually.

McKinsey's then Managing Partner, Dominic Barton issued a statement, following an internal investigation, in which the firm "admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian."&lt;ref name="Independent Online"&gt;{{Cite news|author=|title=Corruption Watch hits out at McKinsey|url=https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/companies/corruption-watch-hits-out-at-mckinsey-11601986/|work=[[Independent Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2017, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], South Africa's main opposition political party, laid charges (Case Number: CAS 1156/9/2017) of fraud, racketeering and collusion against McKinsey in terms of Section 21 of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act (Act 12 of 2004).  The party alleged that McKinsey ignored red flags from senior South African staff members that deals between Trillian, [[Eskom]] and other Gupta-linked companies were not above board. The party said that McKinsey seems to have ignored these warnings as the profits were far too lucrative for McKinsey to pass up. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Mckinsey repayment does not let them off the hook|url=https://www.da.org.za/2018/07/mckinsey-repayment-does-not-let-them-off-the-hook|work=[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corruption Watch (South Africa)|Corruption Watch]], a South African non-governmental organisation, also filed a complaint about the controversial contract to the [[US Department of Justice]], alleging that there was a criminal conspiracy between McKinsey, Trillian and [[Eskom]] in contravention of US and South African law. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=McKinsey &amp; Company not off the hook|url=https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/companies/mckinsey-and-company-not-off-the-hook-15942722]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed in January 2018 that criminal complaints were filed against McKinsey &amp; Company by the South African [[Companies and Intellectual Property Commission]]. South African prosecutors confirmed that they would enforce the seizing of assets from McKinsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/da62b02a-fb94-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority concluded in early 2018 that the payments to McKinsey and its local business partner, Trillian, were illegal, involving crimes such as fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering. McKinsey had subsequently been in discussion with Eskom and the National Prosecuting Authority’s Asset Forfeiture Unit to agree on a transparent, legally appropriate process for returning the R1-billion (US$74m) it had been paid - it was confirmed on 6 July 2018 that this had been concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Pityana commends McKinsey for “paying back the money” - BUSA|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/pityana-commends-mckinsey-for-paying-back-the-mone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eskom confirmed it received R99.5 million in interest from McKinsey on July 23, 2018. The interest payment covers the two years since McKinsey was paid almost R1-billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=McKinsey pays back interest arising from Eskom contract|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/2018-09-06-mckinsey-pays-back-interest-arising-from-eskom-contract/]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repayment of the near R1-billion illegal fee was not universally well received by South Africans.  McKinsey continued to receive negative coverage in South Africa's business press with Sikonathi Mantshantsha, deputy editor of South Africa's [[Financial Mail]] magazine writing in an open letter to Mckinsey that "...I find it rich — too rich, in fact — for McKinsey to lecture anyone about the truth, principles and fairness. Let me tell you that the highest standards of ethics, truth and fairness begin with never taking that which does not belong to you in the first place. The second is to not pretend you are helping a client when you clearly are not. The third point is to acknowledge, however hard that may be, when you have done all and any of the above." This was in response to an unpublished email from Mckinsey which Mantshantsha described as making the "baseless and arrogant claim about there being no evidence presented to support the accusations of unethical conduct — possibly also thieving and corruption — that has financially crippled not only SA's electricity provider [[Eskom]], but also the rail and pipeline firm [[Transnet]]. And possibly others."  Mantshantsha went on to say "as is now common cause, McKinsey has readily admitted that there is no legal basis on which to hold on to the funds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=An open letter to McKinsey: I find it rich — too rich, in fact — for McKinsey to lecture anyone about the truth, principles and fairness |url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/opinion/between-the-chains/2018-07-26-sikonathi-mantshantsha-an-open-letter-to-mckinsey/]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information relating to allegedly corrupt practices by McKinsey at [[Transnet]] in 2011 and 2012 came to light in late July 2018.  The weekly [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] newspaper reported that a "...new forensic treasury report shows how controversial former Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh enjoyed overseas trips at the expense of international consulting firm McKinsey, which scored multi-billion rand contracts at the state owned entities." The "...report reiterates treasury’s recommendations that Singh’s conduct with regards to McKinsey should be referred to the elite crime-fighting unit, the Hawks, for investigations under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Precca). Under Precca, Singh would be investigated for allegations of corruption as the overseas trips alone constitute a form of gratification, which is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=From Dubai to Russia ― how former Eskom and Transnet CFO Anoj Singh was bought|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-07-29-from-dubai-to-russia-how-the-former-eskom-and-transnet-cfo-was-bought]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sunday [[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]] reported that the forensic report in turn reported that "multinational advisory firm McKinsey paid for Singh to go on lavish international trips to Dubai, Russia, Germany and the UK, after which their contract with Transnet was massively extended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Treasury drops looting bomb|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/treasury-drops-looting-bomb-20180729-4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mckinsey issued a statement that the allegations were incorrect. Mckinsey stated that "based on an extensive review encompassing interviews, email records and expense documents, our understanding is that McKinsey did not pay for Mr. Singh’s airfare and hotel lodgings in connection with the CFO Forum and the meetings that took place around the CFO Forum in London and elsewhere in 2012 and 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Right of Reply: McKinsey denies it paid for Anoj Singh’s lavish London junket|url=https://www.biznews.com/undictated/2018/08/03/right-reply-mckinsey-anoj-singh-cfo-junket]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2018 McKinsey admitted to helping [[Transnet]] Group Chief Executive Siyabonga Gama prepare a part of his thesis to obtain an MBA degree from TRIUM, a collaborative MBA programme jointly run by the [[NYU Stern School of Business]], the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] and [[HEC School of Management]].  Several researchers at McKinsey’s Johannesburg office were assigned to help outline and prepare Gama’s submission to a joint thesis to which he had to contribute at least two chapters.  Despite multiple earlier denials that any corrupt activities had been discovered, a McKinsey’s spokesperson said "... we believe this matter passed the threshold of reasonable suspicion that an offence may have occurred under South African law. As such, we reported it last year to relevant authorities under Section 34(1) of Precca."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=McKinsey admits helping Transnet CEO with MBA, but Gama says only aid was editing|url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/exclusive-siyabonga-gama-on-mba-mckinsey-only-helped-with-language-and-flow-not-content-20180806]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Role in Saudi clampdown on dissidents ===
In October 2018, in the wake of the Saudi dissident and journalist [[assassination of Jamal Khashoggi]], ''The New York Times'' reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent Saudi dissidents on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families. One of the dissidents was arrested. Another dissident's family members were arrested, and the cell phone of the dissident was hacked. McKinsey issued a statement, saying "We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused. We have seen no evidence to suggest that it was misused, but we are urgently investigating how and with whom the document was shared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html|title=Saudis’ Image Makers: A Troll Army and a Twitter Insider|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role in Trinidad and Tobago-Petrotrin 
Reports presented in the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament indicated McKinsey provided consulting recommendations to the amount of $66. Million dollars in total. The Petrotrin Refinery is set to close on November 30th 2018. (Reference TT Parliament Hansard).

McKinsey has a de-centralized structure, whereby different offices operate similarly, but independently. Each office is expected to put the overall organization's best interest before the office's, which McKinsey refers to as the "one firm" principle. Consultants and engagements are often shared across offices.&lt;ref name="thefirm"&gt;{{cite book

===Culture===
[[File:Marvin Bower.jpg|thumb|Marvin Bower, founder of modern-day McKinsey and its corporate culture]]
[[Marvin Bower]] is credited with creating McKinsey's values and principles in 1937.&lt;ref name="vault"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eightytwo"/&gt; He established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth even if it means challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eightytwo"/&gt; Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt;

Bower also established the firm's language.&lt;ref name="observerlo"/&gt; McKinsey calls itself "The Firm" and its employees "members".&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; McKinsey says its consultants are not motivated by money.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; McKinsey &amp; Company tries to keep a "very low profile public image".&lt;ref name="stillsetting"&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Birchall|title=Consultancy pioneer is still setting the pace|newspaper=The Times|pp=7|date=June 8, 2006|quote=It was also the first firm to hire MBA graduates from the top business schools to staff its projects, rather than relying on older industry personnel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has a policy against discussing specific client situations.&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt; The firm says it does not advertise, though it did advertise allegedly for recruitment purposes in ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' in 1966.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; Members are not supposed to "sell" their services.&lt;ref name="waylo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardlo"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sandra|last=Laville|author2=Nils Pratley|title=Brothers who sit at Blair's right hand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey's consultants are expected to become a part of the community and recruit clients from church, charitable foundations, board positions and other community involvements.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;

A 1993 profile story in ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' said McKinsey &amp; Company was "the most well-known, most secretive, most high-priced, most prestigious, most consistently successful, most envied, most trusted, most disliked management consulting firm on earth".&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' the firm is "ridiculed, reviled, or revered depending on one's perspective".&lt;ref name="bwww"&gt;{{cite news|title=The McKinsey Mystique|first=Tom|last=Rodenhauser|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2014|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/the-mckinsey-mystique|newspaper=BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinsey's culture has often been compared to [[religion]], because of the influence, loyalty and zeal of its members.&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grip"/&gt; ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' said partners talk to each other with "a sense of personal affection and admiration".&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; An article in ''The News Observer'' said McKinsey's internal culture was "collegiate and ruthlessly competitive" and has been described as arrogant.&lt;ref name="observerlo"/&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' said McKinsey is seen as "elite, loyal and secretive".&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; According to [[Reuters]], it has a "button-down culture" focused on "playing by the rules".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McKinsey shocked by insider-trading allegations|first=Steve|last=Eder|date=October 19, 2009|publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/19/us-mckinsey-insider-trading-analysis-sb-idUSTRE59I5Y520091019|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''BusinessWeek'', some consultants say the firm has strayed from its original values as it increased in size.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt; ''The Guardian'' said at McKinsey "hours are long, expectations high and failure not acceptable".&lt;ref name="guardlo"/&gt;

===Influence===
Many of McKinsey's alumni become CEOs of major corporations or hold important government positions.&lt;ref name="stillsetting"/&gt; In doing so, they influence the other organization with McKinsey's values and culture.&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stillsetting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grip"/&gt; McKinsey's alumni have been appointed as CEOs or high-level executives at [[Google]], [[American Express]], [[Boeing]], [[IBM]], [[Westinghouse Electric]],&lt;ref name="grip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaylo"&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Kim|title=McKinsey: CEO factory.

=== Critiques on culture ===
McKinsey’s culture has been under scrutiny after a number of scandals the firms was either directly involved in or indirectly associated with. The independent says that ‘McKinsey’s fingerprints can be found at the scene of some of the most spectacular corporate and financial debacles of recent decades',&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/mckinsey-how-does-it-always-get-away-with-it-9113484.html|title=McKinsey: How does it always get away with it?|date=7 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Reuters names the scandalous incidents ‘not bad apples, [but] a culture of corruption’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/09/mckinseys-corrupted-culture/|title=McKinsey’s corrupted culture|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey is in some cases seen as complicit or emblematic for the culture in cases where they did not get prosecuted with criminal charges, or where their former employees engaged in illegal or morally unethical behavior.

[[Enron]] was the creation of [[Jeff Skilling]], a proud McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after the falldown. The Independent states that McKinsey had ‘fully endorsed the dubious accounting methods that caused the company to implode in 2001’,&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt; and that ‘the processes and principles he [Jeff Skilling red.] allowed were very McKinsey. The consultants used Enron as their sandbox.' &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/mar/24/enron.theobserver|title=The firm that built the house of Enron|date=24 March 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey does not disclose the nature of its relationship with Enron other than to confirm it was a client. The Guardian reported that Enron used McKinsey on 20 different projects.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; However, it must be noted that McKinsey has consistently denied to have given Enron advice on financing issues or that it had suspicions the company was using improper accounting methods. Nor has it been summoned before the Department of Justice to explain its role. Nevertheless, according to the Guardian, ‘Enronitis is virulent’.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

McKinsey is said to have played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis by promoting the securitization of mortgage assets and encouraged the banks to fund their balance sheets with debt, driving up risk, which ‘poisoned the global financial system and precipitated the 2008 credit meltdown'.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Chu, McKinsey: How does it always get away with it? Independent, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, McKinsey advised [[Allstate]] Insurance to purposefully give low offers to claimants. The Huffington Post revealed that the strategy was to make claims "so expensive and so time-consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/insurance-claim-delays-industry-profits-allstate-mckinsey-company_n_1139102|title=Insurance Industry Reaps Massive Profits From Delay|date=13 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to this, 2016 McKinsey partner Navdeep Arora was convicted for illegally depleting [[State Farm]] of over $500.000 over a period of 8 years, in collaboration with a State Farm employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mckinsey-indictment-0106-biz-20160105-story.html|title=McKinsey and State Farm consultants bilked $900,000, feds say|first=Kim|last=Janssen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent case of indirect involvement concerns [[Valeant]], a Canadian pharmaceutical company investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]]. Valeant has been alleged of improper accounting, and that it used predatory price hikes to boost growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/20/valeant-timeline-scandal/|title=What Caused Valeant's Epic 90% Plunge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Times states that ‘Valeant’s downfall is not exactly McKinsey’s fault but its fingerprints are everywhere.’&lt;ref name="FT_Valeant"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0bb37fd2-ef63-11e5-aff5-19b4e253664a |title=McKinsey’s fingerprints are all over Valeant |last=Gapper |first=John |date=23 March 2016 |work=Financial Times |access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three out of six senior executives were recent ex-McKinsey employees, as well as the chair of the ‘talent and compensation’ committee.&lt;ref name="FT_Valeant" /&gt;

Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that McKinsey didn’t single-handedly cause the credit meltdown or the Enron scandal. The Independent says that McKinsey ‘just partly facilitated them, and blessed the actions of incompetent and greedy managements with their slick charts and beguiling jargon.'&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt; Furthermore, other defenders of McKinsey claim that the firm merely advises, and is not a decision-maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/13/mckinseys-secret-influence-on-american-business.html|title=Want to be a CEO? Work here|first=Kerima|last=Greene|date=13 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consulting services==
McKinsey &amp; Company provides [[management consulting]] services, such as providing advice on an acquisition, developing a plan to restructure a sales force, creating a new business strategy or providing advice on downsizing.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waylo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; Its consultants design and implement studies to evaluate management decisions using data and interviews to test [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref name="waylo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt; Conclusions of the study are presented to senior management, typically in a [[PowerPoint]] presentation and a booklet.&lt;ref name="waylo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt;

McKinsey &amp; Company has traditionally charged approximately 25 percent more than competing firms&lt;ref name="WetFeet2009"/&gt; with an average project of one million dollars.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; Prices were reduced in the economic slump following the dot-com bubble.&lt;ref name="Glater"/&gt; According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', McKinsey clients estimate that the firm's advice turns out to be poor in retrospect about 10 to 20 percent of the time.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

A typical McKinsey engagement can last between two and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants.&lt;ref name="WetFeet2009"/&gt; An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt; or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;

===Environmental consulting===
[[Marginal abatement cost]] curves attempt to compare the financial costs of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucft347/Kesicki_MACC.pdf|first=Fabian|last=Kesicki|publisher=University College London Energy Institute|title=Marginal abatement cost curves for policy making|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey &amp; Company released its first marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Greenhouse gas abatement cost curves|work=Sustainability and Resource Productivity|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/sustainability/latest_thinking/greenhouse_gas_abatement_cost_curves|publisher=McKinsey &amp;amp; Company|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Jerker Rosander, Per-Anders Enkvist  |author2=Tomas Nauclér  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=February 2007|publisher=McKinsey &amp;amp; Company|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/Sustainability/A_cost_curve_for_greenhouse_gas_reduction|title=A cost curve for greenhouse gas reduction|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey &amp; Company's MAC curve has become the most widely used&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{citation|quote=the most well known and widely used of which have been compiled by McKinsey and Company|publisher=University College London Energy Institute|date=April 2011|title=Marginal Abatement Cost Curves: A call for caution|accessdate=December 10, 2012|url=http://www.whoseolympics.org/bartlett/energy/news/documents/ei-news-290611-macc.pdf|author=[[Paul Ekins]], Fabian Kesicki, Andrew Z.P.

This clever little chart shows the relative opportunity costs of different abatement activities. McKinsey's curve and expertise on climate change have opened the doors and pockets of ministries and industries around the globe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKinsey's curve predicts negative cost abatement strategies, which has been controversial among economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Frank Ackerman  |author2=Ramon Bueno |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Stockholm Environment Institute|title=Use of McKinsey abatement cost curves for climate economics modeling|date= January 25, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2012|url=http://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/Climate/sei-workingpaperus-1102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Association for Energy Economics]] said in ''The Energy Journal'' that McKinsey's cost-curve was popular among policymakers, because it suggests they can take "bold action towards improving energy efficiency without imposing costs on society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Energy Journal|volume=32|issue=01|year=2011|issn=0195-6574|doi=10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-SI1|title=The Policy Implications of Energy-Efficiency Cost Curves|first=Hillard|last=Huntington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 report, the Rainforest Foundation UK said McKinsey's cost curve methodology was misleading for policy decisions regarding the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) program. The report argued that McKinsey's calculations exclude certain implementation and governance costs, which makes it favor industrial uses of forests while discouraging subsistence projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=McREDD How McKinsey ‘cost-curves’ are distorting REDD|url=http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/McREDD|publisher=The Rainforest Foundation|date=2010|first=Nathaniel|last=Dyer|first2=Simon|last2=Counsell|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace said the curve has allowed Indonesia and Guyana to win financial incentives from the [[United Nations]] by creating inflated estimates of current deforestation so they could demonstrate reductions in comparison.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Morales|date=April 7, 2011|title=McKinsey Work Lets Congo, Guyana Get Aid, Cut Trees, Greenpeace Says|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=December 10, 2012|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-06/mckinsey-work-lets-congo-guyana-get-aid-cut-trees-greenpeace-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Huffington Post|first=Johann|last=Hari|title=Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program (REDD)|date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinsey said they had made it clear in the cost-curve publications that cost curves do not translate "mechanically" into policy implications and that policymakers should consider "many other factors" before introducing new laws.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerard|last=Wynn|date=April 7, 2011|title=McKinsey defends its climate costs slide rule|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=December 10, 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/07/us-climate-costs-idUSTRE7365KX20110407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruiting and compensation==
McKinsey &amp; Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers,&lt;ref name="stillsetting"/&gt; when it started doing so in 1953. Less than half of the firm's recruits are from business majors,&lt;ref name="WetFeet2009"/&gt;{{RP|7}} while others have advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law.&lt;ref name="waylo"&gt;{{cite book

According to ''The Observer'', McKinsey recruits recent graduates and "imbues them with a religious conviction" in the firm, then culls through them with its "up-or-out" policy.&lt;ref name="observerlo"/&gt; The "up or out" policy, which was established in 1951, means that consultants that are not being promoted within the firm are asked to leave.&lt;ref name="McKenna2006"/&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside McKinsey|first=Andrew|last=Hill|newspaper=Financial Times|quote=Every two or three years, McKinsey determines whether its consultants will make progress to the next level in the firm.

Additionally, a 1984 analysis by ''BusinessWeek'' found that many of those companies identified as "excellent" in the book no longer met the criteria only two years later.&lt;ref name="guest"/&gt;

==Consulting projects==
According to ''The Firm'', McKinsey has been influential in establishing the norms of business, such as working in large-scale office settings.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; According to a 1993 profile in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, "while McKinsey has consulted for many of the current era's great successes... it has also been a fixture at many of the big losers."&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; In ''The Firm'', author Duff McDonald said McKinsey helped restructure the [[White House]], guided corporations through large-scale re-organizations in post-war Europe and facilitated turn-arounds, but in other cases advised companies to adopt strategies that led to their collapse or was unable to prevent an impending bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; It said

&lt;blockquote&gt;McKinsey was a major player in the efficiency boom in the 1920s, the postwar gigantism of the 1940s, the rationalization of government and rise of marketing in the 1950s, the age of corporate influence in the 1960s, the restructuring of America and rise of strategy in the 1970s, the massive growth in information technology in the 1980s, the globalization of the 1990s, and the boom-bust-and-cleanup of the 2000s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKinsey &amp; Company's founder, James O. McKinsey, introduced the concept of budget planning as a management framework in his fifth book ''Budgetary Control'' in 1922.&lt;ref name="CurnowReuvid2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barry Curnow|author2=Jonathan Reuvid|title=International Guide to Management Consultancy: Evolution Practice and Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctLTOJPZQIYC&amp;amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=December 16, 2012|date= December 3, 2005|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-4699-4|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="padjildk"&gt;{{citation|last=Flesher|first=Dale|first2=Tonya|last2=Flesher|title=McKinsey, James O.

In 1931 McKinsey created a methodology for analyzing a company called the General Survey Outline (GSO), which was established based on ideas introduced in the 1924 book ''Business Administration''. It was also known as the Banker's Survey, because McKinsey's clients who used it in the 1930s were predominantly banks.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;{{RP|22}} After the [[Wagner Act]] gave certain rights to employees to organize into unions in 1935, McKinsey started consulting corporations on employee relations. Later in the 1950s, the work of a McKinsey consultant on compensation was influential in "skyrocketing executive pay".&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; It also helped many companies such as [[Heinz]], [[IBM]] and [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] expand into Europe.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;

In the 1940s, McKinsey helped many corporations convert into wartime production for World War II.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; It also helped organize NASA into an organization that relies heavily on contractors in 1958.&lt;ref name="McKenna2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher D.

In the 1970s and 1980s, McKinsey helped European companies change their organizational structure to [[M-form]] (Multidivisional Form), which organizes the company into semi-autonomous divisions that function around a product, industry or customer, rather than a function or expertise.&lt;ref name="KippingEngwall2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthias Kipping|author2=Lars Engwall|title=Management Consulting : Emergence and Dynamics of a Knowledge Industry: Emergence and Dynamics of a Knowledge Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ba_LE10UhagC&amp;amp;pg=PA191|date=June 20, 2002|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-158812-9|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|208}}&lt;ref name="Schröter2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harm G.

According to ''The Firm'' this was "laughably off the mark" from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for [[Hoogovens]], the world's largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; It also implemented a turnaround for the city of [[Glasgow]], which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for [[NationsBank]], when it was still a small company known as [[North Carolina National Bank]].&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; McKinsey was hired by [[General Motors]] to do a large-scale re-organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers. The book ''The Firm'' said it was an "unmitigated disaster" because McKinsey focused on corporate structure, whereas GM needed to compete with Japanese automakers through manufacturing process improvement. A McKinsey consultant said GM did not follow their advice.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt;

A 2002 article in ''BusinessWeek'' said that a series of bankruptcies of McKinsey clients, such as [[Swissair]], [[Kmart]], and [[Global Crossing]], in the 1990s raised questions as to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt; McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, many of which were failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A scary Swiss meltdown|date=July 19, 2001|url=http://www.economist.com/node/705265|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues.&lt;ref name="guardianlo"/&gt; According to ''The Independent'', there was "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture."&lt;ref name="theindlo"&gt;{{cite news|first=Katherine|last=Griffiths|title=The Real Power Behind No 10; McKinsey is a Highly Secretive Consultancy Firm|newspaper=The Independent|date=June 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting,&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems&lt;ref name="wsjtwosohn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hwang|first=Suein|author2=Rachel Emma Silverman |title=McKinsey's Close Relationship With Enron Raises Question of Consultancy's Liability|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 17, 2002|url=http://faculty.msb.edu/bodurthj/teaching/ENRON/McKinsey%27s%20Close%20Relationship%20With%20Enron%20Raises%20Question%20of%20Consultancy%27s%20Liability.htm|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ignored warning signs.&lt;ref name="fiftyone"/&gt;

Former ''Financial Times'' journalist Duff McDonald said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often prevents the public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations.&lt;ref name="thefirm"/&gt; 13,000 McKinsey documents were released as part of a lawsuit against [[Allstate]], which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=David|author2=Darrell Preston |date=August 3, 2007|title=Home Insurers' Secret Tactics Cheat Fire Victims, Hike Profits|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;refer=home&amp;amp;sid=aIOpZROwhvNI|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffin|first=Drew|author2=Kathleen Johnston |date=February 9, 2007|title=Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims|publisher=CNN|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-02-09/us/insurance.hardball_1_accident-victims-auto-insurers-allstate?_s=PM:US|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MeatPrizes20110408.JPG|thumb|Meat prizes on display]]
A '''meat raffle''' is a tradition of [[raffle|raffling]] off [[meat]], often in pubs and bars in Australia, in some areas of the USA, and in Western Canada. In most parts of Britain and Canada a meat raffle is known as a '''meat draw'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Royal Torbay Yacht Club |title=Monthly Meat Draw|accessdate=18 June 2018|url=https://rtyc.org/monthly-meat-draw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases the raffle is operated by a designated charity, though in Britain most of the proceeds are spent on prizes and the raffle is run as a social occasion and a method of enticing customers into a local pub. The meat ranges in animal and cut and often comes from local [[butchers]].

In the UK, a typical meat raffle would have approximately 25-30 tickets sold at £1 each, though there is considerable variation and some raffles are much larger. Depending on the specific raffle, when a winning number is called the winner can either pick their cut of meat or opt for a gift certificate. All proceeds typically go to a [[Charitable organization|charity]].

Also simply known as a '''meat tray''', the tradition is well known in Australian and New Zealand pubs. The trays of meat raffled vary in content: a barbecue style mix of steaks, lamb chops, sausages etc. is the most common, however "breakfast trays" (bacon, eggs, sausages) and "seafood trays" (prawns, oysters, mussels) are also common. Meat trays are usually raffled to raise money for local sporting teams, often those associated with the particular pub the raffle occurs in. The proceeds often help fund the team's end of season trip.
Care must be taken with seafood trays given the propensity for the contents to spoil in the heat as the lucky winner continues drinking; often a friendly publican will store the tray in the fridge until the winner is sufficiently refreshed and ready to head home. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

An Australian variant of the meat raffle is the [[chook raffle]], where a chicken is raffled off. A Canadian variant popular primarily in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area is "Porketta Bingo", in which a traditional Italian [[porchetta]] is given as a prize in a card game as a fundraiser for local [[minor hockey]] leagues.&lt;ref name=sudbury&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/living/food/article/1111711--sudbury-s-signature-dish-is-porketta "Sudbury’s signature dish is porketta"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', January 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the interval at the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] includes a meat raffle to raise funds for youth teams.

The [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] TV comedy show ''[[Compete for the Meat]]'', hosted by [[Al Murray]], is loosely based on the concept of a meat raffle.

The survey also identifies those cities with the highest [[personal safety]] ranking based upon internal stability, crime, effectiveness of law enforcement and relationships with other countries. In this case, [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] is top, followed by [[Bern]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Zürich]], all equally placed at number 2.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Scoring==
The 231 cities are evaluated on 39 factors including political, [[economic]], [[Social environment|environmental]], personal safety, [[health]], [[education]], [[transport]]ation and other [[Public services|public service]] factors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 2010, cities were compared to [[New York City]] which was given a base score of 100.

'''Michael Keith Beale Colvin''' (27 September 1932 – 24 February 2000) was a politician in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was first elected as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bristol North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol North West]] in 1979. From 1983 onwards, he was the MP for [[Romsey and Waterside (UK Parliament constituency)|Romsey and Waterside]] constituency in [[Hampshire]], which later became the constituency of [[Romsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Romsey]].

==Early life and career==

Michael Colvin was born to Captain Ivan Beale Colvin RN and Joy Arbuthnot. He had a brother, Alistair Colvin, four years his junior. He was educated at [[West Downs School]] in Winchester, [[Eton College]]; and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]]. Joining the [[Grenadier Guards]] at 18, he served in Berlin, Suez and Cyprus, emerging as a captain.&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roth|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/25/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary - Michael Colvin|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2000|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After studying at the [[Royal Agricultural College]] at [[Cirencester]], he initially worked for four years in advertising with the agency [[J Walter Thompson]], then for 14 years as a director of Accrep Ltd, a property investment firm.

Active in local government at first, he was an elected member of [[Tangley]] parish council, Andover rural district council and [[Hampshire County Council]]. He had left Hampshire local government by the mid-1970s

==Parliamentary career==
===Policy positions===
His first parliamentary seat was [[Bristol North West]], which he gained from Labour in 1979, when [[Margaret Thatcher]] achieved power, but he was then considered to be one of the "[[Wets and dries|wets]]", and thus under Thatcher likely to remain a backbencher.&lt;ref name="PA240200"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/24/guardianprofiles|title=The Guardian Profile: Michael Colvin|work=The Guardian|agency=Press Association|date=24 February 2000|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colvin showed political ambivalence, however, he urged the creation of a new centre party on the one hand, but also called for privatisation of [[National Health Service|NHS]]. In 1983, he switched to the newly created and much safer seat of [[Romsey and Waterside]], near [[Southampton]]. As a Cayzer son-in-law, he opposed the phasing out of tax allowances on new shipbuilding and urged a larger, more modern merchant marine fleet. He opposed the slicing off of [[British Airways|BA]]'s routes just when it was becoming successful. He favoured easier conditions for pub licencees.

Opposed to bans on [[foxhunting]], Colvin was the chairman of the [[Council for Country Sports]] from 1988, Colvin rejected gun-control; he was a leading figure, following the [[Hungerford massacre|Hungerford]] and [[Dunblane massacre]]s in the "gun lobby". He was a defence and aviation specialist, serving on the [[Defence Select Committee]], which he chaired from 1995 to 1997, leaving it in January 2000. However, he was not politically consistent with the right-wing of the Conservatives; he was liberal on abortion and favoured free eye and dental treatment,&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; In 1989 he sponsored a [[Private Member's Bill]] which became the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]].

===Southern Africa===
Colvin became the chairman of the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee. He supported the South-African-backed anti-[[SWAPO]] white forces in Africa and endorsed the regime in [[Namibia]] in 1981. In his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' obituary of Colvin, [[Andrew Roth]] wrote that the MP "was also a somewhat secretive former propagandist for apartheid South Africa".&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; He defended the whites of southern Africa, accepting invitations to visit [[South Africa]], then under [[apartheid]], and [[Bophuthatswana]], a [[Bantustan]] ('homeland') set up for blacks by the South African  government. He urged that the 'homelands', which were not internationally recognised, should be accepted.&lt;ref name="PA240200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanning"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanning|first1=James|last2=Elliott|first2=Francis|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/from-pretoria-a-gift-horse-funny-cameron-never-mentioned-it-1674392.html|title=From Pretoria, a gift horse: Funny Cameron never mentioned it|work=The Independent|date=25 April 2009|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he supported reformist [[Denis Worrall]]'s election campaign in 1987, the following year he criticised the BBC for broadcasting the concert tribute to [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; Colvin visited Bophuthatswana again, and Angola, in 1989 as a guest of [[UNITA]], an organisation backed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and South Africa. Connected to the Strategic Network International (SNI), a lobbyist front set up in 1985 to campaign against the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa, Colvin was involved in finding sympathetic Conservative MPs to visit the 'homelands' on expenses paid trips.&lt;ref name="PA240200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanning"/&gt; The Conservative activist [[Derek Laud]] was involved in SNI and was responsible for recommending Colvin to the group.&lt;ref name="Davies261094"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Patricia Wynn|last2=Dowden|first2=Richard|last3=Carlin|first3=John|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-attack-on-sleaze-how-apartheid-regime-set-out-to-woo-tories-patricia-wynn-davies-tells-the-story-of-the-firm-which-gave-mps-a-south-african-perspective-1444979.html|title=The Attack on Sleaze: How apartheid regime set out to woo Tories|work=The Independent|location=London|date=26 October 1994|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Colvin became a consultant to SNI (at £10,000 a year), in succession to [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]]. Colvin, with Conservative colleagues [[John Carlisle (British politician)|John Carlisle]] and [[David Atkinson (politician)|David Atkinson]] were among members of SNI sent to watch the peace process in Angola during 1992. SNI dissolved the following year.&lt;ref name="Davies261094"/&gt; His consultancy with SNI was not declared, and when the connection became known in 1994, the media linked the issue to then on-going [[Cash-for-questions affair]]: "It was not registered. It is an oversight which I regret", Colvin said.&lt;ref name="BBC240200"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/654702.stm|title=Michael Colvin MP: Tory squire|publisher=BBC News|date=24 February 2000|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, among 11 Conservative MPs, he was found by the Commons Select Committee on Members' Interests to have failed to declare, as a [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's 'Name']], details of his syndicate's activities, specifically the areas of insurance underwritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Patricia Wynn|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mps-rebuked-for-flouting-rule-on-lloyds-former-prime-minister-among-group-of-names-criticised-for-1425760.html|title=MPs rebuked for flouting rule on Lloyd's: Former prime minister among group of Names criticised for failing to disclose syndicate numbers|work=The Independent|date=28 June 1994|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Patricia Wynn|last2=MacIntyre|first2=Donald|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/third-tory-mp-failed-to-declare-consultancy-fee-1444786.html|title=Third Tory MP failed to declare consultancy fee|work=The Independent|date=25 October 1994|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend to lobbyists such as [[Ian Greer]], more directly implicated in the cash for questions scandal, which led to  Hamilton's disgrace. Later, Colvin became a director, with Derek Laud, of the Laud Ludgate lobbying organisation.&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
He married Nichola Cayzer, the daughter of [[William Cayzer, Baron Cayzer]], an executive in the [[British and Commonwealth shipping company]]. The couple had three children; two daughters and a son.&lt;ref name="BBC250200"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/657252.stm|title=Family tell of inferno grief |publisher=BBC News|date=25 February 2000|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colvin and his wife died in a fire at their house, Tangley House, near [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]] in February 2000.&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC250200"/&gt; The following [[Romsey by-election, 2000|by-election]] led to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] gaining the seat with their candidate [[Sandra Gidley]] being elected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26029">'''Music as a coping strategy''' involves the use of [[music]] (through listening or playing music) in order to reduce stress, as well as many of the psychological and physical manifestations associated with it. The use of music to cope with stress is an example of an emotion-focused, adaptive [[coping strategy]]. Rather than focusing on the stressor itself, [[music therapy]] is typically geared towards reducing or eliminating the emotions that arise in response to stress. In essence, advocates of this therapy claim that the use of music helps to lower stress levels in patients, as well as lower more biologically measurable quantities such as the levels of [[epinephrine]] and [[Cortisol awakening response|cortisol]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elise | first1 = Labbe | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title = Stress and Coping: The Effectiveness of Different Types of Music | url = | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Feedback | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 163–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, music therapy programs have been repeatedly demonstrated to reduce [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety symptoms in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yehuda | first1 = Nechama | year = 2011 | title = Music and Stress | url = | journal = The Journal of Adult Development | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 85–94 | doi=10.1007/s10804-010-9117-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==

{{Main|Coping (psychology)}}

In the context of psychology, a ''coping strategy'' is any technique or practice designed to reduce or manage the negative effects associated with stress. While stress is known to be a natural biological response, biologists and psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that stress in excess can lead to negative effects on one's physical and psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Sapolsky. Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping. 2nd Rev Ed, April 15, 1998. W. H. Freeman {{ISBN|978-0-7167-3210-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevated stress levels can lead to conditions including mental illnesses, cardiovascular conditions, eating disorders, gastrointestinal complications, sexual dysfunction, and skin and hair problems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of-stress-on-the-body#2|title=Stress Symptoms: Effects of Stress on the Body|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The variety and potential fatality from these conditions push the need for a coping mechanism to reduce the manifestations associated with stress. 

While there are hundreds of different coping strategies, the use of music is one specific example of a coping strategy that is used to combat the negative effects of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carver | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Connor-Smith | first2 = Jennifer | year = 2010 | title = Personality and Coping | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 679–704 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100352 | pmid = 19572784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the substantially large number of strategies to choose from, psychologists break down coping strategies into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Weiten, W. &amp; Lloyd, M.A. (2008) Psychology Applied to Modern Life (9th ed.). Wadsworth Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-495-55339-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Appraisal-based - Intended to modify the individual's thought process Stress is typically eliminated through rationalization, changes in values or thinking patterns, or with humor.
# Problem-based - Targets the cause of the stress. The process could either involve eliminating or adapting to a stressor in order to cope. An example of a problem based strategy is [[time management]]. 
# Emotion-based - Geared towards influencing one's emotional reactions when stressed. Meditation, distractions, or the release of emotion are all forms of emotion-based coping strategies. [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]] is another example of this, as it is a more personal reflection based aspect of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mindful Way Through Stress|last=Alidina|first=Shamash|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4625-0940-9|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since music-based coping is designed to modify an individual's emotional reactions to a certain event, it is best classified as an ''emotion-based'' coping strategy. Rather than attempting to directly influence or eliminate a particular stressor, music-based coping relies on influencing an individual's emotional and mental reaction to the stressor. Music assuages stress by either reducing or altering emotional response or alleviate some of the physiological effects of the stress response. 

==Major empirical findings==

Psychologists and medical practitioners have recently focused more time and attention on the concept of music as a coping strategy and the effects of its use on patients. In literature linking music and stress, empirical findings are typically grouped together according to the method in which they are gathered. For example, some methods may include studies like survey questions or more invasive methods of study like invasive [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] observations.  Despite the fact that different methods are used, most of these studies demonstrate the impact different types of music have on human emotions. &lt;ref&gt;Leubner, D., and Hinterberger, T. (2017). [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01109/full# “Reviewing the Effectiveness of Music Interventions in Treating Depression.”] Front Psychol.eCollection 2017 Jul 7;8:1109.   [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28736539 PMID: 28736539] [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01109/full# doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01109]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient response-based findings===

One of the more popular methods used to collect data on coping strategies involves the use of non-invasive, patient response-based methods. This method is directed more towards the psychological realm, in that the methods used to collect data were not very invasive but more of a “tell me how you feel” type of question/response system.&lt;ref&gt;Hanser, S. B., and L. W. Thompson. "Effects of a Music Therapy Strategy on Depressed Older Adults." Journal of Gerontology 49.6: P265-269. Effects of a Music Therapy Strategy on Older Adults. Web. 21 Apr. 2015. &lt;http://geronj.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/6/P265.full.pdf html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the findings had been gathered, statistical analysis was performed in an effort to discover a correlation between the coping mechanism and its effect on the stress response. These non-invasive treatments are more popular among children and elderly patients, since they prevent the results from being altered due to the patients's nervousness. Proponents of these methods claim that if children are prompted with general, unthreatening questions, they are much more comfortable and willing to provide accurate accounts of their levels of stress. In several studies using non-invasive methods, music has been documented as being effective in reducing the subject's perceived level of stress.

====Music and effects on psychological trauma====

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is a psychological stress disorder that involves the experience of strong emotional reactions due to traumatic events in an individual's past. PTSD is almost always a result of a traumatic experience. Certain triggers, such as images, sounds, or other significant sensory details associated with the experience can evoke extreme stress responses, panic attacks, or severe anxiety. PTSD is commonly experienced by veterans of armed conflicts, and can be frequently diagnosed in victims of rape or other violent assaults.&lt;ref&gt;"PTSD". US Department of Veterans Affairs. Accessed Apr. 9 2015. http://www.ptsd.va.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

If an individual diagnosed with PTSD associates a certain song with a traumatic memory, it typically triggers a stronger stress/anxiety response than the individual would otherwise have otherwise experienced when listening to the song.&lt;ref name="hsrd.research.va.gov"&gt;http://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/news/research_news/music-010614.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; While one cannot assume that music is the only factor that triggers PTSD-influenced stress and panic attacks, these can be especially memorable because of music’s rhythm, beat, and/or memorable lyrics.  However, associating music with psychological responses is not necessarily guaranteed to bring up bad memories, because music can often hold psychological connotations to very happy memories. For example, it has been demonstrated that supplying the residents of nursing homes with iPods that feature nostalgic music is a means of reducing the stress of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Music and Memories&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has been used to treat [[dementia]] patients by utilizing methods similar to the treatments that are used in the management of PTSD. However, in the treatment of dementia, more emphasis is placed on providing the patient with music that triggers pleasant memories or feelings, rather than avoiding music that triggers negative emotions.&lt;ref name="hsrd.research.va.gov"/&gt; After the music is listened to, one sees the change in mood and attitude from closed and distant to joyful, open and happy.

There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence demonstrating the effectiveness that music can have as a coping response in this regard. For example, if a patient of either PTSD or dementia were to have a loved one die, he or she might associate a certain song with the person being mourned for, and hearing that song could bring about feelings of happiness or deep sadness. In addition, if there was a certain connection between them, such as in marriage, and their wedding song came on, an overly powerful emotional reaction could occur. These overly emotional situations trigger memories and a stress response that anguishes the person remembering these hurtful memories. A certain song that pertains to that memory can trigger nearly any emotion.

Music’s effects on Dementia patients have shown to bring them out of their shell, and engage them in singing and being happy, opposed to their usual closed and distant personalities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2012/04/18/150891711/for-elders-with-dementia-music-sparks-great-awakenings&lt;/ref&gt; The patients have been shown to sing and perk up, even cry out of pure joy of the music that they loved in their youth. After the patients listen to their music they were interviewed and actually engaged, because of how happy the music had made them. The patients talked about how much they loved the music and the memories that the music invoked.&lt;ref name="hsrd.research.va.gov"/&gt;

====Stress and music in the medical field====

The use of music as a coping strategy also has applications in the medical field. For example, patients who listen to music during surgery or post-operative recovery have been shown to have less stress than their counterparts who do not listen to music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Normalization of Hypertensive Responses During Ambulatory Surgical Stress by Perioperative Music | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 487–492 | pmid = 11382277 | doi=10.1097/00006842-200105000-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that the family members and parents of the patient had reduced stress levels when listening to music while waiting, and can even reduce their anxiety for the surgery results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of music has also been proven effective in pediatric oncology.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne B. Hanser and Jayne M. Standley (1995). “Music Therapy Research and Applications in Pediatric Oncology Treatment”. ''The Journal of Pediatric Oncological Nursing'' 12. http://jpo.sagepub.com/content/12/1/3.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy is mainly used in these cases as a diversion technique, [[play therapy]], designed to distract the patient from the pain or stress experienced during these operations. The focus of the patient is directed at a more pleasurable activity and the mind shifts toward that activity creating a “numbing” effect founded on an “out of sight, out of mind” type approach. This can even transcend to elderly patients in nursing homes and adult day care centers. Music therapy in these places have shown reductions in elder aggression and agitated moods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, because several of these studies rely mainly on patient responses,  some concerns have been raised as to the strength of the correlation between music and stress reduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thoma | first1 = MV | last2 = La Marca | first2 = R | last3 = Brönnimann | first3 = R | last4 = Finkel | first4 = L | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = The Effect of Music on the Human Stress Response | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 8| page = e70156 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0070156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music as a form of coping has been used multiple times in cancer patients, with promising results.  A study done on 113 patients going through stem cell transplants split the patients into two group; one group made their own lyrics about their journey and then produced a music video, and the other group listened to audiobooks.  The results of the study showed that the music video group had better coping skills and better social interactions in comparison, by taking their mind of the pain and stress accompanying treatment, and giving them an outlet to express their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancercenter.com/discussions/blog/music-plays-a-role-in-cancer-coping-skills/|title=Music plays a role in cancer coping skills, study finds {{!}} CTCA|website=www.cancercenter.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done at UNC showed remarkable improvement in a young girl who was born without the ability to speak.  A therapist would come in and sing with her, as the only thing she could do was sing.  Miraculously, the singing allowed to her gain the ability of speech, as music and speech are similar in nature and help the brain form new connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.unc.edu/www/newsarchive/2011/june/music-therapy-helps-patients-cope-with-illness-regain-health|title=Music therapy helps patients cope with illness, regain health — UNC School of Medicine|website=www.med.unc.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same hospital, the therapist visits children daily and plays music with them, singing and using instruments.  The music fosters creativity and reduces stress associated with treatments, and takes the children's minds off of their current surroundings.

It also cannot be ignored the importance of coping strategies in families and caregivers of those going through serious and even terminal illness.  These family members are often responsible for a vast majority of the care of their loved ones, on top of the stress of seeing them struggle.  Therapists have worked with these family members, singing and playing instruments, to help them take their minds off of the stress of helping their loved ones undergo treatment.  Just like in the patients themselves, the music therapy has been shown to help them cope with the intense emotions and situations they deal with on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trauma.blog.yorku.ca/2011/12/families-coping-with-terminal-illness-through-music/|title=Families Coping with Terminal Illness through Music|website=trauma.blog.yorku.ca|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological findings===

Other studies, which use more invasive techniques to measure the response of individuals to stress, demonstrate that the use of music can mitigate many of the physiological effects often associated with the stress response - such as a lowering of blood pressure or a decrease in heart rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labbé, Elise, Nicholas Schmidt, and Jonathan Babin. "Coping with Stress: The Effectiveness of Different Types of Music." ''Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback'' 32.3-4 (2007): 163-68. http://search.proquest.com/docview/228042909&lt;/ref&gt; Most research associated with the use of music as a coping strategy makes use of empirical measurements through devices like an EKG or heart rate monitor in order to provide a stronger correlation between music and its proposed effects on the stress response.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In these studies, subjects are typically exposed to a stressor and then assigned music to listen to, while the parties conducting the study measure changes in the subjects' physiological status.

Some studies, using more invasive physiological research methods, have demonstrated that the use of sedative music or preferred sedative music cause a decrease in tension and state-anxiety levels of adult individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jiang | first1 = Jun | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = The effects of sedative and stimulative music on stress reduction depend on music preference | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197455613000725 | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 201–205 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in tension or feeling of anxiety is more prevalent and noticeable in the attempt to return to [[homeostasis]], and shows far less effectiveness during the actual stressful event.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other studies expose their subjects to an immediate physical stressor, such as running on a treadmill, while having them listen to different genres of music. These studies have shown that the respiratory rates of the participants are increased when they listen to faster, upbeat music while running in comparison to no music or sedative music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownley | first1 = Kimberly | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = Effects of music on physiological and affective responses to graded treadmill exercise in trained and untrained runners | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016787609500007F | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 193–201 | doi=10.1016/0167-8760(95)00007-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the raised respiratory frequency caused by the initial stressor "running" music still had a noticeable physiological effect on the participants.

By and large, a collective review of these studies shows that music can be effective in reducing physiological effects that stress has on the human body. This can be anywhere from changing pulse rates, breathing rates, to even decreasing the occurrence of fatigue. This can even be seen in different tempo's and pitch, such as low pitch creates a relatively calming effect on the body whereas high pitch tends to generate stressors for the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dawn Kent. "Effect of Music on the Human Mind and Body." Web. 10 Apr. 2016. &lt;http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162&amp;context=honors&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been suggested that if a patient can control the music that he or she listens to in the recovery process, then the return to normalcy happens at a much faster, more efficient rate than if the subject was assigned a music genre that he or she did not find appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Labbé, Elise, Nicholas Schmidt, and Jonathan Babin. "Coping with Stress: The Effectiveness of Different Types of Music." Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback 32.3-4 (2007): 163-68. Coping with Stress: The Effectiveness of Different Types of Music. Web. 21 Apr. 2015. .&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of the EKG monitor and other empirical methods of study, researchers are able to remove the superficial qualities associated with patient response-based findings and provide a more substantial correlation between the use of music and the its effects on the human stress response.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Specific techniques==

One particular technique that uses music as a coping strategy is choosing and listening to music genres that have been shown to correlate with lower levels of stress. For example, it has been suggested that listening to classical music or self-selected music can lower stress levels in adult individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Music that is fast, heavy or even dark in nature may produce an increase in these same stress levels, however many people also find the cathartic effects of music to be intensified with the listening of music that is intense in such a way. Ambient music is a genre of music that is often associated with feelings of calmness or introspectiveness. While listening to self-selected genres, an individual is provided with a sense of control after choosing the type of music he or she would like to listen to. In certain situations, this choice can be one of the few moments where stressed and depressed individuals feel a locus of control over their respective lives. Introducing the feeling of control can be a valuable asset as the individual attempts to cope with his or her stress.

With that in mind, there are a few specific techniques specifically involving the use of music that have been suggested to aid in the reduction of stress and stress-related effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanser | first1 = Suzanne B. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Larry W. | year = | title = Effects of a Music Therapy Strategy on Depressed Older Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 49 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Listening to softer genres such as classical music.
* Listening to music of one's choice and introducing an element of control to one's life.
* Listening to music that reminds one of pleasant memories.
* Avoiding music that reminds one of sad or depressing memories.
* Listening to music as a way of bonding with a social group.

Another specific technique that can be used is the utilization of music as a “memory time machine” of sorts. In this regard, music can allow one to escape to pleasant or unpleasant memories and trigger a coping response. It has been suggested that music can be closely tied to re-experiencing the psychological aspects of past memories, so selecting music with positive connotations is one possible way that music can reduce stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanser | first1 = Suzanne B. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Larry W. | year = | title = Effects of a Music Therapy Strategy on Depressed Older Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 49 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A  technique that is starting to be employed more often is vibroacoustic therapy. During therapy the patient lies on his/her back on a mat with speakers within it that send out low frequency sound waves, essentially sitting on a subwoofer. This therapy has been found to help with Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, and depression. Studies are also being conducted on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease in hopes to identify possible benefits from vibroacoustic therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music.aspx|title=Music as medicine|website=http://www.apa.org|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibroacoustic therapy can also be used as an alternative to music therapy for the deaf. 

==Controversies==

Several of the empirical studies carried out to demonstrate the correlation between listening to music and the reduction in the human stress response have been criticized for relying too heavily on a small sample size.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Another criticism of these studies is that they have been carried out in response to no stressor in particular. These critics claim that because no specific stressor is identified in many of these studies, it is somewhat difficult to identify whether the stress response was lessened by music or by some other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelletier | first1 = Cori L. | year = 2004 | title = The Effect of Music on Decreasing Arousal Due to Stress: A Meta-Analysis." The | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 192–214 | doi=10.1093/jmt/41.3.192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more theoretical critique of this coping strategy is that the use of music in stress coping is largely a short-term coping response and therefore lacks long-term sustainability. These critics argue that while music may be effective in lowering perceived stress levels of patients, it is not necessarily making a difference on the actual cause of the stress response.&lt;ref&gt;M. Iwanaga et al. (1996). “The effects of repetitive exposure to music on subjective and physiological responses”. The Journal of Music: 33 (219-230).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the root cause of the stress is not affected, it is possible that the stress response may return shortly after therapy is ended. Those who hold this position advocate instead for a more problem-focused coping strategy that directly deals with the stressors affecting the patient.

==Conclusion==

The use of music as a stress coping strategy has a demonstrated effect on the human response to stress. The use of music has been proven to lower the perceived levels of stress in patients, while greatly reducing the physical manifestations of stress as well– such as heart rate, blood pressure, or levels of stress hormones. It seems as though different types of music have different effects on stress levels, with classical and self-selected genres being the most effective. However, despite demonstrated effectiveness in empirical studies, there are many who still question the effectiveness of this coping strategy. Nevertheless, it is still an attractive option for some patients who want an easy and inexpensive way to respond to stress.

'''Necroptosis''' is a programmed form of [[necrosis]], or inflammatory cell death. Conventionally, necrosis is associated with unprogrammed cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via [[apoptosis]]. The discovery of necroptosis showed that cells can execute necrosis in a programmed fashion and that apoptosis is not always the preferred form of cell death. Furthermore, the immunogenic nature of necroptosis favors its participation in certain circumstances, such as aiding defense pathogens by the [[immune system]]. Necroptosis is well defined as a viral defense mechanism, allowing the cell to undergo "cellular suicide" in a caspase-independent fashion in the presence of viral [[caspase]] inhibitors to restrict virus replication.&lt;ref name="Vanden_Berghe_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanden Berghe T, Linkermann A, Jouan-Lanhouet S, Walczak H, Vandenabeele P | title = Regulated necrosis: the expanding network of non-apoptotic cell death pathways | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–47 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24452471 | doi = 10.1038/nrm3737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a response to disease, necroptosis has also been characterized as a component of inflammatory diseases such as [[Crohn's disease]], [[pancreatitis]], and [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref name="Günther_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Günther C, Martini E, Wittkopf N, Amann K, Weigmann B, Neumann H, Waldner MJ, Hedrick SM, Tenzer S, Neurath MF, Becker C | title = Caspase-8 regulates TNF-α-induced epithelial necroptosis and terminal ileitis | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7364 | pages = 335–9 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21921917 | pmc = 3373730 | doi = 10.1038/nature10400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkermann_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linkermann A, Green DR | title = Necroptosis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 5 | pages = 455–65 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24476434 | pmc = 4035222 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1310050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signaling pathway responsible for carrying out necroptosis is generally understood. [[TNFα]] leads to stimulation of its receptor TNFR1. TNFR1 binding protein TNFR-associated death protein [[TRADD]] and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 [[TRAF2]] signals to [[RIPK1]] which recruits RIPK3 forming the necrosome also named [[wikidata:Q21100386|ripoptosome]].&lt;ref name="Vanden_Berghe_2014" /&gt; Phosphorylation of [[Mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase|MLKL]] by the ripoptosome drives oligomerization of MLKL, allowing MLKL to insert into and permeabilize plasma membranes and organelles.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang H, Sun L, Su L, Rizo J, Liu L, Wang LF, Wang FS, Wang X | title = Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein MLKL causes necrotic membrane disruption upon phosphorylation by RIP3 | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–146 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24703947 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Su_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Su L, Quade B, Wang H, Sun L, Wang X, Rizo J | title = A plug release mechanism for membrane permeation by MLKL | journal = Structure | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1489–500 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25220470 | pmc = 4192069 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2014.07.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration of MLKL leads to the inflammatory phenotype and release of [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)]], which elicit immune responses.

== Function ==

Necroptosis is specific to vertebrates and may have originated as an additional defense to pathogens. Necroptosis also acts as an alternative "fail-safe" cell death pathway in cases where cells are unable to undergo apoptosis, such as during viral infection in which apoptosis signaling proteins are blocked by the virus.

=== In innate immunity ===

Cell suicide is an effective means of stemming the spread of a pathogen throughout an organism. In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by [[phagocytosis]]. Some pathogens, such as [[human cytomegalovirus]], express [[caspase]] inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell.&lt;ref name="Mocarski_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mocarski ES, Upton JW, Kaiser WJ | title = Viral infection and the evolution of caspase 8-regulated apoptotic and necrotic death pathways | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 79–88 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22193709 | pmc = 4515451 | doi = 10.1038/nri3131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.

[[Toll-like receptors]] (TLRs) can also signal to the necrosome, leading to necroptosis. TLRs are a class of receptors that function in the innate immune system to recognize conserved components of pathogens, such as flagellin.&lt;ref name="Vanden_Berghe_2014" /&gt;

=== In contrast to apoptosis ===

In [[apoptosis]], extrinsic signaling via cell surface receptors or intrinsic signaling by release of [[cytochrome c]] from [[mitochondria]] leads to caspase activation. Proteolytic degradation of the cell's interior culminates with the packaging of the cell's remains into apoptotic bodies, which are degraded and recycled by [[phagocytosis]]. Unlike in apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis do not involve caspase activation. Necrotic cell death culminates in leakage of cell contents into the extracellular space, in contrast to the organized disposal of cellular contents into apoptotic bodies.&lt;ref name= "Vandenabeele_2010" &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandenabeele P, Galluzzi L, Vanden Berghe T, Kroemer G | title = Molecular mechanisms of necroptosis: an ordered cellular explosion | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 700–14 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20823910 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

As in all forms of necrotic cell death, cells undergoing necroptosis rupture and leak their contents into the intercellular space. Unlike in necrosis, permeabilization of the cell membrane during necroptosis is tightly regulated. While many of these mechanisms and components of the pathway are still being uncovered, the major steps of necroptotic signaling have been outlined in recent years. First, extrinsic stimulus through the TNF receptor by TNFα signals the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) which in turn recruits [[RIPK1]]. In the absence of active Caspase 8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 auto- and transphosphorylate each other, leading to the formation of a microfilament-like complex called the necrosome.&lt;ref name="Vanden_Berghe_2014" /&gt; The necrosome then activates the pro-necroptotic protein [[Mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase|MLKL]] via phosphorylation. MLKL actuates the necrosis phenotype by inserting into the bilipid membranes of organelles and plasma membrane leading to expulsion of cellular contents into the extracellular space.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Su_2014" /&gt; The inflammatory rupturing of the cell releases Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. Many of these DAMPs remain unidentified, however, the "find me" and "eat me" DAMP signals are known to recruit immune cells to the damaged/infected tissue.&lt;ref name="Vandenabeele_2010" /&gt; Necrotic cells are cleared from the immune system by a mechanism called [[pinocytosis]], or cellular drinking, which is mediated by macropinosomes, a subcellular component of macrophages. This process is in contrast to removal of apoptotic cells by the immune system in which cells are removed via phagocytosis, or cellular eating.

=== Co-Regulation of necroptosis and apoptosis ===
Recent studies have shown substantial interplay between the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. At multiple stages of their respective signalling cascades, the two pathways can regulate each other. The best characterized example of this co-regulation is the ability of caspase 8 to inhibit the formation of the necrosome by cleaving RIPK1. Conversely, caspase 8 inhibition of necroptosis can be bypassed by the necroptotic machinery through the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIP which inactivates caspase 8 through formation of a heterodimer.&lt;ref name="Linkermann_2014" /&gt;

Many components of the two pathways are also shared. The Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor can signal for both apoptosis and necroptosis. The RIPK1 protein can also signal for both apoptosis and necroptosis depending on post-translational modifications mediated by other signalling proteins. Furthermore, RIPK1 can be regulated by cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1, cIAP2) which polyubiquitinate RIPK1 leading to cell survival through downstream [[NF-kB]] signalling. cIAP1 and cIAP2 can also be regulated by the pro-apoptotic protein SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) which can cleave cIAP1 and cIAP2 driving the cell towards an apoptotic death.&lt;ref name="Vanden_Berghe_2014" /&gt;

=== Targeting of organelles ===

Cells can undergo necroptosis in response to perturbed [[homeostasis]] in specific circumstances. In response to [[DNA damage]], the RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated and lead to deterioration of the cell in the absence of caspase activation. The necrosome inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria to decrease cellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] levels.&lt;ref name="Vandenabeele_2010" /&gt; Uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to additional mitochondrial damage and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which releases mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol. The necrosome also causes leakage of lysosomal digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm by induction of reactive oxygen species by JNK, sphingosine production, and calpain activation by calcium release.

== Medical relevance ==

Necroptosis has been implicated in the pathology of many types of acute tissue damage, including myocardinal infarction, stroke, ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, necroptosis is noted to contribute to atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, neurodegeneration, and some cancers.&lt;ref name="Zhou_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou W, Yuan J | title = Necroptosis in health and diseases | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = 35 | pages = 14–23 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25087983 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.07.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In solid-organ transplantation, [[ischemia-reperfusion injury]] can occur when blood returns to tissue for the first time in the transplant recipient. A major contributor to tissue damage results from activation of regulated necroptosis, which could include contributions from both necroptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition. Treatment with the drug [[cyclosporine]], which represses the mitochondrial permeability transition effector Cyclophilin D, improves tissue survival primarily by inhibiting necrotic cell death, rather than its additional function as an immunosuppressant.&lt;ref name="Linkermann_2014" /&gt;

=== Necroptosis based-therapy ===
Recently, necroptosis-based cancer therapy, using a distinctive molecular pathway for regulation of necroptosis, has been suggested as an alternative method to overcome apoptosis-resistance. For instance, necroptotic cells release highly immunogenic [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|DAMP]]s, initiating [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]]. These dying cells can also activate [[NF-κB]] to express [[cytokine]]s, recruiting [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="Razaghi_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Heimann K, Schaeffer PM, Gibson SB | title = Negative regulators of cell death pathways in cancer: perspective on biomarkers and targeted therapies | journal = Apoptosis | pages = 1–20 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29322476 | doi = 10.1007/s10495-018-1440-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}} little is known about [[negative regulator]]s of necroptosis, but [[STUB1|CHIP]], [[CFLAR|cFLIP]] and [[FADD]] appear to be potential targets for necroptosis based therapy.&lt;ref name="Razaghi_2018" /&gt;

The Neighbour-Sensing mathematical model of hyphal growth is a set of interactive computer models that simulate the way [[fungal|fungi]] hyphae grow in three-dimensional space. The three-dimensional simulation is an experimental tool which can be used to study the [[morphogenesis]] of fungal hyphal networks. 

The modelling process starts from the proposition that each [[hypha]] in the fungal [[mycelium]] generates a certain abstract field that (like known physical fields) decrease with increasing distance. Both scalar and vector fields are included in the models. The field(s) and its (their) gradient(s) are used to inform the algorithm that calculates the likelihood of branching, the angle of branching and the growth direction of each hyphal tip in the simulated mycelium. The growth vector is being informed of its surroundings so, effectively, the virtual hyphal tip is sensing the neighbouring mycelium. This is why we call it the Neighbour-Sensing model.

Cross-walls in living hyphae are formed only at right angles to the long axis of the hypha. A daughter hyphal apex can only arise if a branch is initiated. So, for the fungi, hyphal branch formation is the equivalent of cell division in animals, plants and protists. The position of origin of a branch, and its direction and rate of growth are the main formative events in the development of fungal tissues and organs. Consequently, by simulating the mathematics of the control of hyphal growth and branching the Neighbour-Sensing model provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may regulate hyphal growth patterns during morphogenesis to arrive at suggestions that could be tested with live fungi.

The model was proposed by Audrius Meškauskas and David Moore in 2004 and developed using the [[supercomputing]] facilities of the [[University of Manchester]].
The key idea of this model is that all parts of the fungal mycelium have identical field generation systems, field sensing mechanisms and growth direction altering algorithms. Under properly chosen model parameters it is possible to observe the transformation of the initial unordered mycelium structure into various forms, some of them being very like natural fungal fruit bodies and other complex structures.

In one of the simplest examples, it is assumed that the hyphal tips try to keep a 45 degree orientation with relation to the Earth’s gravity vector field, and also generate some kind of scalar field that the growing tips try to avoid. This combination of parameters leads to development of hollow conical structures, similar to the fruit bodies of some primitive fungi.

[[Image:Neighbour Sensing model cords.jpg|thumb|250px|left|After changing the parameter set, the initially chaotic formation (in the center) starts forming cords]]

In another example, the hypha generates a vector field parallel to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After more tips turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, it is possible to observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature.
The parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock.
The Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the ‘crowd behaviour’ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.

'''Nichol Haworth "Nick" Muller''' (10 September 1914 – 19 May 1947) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

==Career==
Muller, from [[North Geelong Football Club|North Geelong]], made three VFL appearances for Geelong early in the [[1936 VFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmesby|first1=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781920910785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/1936.html#9| title=1936 Stats| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He didn't play a senior game in 1937, but was a member of the Geelong seconds premiership team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongcats.com.au/club/history/premierships/reserves| title=Reserves| publisher=Geelong Football Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, [[Angie Muller]], played in Geelong's senior premiership that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1937/040919370925.html| title=Geelong V Collingwood| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 he joined [[Warrnambool Football Club|Warrnambool]] in the [[Hampden Football League]] and ended the year with another premiership.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Camperdown Chronicle]]'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/22998797 "Hampden League Prospects"], 6 May 1939, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Camperdown Chronicle]]'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/27399375 "Hampden League Pennant"], 26 September 1939, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Geelong in 1940 and played seven games, including their semi-final loss to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], which would be his final appearance at VFL level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/1940.html#9| title=1940 Stats| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Muller died on 19 May 1947, aged 32.&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/22448382 "Source of poisoning remains unsolved"], 2 August 1947, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/players/player/nick%2Bmuller/6024|title=Nick Muller – Player Bio|publisher=Australian Football|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquest found that he had died from [[nicotine poisoning]]. It was unclear how he had ingested nicotine, as he was a non smoker and hadn't been using any insecticide.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;

'''''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991''''' is a book written by [[Jeff Goodwin]].&lt;ref name="Voice of Russia - 31Dec2011 - 2011: Year of worldwide protests "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/12/31/63180970/|title=2011: Year of worldwide protests |last=Russell-Sluchansky |first=Carmen|date=31 December 2011|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It analyzes revolutions through the state-centered perspective.

==Comparing Revolutionary Movements==
In ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991'', 
Goodwin offers another comparative study on revolutions focusing on the second half of the twentieth century from 1914 to 1991.  According to 
Goodwin, “revolutionary movements are not simply or exclusively a response to economic exploitation or inequality, but also and more directly a response to political oppression and violence, typically brutal and indiscriminate”. This idea is Goodwin’s main thesis throughout the book and he further expands on it. Goodwin believes that understanding revolutions is “worthwhile  not only because of the enormous importance of these movements for the national societies in which they occurred,  but also for their effects on the configuration of power and beliefs in other societies and thus on the international balance of power as well".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Jeff Goodwin]]|title=No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=4 June 2001|isbn=978-0521629485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparative study on revolutions is worthwhile because it is different from all the others that exist. First, Goodwin uses a unique set of revolutions and revolutionary movements to analyze, making this analysis interesting and very instructive. Second, Goodwin analyzes not only those revolutions that were successful; he also includes failed revolutionary movements that did not succeed. By analyzing these failed revolutions, Goodwin is able to analyze the reasons why some revolutions occur and others simply deteriorate. Goodwin’s goal for his analysis on revolutions is “to discover the general causal mechanics that do the most to explain the origins and trajectory of several important revolutionary movements".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Before beginning to analyze revolutions Goodwin’s guess is that, “the diverse political fortunes of the revolutionary movements in peripheral societies during this era were not fortuitous nor randomly distributed, but were the result of general causal mechanisms” &lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}}
(2001:8).

===Defining Terms===
Goodwin offers a definition of several important key terms that he will use throughout his analysis. To commence, he acknowledges that there are two different definitions for revolutions. For the first definition, the term revolution can “refer to any and all instances in which a state or political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extra constitutional, and/or violent fashion” (Goodwin 2009:9) With this interpretation, there needs to be a mobilization of people against the state. The second definition states that “revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic, and/or cultural change during or soon after the struggle for state power” (Goodwin 2001:8). Goodwin chooses the concept from the concept of the first revolution since it is more general and includes many more revolutionary movements.

Goodwin also defines other important terms that will be essential to his theory. Political context is defined as, “the ways in which a national society, or some component of it, is governed and regulated by, has access to, and otherwise relates to the national state as well as to the larger state system” (Goodwin 2001: 14). To Goodwin, political concept is the single most important factor that explains the formation and fate of revolutionary movements. Lastly he defines peripheral state as “a state whose power and projects are more or less strictly determine or at least very tightly constrained by a much more powerful ‘core’ or ‘metropolitan’ state within the state system” (Goodwin 2001:14). Throughout his theory, Goodwin will use these terms in order to further his argument and it is essential to define them correctly.

===Theoretical Approaches to Revolutionary Movements===
Before Goodwin offers his own theory on revolutions, he first discusses two other popular theories, the modernization theory and the Marxist theory. The “modernization theory links revolutions to the transitions from traditional to modern societies, that is, to the very process of modernization itself” (Goodwin 2001:17). Those who believe in the Marxist theory, “view revolutions as occurring in ‘transitional’ societies- only in this case transition which is seen as the result of class struggle, is from one economic mode of production to another” (Goodwin 2001:19-20).  Goodwin believes that both of these theories, although not completely wrong, fail to completely analyze the political concept in which they are made. In addition to that there is a lot of disagreement in these theories that makes them less reliable.

The State-Centered Perspective
When studying revolutions, Goodwin places the focus on states, also known as the state-centered perspective. He focuses on the state because of two main reasons. The first is that any successful revolution will cause the breakdown or incapacitation of the state. The second reason is that “strong revolutionary movements, even if they ultimately fail to seize state power, will emerge only in opposition to states that are configured and that act in certain ways” (Goodwin 2001: 25) There are two reasons why the development of revolutionary movements is dependent on the state. Primarily, people will not support revolutionary movements unless they feel that the state is at fault for their everyday problems. The second reason is that individuals will not join revolutionary movements if they feel that doing so will only lead to more violence from the state. This second reason introduces another idea of people not joining revolutions unless they feel they have no other way out, which is exactly the title of the book. 
	
	Goodwin concludes in No Other Way Out that certain states lead to revolutions while others do not. According to him the formation of revolutionary movement in the periphery has been mainly caused by the “subset of violence and exclusionary authoritarian states that are also organizational incoherent and military weak” (Goodwin 2001: 26). Although there are many more factors that lead to revolutions, Goodwin’s main focus is on the state itself. The state itself is at the center of his analysis since according to him the state-centered perspective is the most powerful tool when analyzing revolutions

Four Types of State- Centered Analysis
	There are four approaches to the state-centered analysis which are the state- autonomy, the state-capacity, the political-opportunity, and the state-constructionism. All four of these approaches emphasize a set of causal mechanisms which are “those processes whereby states shape, enable, or constrain economic, associational, cultural, and even social-psychological phenomena” (Goodwin 2001: 36).  The state-autonomy perspective emphasizes on the autonomy of the state officials from the dominant social class. This dominant class includes politicians and military officials, among others, and they sometimes develop interests that are opposing to those interests of the popular will. The state-capacity approach focuses on the material and organizational capacity of the state officials’ political agenda. The political-opportunity approach on the other hand “emphasizes how the apparent tolerance, or responsiveness of states or “polities” influences the ability of mobilized social groups to act collectively and/or to influence state policies” (Goodwin 2001: 38).  Lastly, the state-constructionism approach focuses on how the states share and alter the identities, goals, and ideas of actors in civil society.

Analytic Strengths of State-Centered Approaches to Revolution 
	Goodwin argues that his statist approach is imperative when solving key problems of the study of revolutions. This state-centered analysis has much strength that makes it the best tools for analyzing revolutions. Revolutions are phenomenons that are fairly modern and have occurred with much more frequency in the twentieth century. Many have asked themselves why revolutions became more frequent in the twentieth century and the state-centered perspective answers this question. The answer is that revolutions need states to occur and this international state system that is present now thus makes revolutions much more frequent. This is not the only question that this statist perspective is able to answer. The state-centered perspective is able to answer why radical movements are concerned with destroying and seizing state power. Following this is also the question as to why it is necessary for the state to break down. This statist perspective also solves the question of why, when, and where revolutions occur. Lastly through this method analysts can figure out why some groups are able to attract much support and others are not. Through the state-centered perspectives all of these questions are answered in the analysis of revolutions.

	Goodwin believes that there are certain characteristics from states that make revolutionary movement more likely to develop. The first characteristic is that the state not only protects but also sponsors unpopular economic and social arrangements as well as cultural institutions. Another main characteristic is the repression and exclusion of mobilized groups from state power or resources. States where revolutions are more likely to develop also are indiscriminate and violent towards mobilized oppositional groups and figures. States that have weak policing capacities and infrastructural power are also more likely to produce revolutions. Lastly states that are characterized by a, “corrupt and arbitrary personalistic rule that alienates, weakens, or divides counterrevolutionary elites,” are more likely to develop revolutionary movements (Goodwin 2001: 49).

Critiques and Limitations of State-Centered Approaches 
	Goodwin acknowledges that there are many criticisms to his state-centered perspective on revolutions, but he argues that these critiques make unrealistic assumptions and they are completely unreliable. One of these critiques is that societies affect states just as much as states affect societies. Goodwin argues how even though states are not the only things that affect revolutions, and there are certainly other factors, they do tend to be at the center of the whole process and that is why they are at the center of the analysis. Another criticism states that in reality state officials are not the autonomous actors and they in fact are just being driven by the dominant class, challenging the state-autonomy approach. Again Goodwin disagrees with this claim as well as the other two critiques. One being that the state-centered analysis ignores the purpose and cultural dimensions of social action and the last one being that the distinction between states and societies is indefensible and should be eliminated. Although Goodwin disagrees with the critiques to the statist perspective he chooses to analyze revolutions, he does in fact acknowledge that there are certain limitation to this approach. Even though some limitations do exist, Goodwin argues that there are certain solutions to these. The main limitation in the state-centered perspective is that it fails to theorize sources that are not political or from the state. However even though this may be the case Goodwin argues that the state-centered perspective is still the best method for analyzing revolutions.

The Case of The Cuban Revolution 
The Cuban Revolution is a clear example that not only shows the strengths of the 
state-centered perspective, it also shows its limitations. Goodwin explains how in Cuba there were two main reasons as to why Cuba was susceptible to a radical revolution. The first reason was the weakness of Cuba’s clases economicas and the second was its strength of it clases populares or popular sectors. The Cuban state was also characterized by its “mediated sovereignty” and a “near-chronic crisis of political authority” (Goodwin 2001:60). Although the state had a lot to do in the Cuban revolution, this event was also marked by the mobilization of the masses. This is one of the reasons why the state-centered perspective is limited; it fails to analyze certain aspects of the revolution that were very important. On the other hand Goodwin argues that the Cuban revolution needs to be analyzed in different forms in order to fully explain it since no one theory alone can fully analyze any revolution.

The Formation of Revolutionary Movements in Southeast Asia
	Southeast Asia circa 1950 was a very important time in history in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia was defined during this time by seven regional similarities. This region was defined by Western conquest and colonial rule, it had an integration of local economics into the capitalist world system, and it was marked by its development of widespread social grievances and social protests. In addition to these similarities, this region was defined by its formation of reformist and revolutionary parties and movements, the Japanese occupation and privations of World War II, the formation of anti-Japanese resistance movements, and lastly it was defined by the Western colonial powers’ attempt to reassert their dominance over Southeast Asia after the war.

	After World War II, many dominating countries wanted to assert back their power on Southeast Asia, yet they were greeted by resistance. By the year 1950 there were several mass-based Communist movements that were challenging colonial and neocolonial regions in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines. By contrast, the Indonesian struggle, which is seen by Goodwin as a political revolution, had already been won by non-Communist “populist” nationalists. Indonesian is a rare case and there are many explanations for what caused this anti-communism ideology. One main factor is the Japanese rule in Indonesia that ultimately brought many Indonesians into the middle class and liberated many popular non-communist nationalist leaders, thus spreading the dislike for communism.  This anti-communism ideology was not caused solely by economic, class, or cultural factors; it was the cause of circumstances “of a highly contingent character” (Goodwin 2001:89). In order to fully analyze the situation in Southeast Asia Goodwin goes on to use the state-centered perspective come up with answers and patterns to these revolutionary movements in Southeast Asia.
	

The Only Domino: The Vietnamese Revolution in Comparative Perspective
	In Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, many colonial regions were in the process of revolutionary movements. The outcome was of course very different in every region and Goodwin states that in order to analyze these different outcomes the state-centered perspective is the best tool to do so. Goodwin argues that “two political variables, against a general backdrop of colonial rule, widespread socioeconomic problems, and Japanese occupation, determined whether strong Communist-led national movements would form and take power in Southeast Asia” (2001:130-131). The formation and fate of the communist party therefore depended one two variables. One was “whether the Japanese relied upon Europeans or existing indigenous elites on the one hand, or sponsored populist nationalists on the other” (Goodwin 2001:131). The second variable is whether the rule of Western powers was inclusionary and reformist. Goodwin creates a figure that clearly shows the steps and outcomes of every possibility thus providing a generalization to the events in Southeast Asia.

Conclusion 
	The state-centered perspective is the strongest and most efficient tool when analyzing revolutions. States are ultimately an important factor that in all the cases determines the fate of the revolutionary movement and it also explains why revolutionary movements have different outcomes in different situations. According to Goodwin, “states powerfully determine the precise ways in which a range of other factors may contribute to both the mobilization and impact of revolutionary movements. He goes on to argue that, “a state-centered approach, in sum, is important not just or even mainly because of the importance of state breakdowns or political opportunities for seizures of power by preexisting movements, but also because the very formation and strength of revolutionary movements vis-a-vis other political challengers are strongly shaped by the ways in which political authorities rule and respond to challengers” (Goodwin 2001:133). State power, and its use, constructs the possibilities and outcomes for revolutionary movements, and that is why they must be at the center of the study of revolutions.

The '''North West 200''' is a [[motorcycling]] race meeting held each May in [[Northern Ireland]]. It is held in a {{convert|8.970|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[road course]] between the towns of [[Portstewart]], [[Coleraine]] and [[Portrush]] in [[Causeway Coast and Glens]]. The course, known as ''the Triangle'', is one of the fastest in the world, with average speeds of {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and top speeds in excess of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fastest&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/8676403.stm|title=Honda rider Steve Plater fastest at NW200 practice|agency=BBC|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North West 200 is one of around fifteen events run on public roads between April and October throughout Northern Ireland. It is the largest annual sporting event in Northern Ireland, with the race weekend attracting over 150,000 visitors from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-may-2009/news-doe-140509-other-motorists-have.htm  Other motorists have responsibility for bikers too, campaign warns] Northern Ireland Executive Website 14 May 2009 Retrieved 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1964 the event has been organised by the [[Coleraine and District Motor Club]]. In 2010, the meeting featured daytime practice on the Thursday for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northwest200.org/news_article/103.aspx|title=Local People Urged to Support new NW200 Daytime Practice Session|agency=North West 200 Website|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520080114/http://www.northwest200.org/news_article/103.aspx|archivedate=20 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011 North West 200 Races|2011]] event took place on Saturday 21 May. There were significant delays due to a hoax bomb alert and then an extensive oil spill on the track caused racing to be cancelled after the completion of only one race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= North West 200 racing abandoned|agency=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/13467100.stm|work=BBC Sport |date= 21 May 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race format==
[[File:North West 200 Juniper 2009.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several motorcycle riders racing on a public road|Riders approaching York from Juniper Hill during the 2009 event.]]
The North West 200 was originally run over two hundred miles as a handicap race, before changing to its current format of several separate races, each running 4–6 laps during Saturday afternoon. Practice is held on the Tuesday and Thursday evenings before the race. Both the practice and races are held on closed roads, but unlike the [[Isle of Man TT]] races which are run in a [[time-trial]] format, all riders compete together as with normal circuit racing.

Over the years the number and the classes of races has varied according to the latest regulations. From 1990 until 2010, there was always a 125 cc race and since 1992 the ''North West 200'' race has been for Superbikes.

From 2012, all practice sessions will take place during the day, and the racing programme has been extended to include two races on the Thursday evening. All races will be held over six laps, except for the newly introduced Supertwin event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northwest200.org/news_article_name/relentless-international-north-west-200-revs-up-for-giant-2012.aspx |title=Relentless International North West 200 Revs up for 'Giant' 2012 |agency=North West 200 Website |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317170405/http://www.northwest200.org/news_article_name/relentless-international-north-west-200-revs-up-for-giant-2012.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The course==
The [[street circuit]] is made up almost entirely of public roads (A2, B185 &amp; A29) but does include three speed reducing chicanes. The route, running anti-clockwise enters the outskirts of the towns passing many private houses. To help improve track safety street signs are removed at parts of the track and bales of hay are used to wrap the base of lampposts and telegraph poles.

The circuit is {{convert|8.970|mi|km|abbr=on}} long, with a distance of {{convert|8.834|mi|km|abbr=on}} being covered on the first lap of every race. The original start/finish line was located near Magherabouy but moved to the Portmore Road in Portstewart in 1930. The elevation ranges from {{Convert|6 to 75|m||round=5}} above sea level.
[[File:Metropole Corner Portrush - geograph.org.uk - 335042.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mick Grant]] passes the Railway Bank at Metropole Corner, Portrush, 1975]]

1973 saw the first major changes to the course, which include the exclusion of the Promenade at Portstewart from the route and the moving of the start/finish line to its current location between Juniper Hill and Millbank Avenue. These changes meant the route used Station Road (B185) for the first time and saw the introduction of York Corner. Shell Hill Bridge, an iconic part of the original course was used for the last time in 1979. In 1980, a new link road, from University Corner to Ballysally Roundabout, was introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">A '''physical neural network''' is a type of [[artificial neural network]] in which an electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate the function of a [[chemical synapse|neural synapse]]. "Physical" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate [[neurons]] as opposed to software-based approaches which simulate neural networks. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a [[memristor]] or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.

==Types of physical neural networks==

===ADALINE===
In the 1960s [[Bernard Widrow]] and [[Ted Hoff]] developed [[ADALINE]] (Adaptive Linear Neuron) which used electrochemical cells called [[memistor]]s (memory resistors) to emulate synapses of an artificial neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memistors were implemented as 3-terminal devices operating based on the reversible electroplating of copper such that the resistance between two of the terminals is controlled by the integral of the current applied via the third terminal. The ADALINE circuitry was briefly commercialized by the Memistor Corporation in the 1960s enabling some applications in pattern recognition. However, since the memistors were not fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication techniques the technology was not scalable and was eventually abandoned as solid state electronics became mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Physical Neural Network===

Alex Nugent describes a physical neural network as one or more nonlinear neuron-like nodes used to sum signals and nanoconnections formed from nanoparticles, nanowires, or nanotubes which determine the signal strength input to the nodes.&lt;ref name = KNOWM&gt;{{US Patent|6889216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alignment or self-assembly of the nanoconnections is determined by the history of the applied electric field performing a function analogous to neural synapses. Numerous applications&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=alex&amp;FIELD1=INNM&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=nugent&amp;FIELD2=INNM&amp;d=PTXT U.S. Known Patents]&lt;/ref&gt; for such physical neural networks are possible.  For example, a temporal summation device &lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Patent]] No. [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=17&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=alex.INNM.&amp;s2=nugent.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent&amp;RS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent 7,028,017]&lt;/ref&gt; can be composed of one or more nanoconnections having an input and an output thereof, wherein an input signal provided to the input causes one or more of the nanoconnection to experience an increase in connection strength thereof over time.  Another example of a physical neural network is taught by U.S. Patent No. 7,039,619&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US7039619?pg=PA1&amp;dq=7039619&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GgrAUNLMM-PVyQGbnoDoCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;pjf=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=7039619&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Utilized [[nanotechnology]] apparatus using a neural network, a solution and a connection gap," which issued to Alex Nugent by the [[U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office]] on May 2, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=18&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=alex.INNM.&amp;s2=nugent.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent&amp;RS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent&lt;/ref&gt;

A further application of physical neural network is shown in U.S. Patent No. 7,412,428 entitled "Application of [[hebbian]] and anti-hebbian learning to nanotechnology-based physical neural networks," which issued on August 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=13&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=alex.INNM.&amp;s2=nugent.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent&amp;RS=IN/alex+AND+IN/nugent&lt;/ref&gt;

Nugent and Molter have shown that universal computing and general-purpose machine learning are possible from operations available through simple memristive circuits operating the AHaH plasticity rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085175&lt;/ref&gt;
 
More recently, it has been argued that complex purely memristive circuits can serve as neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caravelli |first1=F. |last2=Traversa |first2=F.

===Phase change neural network===

In 2002, [[Stanford Ovshinsky]] described an analog neural computing medium in which phase change material has the ability to cumulatively respond to multiple input signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|6999953}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electrical alteration of the resistance of the phase change material is used to control the weighting of the input signals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8597">'''Pyrosequencing''' is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] (determining the order of [[nucleotides]] in DNA) based on the "sequencing by synthesis" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a [[DNA polymerase]]. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when [[pyrophosphate]] is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.

The principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Nyren, Petersson and Uhlen (1993) “Solid Phase DNA Minisequencing by an Enzymatic Luminometric Inorganic Pyrophosphate Detection Assay” Analytical Biochemistry 208 (1), 171-175, https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1993.1024&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A8081&amp;dswid=3295#sthash.08HyBugr.dpbs Bertil Pettersson], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]] by combining the [[solid phase sequencing]] method&lt;ref&gt;Uhlen (1989) ”Magnetic separation of DNA”  Nature 340: 733-4, https://doi.org/10.1038/340733a0&lt;/ref&gt; using [[streptavidin]] coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the [[Luciferase|firefly luciferase]] enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;Nyren and Lundin (1985) “Enzymatic method for continuous monitoring of inorganic pyrophosphate synthesis” Analytiocal Biochemistry 151 (2): 504-509.  https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(85)90211-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixture of three [[enzyme]]s ([[DNA polymerase]], [[Sulfate adenylyltransferase|ATP sulfurylase]] and firefly [[luciferase]]) and a nucleotide ([[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTP]]) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.

A second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Ronaghi, Uhlén and Nyrén (1998) ”A sequenbcing method based on real-time pyrophosphate” Science. 281 (5375): 363. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.363  .&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mostafa Ronaghi]], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]]. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme [[apyrase]] is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the [[DNA polymerase]], the [[luciferase]] and the [[apyrase]] to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.

A third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Marguiles et al (2005) “Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors” Nature 437, 376-380.  https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature03959;&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] and co-workers at the company [[454 Life Sciences]]. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[microarray]]. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in [[genomics]] research, with rapidly falling prices for [[DNA sequencing]] allowing [[whole genome sequencing]] at affordable prices.

==Procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QIAGEN|title=Pyrosequencing Technology and Platform Overview|url=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/technologies/pyrosequencing-resource-center/technology-overview/|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[File:How Pyrosequencing Works.svg|alt=How Pyrosequencing Works|thumb|679x679px|The chart shows how pyrosequencing works.]]
"Sequencing by synthesis" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of [[DNA polymerase]] (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another [[chemiluminescence|chemoluminescent]] [[enzyme]].  Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of [[DNA]] by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step.  The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T [[nucleotides]] are sequentially added and removed from the reaction.  Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template.  The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.

For the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA ([[ssDNA#ssDNA|ssDNA]]) template is hybridized to a sequencing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] and incubated with the enzymes [[DNA polymerase]], [[ATP sulfurylase]], [[luciferase]] and [[apyrase]], and with the substrates [[adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate]] (APS) and [[luciferin]].
# The addition of one of the four [[deoxynucleotide triphosphate]]s ([[dNTP]]s) (dATPαS, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi).
# ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program.
# Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the [[apyrase]], and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.

==Limitations==

Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|chain termination]] methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing).  This can make the process of [[genome assembly]] more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of [[repetitive DNA]]. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.

==Commercialization==

The company '''Pyrosequencing AB''' in [[Uppsala, Sweden]] was founded with [[venture capital]] provided by [[HealthCap]] in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 1999. It was renamed to [http://www.biotage.com Biotage] in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by [[Qiagen]] in 2008.  Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to [[454 Life Sciences]]. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|large-scale DNA sequencing]], including [[genome project|genome sequencing]] and [[metagenomics]].

[[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollmer|first1=Mark|title=Roche to close 454 Life Sciences as it reduces gene sequencing focus |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/roche-to-close-454-life-sciences-as-it-reduces-gene-sequencing-focus|work=Fierce Biotech|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PC}} (6 May 1760{{snd}}4 February 1816), styled '''Lord Hobart''' from 1793 to 1804, was a [[UK|British]] [[Tory]] [[politician]].

==Life==
Buckinghamshire was born at [[Hampden House]],{{fact|date=June 2018}} the son of [[George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire]] and [[Albinia Hobart|Albinia]], daughter of [[Lord Vere Bertie]], younger son of [[Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven]]. He was educated at [[Westminster School]], [[London]] and later served in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  He acted as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to successive lord lieutenants of Ireland from 1784 onwards.&lt;ref name=ADNB&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hobart, Robert (1760–1816)|publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hobart-robert-2185/text2813|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===

In 1793 he was invested a member of the [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Council]], and appointed [[Governor of Madras]]. In 1798 he was recalled to England by the [[President of the Board of Control]] responsible for Indian affairs, [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Kenneth|last=Severn|title=Architects of Empire: The Duke of Wellington and His Brothers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8eygq2I6tEC|year=2007|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3810-7|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and summoned to the House of Lords through a [[writ of acceleration]] in his father’s junior title of Baron Hobart. He later served as [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] from 1801 to 1804 when it was said he had "a better grasp of the local or colonial conditions, and a more active spirit than did some of his successors."&lt;ref name=ADNB /&gt; He was [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] in 1805 and again in 1812, [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] from 1806 to 1807 and President of the Board of Control from 1812 to 1816.

'''Sheila Helena Elizabeth Kitzinger''' [[MBE]] (29 March 1929 – 11 April 2015) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[natural childbirth]] activist and author on [[childbirth]] and [[pregnancy]]. She wrote more than 20 books and had a worldwide reputation as a passionate and committed advocate for change. 

== Life and work ==
Kitzinger was born in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]]. She was a [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]] specialising in pregnancy, childbirth and the parenting of babies and young children.  She campaigned for women to have the information they need to make choices about childbirth and was a well known advocate for breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/sheila-kitzinger-1929-to-2015/|title=Sheila Kitzinger, 1929 to 2015 |publisher=The Breastfeeding Network|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the advisory board of the [[National Childbirth Trust]] (NCT) in 1958 as a teacher and trainer.

She held academic posts at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[Open University]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/12/sheila-kitzinger|title=Sheila Kitzinger obituary|last=Hayman|first=Suzie|date=2015-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pioneer-sheila-kitzinger-helped-women-reclaim-control-of-birth/news-story/51556dc3b28c97f7d1e60491c6da9793|title=Pioneer Sheila Kitzinger helped women reclaim control of birth|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an honorary professor at the [[University of West London]], where she taught the MA in [[midwifery]] in the [[Wolfson School of Health Sciences]]. She also taught workshops on the social anthropology of birth and [[breastfeeding]]. She wrote many articles and books and was active in midwifery education in the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.12968/bjom.2016.24.4.234 |title=A legacy from Sheila Kitzinger: Continuity of care is crucial |journal=British Journal of Midwifery |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=234 |year=2016 |last1=Page |first1=Lesley }}&lt;/ref&gt; She lectured widely in the USA and Canada, the Caribbean, Israel, Australia, Latin America, South Africa and Japan and worked as a consultant to the International [[Childbirth Education Association]].  

She was a strong believer that all women who are not at high risk should be given the choice of a [[home birth]]. Her books cover women's experiences of [[breastfeeding]], antenatal care, birth plans, [[Induction (birth)|induction]] of labour, [[epidural]]s, [[episiotomy]], hospital care in childbirth, children's experiences of being present at birth and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress]] following childbirth. Some of her writing was controversial for its time; ''The Good Birth Guide'' (1979) may have caused a rift in her relationship with the NCT&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and she was often at odds with radical feminist views.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/a-passion-for-birth-my-life-anthropology-family-and-feminism-by-sheila-kitzinger-book-review-10254467.html|title=A Passion for Birth: My Life, Anthropology, Family and Feminism, by Sheila Kitzinger, Book review |date=2015-05-16|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Her work is considered influential in changing the culture in which women give birth&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She believed that: "Birth is a major life transition. It is – must be – also a political issue, in terms of the power of the medical system, how it exercises control over women and whether it enables them to make decisions about their own bodies and their babies."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was awarded an MBE in 1982 in recognition of her services to education for childbirth. 

In 1987 she made an extended appearance on television in the first series of [[Channel 4|Channel 4's]] ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.openmedia.co.uk/afterdark1.htm production company website]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electron can always be theoretically considered as a [[bound state]] of the three, with the spinon carrying the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron, the [[orbiton]] carrying the [[Atomic orbital|orbital location]] and the [[Holon (physics)|holon]] carrying the [[Electric charge|charge]], but in certain conditions they can become [[Deconfinement|deconfined]] and behave as independent particles.

The term spinon is frequently used in discussions of experimental facts within the framework of both [[quantum spin liquid]] and [[strongly correlated quantum spin liquid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Amusia, M., Popov, K., Shaginyan, V., Stephanovich, V. | title=Theory of Heavy-Fermion Compounds - Theory of Strongly Correlated Fermi-Systems | volume=182 | publisher=Springer | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-319-10825-4| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10825-4 | series=Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Electrons, being of like charge, repel each other. As a result, in order to move past each other in an extremely crowded environment, they are forced to modify their behavior. Research published in July 2009 by the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Birmingham]] in [[England]] showed that electrons could jump from the surface of the metal onto a closely located [[quantum wire]] by [[quantum tunneling]], and upon doing so, will separate into two [[quasiparticle]]s, named spinons and holons by the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;

The research states that by firing a beam of [[X-ray]] [[photon]]s at a single electron in a one-dimensional sample of strontium [[cuprate]], this will excite the electron to a higher orbital, causing the beam to lose a fraction of its energy in the process. In doing so, the electron will be separated into a spinon and an orbiton. This can be traced by observing the energy and momentum of the X-rays before and after the collision.

'''Sürmeli Ali Pasha''' ({{circa}} 1645 – 29 May 1695) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] statesman who served as  [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1694 to 1695. According to historian [[Joseph von Hammer|von Hammer]], his epithet ''sürmeli'' means "did not know his place," while Uzunçarşılı claims that it more literally means "wearing mascara" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

Ali was born in [[Didymoteicho]] (today in [[East Macedonia and Thrace]], northeastern [[Greece]]). He was a high-ranking bureaucrat, serving in the shipyards and in the treasury. He also served as the governor of [[Ottoman Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Tripoli Eyalet]] (modern-day [[Tripoli, Lebanon]]).

On 13 March 1694, he was appointed as the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] by sultan [[Ahmed II]]. He also took the title ''serdar'', meaning the "commander of the army," and fought against [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. He laid siege to [[Petrovaradin]] (in modern-day [[Serbia]]), but soon lifted it.

On 6 February 1695, Ahmed II died, and after some hesitation, the new sultan [[Mustafa II]] dismissed Sürmeli Ali Pasha on 22 April 1695. There were several reasons for this. Mustafa suspected that Sürmeli Ali Pasha's candidate for the throne instead of him had been a younger prince&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Jorga: ''Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches Vol III''. (tr: Nilüfer Epçeli), Yeditepe Yayınları,  Istanbul, 2009, {{ISBN|975-6480-21-1}}, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and he further suspected that Sürmeli Ali Pasha was against his plan for commanding the army personally. Additionally, there was a power struggle between Sürmeli Ali Pasha and Feyzullah Efendi, the sultan's advisor (and later [[Shaykh al-Islām]]). Sürmeli Ali was accused of fraud and exiled to [[Çeşme]] (in modern-day [[İzmir Province]], [[Turkey]]), but soon the sultan changed his mind and had Sürmeli Ali executed on 29 May 1695.&lt;ref&gt;[http://osmanliansiklopedisi.blogspot.com/2012/07/surmeli-ali-pasa.html Online history {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Louis André Théodore Géricault''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ lwi ɑ̃dʁe teodoʁ ʒeʁiko|lang}}; 26 September 1791 – 26 January 1824) was an influential French [[Painting|painter]] and [[Lithography|lithographer]], whose best-known painting is ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]''. Although he died young, he was one of the pioneers of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Rouen]], France, Géricault was educated in the tradition of English sporting art by [[Carle Vernet]] and classical figure composition by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]], a rigorous classicist who disapproved of his student's impulsive temperament while recognizing his talent.&lt;ref name=e1/&gt; Géricault soon left the classroom, choosing to study at the [[Louvre]], where from 1810 to 1815 he copied paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Rembrandt]]. 

During this period at the Louvre he discovered a vitality he found lacking in the prevailing school of [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref name=e1&gt;Eitner, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his time was spent in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], where he found the stables of the palace open to him, and where he gained his knowledge of the [[anatomy]] and action of horses.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Géricault, Jean-Louis André Théodore|year=1906|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success==
[[File:GericaultHorseman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', 1812]]

Géricault's first major work, ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812, revealed the influence of the style of Rubens and an interest in the depiction of contemporary subject matter.  This youthful success, ambitious and monumental, was followed by a change in direction: for the next several years Géricault produced a series of small studies of horses and cavalrymen.&lt;ref name="Eitner, page 2, 1987"&gt;Eitner, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

He exhibited ''[[The Wounded Cuirassier|Wounded Cuirassier]]'' at the Salon in 1814, a work more labored and less well received.&lt;ref name="Eitner, page 2, 1987"/&gt; Géricault in a fit of disappointment entered the army and served for a time in the garrison of Versailles.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; In the nearly two years that followed the 1814 Salon, he also underwent a self-imposed study of figure construction and composition, all the while evidencing a personal predilection for drama and expressive force.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Théodore Gericault - Head of a Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Study of the Head of a Youth  ]]
A trip to [[Florence]], Rome, and Naples (1816–17), prompted in part by the desire to flee from a romantic entanglement with his aunt,&lt;ref&gt;Lüthy, Hans: ''The Temperament of Gericault'', ''Theodore Gericault'', page 7. Salander-O'Reilly, 1987. In 1818 Alexandrine-Modeste Caruel gave birth to his son (christened Georges-Hippolyte and given into the care of the family doctor who then sent the child to Normandy where he was raised in obscurity). See also [[Wheelock Whitney (historian)|Wheelock Whitney]], ''Géricault in Italy'', New Haven/London 1997, and Marc Fehlmann, ''Das Zürcher Skizzenbuch von Théodore Géricault'', Berne 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ignited a fascination with [[Michelangelo]]. Rome itself inspired the preparation of a monumental canvas, the ''Race of the Barberi Horses'', a work of epic composition and abstracted theme that promised to be "entirely without parallel in its time".&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; However, Géricault never completed the painting and returned to France. In 1821, he painted ''[[The Derby of Epsom]]''.

==''The Raft of the Medusa''==
{{main|The Raft of the Medusa}}
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', 1819]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Theodore Gericault - Evening- Landscape with an Aquaduct, 1818.jpg|thumb|Evening: Landscape with an Aquaduct, 1818]] --&gt;

Géricault continually returned to the military themes of his early paintings, and the series of [[lithograph]]s he undertook on military subjects after his return from Italy are considered some of the earliest masterworks in that medium.  Perhaps his most significant, and certainly most ambitious work, is ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818–19), which depicted the aftermath of a contemporary French shipwreck, ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Meduse]]'', in which the captain had left the crew and passengers to die.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raft of the medusa]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The incident became a national scandal, and Géricault's dramatic interpretation presented a contemporary tragedy on a monumental scale. The painting's notoriety stemmed from its indictment of a corrupt establishment, but it also dramatized a more eternal theme, that of man's struggle with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; It surely excited the imagination of the young [[Eugène Delacroix]], who posed for one of the dying figures.&lt;ref&gt;Riding, p. 73. ''Having studied the painting by candlelight in the confines of Géricault's studio, he walked into the street and broke into a terrified run.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical depiction of the figures and structure of the composition stand in contrast to the turbulence of the subject, so that the painting constitutes an important bridge between [[neo-classicism]] and [[romanticism]]. It fuses many influences: the [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''Last Judgment'']] of [[Michelangelo]], the monumental approach to contemporary events by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], figure groupings by [[Henry Fuseli]], and possibly the painting ''[[Watson and the Shark]] ''by [[John Singleton Copley]].&lt;ref&gt;Riding, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting ignited political controversy when first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819; it then traveled to England in 1820, accompanied by Géricault himself, where it received much praise. While in London, Géricault witnessed urban poverty, made drawings of his impressions, and published lithographs based on these observations which were free of sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He associated much there with [[Nicolas Toussaint Charlet|Charlet]], the lithographer and caricaturist.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

==Later life==
[[Image:Perelachaise-Gericault-p1000405.jpg|thumb|Monument at Géricault's tomb, by sculptor [[Antoine Étex]]]]

After his return to France in 1821, Géricault was inspired to paint a series of ten portraits of the insane, the patients of a friend, Dr. [[Étienne-Jean Georget]], a pioneer in [[psychiatric medicine]], with each subject exhibiting a different affliction.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; There are five remaining portraits from the series, including ''[[Insane Woman]]''. 

The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in Géricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Noon: ''Crossing the Channel'', page 162. [[Tate Publishing Ltd]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; His observations of the human subject were not confined to the living, for some remarkable [[still-life]]s—painted studies of severed heads and limbs—have also been ascribed to the artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/constable-delacroix-british-art-and-french-romantics Constable to Delacroix] [[Tate Britain]] 2003 exhibition. Retrieved 2 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Géricault's last efforts were directed toward preliminary studies for several epic compositions, including the ''Opening of the Doors of the Spanish Inquisition'' and the ''African Slave Trade''.&lt;ref&gt;Eitner, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The preparatory drawings suggest works of great ambition, but Géricault's waning health intervened. Weakened by riding accidents and chronic [[tuberculosis|tubercular]] infection, Géricault died in Paris in 1824 after a long period of suffering. His bronze figure reclines, brush in hand, on his tomb at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, above a low-relief panel of '' The Raft of the Medusa''.

The '''Treens''' are fictional aliens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. They first appeared in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', which was serialized in [[Eagle (comic)|the ''Eagle'']] comic magazine from Volume 1, Number 1 (April 14, 1950) to Volume 2, Number 25 (September 28, 1951). The story was drawn by [[Frank Hampson]].

==Fictional background==
The Treens are a race of green-skinned [[humanoid]]s from the northern hemisphere of the planet [[Venus]]. The southern hemisphere is inhabited by the Therons, a human-like race with an obvious affinity to humanity on Earth. The Treens share the northern hemisphere with the  ''Atlantines'', a blue-skinned people whose ancestors came from Earth 100,000 years previously. The two hemispheres are separated by the "flamelands" around the equator which are impassable, except by specially equipped aircraft.

The leader of the Treens is [[the Mekon]], an individual specifically engineered to have a high intelligence. The Treens are portrayed as mostly unemotional without the usual human feelings about the sanctity of life. In ancient times, they lived as savage jungle tribes permanently involved in tribal wars amongst themselves, until in a major war the Therons occupied the northern hemisphere by force in an attempt to civilize the Treens. The attempt failed and the Therons later abandoned the Treens to their own devices.

Soon after, Treen scientists created the first ''Mekon'' as a "super-brain" to rule over the Treen race. The Mekon developed Treen society into a highly organized militaristic logic-based society where orders are obeyed without query, and which is usually in a state of hostility with the Therons and Earth, both of whose lands they have on occasion occupied. Their [[capital city]] is called [[Mekonta]] and is on islands in a lake. The Atlantines are usually ignored by the Treens, and live in primitive conditions.
	 
'''Mekonta''' is the capital city of the Treens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. It is named after [[The Mekon]]. It is built on many islands in a lake. Its design may have been inspired by [[Venice]] and/or [[Tenochtitlan]]. It was ruined in the war in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', and New Mekonta was built nearby. Afterwards for a long time Old Mekonta remained uncleared ruins.
	 
The Magnets of Mekonta are huge [[electromagnet]]s on mountaintops around Mekonta. They are used to raise and lower spaceships in and out of Mekonta.

==Political interpretation==
Creator Frank Hampson stated "Basically we were fighting the Second World War again – the Treens were the Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Onward Christian Spacemen: Dan Dare - Pilot of the Future as British Cultural History | last=Chapman | first=James | journal=Visual Culture in Britain | volume=9 | number=1 | date=June 2008 | pages=55–79 | publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/manup/vcb/2008/00000009/00000001/art00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
*A Treen was briefly seen in ''[[Scarlet Traces: The Great Game]]''. A Treen was seen drinking at the Star Stop diner in Marvel Comic's She-Hulk (4-7).
*Inky schoolboy [[Nigel Molesworth]] on being caught smoking, remarked "You have caught me Sir, like a Treen in a disabled spaceship."
*In the universe of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', the Treens enter an alliance with Earth as of 1969, and schools where they are taught English are established. In 2009, however, relations have intensified.

'''''Very Bad Things''''' is a 1998 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Peter Berg]]. It stars [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Leland Orser]] and [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]].

==Plot== 
Before his wedding to fiancée Laura ([[Cameron Diaz]]), Kyle Fisher ([[Jon Favreau]]) organizes a bachelor party in a Las Vegas hotel with his friends: Charles Moore ([[Leland Orser]]), Robert Boyd ([[Christian Slater]]), brothers Adam and Michael Berkow ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] and [[Jeremy Piven]]). Michael pays Tina ([[Kobe Tai]]), a stripper/prostitute, for sex in the bathroom and accidentally kills her. Soon thereafter, a security guard comes to investigate the ruckus and discovers Tina's corpse. In desperation, Boyd stabs the guard to death. Boyd convinces the group to dismember the bodies, bury them in the desert, and never speak of it again. 

At the rehearsal dinner, Adam cracks under the pressure, leading to a confrontation with Michael outside, with Adam threatening to turn over to the police. The fight is broken up and Michael is convinced to leave. While leaving, he tries to ram his jeep into Adam's beloved minivan. Adam runs in front of his van and is crushed in the collision. In the hospital, Adam whispers something to his wife Lois ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]) before dying, as Boyd looks on through a glass window.

Lois demands answers about what happened in Las Vegas when she finds a written confession by Adam. Fisher makes up a story about Adam sleeping with a prostitute. Boyd, suspecting she does not believe them, kills Lois. Later, Boyd calls Fisher and Moore to bring Michael to the house, where he kills him. He concocts a story about a Michael/Lois/Adam love triangle to answer any interrogation by police. After these events and being named beneficiary of Adam and Lois' estate, Fisher breaks down and confesses the story to Laura, who demands that the wedding she has dreamed about proceed as planned.

On the wedding day, Boyd confronts Fisher, demanding the money from Adam's life insurance policy. Fisher refuses and a fight ensues which ends with Laura bludgeoning Boyd.  During the ceremony, Fisher and Moore realize that Boyd has the wedding rings. Moore goes to retrieve them, opening a door that knocks Boyd down a stairwell where he dies.  Laura demands Fisher bury Boyd's body in the desert and then ensure no loose ends remain by killing Moore. Ultimately, Fisher cannot go through with the act and as he drives home, he loses focus and crashes into an oncoming car.

After the collision, Fisher has had both his legs amputated below the knee and Moore is brain damaged and confined to a motorized wheelchair, leaving Laura to care for all of them in addition to raising Adam's sons. As Laura watches Fisher's futile attempt to control the two boys, she realizes her life and dreams are totally ruined and suffers a nervous breakdown as she runs out of the house and collapses screaming in the street.

==Reception==
The film scored a 44% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus, "Mean-spirited and empty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/very_bad_things/|title=Very Bad Things|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that ''Very Bad Things'' is "not a bad movie, just a reprehensible one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981125/REVIEWS/811250305/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Very Bad Things}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics appreciated the cold-blooded approach, however, Maitland McDonagh of ''[[TV Guide]]'' said, "In a world filled with crude movie sitcoms, Berg's bitter, worst-possible-case scenario really does stand alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/bad-things/review/133463|title=Very Bad Things|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Weltalter''''' (sometimes '''''Die Weltalter'''''; "{{bracket|The}} Ages of the World") of [[Friedrich Schelling]] refers to a philosophical work of 1811, and its continuation in manuscript for many years after that. It was a long and unfinished project, sometimes identified with Schelling's  philosophical output from 1809 to 1827, the period beginning with his ''[[Freiheitsschrift]]''.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=Schelling |title=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling |last=Bowie  |first=Andrew|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Weltalter'' fragments==
Despite Schelling's years of work on the project, no definitive version of the ''Weltalter'' emerged. There were three drafts in a series: the later versions were not complete and are often referred to as fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alistair Welchman|title=The New Schelling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9LsLVpTrEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-6942-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work ''System der Weltalter'' from 1827/8 consists of Munich lecture notes taken by [[Ernst von Lasaulx]] from Schelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|title=System der Weltalter: Münchener Vorlesung 1827/28 in einer Nachschrift von Ernst von Lasaulx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDu9GzwrtIC&amp;pg=PR30|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Vittorio Klostermann|isbn=978-3-465-02744-7|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was at that time a student also of [[Franz von Baader]] and [[Joseph Görres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:s:ADB:Lasaulx, Ernst von]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts, which no longer exist, are assigned to the periods 1811, 1813 and 1814/5. The 1814/5 manuscript was published posthumously; copies of the other two manuscripts, made by [[Manfred Schröter]] before the destruction of the originals by bombing in [[World War II]], were published in 1946, with some of Schelling's project notes.&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miklós Vassányi|title=Anima Mundi: The Rise of the World Soul Theory in Modern German Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtfOVk5zz1YC&amp;pg=PA387|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=3 December 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-8795-9|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Schelling works in the ''Weltalter'' with and from a theological idea of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Laughland|title=Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOzHYeFPNckC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6118-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is influenced by the formulations of [[Jakob Boehme]], and in general the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joris Geldhof|title=Revelation, Reason and Reality: Theological Encounters With Jaspers, Schelling and Baader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PS2to13BblAC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-1929-7|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken as a Romantic theory of the ''[[anima mundi]]'', the ''Weltalter'' writings call on, at least superficially, [[mysticism]] (both Jewish and Christian) and [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"/&gt;

==Philosophical formulation==
Aside from the language used, there are a number of formulations explaining the problems Schelling was tackling in the ''Weltalter'' project. According to a 2010 paper,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Schelling sat down to write the ''Ages of the World'' he had a large number of seemingly contradictory philosophical commitments to reconcile. He wanted to avoid dualism and yet acknowledge the essential and irreducible roles of both spirit and matter. He wanted to give a law-like description of the creation of the world and yet preserve divine freedom. He wanted to treat God as perfect and self-sufficient and yet also account for the motive underlying God's decision to create the world. Perhaps most paradoxically of all, he wanted to explain what events led up to the creation of the past – what ‘caused’ time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://utsa.academia.edu/AlistairWelchman/Papers/193611/Creating_the_Past_Schellings_Ages_of_the_World Alistair Welchman, Judith Norman, ''Creating the Past: Schelling's Ages of the World'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1813 draft has been called the origin of [[dialectical materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelsey Wood|title=Zizek: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HRBODii6dcC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-26982-4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Žižek]] in explaining his attitude to the ''Weltalter'' and its theosophical leanings, however, states that "there is no way of throwing out the dirty bath water without losing the baby".&lt;ref name="Žižek1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slavoj Žižek|title=The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Schelling and Related Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K77t2XTpSeMC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1996|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-959-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wesley Fletcher Orr''' (March 3, 1831 – February 16, 1898) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[businessman]], [[journalist]], and [[politician]].  He was the eighth mayor of the city of [[Calgary]], [[District of Alberta|Alberta]].

Orr was born in [[Lachute]], [[Lower Canada]] on March 3, 1831 to Samuel G. P. Orr and Jane Hicks.  He married Priscilla Victoria Miller circa 1863.  Together they had two daughters and one son.

Prior to moving to Calgary, Orr spent his life in various occupations.  These include: cattle-dealer, salesman, teacher, and [[coroner]].  He also contributed to newspapers such as the [[Northern Gazette]] ([[Barrie, Ontario]]) and the [[Hamilton Spectator]].

In 1883, Orr was advised by [[D'Alton McCarthy]] to buy land at [[Fort Calgary]] prior to the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].  That year he purchased land south of the [[Bow River]] and east of the [[Elbow River]] with an associate, Mary S. Schreiber, for $10,000.  This was nearly his entire fortune, as he was confident in getting a significant return.  Due to complications, Orr settled in Calgary in 1886 to protect his investment.  The railway station was not located near his property as expected and his involvement with local politics was to promote development near or on his property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foran|first=Max|title=Calgary, Canada's frontier metropolis : an illustrated history|year=1982|publisher=Windsor Publications|isbn=0-89781-055-4|page=142|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3610432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his wife refused to follow, he took along his seven-year-old son.

As with his time in the east, Orr spent time in various work opportunities.  He thought the road to prosperity came through the railway and was involved in the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[Alberta Southern Railway Company]], [[Rocky Mountain Railway]], [[Coal Company]], [[North-West Central Railway]] and a proposed line between Calgary and [[Hudson Bay]].  He was also involved in real estate, buffalo bone trading, operated a stone quarry, and was a financial agent.  In 1888, he served as the editor of the [[Calgary Herald]].

Orr was also active in municipal politics.  Excluding one year, he served as alderman from 1888 through 1894.  He chaired the committee of public works which was responsible for the creation of much of the early infrastructure in Calgary, including: electric light, the General Hospital, sewage, municipal financing and water.  In 1894, he became Calgary's eighth mayor and served for two one-year terms.  Calgary was elevated to a city during November of his first term.  With this, Orr became the first mayor of the city of Calgary.  After a narrow defeat in 1896, he again took on the post as mayor in 1897 for another one-year term.  He personally drew the city crest with its motto "Onward Calgary."

Orr died on February 16, 1898 in the Calgary General Hospital.  In 1961, a stained glass window in St. Stephen's Anglican Church was dedicated to his memory.

'''''William Brown''''' was an American ship that sank in 1841, taking with her 31 passengers. A further 16 passengers were forced out of an overloaded [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] before the survivors were rescued. In the case of '''''United States v. Holmes''''', [[crewman]] Alexander Holmes was charged with [[murder]] and convicted of [[manslaughter]] for his actions.

==Sinking and rescue==
Under the command of Captain George Harris, the ship departed from [[Liverpool]] on March 18, 1841 for [[Philadelphia]] with 17 seamen and 65 passengers, mostly poor Scottish and Irish emigrants. At about 10 p.m. on the night of April 19, ''William Brown'' struck an [[iceberg]] {{convert|250|mi|km}} southeast of [[Cape Race]], [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and sank. The captain, eight seamen, and one passenger made it to the [[jolly boat]] (to be picked up six days later by a French fishing vessel), while nine crewmen and 32 passengers occupied the [[longboat]]. One person had died earlier on the voyage, and 31 passengers, many of them children, went down with the ship.&lt;ref name=BCLC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F.Cas/0026.f.cas/0026.f.cas.0360.pdf |title=UNITED STATES v. HOLMES - Circuit Court, E. D. Pennsylvania. 26 F.Cas. 360 (1842) }&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the two boats parted ways to increase their chances of being found, Captain Harris placed the [[first mate]], Francis Rhodes, in charge of the crowded, leaking longboat. At about 10 p.m., 24 hours after the sinking, the wind picked up, sending water over the longboat's [[gunwale]]s, and it began to rain heavily. The first mate shouted, "This . . . won't do. Help me, God. Men, go to work."&lt;ref name=BCLC/&gt; When the crewmen did nothing, he stated, "Men, you must go to work, or we shall all perish."&lt;ref name=BCLC/&gt;&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2482/Alexander-Holmes-Trial-1842.html |title=Alexander Holmes Trial: 1842 - Holmes Tried For Manslaughter |publisher=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the seamen, among them Alexander Holmes, forced 12 men out of the boat. Two women also went into the frigid water, though they may have voluntarily followed their brother, Frank Askin. Early the next morning, two men were found to be hiding and were also jettisoned. All of the male passengers, except for two married men and a young boy, had been sacrificed,&lt;ref name=BCLC/&gt; while all of the crewmen remained aboard. Later that day, the survivors were picked up by the American ship ''Crescent'' and taken to [[Havre de Grâce]], [[Seine-Maritime]], France.&lt;ref name=Times150541&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Dreadful Shipwreck |date=15 May 1841 |page_number=6 |issue=17671 |column=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
When some of the passengers finally reached their destination of Philadelphia, they filed a complaint with the District Attorney. Holmes was the only crewman to be found in the city, so he was the only one charged. He was accused of murdering Frank Askin. A [[grand jury]] before Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin refused to [[Indictment|indict]] him on that charge, so it was reduced to manslaughter. In the case of ''United States v. Holmes'', the defendant was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail and a $20 fine.&lt;ref name=LL/&gt; None of the other crewmen were ever brought to trial.

==Films==
The 1937 film ''[[Souls at Sea]]'', with [[Gary Cooper]], [[George Raft]], and [[Henry Wilcoxon]], is somewhat based on the disaster, changing the cause of it to a fire accidentally set by a little girl.  A story involving [[abolitionist]]s against the slave trade is involved, but the conclusion has Cooper's character forced to jettison passengers out of the overcrowded lifeboat, and facing a trial for murder as a result.

The 1957 film ''[[Seven Waves Away]]'' (renamed ''Abandon Ship!'' in the USA), was also loosely based on the incident, with [[Tyrone Power]] starring as "Alec Holmes". 

A 1975 made-for-television version, ''The Last Survivors'', featured [[Martin Sheen]].

'''Yishai Schlissel''' (also spelled '''Shlisel'''; {{lang-he-n|ישי שליסל}}; born 10 December 1975) is an [[Israel]]i convicted criminal. He stabbed marchers during the [[Jerusalem gay pride parade]] in 2005, for which he served ten years in prison. On 30 July 2015, during the 2015 Jerusalem gay pride, he stabbed 16-year-old Shira Banki to death, and wounded six other people. The incident occurred just three weeks after his release from prison. On 24 August, Schlissel was indicted for murder, six counts of attempted murder, and wounding under aggravating circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.2714458’], ''An indictment for murder against Yishai Schlissel'', Haaretz, August 24, 2015 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; and detained until the end of proceedings. On June 26 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, as well as pay NIS 2,064,000 (around $650,000) in damages. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Life-sentence-for-Jerusalem-pride-parade-stabber-who-killed-teen-girl-457749], ''Life sentence for Jerusalem pride parade stabber who killed teen girl'', The Jerusalem Post, June 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Schlissel was born on 10 December 1975 in [[Yad Binyamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-visits-pride-attack-victim-defends-right-to-live-in-peace/ PM visits pride attack victim, defends ‘right to live in peace’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhol"&gt;[http://www.bhol.co.il/Article.aspx?id=87722מוזר ומופנם, או איש עקרונות  קנאי - מי אתה ישי שליסל?], July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of ten children. His parents are the children of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors. He studied [[Talmud]], and is very religious. He later studied in a [[kolel]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt;

==Criminal acts and convictions==
In 2005, Schlissel stabbed three marchers during the gay pride parade in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; As a result, he was convicted of [[attempted murder]] and [[aggravated assault]],&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"/&gt; and sentenced to twelve years in prison.&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; In 2007, his sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal. Schlissel served his sentence at [[Maasiyahu Prison]]. In 2008, he was hospitalized for a month and a half over mental health issues and diagnosed with a paranoid psychiatric condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://10tv.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1141498&lt;/ref&gt; Schlissel was released in June 2015.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"&gt;{{cite news|title=6 stabbed at Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade by ultra-Orthodox Jewish assailant|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.668796|publisher=Haaretz|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.668832&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his release, he distributed a homophobic letter in his hometown which read, "It is the obligation of every Jew to keep his soul from punishment and stop this giant desecration of God's name next Thursday."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"&gt;Joe Williams, [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/02/victim-of-jerusalem-pride-attack-dies-of-injuries/ Victim of Jerusalem Pride attack dies of injuries], ''[[PinkNews]]'', August 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was not tracked by the Judea and Samaria Police District because his previous crime had occurred in Jerusalem, outside of their jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt; Moreover, [[Moshe Edry]], the chief of the Jerusalem District Police, was not warned that Schlissel would be coming to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt;

On 30 July 2015, only three weeks after being released, he stabbed six marchers during the [[Jerusalem gay pride parade]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; The act was widely condemned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yishai Schlissel: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2015/07/yishai-schlissel-jerusalem-gay-pride-stabbing-2005-attack-release/|publisher=Heavy.com|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelstuart"&gt;Stuart Winer, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-slams-gay-pride-attack-we-will-bring-those-responsible-to-justice/ After attack on pride parade, PM condemns ‘despicable hate crime’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015.&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.669161|date=August 2, 2015|accessdate=August 2, 2015|first=Yaniv|last=Kubovich|newspaper=Haaretz|title=16-year-old stabbed in Jerusalem pride parade succumbs to wounds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;

A psychiatric evaluation by the [[Israel Prison Service]], with which Schlissel refused to cooperate, found him fit to stand trial. However, after state psychiatrists argued that his refusal to cooperate rendered the evaluation inconclusive, the court ordered that he be hospitalized for a 48-hour observation period for reevaluation. He was again found fit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-parade-stabber-deemed-fit-to-stand-trial/&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2015, Shlissel was charged with one count of murder and six counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault at the Jerusalem District Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4693866,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to recognize the authority of the court to try him due to it not abiding by Jewish religious law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/pride-parade-stabber-to-undergo-further-psychiatric-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he would refuse to be represented by an attorney, and did not cooperate with the public defender assigned to represent him. On April 19, 2016, he was convicted.&lt;ref name="jtajerusalemgayprideparade"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerusalem gay pride parade stabber convicted of murder|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/04/19/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/jerusalem-gay-pride-parade-stabber-convicted-of-murder|accessdate=April 20, 2016|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, and was ordered to pay [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 2,064,000 in compensation to the families of his victims. 

Schlissel is serving his sentence in [[Ayalon Prison]]. In August 2016, Schlissel tore up pictures of another inmate's daughters due to them being "immodestly dressed", and was subsequently beaten by the inmate until guards separated them. Schlissel was hospitalized as a result of the beating he sustained, and was temporarily placed in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure. After prison authorities carried out an evaluation, it was decided to separate him from other inmates due to his volatile behavior, and he was given his own cell in a protected area of the prison. One month later,  Schlissel was again attacked and had to be hospitalized after an argument between him and two convicted mobsters in the prison yard escalated to the mobsters beating him until guards intervened.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-pride-killer-beaten-up-in-prison-in-argument-over-his-crime/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4842863,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Before his prison sentence, Schlissel resided in [[Modi'in Illit]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Israeli settlement]] and city in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"&gt;Chaim Levinson, Yaniv Kubovich, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.668832 Israel Police to probe failure to monitor Jerusalem gay pride parade assailant], ''Haaretz'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Israeli [[ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox Jew]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/six-stabbed-at-jerusalem-pride-parade-by-same-assailant-who-attacked-parade-in-2005/ Six stabbed at Jerusalem pride parade by same assailant who attacked parade in 2005], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33726634 Jerusalem Gay Pride: Six stabbed 'by ultra-Orthodox Jew'], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his crime, he was married, with four children.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt; He divorced his wife at the beginning of his imprisonment in 2005.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt;
