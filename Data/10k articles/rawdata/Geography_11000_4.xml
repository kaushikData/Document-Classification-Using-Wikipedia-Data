'''Bull Hill''', also known as '''Mount Taurus''', is a [[mountain]] north of the [[village]] of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] on the [[Hudson River]] in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] in the [[State of New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15644">A '''cadastre''' (also spelled '''cadaster''') is a comprehensive land recording of the [[real estate]] or [[real property]]'s [[metes and bounds|metes-and-bounds]] of a country.&lt;ref name=CTdata/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henssen1995&gt;Jo Henssen, BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE MAIN CADASTRAL SYSTEMS
IN THE WORLD, [https://www.fig.net/organisation/comm/7/activities/reports/events/Delft_seminar_95/paper2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, legal systems have developed around the original administrative systems and use the cadastre to define the dimensions and location of [[land parcel]]s described in legal documentation. The cadastre is a fundamental source of data in disputes and [[lawsuit]]s between landowners.

In the [[United States]], Cadastral Survey within the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) maintains records of all [[public land]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Such surveys often require detailed investigation of the history of land use, legal accounts, and other documents.

[[Land registration]] and cadastre are both types of land recording and complement each other.&lt;ref name=Henssen1995/&gt;

== Definition ==

A cadastre commonly includes details of the [[ownership]], the [[land tenure|tenure]], the precise location (therefore [[GNSS]] coordinates are not used due to errors such as multipath),&lt;ref name="GPS Errors &amp; Estimating Your Receiver's Accuracy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu-observatory.org/gps/gps_accuracy.html|title=Sam Wormley's GPS Errors &amp; Estimating Your Receiver's Accuracy|first=Samuel J.|last=Wormley|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310132600/http://edu-observatory.org/gps/gps_accuracy.html|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dimensions (and area), the cultivations if rural, and the [[Value (economics)|value]] of individual parcels of land. Cadastres are used by many nations around the world, some in conjunction with other records, such as a title register.&lt;ref name="CTdata"&gt;"Cadastral Template - Field Data C4" (lists nations), CadastralTemplate.org, January 2008, webpage: [http://www.cadastraltemplate.org/fielddata/c4.htm CT-C4]: also has term "cadastral survey" and other land records.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] defines cadastre as follows:&lt;ref&gt;FIG (1995) "The FIG Statement on the Cadastre", FIG Policy Statement, The International Federation of Surveyors (FIG), FIG PUBLICATION No 11, 1995,{{OCLC|38375638}} [http://www.fig.net/resources/publications/figpub/pub11/figpub11.asp fig.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Cadastre is normally a parcel based, and up-to-date land information system containing a record of interests in land (e.g. rights, restrictions and responsibilities). It usually includes a geometric description of land parcels linked to other records describing the nature of the interests, the ownership or control of those interests, and often the value of the parcel and its improvements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[wikt:cadastre|cadastre]]'' came into [[English language|English]] through [[French language|French]] from [[Late Latin]] ''capitastrum'', a register of the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], and the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{grc-tr|κατάστιχον}} ({{lang|grc|κατάστιχον}}), a list or register, from {{grc-tr|κατὰ στίχον}} ({{lang|grc|κατὰ στίχον}})&amp;mdash;literally, "down the line", in the sense of "line by line" along the directions and distances between the corners mentioned and marked by monuments in the metes and bounds.

The word forms the adjective ''[[wikt:cadastral|cadastral]]'', used in [[public administration]], primarily for ownership and [[taxation]] purposes. The terminology for cadastral divisions may include [[county|counties]], [[Parish (subnational entity)|parish]]es, [[Riding (division)|ridings]], [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]], [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]], [[Lot (real estate)|lots]], [[Block (country subdivision)|blocks]] and [[city block]]s.

Other languages have kept the original ''t'' sound in the second syllable (examples: [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|catasto}}'', [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Kataster}}'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''{{lang|sk|kataster}}'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|katastr}}'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|catastro}}''). In [[Greek language|modern Greek]], though, it has been replaced by ''ktimatologio'' ({{lang|el|κτηματολόγιο}}).

==History==
{{see also|Surveying#History|Cartography#History|Topographic mapping#History}}

[[File:Katastermarke südtirol 2018.jpg|thumb|Cadastre survey marker from the [[South Tyrol]]'s mountains, 2018]]
Some of the earliest cadastres were ordered by Roman Emperors to recover state owned lands that had been appropriated by private individuals, and thereby recover income from such holdings. One such cadastre was done in AD 77 in Campania, a surviving stone marker of the survey reads "The Emperor [[Vespasian]], in the eighth year of his tribunician power, so as to restore the state lands which the Emperor [[Augustus]] had given to the soldiers of Legion II Gallica, but which for some years had been occupied by private individuals, ordered a survey map to be set up with a record on each 'century' of the annual rental".&lt;ref name="Kain"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State: A History of Property Mapping|author=Roger J. P. Kain and Elizabeth Baigent|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Vespasian was able to reimpose taxation formerly uncollected on these lands.&lt;ref name="Kain"/&gt;

With the fall of Rome the use of cadastral maps effectively discontinued. Medieval practice used written descriptions of the extent of land rather than using more precise surveys. Only in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries did the use of cadastral maps resume, beginning in the Netherlands. With the emergence of capitalism in Renaissance Europe the need for cadastral maps reemerged as a tool to determine and express control of land as a means of production. This took place first privately in land disputes and later spread to governmental practice as a means of more precise tax assessment.&lt;ref name="Kain"/&gt;

==Surveys==
{{main article|Cadastral surveying}}
[[File:Bureau_of_Land_Management_Cadastral_Survey_Marker_Arizona.jpg|thumb|BLM cadastral survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]]]]

Cadastral surveys document the [[Boundary (real estate)|boundaries]] of land ownership, by the production of documents, diagrams, sketches, plans ([[plat]]s in USA), charts, and maps. They were originally used to ensure  reliable facts for land valuation and taxation. An example from early [[England]] is the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086.  [[Napoleon]] established a comprehensive cadastral system for France that is regarded as the [[wikt:forerunner|forerunner]] of most modern versions.

The [[Public Lands Survey System]] is a cadastral survey of the United States originating in legislation from 1785, after [[Diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] of the United States. The [[Dominion Land Survey]] is a similar cadastral survey conducted in Western Canada begun in 1871 after the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Both cadastral surveys are made relative to [[principal meridian]] and [[baseline (surveying)|baseline]]s. These cadastral surveys divided the surveyed areas into [[Survey township|townships]], square land areas of approximately 36 square miles (six miles by six miles; some very early surveys in Ohio created 25 square mile townships when the design of the system was being explored). These townships are divided into [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]], each approximately one-mile square. Unlike in Europe this cadastral survey largely preceded settlement and as a result greatly influenced settlement patterns. Properties are generally rectangular, boundary lines often run on cardinal bearings, and parcel dimensions are often in fractions or multiples of [[chain (length)|chains]]. [[Land description]]s in Western North America are principally based on these land surveys.

Cadastral survey information is often a base element in [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) or [[Land Information Systems]] (LIS) used to assess and manage land and built infrastructure. Such systems are also employed on a variety of other tasks, for example, to track long-term changes over time for geological or ecological studies, where land tenure is a significant part of the scenario.

==Map==
A ''cadastral map'' is a [[map]] that shows the [[Border|boundaries]] and ownership of land parcels. Some cadastral maps show additional details, such as survey district names, unique identifying  numbers for parcels, certificate of title numbers, positions of existing structures, section or lot numbers and their respective areas, adjoining and adjacent street names, selected boundary dimensions and references to prior maps.

The [[National Ocean Service|U.S. NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC)]] has released a cadastre web tool to illustrate [[offshore wind power]] suitability of [[East coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] areas.&lt;ref name=noaa-csc&gt;[http://www.marinecadastre.gov/MMC%20Pages/wind.aspx Offshore Wind Development - Site Suitability Prototype] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612164556/http://www.marinecadastre.gov/MMC%20Pages/wind.aspx |date=2012-06-12 }} ''[[National Ocean Service]]''. Accessed: 4 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentation==
Cadastral documentation comprises the documentary materials submitted to cadastre or land administration offices for renewal of cadastral recordings. Cadastral documentation is kept in paper and/or electronic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geoportal.sk/en/kataster/|title=Slovak Geoportal, retrieved 2016-08-02|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jurisdiction statutes and further provisions specify the content and form of the documentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuzk.cz/English/Cadastre-of-Real-Estate/Registration-into-the-Cadastre-of-Real-Estate/Registration-into-the-Cadastre-of-Real-Estate.aspx|title=ČÚZK - Registration into the Cadastre of Real Estate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the person(s) authorized to prepare and sign the documentation, including concerned parties (owner, etc.), licensed [[Surveying#The surveying profession|surveyor]]s and legal advisors. The office concerned reviews the submitted information; if the documentation does not comply with stated provisions, the office may set a deadline for the applicant to submit complete documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2015/papers/ts07b/TS07B_shala_meha_et_al_7691.pdf Shala, X., Meha, M. and Ahmedi, S.

Despite the age of [[Cadastre#History|cadastre]], the notion of cadastral documentation emerged late in the English language, as the institution of cadastre developed outside English-speaking countries. In a Danish textbook, one out of fifteen chapters regards the Form and content of documents concerning subdivision, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, V. E. (1951) Matrikelvæsen. København, Den kgl. Veterinær- og Landbohøjskole (Cadastral Service. Copenhagen. Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University)&lt;/ref&gt; Early textbooks of international scope focused on recordings in terms of [[land registration]] and technical aspects of [[cadastral survey]], yet note that 'cadastral surveying has been carried out within a tight framework of legislation' (p. 28).&lt;ref name="Dale1"&gt;Dale. P. F.  &amp; McLaughlin, J. D. (1988) Land Information Management. - An introduction with special reference to cadastral problems in Third World countries. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1999) Land Administration. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With the view of assessing transaction costs, a European project: Modelling real property transactions (2001&amp;ndash;2005) charted procedures for the transfer of ownership and other rights in land and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://costg9.plan.aau.dk/|title=COST G9: Modelling Real Property Transactions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadastral documentation is described, e.g. for Finland as follows '8. Surveyor draws up cadastral map and cadastral documents .. 10. Surveyor sends cadastral documents to cadastral authority.' &lt;ref&gt;Vitikainen, A. (2007) Transaction costs concerning real property - The case of Finland. Pp 101 - 118 in Zevenbergen, J., Frank, A., Stubkjær, E. (Eds) Real property transactions: procedures, transaction costs and models. Amsterdam, IOS Press. Page 109&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, similar activities are referred to as 'lodgement of plans of subdivision at land titles offices' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadastraltemplate.org/Australia.php|title=Australia - CSDILA icon|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827012020/http://www.cadastraltemplate.org/australia.php|archivedate=2016-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Cadastre management has been used by the software industry since at least 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/gis-for-cad-mgmt.pdf|title=GIS for Cadastre Management, ESRI® GIS Technology in Europe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/aumentum/cadastre/ Streamline Cadastral Data Management, Thomson Reuters, Aumentum Cadastre]&lt;/ref&gt;. It mainly refers to the use of technology for management of cadastre and land information in [[Geographic Information System]]s, [[Spatial data infrastructure]]s and [[Software architecture]], rather that to general management issues of cadastral and other land information agencies &lt;ref name="Dale1"/&gt;.

'''Copo National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Copo}}) is a [[National parks of Argentina|federal protected area]] in [[Santiago del Estero Province]], [[Argentina]]. Established on 22 November 2000,&lt;ref name=decree1/&gt; it houses a representative sample of the [[Dry Chaco]] [[biodiversity]] in average state of conservation.
Located in the [[Copo Department]], it has an area of {{convert|118118|ha|km2 sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Biodiversity==
The climate is warm, with annual rainfall between {{convert|500|-|700|mm|abbr=on}}. A large part of the park is made up of forests, with the Santiago red quebracho (''quebracho colorado santiagueño'') being its characteristic tree species. This tree has a strong wood and high content of [[tannin]], and in the past it suffered a devastating exploitation in other parts of the country. At the beginning of the 20th century, Santiago del Estero was 80% quebracho scrubland; nowadays only 20% remain.

Some of the endangered species that live in this park include the [[maned wolf]],{{sfn|Maffei|2007}} [[jaguar]], the giant [[anteater]], the [[Chacoan Peccary|chacoan peccary]] and the [[giant armadillo]].

[[File:Departments map Côte d'Ivoire.jpg|thumb|left|Departments of Ivory Coast. Red lines indicate borders of districts. Bolded black lines indicate borders of regions. Grey area is not governed by a department.]]
'''Departments of Ivory Coast''' ({{lang-fr|départements de Côte d'Ivoire}}, also known as ''collectivités territoriale'') are currently the third-level administrative [[subdivisions of Ivory Coast|subdivision]] of the country. Each of the 31 second-level [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]] of Ivory Coast is divided into two or more departments. (The autonomous districts contain no regions, but they do contain departments.) Each department is divided into two or more [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]], which are the fourth-level subdivisions in Ivory Coast. As of 2016, there are 108 departments of Ivory Coast.

There is one area of Ivory Coast that is not governed by departments: the portion of [[Comoé National Park]] that is within [[Zanzan District]] is not assigned to any department.

Departments were first created in 1961. During their existence, they have been first-, second-, and third-level administrative subdivisions.

==Current departments==

==History==

===1961–69===
[[File:Departments of Côte d'Ivoire locator map labelled (1961-63).jpg|left|thumb|Departments of Ivory Coast in 1961–63.]]
[[File:Departments of Côte d'Ivoire locator map labelled (1963-69).jpg|thumb|Departments of Ivory Coast in 1963–69.]]
Departments were established in 1961 and were the original first-level administrative subdivision of independent Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;At independence in 1960, Ivory Coast was informally divided into 19 traditional cercles, but the cercles were not official administrative subdivisions.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, there were just four departments: [[Centre Department (Ivory Coast)|Centre]], [[Nord Department (Ivory Coast)|Nord]], [[Sud-Est Department (Ivory Coast)|Sud-Est]], and [[Sud-Ouest Department|Sud-Ouest]]. In 1963, two more departments were created: [[Est Department|Est]] was created by dividing Sud-Est, and [[Centre-Ouest Department|Centre-Ouest]]) was created by dividing Sud-Ouest. As a result of the divisions, Sud-Est was renamed [[Sud Department (Ivory Coast)|Sud]] and Sud-Ouest was renamed [[Ouest Department (Ivory Coast)|Ouest]].

===1969: 24 new departments===
In 1969, the six departments were abolished and in their place 24 new departments were created. The following table illustrates how the old departments were divided into the new departments:
[[File:Departments map Côte d'Ivoire numbered (1969-74).jpg|thumb|left|The 24 new departments that were created in 1969. These boundaries were consistent until departments began to be divided in 1974.]]

}}

Due to a lack of government resources, the 1969 changes were not fully implemented until 1974.

===Subsequent divisions and relegation to second-level===
From 1974 onward, new departments were occasionally created through division of pre-existing departments. New departments were created in 1974 (2), 1980 (8), 1988 (15), and 1995 (1). In 1997, when there were 50 departments, [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]] were created, which supplanted departments as the first-level administrative subdivision. As a result, the 50 departments became second-level divisions.

More departments were created in 1998 (8), 2005 (12), 2008 (11), and 2009 (9). By the time of the late-2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, there were 90 departments in 19 regions.

===2011 subdivision reorganisation===
In the 2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, five new departments were created, bringing the total to 95. More significantly, however, [[Districts of Ivory Coast|districts]] were created as a new first-level division. As a result, regions became second-level subdivisions and the 95 departments became third-level subdivisions.

===Post-2011 changes===
Since the 2011 reorganisation, 13 more departments have been created, bringing the total number to 108. Twelve departments were created in 2012 and one was created in 2013.

==Names and governance==
Departments are named after the city or town that serves as the seat of the department. In most cases, this is the most populous settlement in the department.

Each department is headed by a prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451&gt;[http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/ivc146379.pdf Loi n° 2014-451 du 05 août 2014 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'Administration Territoriale].&lt;/ref&gt; For departments that house regional capitals, the prefect of the department is the same individual as the prefect of the region, though the two offices of prefect remain distinct.&lt;ref name = ordonnance262&gt;[http://www.dgddl.interieur.gouv.ci/documentation/20130612092155TEXTELIGISLATIFETREGLEMENTAIRE.pdf Ordonnance n° 2011-262 du 28 septembre 2011 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'administration territoriale de l'Etat].&lt;/ref&gt;

Each department is divided into two or more [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]], which serve as fourth-level administrative subdivisions. There are currently 510 sub-prefectures in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">'''Dubovë e vogël''' (Albanian, determinate form: '''Dubova e Vogël'''), '''Malo Dubovo''' (Serbian), is a village of [[Istog]]/[[Istok]] municipality, in Western [[Kosovo]]. The village has an area of 243,23 ha.&lt;ref&gt;J. OSMANI, ''Vendbanimet e Kosovës: n°12 Burimi (Istogu)'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toponym is of Slavic origin, from the word ''dub'' that means ''oak''.

Between the two world wars, seven families of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] colonists as well as a [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] family ([[Bosnians|Bosnian]]) settled in the village.&lt;ref name="Osmani"/&gt;

At the census of 1921, the village had a population of 121 inhabitants, at the one of 1948 it had 160 inhabitants, and 346 inhabitants in 1981 (among them: 310 [[Albanians]], or 89,5% of the total population; 30 [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], or 8,67% of the total population; 6 [[Muslims]], or 1,73% of the total population).&lt;ref name="Osmani"&gt;J. OSMANI, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The families currently inhabiting the village are:&lt;ref name="Osmani"/&gt;

- Bacaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Daci ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Demaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Hasaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Kelmendi ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Lajci ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Mehaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Sallka ([[Albanians|Albanian]] with [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] origins)

During [[Kosovo war]] the [[Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] population of the village had to leave and took refuge in [[Montenegro]], a part then left for [[Albania]].

[[Serbs|Serbian]] families left the village before the return of [[Albanians|Albanian]] refugees in 1999.

In 1999, during the [[Kosovo]] war, five people were killed in the village:&lt;ref&gt;http://hlc-rdc.org/index.php?lid=en&amp;show=kosovo&amp;action=search&amp;str_prezime=&amp;str_ime=&amp;str_ime_oca=&amp;str_date_of_birth=&amp;str_status=&amp;str_povreda=&amp;str_date_of_injury=&amp;str_mesto_povrede=Malo+Dubovo%2FDubov%C3%AB+e+Vog%C3%ABl&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''equator''' of a rotating [[spheroid]] (such as a [[planet]]) is its zeroth [[circle of latitude]] (parallel). It is the [[imaginary line]] on the spheroid's surface, equidistant from its [[geographical pole|poles]], dividing it into [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]]s. In other words, it is the intersection of the spheroid's surface with the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] [[perpendicular]] to its axis of [[rotation]] and midway between its [[geographical pole]]s.

On [[Earth]], ''the Equator'' is about {{cvt|40,075|km|mi}} long, of which 78.8% lies across water and 21.3% over land. [[Indonesia]] is the country straddling the greatest length of the equatorial line across both land and sea.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from medieval Latin word ''aequator'', in the phrase ''circulus aequator diei et noctis,'' meaning ‘circle equalizing day and night’, from the Latin word ''aequare'' meaning ‘make equal’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/equator|title=Definition of equator|last=|first=|date=|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Double image|right|Equator monument.jpg|150|Equator sign kenya.jpg|125|''Top'': A monument marking the Equator near the city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia]]&lt;br /&gt;''Bottom'': Road sign marking the Equator near [[Nanyuki]], [[Kenya]]}}

The [[latitude]] of the Earth's equator is, by definition, 0° (zero [[degree (angle)|degrees]]) of arc. The Equator is one of the five notable [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] on Earth; the other four are both [[polar circle]]s (the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Antarctic Circle]]) and both [[tropics|tropical circles]] (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]). The Equator is the only line of latitude which is also a [[great circle]] — that is, one whose [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] passes through the center of the globe. The plane of Earth's equator, when projected outwards to the [[celestial sphere]], defines the [[celestial equator]].

In the cycle of Earth's [[season]]s, the equatorial plane runs through the Sun twice per [[year]]: on the [[equinox]]es in [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox|September]]. To a person on Earth, the Sun [[subsolar point|appears to travel above]] the Equator (or along the celestial equator) at these times. Light rays from the Sun's center are [[perpendicular]] to Earth's surface at the point of [[Noon#Solar noon|solar noon]] on the Equator.

[[File:equator Line Monument, Macapá city, Brazil.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Marco Zero (São Paulo)|Marco Zero]] monument marking the Equator in [[Macapá]], [[Brazil]].]]

Locations on the Equator experience the shortest [[sunrise]]s and [[sunset]]s because the Sun's [[sun path|daily path]] is nearly perpendicular to the [[horizon]] for most of the year. The length of [[daylight]] (sunrise to sunset) is almost constant throughout the year; it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to [[atmospheric refraction]] and the fact that sunrise begins (or sunset ends) as the upper limb, not the center, of the Sun's disk contacts the horizon.

Earth [[equatorial bulge|bulges slightly]] at the Equator; the "average" diameter of Earth is {{cvt|12750|km|mi}}, but the diameter at the Equator is about {{cvt|43|km|mi}} greater than at the poles.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/equator/?ar_a=1|title=Equator|author= |date= |work= |website=National Geographic - Education|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites near the Equator, such as the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], are good locations for [[spaceport]]s as they have a faster [[rotational speed]] than other latitudes; the added [[velocity]] reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft. Since Earth [[retrograde and prograde motion|rotates eastward]], spacecraft must also be launched eastward (if not, to the southeast or northeast) to take advantage of this Earth-boost of speed.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Geodesy ==
{{further|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}

===Precise location===
The precise location of the Equator is not truly fixed; the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the [[Axial tilt|Earth's spin axis]], which [[polar motion|drifts]] about {{convert|9|m|0}} during a year. This effect must be accounted for in detailed [[geophysical]] measurements.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Exact length ===
{{main|Earth's circumference}}
In two widely used [[geodesy|geodetic]] standards, the Equator is modelled as a circle whose [[radius]] is a [[integer|whole number]] of metres. In 1976, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) chose a radius of {{convert|6378.140|km}} (codified as the [[IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants|IAU-1976]] value), later refined by the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) to {{convert|6378.137|km}} and adopted in [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]]. Despite this change, the yet more recent IAU-2000 retained the old IAU-1976 value. If it were really circular, the length of the Equator would be exactly 2{{pi}} times the radius, namely {{convert|40075.036|km}}. However, due to the effect of the [[Earth tide|tides on the Earth's surface]] the actual circumference at the equator is about {{convert|40075.16|km}}.

The [[geographical mile]] is defined as one [[arc-minute]] of the Equator, so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed. For example, by WSG-84, the distance is {{convert|1855.3248|m}}, while by IAU-2000, it is {{convert|1855.3257|m}}. This is a difference of less than {{Convert|1|mm||spell=in}} over the total distance (approximately {{convert|1.86|km||disp=or}}).

The earth is commonly modeled as a [[sphere]] flattened 0.336% along its axis. This makes the Equator 0.16% longer than a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (a great circle passing through the two poles). The IUGG standard meridian is, to the nearest millimetre, {{convert|40007.862917|km}}, one arc-minute of which is {{convert|1852.216|m}}, explaining the [[International System of Units|SI]] standardization of the [[nautical mile]] as {{convert|1852|m}}, more than {{convert|3|m}} less than the [[geographical mile]].

The [[Sea level|sea-level]] surface of the Earth (the [[geoid]]) is irregular, so the actual length of the Equator is not so easy to determine. ''[[Aviation week and space technology|Aviation Week and Space Technology]]'' on 9 October 1961 reported that measurements using the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] IV-A satellite had shown the equatorial "diameter" from longitude 11° West to 169° East to be {{convert|1000|ft}} greater than its "diameter" ninety degrees away.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Despite its name, no part of [[Equatorial Guinea]] lies on the Equator. However, its island of [[Annobón Province|Annobón]] is {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} south of the Equator, and the rest of the country lies to the north.

==Equatorial seasons and climate==
{{Main|Seasons|Tropics|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
[[File:seasons.svg|frame|right|&lt;br/&gt;Diagram of the seasons, depicting the situation at the December solstice. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the [[Earth]]’s rotation on its axis), the [[North Pole]] will be dark, and the [[South Pole]] will be illuminated; see also [[arctic winter]]. In addition to the density of [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]
Seasons result from the tilt of the Earth's axis compared to the plane of its revolution around the Sun. Throughout the year the northern and southern hemispheres are alternately turned either toward or away from the sun depending on Earth's position in its orbit. The hemisphere turned toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer, while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter (see [[solstice]]).

At the [[equinoxes]], the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun rather than tilted toward or away, meaning that day and night are both about 12 hours long across the whole of the Earth.

The Equator lies mostly on the three largest [[ocean]]s: the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Near the Equator there is little temperature change throughout the year, though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity. The terms summer, autumn, winter and spring do not generally apply. Lowlands around the Equator generally have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], also known as an equatorial climate, though cold currents cause some regions to have [[tropical monsoon climate]]s with a [[dry season]] in the middle of the year, and the [[Somali Current]] generated by [[Monsoon of South Asia|the Asian monsoon]] due to continental heating via the high [[Tibetan Plateau]] causes [[Greater Somalia]] to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location.

Average annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around {{convert|31|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the afternoon and {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} around sunrise. Rainfall is very high away from cold current upwelling zones, from {{convert|2500|to|3500|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} per year. There are about 200 rainy days per year and average annual sunshine hours are around 2,000. Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the [[Andes]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] have glaciers. The highest point on the Equator is at the elevation of {{convert|4690|m|0}}, at {{coord|0|0|0|N|77|59|31|W|type:landmark_region:EC|name=highest point on the Equator}}, found on the southern slopes of [[Volcán Cayambe]] [summit {{convert|5790|m|0}}] in [[Ecuador]]. This is slightly above the [[snow line]] and is the only place on the Equator where snow lies on the ground. At the Equator the snow line is around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} ''lower'' than on [[Mount Everest]] and as much as {{convert|2000|m|ft}} lower than the highest snow line in the world, near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on [[Llullaillaco]].

== Crossing-the-Equator ceremonies==
{{Main|Line-crossing ceremony}}

Certain navies, such as the [[Royal Navy]], [[Russian Navy]], and [[US Navy]], have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors' first crossing of the Equator. These ceremonial events have in the past been notorious for their brutality.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Milder line-crossing ceremonies, typically featuring [[Neptune (god)|King Neptune]], are also held for passengers' entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise ships.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">'''Origin of the name Kainuu''' has been a disputed subject among Finnish historians and linguistics. [[Kainuu]] is a region of Finland. The reason for the controversy is the speculated connection between areas known as [[Kainuu]] and [[Kvenland]], both historical lands in [[Fennoscandia]].

==Theory one: Swampy land==

As a part of his theory about the [[Origin of the name Kven|origin of the name "kven"]], professor of history in Oulu University [[Jouko Vahtola]] suggested that also the name "kainuu" would basically have the same origin. To prove his point, Vahtola constructed a hypothetical [[proto-Germanic]] word "*χwainō" that would have meant "swampy land".&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, J. (1994), Kvenerne – vem var de ursprungligen? In: Torekoven Strøm (eed.), Report from the seminar ”Kvenene – en glemt minoritet?” 14.11.94 at the University of Tromsø/Tromsø Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, J. (2001), Folk och folkgrupper inom det nordliga rummet över tid. In: Tedebrand, L.-G. &amp; Edlund, L.-E. (ed.), Tre kulturer i möte. Kulturens frontlinjer. Papers from the research program Kulturgräns norr, 27. Published by Johan Nordlander-sällskapet, 23. Umeå.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] support for this part of his theory has been reserved, as the expected [[etymology]] of *χwainō would not have been "kainuu" like Vahtola had thought. There is also no evidence that the word "kainuu" had ever been used in the meaning of "swampy land" in any Finnish dialects.&lt;ref name="Häkkinen, Kaisa 1996. page 178"&gt;Häkkinen, Kaisa. ''Suomalaisten esihistoria kielitieteen valossa.'' ({{ISBN|951-717-855-7}}) Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura 1996. See page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory two: Hole==

Professor of Germanic [[Philology]] in Helsinki University [[Jorma Koivulehto]] has proposed that "kainuu" is originally the same as the Germanic word for a hole or mouth, "*gain-". In the meaning "water-route" or "water-body", *Kainu- was originally a toponymic prefix in SW Finland, and during the Iron Age it was gradually established as the name of the land surrounding the northern coasts  Bothnian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Koivulehto, Jorma. ''Ala-Satakunnan Kainu ja pohjoisen Kainuu. - Kielen ja kulttuurin Satakunta.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically this etymology is seen as more acceptable.&lt;ref name="Häkkinen, Kaisa 1996. page 178"/&gt; The area originally known as [[Kainuu]] seems to have been the central part of [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] where [[Karelians]] could access the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] in the [[Middle Ages]], giving also conceptual support for the theory.

Noteworthy in this context is also the word "kainu", which is only known in lower [[Satakunta (region)|Satakunta]] in Finland. It had a completely different meaning being the middle stake in a work sled, also clearly deriving from *gain-.

Like the theory one, Koivulehto believes the words "kainu" and Kven to be interconnected. After the Germanic etymology of the *Kainu- names was forgotten, the name was adopted in the Scandinavian dialects in a new form.

==Theory three: Sami background ==

Similar sounding words to "kainuu" also exist in the [[Sami languages]]. In [[North Samic]], ''Gáidnu'' is a rope made of roots for boats or fishing nets. ''Gáidnulaŝ'' refers to a clumsy person and ''Geaidnu'' stands for a road or a way.&lt;ref&gt;Álgu-database&lt;/ref&gt; In the early saami dictionaries ''Kainolats'' had the meaning Norwegian or Swedish man while ''Kainalats'' had the meaning Norwegian or Swedish women, it could also have the meaning peasant. Helsing-by or Torneå was referred to as ''Cainho''.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon lapponicum, Erik Lindahl, Johann Öhrling, Typis Joh. Georg. Lange, 1780"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}

This is a list of the '''extreme points of Europe''': the geographical points that are higher or farther north, south, east or west than any other location in [[Europe]]. Some of these positions are open to debate, as the [[definition of Europe]] is diverse.

==Extremes of the European continent, including islands==
[[File:Southernmost point of europe.jpg|thumb|Southernmost point on the island of [[Gavdos]], [[Greece]]]]
*'''Northernmost point'''. [[Cape Fligely]], [[Rudolf Island]], [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Russia]] (81° 48′ 24″ N).{{dubious|date=March 2015}} Franz Josef Land is near the ill-defined border between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]; if it is not considered a part of Europe, then the northernmost point is on the island of [[Rossøya]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]] ([[81st parallel north|81°N]]).
*'''Southernmost point'''. Cape Trypiti, [[Gavdos]] Island, [[Greece]] (34° 48′ 02″ N) is the least ambiguous southernmost point of Europe. However, there are other contenders, depending on definition. The island of [[Cyprus]] has cultural links with Europe; its southernmost point is the British base at [[RAF Akrotiri|Akrotiri]] (34°35′N). The Portuguese islands of [[Madeira]] are borderline between Europe and [[Africa]]; their southernmost point is the [[Savage Islands]] (30°8′43″N). [[La Restinga]] on the island of [[El Hierro]] (27°45′N) in the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] is yet further south and could be considered politically, though not [[physiographic]]ally as part of Europe.
*'''Westernmost point'''.  [[Monchique Islet]], [[Azores Islands]], [[Portugal]] (31° 16′ 30″ W) (If considered part of Europe, though it sits on the [[North American Plate]]). If not, then the [[Capelinhos]] Volcano, [[Faial Island]], [[Azores Islands]], [[Portugal]] (28° 50′ 00″ W), the westernmost point of the [[Eurasian Plate]] above sea level.
*'''Easternmost point'''. [[Cape Flissingsky]] (69° 02′ E), [[Severny Island]], [[Novaya Zemlya]], Russia.

==Mainland Europe==
*'''Northernmost point'''. [[Cape Nordkinn]] (Kinnarodden), [[Norway]] (71°08′02″N 27°39′00″E)
*'''Southernmost point'''. [[Punta de Tarifa]], [[Spain]] (36° 00′ 15″ N)
*'''Westernmost point'''. [[Cabo da Roca]], [[Portugal]] (9°29'56.44 W).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WETillZI8rwC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Dunmore+Head+most+westerly+point+of+Europe&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d_ZxU77yMsKu7AaCqIHgDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dunmore%20Head%20most%20westerly%20point%20of%20Europe&amp;f=false Statistical Account of the British Empire: 1/ by J. R. Macculloch], retrieved 13 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Ireland]], which is part of the European [[continental shelf]] and which was connected to the continent by land during the [[last glacial period#Europe|last glacial period]], includes points that are further west than Cabo da Roca (see [[Extreme points of Ireland#Whole island|Extreme points of Ireland]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Easternmost point'''.  The easternmost point is dependent upon the various definitions of Europe's eastern border. Utilizing the most common definition of Europe's eastern edge (the [[Continental divide|watershed divide]] of the [[Ural Mountains]]), the easternmost point of the Ural watershed (and thus mainland Europe) lies on an unnamed 545 metre peak at {{Coord|68|18|37|N|66|37|05|E|type:landmark_region:RU_dim:100km_source:enwiki}} as shown on various detailed maps such as the Soviet General Staff maps and as shown on [[Google Earth]]/Maps.  This peak is 17&amp;nbsp;km northeast of an 875-metre peak named Gora Anoraga and 60&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Ostrov Lediyev (island) on Arctic waters south of the Kara Sea.

==Elevation==
*'''Highest point'''. The highest point is dependent upon the definition of Europe:
**The [[Caucasus|Caucasus Mountains]] [[Drainage divide|watershed]] divide is the most common definition for the European/Asian border. This places the highest point at [[Mount Elbrus]], Russia (5,642 metres; 18,506 feet), which is 11&amp;nbsp;km onto the European side of the Caucasus watershed divide.
**If the Caucasus mountains are excluded, the highest point is [[Mont Blanc]], on the border between France and Italy (4,810 metres; 15,781 feet).
*'''Lowest point (natural, with open sky)'''. [[Caspian Sea]] shore, Russia (28 metres; 92 feet below sea level).
*'''Lowest point (natural, under water)'''. [[Calypso Deep]], Greece (5,267 metres; 17,280 feet below sea level).
*'''Lowest point (natural, underground)'''. Dependent upon the definition of Europe: either [[Krubera Cave]], Abkhazia, Georgia (2196 metres; 7205 feet below surface) (also the deepest cave of the world)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klimchouck|first=Alexander|title=The deepest cave in the world (Krubera Cave) became 6 m deeper|url=http://www.speleogenesis.info/news/?id=213|work=speleogenesis.info.|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Lamprechtsofen]], Austria (1,632 metres; 5,354 feet below surface).
*'''Lowest point (artificial, with open sky)'''. [[Hambach surface mine]] ([[open-pit mining|open-pit mine]]), Germany (293 metres; 961 feet below sea level). Also deepest of the world.

{{Distinguish|Federation}}
{{Redirect|Federated states|the country near [[Southeast Asia]]|Federated States of Micronesia}}

A '''federated state''' (which may also be referred to by [[endonyms|various terms]] such as a '''state''', a '''province''', a '''[[canton (country subdivision)|canton]]''', a '''land''') is a territorial and [[constitution]]al community forming part of a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Australian National Dictionary: Fourth Edition'', pg 1395. (2004) Canberra. {{ISBN|978-0-19-551771-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such states differ from fully [[sovereign state]]s, in that they have transferred a portion of their [[sovereignty|sovereign]] powers to a [[federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt10.html Constitution of the United States of America: Tenth Amendment, Reserved Powers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309052417/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt10.html |date=2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, when states choose to federate, they lose their standing as entities of international law. Instead, the federal union as a single entity becomes the [[sovereign state]] for purposes of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, J. (2006). The Creation of States in International Law. Oxford, Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A federated state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of [[administrative division|regional government]].

In some cases, a federation is created from a union of political entities, which are either independent, or [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of another sovereign entity (most commonly a [[colonial power]]).&lt;ref&gt;Examples are [[Australia]] and the [[United States]].&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, federated states have been created out of the regions of previously [[unitary state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This occurred in Belgium in 1993. The Belgian regions had previously devolved powers.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a federal constitution is formed, the rules governing the relationship between federal and regional powers become part of the country's constitutional law and not [[public international law|international law]].

In countries with federal constitutions, there is a division of power between the central government and the component states. These entities - states, provinces, counties, cantons, Länder, etc. - are partially [[self-government|self-governing]] and are afforded a degree of constitutionally guaranteed [[autonomy]] that varies substantially from one federation to another.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Canadian provinces and Swiss cantons possess substantially more powers and enjoy more protection against interference and infringments from the central government than most non-Western federations.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the form the [[decentralization]] of powers takes, a federated state's legislative powers may or may not be overruled or [[veto]]ed by the federal government. [[Law]]s governing the relationship between federal and regional powers can be amended through the federal constitution, and, if they exist, [[Constitution#Distribution of sovereignty|state constitutions]] as well.

== Differences in terminology ==
Federated states typically, though not necessarily, use differences in the terminology of institutions to which there is an analogous federal-level equivalent. This list is a demonstration of common—though neither exhaustive nor universal—terminology differences between the state and federal levels:

== List of constituents by federation ==
The "federated units" in the table below have inherent governmental authority in the federation's constitutional system, while the "other units" are delegated authority by the federal government or are administered directly by it (see [[federal district]] and [[federal territory]]).

&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; indicates federal capital (or federated units that contain it).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; indicates actively disputed territory by other sovereign states or the international community.

'''Foy's Lake''' is a man-made [[lake]] in [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]. It was created in 1924 by constructing a dam across the stream that came down from the hills in the northern part of Chittagong. The purpose of creating an artificial lake was to provide water to the residents of railway colony. It was named after Mr Foy who was a  Railway engineer and believed to materialize the project. Pahartali was basically a railway town with workshop, yard and shed. A good number of railway employees live there. Presently, a carriage workshop, diesel workshop, loco shed, laboratory, stores, electric workshop, school (established in 1924) are located.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3144">'''German Naval Grid Reference''', (German:''Gradnetzmeldeverfahren''), was a system for referencing a location on a map. Introduced initially by the German [[Luftwaffe]] just before [[World War II]], it was used widely in the German armed forces until 1943. Each armed force had its own version of this reference.

The reference used in the ’Gradnetzmeldeverfahren’ can be viewed as a short form of the position in full, without a real translation or encoding.

In the [[Kriegsmarine]] version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/maps/grid.html |title=The War in Maps - The Grid system |last=Helgason |first=Guðmundur |publisher=uboat.net |date=1995-01-01|website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the entire globe was divided into large square sectors, each with its unique two-letter designation (e.g. AE, AF, BA, BB, etc.) with each square called a quadrant 486 nautical miles to a side. E.g CA covered the East Coast of the United States from about Portsmouth, Hampshire south to Cape Fear, North Carolina. Each such sector was further sub-divided into a 3 x 3 matrix, so that there were nine squares. Each of the nine squares were again divided into nine smaller squares.

This was known as a Grid, so that there were now 81 total grid squares within a sector. Each grid was given a two-digit designation, so the Grid System would now have two alphabets and two digits. Each of these Grids were again divided in the same manner – first into a 3 x 3 matrix, and then each matrix was divided into nine squares, so that a further 81 squares were formed within the Grid. Each newly formed square was again given a two digit designation. The complete Grid System would now read as two alphabets with four digits. This can be referred to as the patrol zone. Thus the ''Kriegsmarine'' could pinpoint any location on the globe using six characters, a very useful tool when using radio. Its precision was to the level of six nautical miles within a grid. This was how locations were communicated to naval units, particularly [[U-boats]]. Thus grid location AN1879 denoted a location east of Northern [[Scotland]], just below [[Scapa Flow]].

For example, major grid AJ is located south of Greenland. Each submarine was equipped with an Adressbuch to decipher the locations.

As the war advanced, the Germans suspected that the Allies were deciphering their patrol reports. As a precautionary measure they transmitted patrol zones by using coded sectors.

Thus instead of transmitting the actual patrol zone, they would use an offset, so that any zone that was transmitted over the waves would be an offset of a secret location. This secret location was changed at random intervals, and U-boat captains would calculate the new patrol zone based on the offset.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">The '''History of Cartography Project''' is a publishing project in the Department of Geography at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. It was founded by [[David Woodward]] in 1981. Woodward directed the project until his death in August 2004; [[Matthew H. Edney]] became director in July 2005.

== ''The History of Cartography'' ==
The Project works to prepare ''The History of Cartography'', a multivolume series established by Woodward and [[John Brian Harley|Brian Harley]]. This effort is funded by generous grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Science Foundation]], various private foundations, and numerous individuals.

The six volumes of the ''History'', all published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], are:

* '''1.''' Harley, J. B. and David Woodward. (eds.). ''[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/index.html  Cartography in Prehistoric, Ancient, and Medieval Europe and the Mediterranean]''. 1987. {{ISBN|9780226316338}}

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Harley and Woodward's initial scheme was for a four-volume series, each volume to contain several full-length chapters by different authors, all to be published by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Harley and Woodward|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Woodward|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was followed for Volumes 1 through 3, but as the scope of the project grew Volume 2 was divided into three physical parts, and Volume 3 into two parts. The growth of Volume 3 to have been larger than the entire series as originally conceived demonstrated how unfeasible the established format would be for what was now planned as the final three volumes, dealing with the modern period. Woodward therefore decided, after much consultation, to turn the volumes into interpretive encyclopedias.

'''Jacques Lévy''' is a professor of geography and urbanism at the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering of the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL). He is the director of Chôros Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;http://choros.epfl.ch/page-13739-fr.html&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Doctoral Program in Architecture and Science of the City.&lt;ref&gt;http://phd.epfl.ch/edar&lt;/ref&gt; He is the cofounder of the scientific journal ''EspacesTemps.net'' ({{ISSN|1777-5477}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History | url = http://www.espacestemps.net/en/historical/ | website = espacestemps.net | publisher = EspacesTemps.net | access-date = 28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published in French, along with Michel Lussault, the dictionary of geography and space of societies, ''Dictionnaire de la géographie et de l’espace des sociétés''.He has contributed to in the epistemological and theoretical reform of geography as a science of the spatial dimension of the social, open to the social sciences and philosophy. Starting from political geography, he has most notably explored the city, urbanity, Europe and globalization. He works also for the introduction of non-verbal languages, especially audio-visual languages, at all levels of research. In 2013 he made a feature film, ''Urbanity/ies'', which is intended as a manifesto for scientific film.

== Biography ==
[[File:Remise du prix Vautrin-Lud à Jacques Lévy-FIG 2018 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Jacques Lévy being awarded the 2018 [[Vautrin Lud Prize]].]]
Born in Paris in 1952, Jacques Lévy got his geography ''Agrégation'' [national competitive examination] at the University of Paris VII in 1974. In 1975, he became co-founder and coordinator of the editorial board of the magazine ''EspacesTemps''. In 1984, he was hired by the CNRS as a researcher and obtained his PhD in 1993 with a thesis in political geography on ''legitimate space''. In 1993, he was named university professor at Reims. He was a senior lecturer and then professor at l'Institut d 'études politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) from 1999 to 2007 and has been a visiting professor at the University of New York, Los Angeles (UCLA), Naples (IUO), São Paulo (USP), Mexico (Cátedra Reclus), Sydney (Macquarie University), Bergamo (Università degli Studi di Bergamo), Liège (ULiège) and a fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2003-2004). Since 2001, he has sevred as an advisor to the French Ministry of research. He is co-director of the free social science journal ''EspacesTemps.net'' and of the ''L’espace en société'' collection at the Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes.He has been nominated for the Grand Prix International de l’Urbanisme (2017).
	
A political geography specialist, he has conducted numerous research missions on urbanity in cities in North and South countries, and is an active participant in the debate on cities, regional development and the relationship between space and politics, Europe and globalization.

== Major theoretical contributions ==

Jacques Lévy’s work concerns the spatial dimension of societies, with a focus on political spaces. He developed a new approach on geography in his most comprehensive book ''L’espace légitime'' in which he analyzes the geographic dimension of the political function. His researches on the legitimate scale of politics include works on the city, France, Europe and the World. The notion of urbanity is also central in his work. He also supports the relevance of using non verbal languages as scientific means for researchers, especially cartography and cinema.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/84507071&lt;/ref&gt; He is the director of a scientific film named Urbanity/ies. Conducted in interdisciplinary groups, his research focuses on such topics as urban models, mobility, the micro-geography of public spaces and the extent of globalization in metropolitan areas. His work also embraces sociology, anthropology, architecture and human geography, skillfully combining both theory and the realization of concrete projects. Within the Direction à l'aménagement du territoire et à l'action régionale (DATAR) in Paris, he has notably developed practices of participatory mapping that seek to fully involving the populations concerned.

=== Epistemology of geography and the theory of the social ===

He has actively been involved in the epistemological and theoretical reform of geography since as 1975, arguing that the latter is defined as the study of the spatial dimension of the social. The inclusion of geography in the “common trunk of social sciences” led him to develop “realistic constructivism,” a general epistemology, starting in 1994 and then in 1999. The latter seeks to make the best use of the constructivist approach (knowledge is invention) while asserting the specificity of the regime of truth of the scientific project as the cognitive goal. He likewise built a social theory based on “dialogic systemism,” i.e. a vision of society as a whole that is sensitive to the action of the actors within it and which diverges from both structuralism and methodological individualism. In the 2000s and 2010s he continued in the same vein, introducing an actor/object/environment triptych that made it possible to take into account the contributions of an “actor turn” in thinking on non-human agents, and generalize the concept of environment by refusing to limit social aggregates to "assemblages." He is part of an informal network that includes several French-speaking geographers, including Christian Grataloup, Denis Retaillé, Michel Lussault, Mathis Stock, Olivier Lazzarotti, Anne Volvey, Boris Beaude and Marc Dumont, as well as English, Italian, German and Portuguese geographers and non-geographers, including sociologists, political scientists, historians, cartographers, planners and developers.

=== Theory of space ===

Since 1994, one of Jacques Lévy’s main contributions is the formalization of a theory of social space, most notably through the building of a vocabulary that reworks basic concepts while making them coherent. The definition of space as a set of relationships of distance, in a Leibnizian perspective, helps in escaping Newtonian and Cartesian absolutism and identifying the two major attributes of space (metrics and scale) in close connection with that which, in social reality, is not spatial (substance). The territory/network, topography/topology and place/area duos, as well as his work on “interspatialities” (interaction, co-presence, nesting and “synchorization”{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does this word mean? It's not in any major English dictionary, according to onelook.com}}) complete the basic glossary that the Dictionary of geography and space of the societes developed with the contributions of more than one hundred authors representative of contemporary social sciences of space. Space as an environment and spatiality as an action thus appear to be the basis of "geographicity" thus redefined. Since 2001, Lévy has revisited the concept of dwelling based on a re- historicized integration of the contributions of Martin Heidegger, in which there is tension between space and spatiality, that is, between enclosing but fragile environments and enclosed but strategic actors.

=== Political geography  ===

As early as 1984, in analyzing the municipal elections in Paris, he showed the existence of a political space that was not reducible to the distribution of social groups defined on the basis of socio-economic criteria. His doctoral thesis focused on the intersection of the two dimensions of the social: the political and the spatial. The resulting book, ''L’Espace Légitime'', is an exploration of the junction of these dimensions. First, it clarifies the concepts of politics regulated within a society by legitimacy versus geopolitics regulated between societies through violence. Moreover, the empirical corpus largely consists of French election results since World War II. Since 1997, this analytical work has been supplemented by numerous electoral studies on the France, Switzerland, the European Union and the United States, often published in newspapers and scientific journals. It appears that, when questions of openness (to Europe, migrants, religions or minority sexual orientations) arise, the electoral space is highly sensitive to gradients of urbanity. Central areas of large cities are often favorable to such otherness while those in peri-urban areas and smaller towns are more reticent or even hostile.

=== The city and urbanity  ===

Starting 1983, he began work on the city which would gradually become a general theory of urbanity. The concept of urbanity, based on the multidimensional combination of density and diversity, allows for a convergence of all the work of the social sciences on the city. This makes it possible to overcome morphological tropisms and break from the historical European matrix to study the urbanization process and the dynamics of urban societies without bias. He shows that, in developed countries and soon throughout the world, urbanization is ending. Distinctions between rural and urban are giving way to internal differences of the urban world, which he calls gradients of urbanity. In the tradition of Henri Lefebvre and Jane Jacobs, he stresses the fact that urbanity is a social reality, a developmental horizon and a political issue as such, challenging economistic and communitarian approaches like those of the North American Marxists, and instead claiming the relevance of space as an interpretive lens of urbanity.

This led him to criticize the use of the concept - in itself questionable - of "gentrification" to describe processes that increase social diversity in a neighborhood. Regarding urban planning practices, he is developing a theory of public space as a multi-scale concentrate of urbanity, where intimacy unfolds not less than in the private sphere, and wherein a way of doing politics based essentially on interaction and civility functions. The concept of public space (öffentlicher Raum), though separated from the more general one of public sphere (Kant and Habermas’s Öffentlichkeit) convergence with works hitherto little connected: those of Norbert Elias on the society of individuals, those of Erving Goffman on interactions in public and those of Lyn Lofland on the “public realm.” He highlighted the role of serendipity as a particularly effective creative force in the public space.

He has also incorporated mobility into his thinking by linking transport with the issue of public space and encouraging researchers to give greater consideration to walking. With François Ascher and Sylvain Allemand he organized a conference at Cerisy in 2003 and edited Les sens du mouvement, Belin, 2004. At the EPFL, he works in collaboration with sociologist Vincent Kaufmann on mobility issues. He currently heads the PostCarWorld network research program (2014-2016), which brings together a multidisciplinary group of Swiss researchers to propose sociological, geographical, architectural and technical simulations of a world without cars.

This conceptual work is fueled by numerous field studies, particularly in the world’s largest cities. He has developed a method based on free exploration of urban environments, mostly on foot, to facilitate comparisons by the body, and the scales and metrics of different cities. It is in this regard that his work is in the tradition of those of Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Guy Debord and Michel de Certeau.  A feature film, Urbanité/s, produced by the Chôros laboratory in 2013, sums up in images the entire approach, while at the same time being intended as a manifesto of scientific cinema.

He has criticized certain schools of thought in North American geography and sociology, led most notably by David Harvey and Neil Smith, for their inability to take into account the profound nature of urbanity by reducing it to a clash between communities or economic or political domination. He has characterized this movement, with its strong activist focus combining Marxism and culturalism and promoting the defense of the homogeneity of the slums, as "neo-structuralist," whereas for Jacques Lévy, urban development should aim for sociological and functional diversity.

From these theoretical and empirical explorations he concludes that the debate on desirable urbanity has becomes polarized around two models of urbanity: one is the “Amsterdam model,” which accepts urbanity and the exposure to otherness this implies, while the other - the “Johannesburg model” - rejects it, accepting urbanity only reluctantly by seeking to privatize everything that can be privatized. According to him, the first model, if adopted by inhabitants, tends to produce a “collected city” one finds mainly in large city centers in Europe and Asia. The second model, on the other hand, produces the "scattered and fragmented urbanity" often found in small towns and city outskirts in North America and Africa.

=== Globalization and World-society ===

Since 1991 and his work - first didactic, then theoretical - with Marie-Françoise Durand and Denis Retaillé, he has developed a theory of globalization using four "explanatory models" (the world as a collection of worlds, the world as a force field, the world as a hierarchical network and the world as a society), each of which considers a dimension of today’s world but not all of its reality. This means that, since 1996, he has insisted that the challenge of the contemporary phase is the construction of a World-society. In the collective work ''L’invention du Monde'', which he edited in 2008, he linked various components of today’s world (including the Earth as one of the "natures of humanity") and suggested a periodization of globalization in seven phases, the first being the spread of Homo sapiens across the planet. By analyzing recent events, he confirmed the impossibility of explaining the current dynamics using only geopolitical or economic logics, as well as the need to observe the emergence of a society of individuals at the global scale through the appropriate "lenses." In ''Europe: A geography'' he laid out the main concepts of geography, including those he tested at the global scale, to approach the highly complex space that is Europe through its history and geography.

=== Cartography ===

Since 2002 and in a more systematic way in 2004, he identified a gap between what he calls a “geographical turn” and the state of mapping. Since 1994 he has sought to use innovative mapping languages but came to the conclusion that only a “geographical turn” could connect the spatial language of maps with the theoretical demands of geography and the evolution of the world, most notably characterized by mobility, the emergence of individual spatial actors and globalization—some of the many challenges of traditional mapping. One of the evolutionary paths he explores is the broadening of the range of cartographic techniques and semiotics to escape from a "Euclidean prison," which cannot correctly process both cities and the global scale. More specifically, he developed the use of cartograms by developing the software ScapeToad, an auto-extensive (i.e. without background) and animation map, with his team. In the Chôros laboratory, he regularly produces both maps and theoretical reflection on mapping, drawing on history as well as other mapping techniques (e.g. non-Western schools, maps from stateless societies and from contemporary art). In 2016, he edited a comprehensive synthesis about the different aspects of this “cartographic turn”.

=== Spatial justice and France ===

His interest in France as a unique space has always been obvious in his work through urban issues. He then connected the latter with his analyses of political space. Since 1996 he has been the scientific advisor for the journal Pouvoirs locaux, and contributes to French society’s debate on the organization and governance of its territories. Similarly, he has participated, as a researcher, in many of the projects and studies led by the French institution DATAR - which became CEGET (Commissariat général à l’égalité des territories - general Commission for equality of the Territories) in 2014. More recently, he has been reworking a problem originally launched in 19941 – that of spatial justice, dealing with the concept in general and applying it to France specifically. On this point his approach differs from Ed Soja’s neo-structuralist one by proposing a view of spatial justice based on urbanity, inhabiting and the co-production of public goods.
In 2013 he published Réinventer la France, which takes stock of the end of urbanization and stipulates the idea - already put forth by Pierre Veltz and Jean Viard - of an archipelago society, to be understood here as a series of urban areas that resemble one another more so than their hinterlands, and whose differences are internal to them, by gradients of urbanity. In this book, he shows that the gap between the reality of the French space and the map of political territories is not only archaic but also unjust. Hence, his reflection is on spatial justice that addresses territorial divisions, taxation, urban planning, and public health and education policies. He concludes that space and the issues surrounding it (urbanity, mobility, dwelling, etc.) should be addressed with a view to co-producing public goods with inhabitants. In the same spirit, he has participated in the debate on "territorial reform" initiated by the Government in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8586">'''Jean Grove''' (''née'' Clark; 10 March 1927 – 17 January 2001) was a British [[Physical geography|physical geographer]] and [[glaciologist]] known for her comprehensive study of [[climate change]] in the [[Little Ice Age]] across the world.

== Early life and education ==
Born Jean Mary Clark to Mary Johnson Clark, one of the first women chemists at [[Cambridge University]], she grew up with a keen interest in science in a family that enjoyed mountaineering.   Jean Grove had tubercolosis as a child and for a year lived in a summer house in the garden. There she read widely, including books on exploration, geology and astronomy, and was taught by her mother. During the War the family moved to St  Asaph, North Wales. Jean Grove attended Howell's School, Denbigh, where [[Marjorie Sweeting]], later a Professor in the Geography Department at Oxford, was teaching. Marjorie Sweeting was a major influence and Jean decided to read geography at her mother's former College, Newnham.

She attended [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] and earned a degree in geography in 1948, then earned her Ph.D. in glaciology from [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] in 1956. She married [[Alfred Thomas Grove]] in 1954, while working on her doctorate and working as a part-time lecturer, and had six children, the first, historian [[Richard Grove]], in 1955 and the last in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Grove  [née Clark], Jean Mary (1927–2001), geographer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulbe|first=Christina L.|last2=Wang|first2=Weili|last3=Ommanney|first3=Simon|date=2010-12-01|title=Women in glaciology, a historical perspective|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/igsoc/jog/2010/00000056/00000200/art00002|journal=Journal of Glaciology|volume=56|issue=200|pages=944–964|doi=10.3189/002214311796406202|bibcode=2010JGlac..56..944H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research ==

She much enjoyed a Long Vacation field trip to the Jotunheim mountains of Norway in 1947, led by W. Vaughan Lewis, [[Gordon Manley]] and Ronald Peel. Professor  [[Frank Debenham]], and Dr Jean Mitchell provided much encouragement and in the next three years Jean herself led small parties of students to Norway. Subsequently, she joined several University glaciological expeditions. The aim of the first of these in 1951, organised by Lewis and John McCall, an American research student, was for undergraduate labour to excavate a tunnel into Vesl-Skautbreen, a cirque glacier, to investigate its structure and flow characteristics. The effort was successful in reaching the headwall of the glacier and thereby provided graduates in geography, geology and mineralogy with the opportunity to make observations which laid the basis for post-war British glaciological research. Grove examined the banding on and in Veslskautbreen and Veslgjuvbreen and gained her PhD in 1956 for this work – 'A study of aspects of the physiography of certain glaciers in Norway'. She produced two chapters in the 'Investigations on Norwegian Cirque Glaciers' (Royal Geographical Society Research Series: number 4, 1960) edited by Lewis, which brought together this innovative work, and published three other papers on the nature of these glaciers.

From 1951-53 she lectured at Bedford College, London, under Gordon Manley. She was then appointed Director of Studies in Geography at Girton and became a Fellow in 1960 and Emeritus in 1994. Jean Clark had met A.T. (Dick) Grove, newly appointed to the Geography Department. He assisted with the surveying in Norway. They married in 1954 and settled in Cambridge. In 1963, with their young family, they spent 6 months in Ghana teaching at Legon University.

Jean Grove's research continued to involve glaciers but increasingly it turned towards a subject, then somewhat neglected, namely historical climatology, following in the footsteps of Gordon Manley and [[Hubert Lamb]]. It was known that glaciers in the Alps had extended well beyond their present limits, leaving behind moraines dating from roughly 1600CE to 1900CE, the period known as the 'Little Ice Age'. Jean sought 'proxy' data for the instrumental climatic record in the Alps and elsewhere. She and Arthur Battagel, a relation by marriage, made use of the information about climatic and glacial damage to farmland in Norway provided by land tax records. It remained unclear whether the Little Ice Age was globally synchronous and so she proceeded to collect information from the field and from archives in many parts of the world. In 1988 her magnum opus, 'The Little Ice Age', was published (Methuen).  This provided the first comprehensive study of the phenomenon.  A second edition, edited by Dick Grove, was published in 2004.

== Educational legacy ==
Jean Grove's academic output, in terms of books and papers, was not enormous by today's standards, yet her influence was substantial.  Many of her protégés at Girton have become distinguished academics and many have made their marks in other professions.  Her supportive attitude was much valued. In particular, Girton geographers were encouraged, even required, to do fieldwork abroad and as a result their final year dissertations were accomplished in many remote parts of the world.  It is fitting that there is now a 'Jean Grove Travel Scholarship' for undergraduates at Girton College.

== The Jean Grove Trust ==
The [http://jeangrovetrust.org.uk/ Jean Grove Trust] is a [[Roman Catholic]] charity named in her honour, and associated with [[Cambridge Blackfriars]], of which Grove was an active lay member. It supports several schools in [[Ethiopia]], and was founded in 1999 after a suggestion of hers to stay in touch with and aid some [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]] priests that had visited Blackfriars.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeangrovetrust.org.uk/?page_id=7|title=History|publisher=The Jean Grove Trust|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Thomas Grove]] is a trustee.

'''(John) Brian Harley''' ({{Birth date|df=yes|1932|7|24}} – {{Death date|df=yes|1991|12|20}}) was a geographer, cartographer, and map historian at the universities of [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[University of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee|Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. He helped found the [[History of Cartography Project]] and was the founding co-editor of the resulting The History of Cartography. In recent years, Harley's work has gained broad prominence among geographers and social theorists, and it has contributed greatly to the emerging discipline of [[critical cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew H. Edney, ''The Origins and Development of J. B. Harley's Cartographic Theories'', Cartographica Monograph 54, ''Cartographica'' 40, nos. 1 &amp; 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Harley was born in [[Ashley, Gloucestershire|Ashley]], Gloucestershire. From 1943 to 1950 he attended [[Brewood Grammar School]] near [[Wolverhampton]]. After [[National Service in the United Kingdom#After 1945|national service]] Harley gained a place at [[Birmingham University]] in 1952. After gaining his Dip Ed from [[University College, Oxford]] in 1956, he returned to Birmingham, gaining a PhD in 1960 for work on the historical geography of medieval Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Laxton, ''Harley, (John) Brian (1932–1991)'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Harley married Amy Doreen in 1957. He began teaching at [[Queensbridge School]], [[Moseley]], but was offered an assistant lecturership in geography at [[Liverpool University]] and took up the post in January 1959. In Liverpool Harley turned to the [[history of cartography]], producing ''[[Christopher Greenwood (cartographer)|Christopher Greenwood]], County Map-Maker'' (1962).

In 1969 Harley resigned from Liverpool to become an editor with publishers [[David and Charles]] in [[Newton Abbot]]. Harley commissioned a number of works, but by March 1970 he was appointed as a lecturer at the [[University of Exeter]], becoming Montefiore Reader in 1972. In 1972, he published ''Maps for the local historian'' which introduced the use of maps to many amateur historians.

His main focus at Exeter was the history of the [[Ordnance Survey]]. He produced notes for the David and Charles reprints of the first edition one-inch maps, wrote ''Ordnance Survey Maps: a Descriptive Manual'' (1975), and a substantial part of the official history of the Ordnance Survey (1978).

From the 1970s Harley turned to a philosophical view of maps. In 1985 he was awarded a [[DLitt]] by the University of Birmingham.

Harley served on the council of the [[Institute of British Geographers]] (1971–74). But despite his academic distinction, he didn't secure promotion in Britain. After the death of his wife and son, Harley relocated to the United States in 1986, when he was appointed professor of geography at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Here he worked on the multi-volume ''History of Cartography'' with [[David Woodward]]. He was also involved in controversies over the [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] celebrations, writing ''Maps and the Columbian Encounter'' (1990), and was due to give twelve public lectures on the topic in 1992.

Harley died suddenly of a heart attack on 20 December 1991. He was cremated in Milwaukee, and his ashes were interred at [[Newton Abbot]], Devon.  Shortly before he died he proposed a new book combining a selection of essays, eventually published in 2001 as ''The New Nature of Maps'' (ed. P. Laxton).

==Legacy==
The J. B. Harley Research Trust was set up in London in 1992. This trust provides Harley Fellowships to permit scholars from around the world to conduct advanced research in the history of cartography at archives and libraries throughout the United Kingdom.

[[File:Burj Al Arab, Dubai, by Joi Ito Dec2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burj Al Arab]], Hotel]]

This is a '''list of hotels in Dubai'''. [[Dubai]] leads in the world's highest hotel occupancy rates. In 2006, the Dubai hotel occupancy rate was 86%, the highest ever in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaishortstay.com/12-dubai-hotel.asp |title= Hotels in Dubai |publisher= Dubaishortstay.com |accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the city had 167 hotels with 9,383 rooms, while the number shot up to 272 hotels and doubled the number of rooms to 23,170 in 2002. In 2005, it increased to 28,999 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/features/abu-dhabi-and-dubai-plan-tourism-ventures-to-attract-more-visitors-1.220768 |title= Dubai Plan Tourism Ventures to Attract More Visitors |publisher= Gulfnews.com |accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the hotel rooms jumped to 43,419, with 6,105,813 hotel guests and a 70 percent occupancy rate. In 2009, the number of hotel rooms increased to 58,188. In 2010, it jumped to 67,369 rooms, an increase of 9,181 in one year due to the massive rise in visitor arrivals. Dubai hosted a record 10 million visitors in 2012, an increase of 9.3% from the previous year.

In  2013 more than 32,686 hotel rooms were planned, including 17,162 hotel rooms which were under construction.&lt;ref name="Hotels in Dubai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/hotels-in-dubai.php |title= Hotels in Dubai |publisher= Dubaifaqs.com |accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 new hotels opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuoni.co.uk/en/travel-industry-news/pages/dubai-reports-growth-in-visitors-197.aspx |title= Dubai Reports Growth in Visitors |publisher= Kuoni.co.uk |accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the occupancy rate was at 81 percent, the second highest ever for Dubai; however, throughout the year, the occupancy rate settled at 71 percent, an increase of one percent from 2009.&lt;ref name="Hotels Occupancy Rates in Dubai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/ttn_193189.html |title= Hotels Occupancy Rates in Dubai |publisher= Tradearabia.com |accessdate= 30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city’s hotels experienced a decline of 4.2 percent in revenue per available room (RevPAR), which reached $154 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Hotels Occupancy Rates in Dubai"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1292">This is a list of British place names that commemorate non-Christian religions. Many of them refer to the old Germanic religion. There are 3 types of such names:
*Places named after [[deity|god]]s.
*Places named after [[temple]]s.
*Places named after men with [[theophoric]] names, such as [[Thurlstone]] = "[[Thor]]-[[wolf]]'s farmstead"; but none are listed here yet.

Note that the common English place name [[Thorley (disambiguation)|Thorley]] came from "[[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Thorn]]-ley".

[[File:Logo Sign.svg|thumb|300px|alt=A blue sign consisting of the words "Food-Exit 44" and the logos of the following fast food restaurants: Blimpie, IHOP, KFC, McDonald's, and Subway|An example of a typical American logo sign]]
'''Logo signs''' (also known as '''specific service signs''' or '''Logo service signs''', or colloquially as '''Big Blue Signs''') are [[blue]] [[Traffic sign|road signs]] used on freeways that display the logos of businesses prior to an [[interchange (road)|interchange]].  Typically, a business pays fees to a transportation department (or to a subcontractor of a transportation department such as [[Lamar Advertising]] subsidiary Interstate Logos) to have their [[logo]]s displayed on a large panel alongside other [[business]]es.

==History==
===In the United States===
In the [[United States]], logo signs were permitted on rural [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]]s in 1965 as part of the [[Highway Beautification Act]].  Originally, such signs were limited to the following categories: gas, food, lodging, and camping.  The 1976 amendments to the Highway Beautification Act expanded the program to federal-aid primary rural highways.  In 2000, provisions for allowing logo signs on urban highways (as long as adequate sign spacing can be maintained) were added to the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]; however, as of 2018 not all states have adopted these provisions, with some states (such as [[California Department of Transportation|California]] and [[New York State Department of Transportation|New York]]) continuing to restrict the installation of logo signs to rural highways only.  As of 2018, logo signs are permitted on urban highways in 18 states ([[Arizona Department of Transportation|Arizona]], [[Colorado Department of Transportation|Colorado]], [[Florida Department of Transportation|Florida]], [[Georgia Department of Transportation|Georgia]], [[Iowa Department of Transportation|Iowa]], [[Louisiana Department of Transportation|Louisiana]], [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation|Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota Department of Transportation|Minnesota]], [[Nevada Department of Transportation|Nevada]], [[New Jersey Department of Transportation|New Jersey]], [[North Carolina Department of Transportation|North Carolina]], [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon]], [[Tennessee Department of Transportation|Tennessee]], [[Texas Department of Transportation|Texas]], [[Utah Department of Transportation|Utah]], [[Virginia Department of Transportation|Virginia]], [[Washington State Department of Transportation|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|Wisconsin]]), with Tennessee being the most recent state (as of 2015) to repeal the restriction for installing logo signs on rural highways only. The 2000 MUTCD also added the attractions category, followed by the 2003 MUTCD which added the 24-hour pharmacies category.&lt;ref name=MUTCD2003&gt;{{cite book |author= Staff |year= 2004 |origyear=2003 |chapter= Chapter 2F: Specific Service Signs |title= [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] |chapter-url= https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ghawkins/MUTCD%202003-Revision%201.pdf |format= PDF |edition= Revision&amp;nbsp;1, 2003 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |pages= 2F-1–2F-6 |isbn= 9780935403817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logo signs in the United States are limited to six logos per sign, and additional signs may be used up to a total of four in each direction per interchange.&lt;ref name=MUTCD2009&gt;{{cite book |author= Staff |year= 2009 |chapter= Chapter 2J: Specific Service Signs |chapter-url= http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/part2ithu2n.pdf |format=PDF |title= Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices |edition= 2009 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |pages= 312–19 |isbn= 9781615835171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] issued an interim approval to allow more than six logo panels per service type on up to two signs per direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/res-interim_approvals.htm | title=Interim Approvals Issued by FHWA | work=Federal Highway Administration | accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was eventually incorporated into the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

In California, as well as on the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] the label "GAS" is replaced by "FUEL".

===In Canada===

Logo signs are found along major highways in [[Ontario]], namely 400-series highways 400 and 401. A separate signage is used for [[ONroute]] rest areas.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), Soetoro was the ninth of ten children of Martodihardjo, who was an employee of a mining office from [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref name="Habib 2008a"/&gt;  Soetoro's father and eldest brother were killed during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], when Indonesia won independence from the Dutch, and the Dutch army burned the family's home. Soetoro fled with his mother to the countryside.&lt;ref name="Dreams p. 42"&gt;Obama (1995, 2004), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soetoro earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[geography]] from [[Gadjah Mada University]], in [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref name="Habib 2008a"/&gt;  In 1962, Soetoro, then a civilian employee of the [[Indonesian Army]] Topographic Service, obtained an [[East–West Center]] grant for graduate study in geography at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-09-11 |title=For the record: President Obama's East-West Center connections |work=East-West Center Press Kit |location=Honolulu |publisher=[[East–West Center]] |url=http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2009/09/11/2873394/0_EWCPressKit.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-06 |quote=Obama's stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, was an East–West Center graduate degree fellow (M.A. in geography) from 1962–64, before he married Obama's mother.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in [[Honolulu]] in September 1962 and graduated from the university with a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in geography in June 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wester, Lyndon |date=2010-10-13 |title=History of the Department |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii Department of Geography |url=http://www.geography.hawaii.edu/history.html |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1971, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and attend Punahou School starting in 5th grade.&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1995, 2004). pp. 58–59.&lt;br/&gt;Maraniss (2012), pp. 264–266.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in August 1972, Dunham, with the help of her employer (LPPM), obtained an [[Asia Foundation]] grant to begin graduate study in anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;ref name="Mizan 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="January 8, 1976 letter"&gt;Dunham (2009), pp. xli–xliv: "January 8, 1976 letter from Ann Dunham Soetoro (Jl.

Dunham completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for a M.A. in anthropology in December 1974,&lt;ref name="anthropology"/&gt; and after three years in Hawaii, returned with her daughter to Jakarta in 1975 to complete her contract with LPPM and do anthropological field work.&lt;ref name="Mizan 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="January 8, 1976 letter"/&gt;  Obama chose to stay with his grandparents in Hawaii to continue attending Punahou School for high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mendell, David |year=2007 |title=[[Obama: From Promise to Power|Obama: from promise to power]] |location=New York |publisher=Amistad/HarperCollins |page=43 |isbn=0-06-085820-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976, Dunham and her daughter moved to [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], living for half a year with Soetoro's 76-year-old mother.&lt;ref name="January 8, 1976 letter"/&gt;

During their years in Indonesia, Dunham became increasingly interested in the country's culture, while Soetoro became more interested in Western culture,&lt;ref name="Ripley 2008"/&gt; and their relationship was in conflict over differing values.&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1998, 2004), pp. 44–47.&lt;br/&gt;Maraniss (2012), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce became final on 6 November 1980.&lt;ref name="Ripley 2008"/&gt;

In his 1995 memoir ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'', Obama described Soetoro as well-mannered, even-tempered, and easy with people; he wrote of the struggles he felt Soetoro had to deal with after his return to Indonesia from Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1995, 2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  He described his stepfather as following "a brand of [[Islam]] that could make room for the remnants of more ancient, classical, and [[Dharmic]] philosophies such as that of the [[Hindu]]."&lt;ref name="Fornek 2007b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obama (1995, 2004), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2007 article, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' foreign correspondent Kim Barker reported that Soetoro "was much more of a free spirit than a devout Muslim, according to former friends and neighbors."&lt;ref name="Barker 2007"/&gt;

==Later life==
Soetoro married Erna Kustina in 1980 and had two children, a son, Yusuf Aji Soetoro (born 1981), and daughter, Rahayu Nurmaida Soetoro (born 1984).&lt;ref name="Habib 2008b"&gt;{{cite news |author=Habib, Ridlwan |date=2008-11-06 |title=Keluarga besar Lolo Soetoro, kerabat dekat calon Presiden Amerika di Jakarta (Lolo Soetoro's extended family in Jakarta, close relatives to American Presidential nominee) |language=Indonesian |newspaper=[[Jawa Pos]] |location=Surabya  |url=http://www.jpnn.com/?mib=berita.detail&amp;id=9368 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}[[Google Translate]]'s [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=id&amp;u=http://www.jpnn.com/%3Fmib%3Dberita.detail%26id%3D9368&amp;ei=IvEnTaXFG-HonQfAvPGuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.jpnn.com/%253Fmib%253Dberita.detail%2526id%253D9368%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox%26rlz%3D1I7ADBR_en%26prmd%3Divns English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercado dos Lavradores''' ("farmers' market") is a fruit, vegetable, flower and [[fish market]] in [[Funchal]], [[Madeira Island|Madeira]]. The building was designed by Edmundo Tavares and opened on 24 November 1940. The facade, main entrance and fish market contain panels of tiles depicting regional themes, executed by João Rodrigues. It is divided into a number of smaller plazas and stairways that are used as sales venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfunchal.pt/en/farmers-market.html|title=Mercado dos Lavradores|publisher=Visit Funchal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 23 December (known locally as night of the market, Noite do Mercado in Portuguese), it is traditional for locals to meet in the market and surrounding streets singing Christmas songs, dance and drink in the nearby bars, which are open throughout the night to serve traditional drinks and especially the traditional [[Carne de vinha d'alhos]] sandwiches.&lt;ref&gt;

'''MoNav''' (short for MObile NAVigation) is a [[Free software|free]], car navigation system with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]], realtime routing engine. It uses data from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project. It supports multiple platforms and supports car, foot and bicycle navigation.

The software includes a local navigation [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] and a client. There is also a preprocessor, that converts OpenStreetMap data to data usable by the daemon, but the preprocessor does not need to run on the navigation unit. It is written in [[C++]] using the [[Qt (software)|Qt toolkit]] (for the non-graphical parts as well). It is maintained as a project in [[Google Code]] using the [[Mercurial]] version control system.

The '''National Park of American Samoa''' is a [[national park]] in the United States territory of [[American Samoa]], distributed across three islands: [[Tutuila]], [[Ofu-Olosega|Ofu]], and [[Ta‘ū]]. The park preserves and protects [[coral reef]]s, tropical [[rainforest]]s, fruit bats, and the Samoan culture. Popular activities include hiking and snorkeling. Of the park's {{convert|13,500|acre|ha}}, {{convert|9,000|acre|ha}} is land and {{convert|4,500|acre|ha}} is coral reefs and ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/nps/nps/part2.htm#npsa |title=The National Parks: Index 2009–2011 |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is the only American [[List of the United States National Park System official units|National Park Service system unit]] south of the equator.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/npsa/learn/news/fact-sheet.htm ''National Park of American Samoa''. National Park Service. Retrieved November 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The National Park of American Samoa was established on October 31, 1988 by Public Law 100-571&lt;ref name="100-571"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:H.R.4818:|title=Public Law No: 100-571|date=1988-10-31|publisher=Library of Congress: THOMAS|accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the NPS could not buy the land because of traditional communal land system. This was resolved on September 9, 1993, when the [[National Park Service]] entered into a 50-year lease for the park land from the Samoan village councils.  In 2002, Congress approved a thirty percent expansion on Olosega and Ofu islands.&lt;ref name="107-336"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:H.R.1712:|title=Public Law No: 107-336|date=2002-12-16|publisher=Library of Congress: THOMAS|accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 an [[2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] and tsunami produced several large waves, resulting in 34 confirmed deaths, more than a hundred injuries and the destruction of about 200 homes and businesses. The park encountered major damage.  The visitor center and main office were destroyed but there was only one reported injury among the NPS staff and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/emergency/docs/10-13-09%20DOI%20American%20Samoa%20roundup%20fq.pdf|title=American Samoa Earthquake and Tsunami Damage|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=2011-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023060453/http://www.doi.gov/emergency/docs/10-13-09%20DOI%20American%20Samoa%20roundup%20fq.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tutuila unit of the park is on the north end of the island near [[Pago Pago]]. It is separated by Mount Alava ({{convert|1610|ft|m}}) and the Maugaloa Ridge and includes the Amalau Valley, Craggy Point, Tafeu Cove, and the islands of Pola and Manofa. It is the only part of the park accessible by car and attracts the vast majority of visitors to the area. The park lands include a trail to the top of Mount Alava and historic World War II gun emplacement sites at Breakers Point and Blunt's Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/npsa/planyourvisit/hiking.htm |title=Hiking and Beachwalking |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail runs along the ridge in dense forest, north of which the land slopes steeply away to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;

==Manua Island group==
{{main|Manu'a}}

===Ofu Unit===
[[File:Ofu Beach NPS.jpg|thumb|Beach at Ofu]]
Ofu island is only accessible via small fisherman boats from Ta'u island. Accommodations are available on Ofu.

===Ta‘ū Unit===
Ta‘ū island can be reached by a flight from Tutuila to Fiti‘uta village on Ta‘ū. Accommodations are available on Ta‘ū. A trail runs from Saua around Si’u Point to the southern coastline and stairs to the {{convert|3,170|ft|m|sing=on}} summit of Lata Mountain.

==Biodiversity==
Because of its remote location, diversity among the terrestrial species is low. Approximately 30% of the plants and one bird species (the [[Samoan starling]]) are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the archipelago.&lt;ref name="NPSARO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/im/units/pacn/monitoring/plan/PACN_MP_AppendixA_NPSA.pdf |title=Pacific Island Network Vital Signs Monitoring Plan—Appendix A: National Park of American Samoa Resource Overview |last=Hart |first=Risé |date=2005-02-14 |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[File:Manycoloured fruitdove fem bobbys.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[many-colored fruit dove]] has been found in the park.]]
Three species of [[bat]] are the only native mammals: two large fruit bats ([[Samoa flying fox]] and [[Insular flying fox|white-naped flying fox]]) and a small [[insectivore]], the [[Pacific sheath-tailed bat]]. They serve an important role in pollinating the island's plants. The sheath-tailed bat was nearly eliminated by [[Cyclone Val]] in 1991. Native reptiles include the [[Nactus pelagicus|pelagic gecko]], [[Gehyra oceanica|Polynesian gecko]], [[Lepidodactylus lugubris|mourning gecko]], [[stump-toed gecko]], [[Candoia carinata|Pacific boa]] and seven [[skink]] species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/npsa/5Atlas/partu.htm National Park home page], retrieved 2009-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;
A major role for the park is to control and eradicate [[invasive species|invasive plant and animal species]] such as feral pigs, which threaten the park's ecosystem. There are several bird species, the most predominant being the [[wattled honeyeater]], [[Samoan starling]], and [[Pacific imperial pigeon|Pacific pigeon]].&lt;ref name = "Craig"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Other unusual birds include the [[Tahiti petrel]], the [[spotless crake]], and the rare (in this locality) [[many-colored fruit dove]].&lt;ref name="NPSARO"/&gt;

===Flora===
The islands are mostly covered by [[tropical rainforest]], including [[cloud forest]] on Ta'u and lowland ridge forest on Tutuila. Most plants arrived by chance from [[Southeast Asia]]. There are 343 flowering plants, 135 ferns and about 30% are endemic plant species.

===Marine===
The surrounding waters are filled with a diversity of marine life, including [[sea turtles]], [[humpback whales]], over 950 species of fish, and over 250 coral species. Some of the largest living coral colonies ([[Porites]]) in the world are at Ta'u island.

==Geology==
[[File:Samoa geologic map.png|thumb|Samoan [[geologic map]] with volcanic series labeled (click on image to enlarge)]]
[[File:Samoan Bathymetry.png|thumb|Samoan bathymetry]]
[[File:Samoan Tectonic setting.png|thumb|upright|Samoan tectonic setting]]
The volcanic islands of Samoa that dominate the acreage of the national park are composed of [[shield volcanoes]] which developed from a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] on the [[Pacific Plate]], emerging sequentially from west to east. Tutulia, the largest and oldest island, probably dates from the [[Pliocene]] Epoch, approximately 1.24 to 1.4 million years ago, while the smaller islands are most likely [[Holocene]] in age.

The islands are not made up of individual volcanoes, but are rather composed of overlapping and superimposed shield volcanoes built by [[basalt]] [[lava]] flows. Much of the lava that erupted has since broken into angular fragments known as [[breccia]]. The volcanoes emerged from the intrusion of basaltic [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] from a rift zone on the ocean floor during the Pliocene Epoch, and were heavily eroded during the Pliocene and early [[Pleistocene]] Epochs, leaving behind [[trachyte]] [[Volcanic plug|plugs]] and exposed outcrops of volcanic [[tuff]] throughout the park. Ta'u island, the youngest of the islands included within the national park, is all that remains from the collapse of a shield volcano during Holocene time. This collapse produced sea cliffs over 3,000 feet high on the north side of the island, some of the highest such [[escarpments]] in the world.

While the Samoan islands have not shown evidence of volcanism for many years, the [[Samoa hotspot]] beneath the islands continues to give indications of activity, with a submarine eruption detected just east of American Samoa in 1973. The [[Vailulu'u|Vailulu'u Seamount]], located east of Ta'u, is a future Samoan island developing from submarine lava flows, continuing the eastward progress of volcanic development from the hotspot below the islands. The lava flows forming the [[seamount]] have been dated by [[radiometric]] methods to between 5 and 50 years, during which time the seamount has risen 14,764 feet from the ocean floor.

Evidence exists of past submarine and surface [[landslides]] as a result of [[weathering]] and other forms of [[erosion]] of the rocks and soil making up the islands. On Ta'u island, an inland escarpment known as Liu Bench (a feature of [[mass wasting]]) threatens to slump into the nearby ocean, an event which could produce a tsunami strong enough to devastate the island of [[Fiji]] to the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;Ann G. Harris, et al., ''The Geology of National Parks'',(Dubuque, Iowa: Kendall-Hunt, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivine basalt]]s were extruded from a N. 70° E. trending [[rift zone]], oriented along the current Afono and Masefay bays of [[Tutuila]], in the Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene.  The Masefau dike complex and [[scree|talus]] breccias are remnants of this rifting.  Development of the Taputapu, Pago, Alofau, and Olomoana [[shield volcano|shield domes]] followed long parallel [[fracture (geology)|fissures]] followed, but when the Pago and Alofau summits collapsed, calderas were formed.  Thick [[tuff]]s were deposited in the Pago caldera, and the southern rim was buried by lavas composed of picritic [[basalt]]s, [[andesite]]s, and trachytes.  Subsequent erosion in Early to Middle Pleistocene enlarged the calderas, the Pago River in particular carved a deep canyon, the forerunner of today's Pago Pago Bay.  A submarine shelf formed from the erosional runoff, allowing for the development of [[coral reef]]s before the island was submerged 600 to 2000 feet.  [[sea level change|Sea level fluctuations]] continued in the Middle to Late Pleistocene.  A barrier reef formed, was submerged 200 feet, before emerging 50 feet, leaving [[sea cave]]s above sea level.  Leone volcanics erupted in recent time generating tuff cones undersea, such as Aunuu Island, and cinder cones on land.  The [[pahoehoe]] flows buried the submerged barrier reef, enlarging the island by 8 square miles.  The island has since emerged another 5 feet.&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stearns|first1=Harold|title=Geology of the Samoan Islands|journal=Bulletin of the Geological Society of America|date=1944|volume=55|issue=November|pages=1312–1313|doi=10.1130/gsab-55-1279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ofu-Olosega|Ofu and Olosega]] are the remains of a single basaltic volcano, 4 miles north to south and 6 miles east to west, which formed in the Pliocene to Early Pleistocene.  Remnants of one half of the caldera, ponded flows, form the north center portion of Ofu.  The steepest cliffs, 600 feet high, are found on this north coast.  The Ofu-Olosega island group formed along the same N. 70° W. trending rift which formed Tau, another single basaltic dome.  The remnant of Tau's caldera is found on the south coast.  A 2000-foot cliff marks the north coast of this island.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;{{rp|1313–1318}}

[[Upolu]] formed as an elongated basaltic shield volcano due to Late [[Tertiary]] to Late Pliocene rifting along a S. 70° E. trend.  Remnants of these eruptions are found as [[inlier]]s and [[monadnock]]s forming Mt. Tafatafao, Mt. Vaaifetu, and Mt. Spitzer. Volcanic activity renewed in the Middle Pleistocene along the same rift trend, with olivine basalt pahoehoe and [[Lava#.CA.BBA.CA.BB.C4.81|aa]] flowing northward and southward from a point 8 miles west from the center of the island.  Pleistocene cinder cones trending east and west, are aligned along the center axis of the island.  [[Savai'i]] lies along this same rift trend, its surface marked by [[Quaternary]] lava flows.  Examples include the olivine basalt pahoehoe which emerged from [[Mount Matavanu]] from 1905 to 1911, and the [[Mauga Afi]] chain of [[spatter cone]]s of 1902.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;{{rp|1318–1328}}

==Threats==
The coral reefs are under significant threat due to rising ocean temperatures and [[carbon dioxide]] concentration, as well as [[sea level rise]]. As a result of these and other stresses, the corals that form the reefs are projected to be lost by mid-century if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at their
current rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.globalchange.gov/usimpacts/pdfs/climate-impacts-report.pdf Report to the Congress Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oligosaprobes''' are organisms that inhabit clean water or water that is only slightly polluted by organic matter. [[Oxidation]] processes predominate in such waters owing to an excess of dissolved oxygen. [[Nitrate]]s are among the nitrogen compounds present; there is little carbonic acid and no hydrogen sulfide.  Oligosaprobic environments are aquatic environments rich in dissolved oxygen and (relatively) free from decayed organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Basinger Maggenti, Armand R. Maggenti, and Scott Gardner,  '''Online Dictionary of Invertebrate Zoology: O''' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligosaprobes include some green and [[Diatom|diatomaceous algae]], flowering plants (for example, [[European white water lily|European white water lilies]]), some [[rotifers]], [[Bryozoa]], sponges, [[mollusk]]s of the genus [[Dreissena]], [[cladoceran]]s (daphnids, bithotrephes), dragonfly and [[mayfly]] larvae, sterlets, trout, minnows, and newts. Oligosaprobes also embrace a few saprophytes, including bacteria (scores and hundreds per 1 cu mm of water) and organisms that feed on bacteria. The term “oligosaprobe” is usually applied only to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outport''' is the name given in the [[United Kingdom]] for a subsidiary port built in deeper water than the original [[port]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.die.net/outport Webster's Dictionary definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123113047/http://dictionary.die.net/outport |date=January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Port of Tilbury]] from the [[Port of London]] is a good example. [[Avonmouth]] for [[Bristol]] and, on a smaller and now historical scale,  [[Fordwich]] for [[Canterbury]] are others.

'''Es Pantaleu''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]) or '''El Pantaleu''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is an uninhabited [[islet]] in the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]], located just off the west coast of [[Majorca]]. It is currently a [[natural park (Spain)|natural park]], part of the natural park of its neighboring island [[Dragonera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conselldemallorca.net/dragonera/dades.php?lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; It has an area of 2,4 ha and its highest point is 26 m [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]].

==Geography==
Geologically speaking, Pantaleu is an emerged part of the [[Baetic System|geologic system running southwest-northeast]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. This runs from the [[Province of Málaga]] through [[Cap de la Nau]] and then gets submerged under the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It surfaces again to form the island of [[Ibiza]], the [[Serra de Tramuntana|Tramuntana Range]] in the island of Majorca and Pantaleu itself.

The island is a part of the municipality of [[Andratx]], which is, along with [[Sant Elm]] (both in nearby Majorca), the closest towns to the island.

==History==
This islet gained historical importance in 1229 when [[James I of Aragon]] in September of this year dropped anchor by this island in order to protect his ships from the storm. They explored the coast of Majorca from here and chose the strand near today's [[Santa Ponsa|Santa Ponça]] as an ideal landing point for the Crusaders to start the [[Reconquista]] of the  [[Balearic Islands]]. The gulf of Sant Elm proved to be a good place for defense.

Lying about 300&amp;nbsp;m from the strand of Sant Elm, the island is a popular destination for good swimmers. Since 1998 it belongs to the Dragonera nature reserve and must not be entered.

This article provides a collection of the '''[[etymologies]]''' of the [[name]]s of the [[regions of Peru]].

{| class="wikitable"
! State name !! Language of origin !! Source word !! Meaning and Notes
|-
| [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]] || [[Spanish language|Spanish]] || ''Amazonas'' || Named after the [[Amazon River]]. This name was given by [[Francisco de Orellana]] originally to [[Marañón River]], after dealing with a local ethnic group in which men and women alike were defending themselves. The name given is merely historical, because the river does not cross the territory of this region.
|-
| [[Ancash Region|Ancash]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] || ''anqash'' || "Blue". The name comes from the Ancash Quechuan word  "anqash" which means 'blue'. It was the name of a stream tributary of the [[Santa River]] (Ancachs River) on whose banks was fought the [[Battle of Yungay]] on 28 February 1839. The name of this region, formerly the Huaylas Department was changed by the temporary President [[Agustín Gamarra]] by Supreme Decree in commemoration of the victory in these battle. In 1940 "Ancachs" was finally changed to "Ancash".
|-
| [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]|| ''apu rimaq'' || Named after the [[Apurímac River]]. ''Apu rimaq'' in Quechua means 'one who speaks with the gods' or 'oracle greater'. It is a region run by mountain ranges.
|-
| [[Arequipa Region|Arequipa]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] || ''Ari, qhipay'' || The region takes its name from its capital city, [[Arequipa]].  The city's name comes from the Quechua phrase "Ari, qhipay" which means "yes, stay" which is said to have been the response of the fourth Sapa Inca &amp;mdash; [[Mayta Cápac]] &amp;mdash; upon seeing the site of the great city, which was later destroyed in an earthquake but reestablished by the Spanish in 1540.
|-
| [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] || ''aya k'uchu'' || "Corner of the dead". The [[Wari culture]] developed in [[Huanta Province]], until they were assimilated by the expansion of the [[Incas]]. [[Viracocha]] conquered the region, finding a stubborn opposition by Pocras who were slain in a corner of Parcos, so after it was called toponymic ''Ayawarkuna'', which means "place where dead hang". Such was the carnage that caused the fighting between the [[Incas]] and the natives that these events resulted in the Quechua name ''Ayak'uchu'', which literally means "corner of the Dead". On 15 February 1825, by Order of the Liberator [[Simón Bolívar]], original names ([[Ayacucho|Huamanga]] and [[Ayacucho Region|Department of Huamanga]]) were replaced by the name of Ayacucho, in recognition of the victors of the [[Battle of Ayacucho]]."
|-
| [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] || ''kasha marka'' || The region takes its name from its capital city, [[Cajamarca]]. The city name was registered by the early chroniclers as ''Caxamarca'', in Quechua, ''kasha marka'' or "town (marka) of thorns (kasha)" in reference to the abundance of the San Pedro cacti (''[[Echinopsis pachanoi]]'') in the valley where it is located the city.
|-
| [[Callao Region|Callao]] || [[Spanish language|Spanish]] || ''callao'' || In Spanish, ''callao'' means pebble or river cobble, which means the same as the French word "caillou" and the Portuguese word "calhao". One of the qualities of Callao are its clean and rocky beaches.
|-
| [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] via [[Aymara language|Aymara]] || ''qusqu wanka'' || "Rock of the owl".{{dubious|reason=It is quite well established that the Quechua word ''qosqo'', meaning ''navel'', is the origin of the name|date=August 2017}} The region takes its name from its capital city, [[Cusco]]. It is believed that the Quechua name 'Qusqu' with which it was found at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of the Inca Empire]], has Aymara origin, and derives from the phrase ''qusqu wanka'' ("rock of the owl") from the [[Inca_mythology#Inca_foundation_legends|legend of Ayar Brothers]], where Ayar Auca flying with his own wings, occupies the site where it was Cusco, then settles on a rock in the area and he turns to stone, becoming a symbol of the occupation.
|-
| [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]] || [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] || ''wanka willka'' || The region takes its name from its capital city, [[Huancavelica]]. In the [[Ancient Peruvian cultures|pre-Incan era]], Huancavelica was known as the ''wanka willka'' region or "the place where the grandsons of the [[Wankas]] live".

[[File:Pirates House (8062128383).jpg|thumb|Pirates House]]

'''The Pirates' House''' is a historic restaurant and [[tavern]] established in 1753 located in downtown [[Savannah, Georgia]] in the Southern United States. A portion of the structure was built in 1734, making it the oldest standing building in the state of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Kevin M. ''Georgia's Lighthouses and Historic Coastal Sites''. Pineapple Press, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alan. ''Haunted Places in the American South''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2002, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern restaurant was founded by Herb Traub and Jim Casey in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savannahmagazine.com/beneath-the-surface|title=Beneath the Surface - Savannah Magazine|date=15 March 2017|website=Savannahmagazine.com|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of Savannah's most-popular tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hustmyre, Chuck|title="The Pirates' House"|publisher=Crime and History|date=13 September 2010|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/pirates_house/1_index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pirate's House, Savannah, Georiga, US.JPG|thumb|Pirate's House restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, US. One of the oldest buildings in Georgia.]]

The Pirates' House was built on a plot of land located on the east side of [[James Oglethorpe]]'s original plan of the city of Savannah. The plot of land was assigned to become a botanical garden that modelled the Chelsea Botanical Garden in London, England. The garden was dedicated to Oglethorpe's Trustees. Oglethorpe recruited botanists from around the world to acquire plants for the project such as cotton, [[spices]], [[indigo]], and [[medicinal herbs]]. The garden was hoped to bring success in the wine and silk industries, and was centered on growing mulberry trees. The soil and weather conditions of Georgia were not compatible with the mulberry trees and it was not successful with wine or silk. However, it did distribute [[peach]] trees which Georgia is currently renowned for. The garden was also highly successful in growing cotton which later became a staple of Georgia's economy.

A small building which later became the starting structure of the Pirates' House was built on the plot of land in 1734 to house the gardener who worked there. This building was deemed the Herb House and is said to be the oldest building in the state of Georgia (see [[List of the oldest buildings in Georgia (U.S. state)|List of the oldest buildings in Georgia]]).

In 1754, the people of Savannah decided the need for the botanical garden was no longer relevant. Savannah was quickly becoming a port town and The Herb House was transformed into an Inn and tavern for [[seaman|seamen]] visiting from abroad.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateshouse.com/index.htm|title=The Pirate's House|website=Thepirateshouse.com|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Pirates' House is home to some rare early edition pages of [[Treasure Island]], by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The pages can be seen hanging on the walls of the Captain's room and the Treasure room in the Pirates' House.

The current owners of The Pirates' House claim that [[Captain Flint]], a pirate mentioned in the book [[Treasure Island]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], died in the upstairs bedroom at the Pirate's House.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://historicghost.com/PirateHouse.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115043827/http://www.historicghost.com/PirateHouse.html |archive-date=15 January 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Flint is a completely fictional character, this story cannot be historically true, and the additional claim that Flint haunts the place as a ghost&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ghostinmysuitcase.com/places/pirate/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006015407/http://ghostinmysuitcase.com/places/pirate/index.htm |archive-date=6 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that these claims are not intended to be taken seriously. Moreover, although the novel states that Flint died in Savannah, nothing in it states or suggests that The Pirates' House is the location of his deathbed.

==Renovation and ownership==
In 1948, the Pirates' House and the surrounding land was acquired by The Savannah Gas Company. The building soon caught the interest of Mrs. Hansell Hilyer, wife of the president of The Savannah Gas Company. She renewed the house museum into the restaurant of present day. The Pirates' House has 15 dining rooms, can hold up to 120 guests and serves a variety of southern dishes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Many of its recipes can be found in "The Pirate's House Cook Book" by Frances McGrath.&lt;ref name="harvard.edu"&gt;[http://discovery.lib.harvard.edu/?q=The%20Pirate's%20House] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard.edu"/&gt;

The '''place of birth''' ('''POB''') or '''birth place''' is the place where a person was [[childbirth|born]]. This place is often used in legal documents, together with [[name]] and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be country that currently has ''[[sovereignty]]'' over the actual place of birth regardless of when the birth actually occurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a [[hospital]] in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.

In other countries, such as [[Sweden]] since 1947, there is a concept of ''födelsehemort'' ("domicile of birth"), which means that the [[domicile (law)|domicile]] of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;"Newborn children are registered as born in the parish where the mother was registered at the time of delivery." ''Tables on the population of Sweden 2006, page 430'' {{ISBN|978-91-618-1383-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.

Sometimes the place of birth automatically determines the [[nationality]] of the baby, a practice often referred to with the [[Latin phrase]] ''[[jus soli]]'' (it depends on the law of the country to give the nationality). More often, this may also depend on the nationality or nationalities of the parents (referred to as ''[[jus sanguinis]]''). 

There can be some confusion on the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are [[birth aboard aircraft and ships|born]] in an [[airplane]] or at [[sea]], difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality/nationalities of the parents and/or the position of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the [[territorial waters]] or [[airspace]] of a country).

Some applications may request the "Country of Birth" of the applicant. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the "Place of Birth" or "Nationality at Birth" of the applicant. For US citizens born abroad that under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the Nationality at Birth will be USA (American), while Place of Birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

'''Ras Dejen''' (alternatively '''Ras Dashan'''  [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: ራስ ደጀን ''rās dejen'' or ራስ ዳሸን ''rās dashen'', [[Amharic language|Amharic]] "head guard") is the highest [[mountain]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Highest mountain peaks of Africa|tenth highest mountain]] of [[Africa]]. Part of [[Simien Mountains National Park]] located in the Amhara region, it reaches an elevation of 4,550 metres (14,930&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt; The more common form, "Ras Dashen" is a corruption of its Amharic name, "Ras Dejen", used by the system of the [[Ethiopian Mapping Authority]] (EMA) which means "the general who fights in front of the Emperor"{{dubious |Dubious translation: "the general who fights in front of the Emperor"|date=January 2018}}.&lt;ref name=Nilsson-13&gt;Erik Nilsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/519950 "Traces of Ancient Changes of Climate in East Africa:  Preliminary Report"], ''[[Geografiska Annaler]]'', 17 (1935), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to Erik Nilsson, Ras Dejen is the eastern peak of the rim of "an enormous volcano, the northern half of which is cut down about [a] thousand metres by numerous ravines, draining into the [[Tekezé River|Takkazzi River]]." Its western counterpart is [[Mount Biuat]] (4,510 meters), separated by the valley of the Meshaha river.&lt;ref name=Nilsson-13/&gt; The mountain is often place to violent snowfalls during the night, but, since daily and night temperatures vary greatly,  the snow is almost completely melted in a few hours (during the hottest period of the year) since temperature may be over 5 Celsius degrees by midday. In winter snow falls rarely, since the majority of yearly rainfalls in Ethiopia are in the summer, but if it does it usually lasts for weeks or months.

The first recorded ascent by a Eurasian was in 1841, by the French officers Ferret and Galinier. There is no verifiable evidence of earlier ascents by locals, but the summit climate and conditions are relatively hospitable, and there are nearby high altitude pastoral settlements. A small fort still partially standing at around 4,300 Meter [[SRTM]] data.&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt;

'''Rosenberg''' is a Germanic-language family name and toponym. Its principal meaning is "mountain of roses", from ''Rose'' + ''Berg''. However, as a toponym, in some locations it may have originally meant "red mountain" or simply "red hill", from ''rot'' + ''Berg''. The terminal consonant of the /rot/-/roθ/-/roð/-/ros/ syllable has varied across regions and centuries; there are many variations of the name, including ''Rosenberg, [[Rotenberg (disambiguation)|Rotenberg]], [[Rottenberg]],  [[Rothenberg (disambiguation)|Rothenberg]], [[Rodenberg (disambiguation)|Rodenberg]]'', and ''Rozenberg''.

While sometimes inaccurately assumed to be exclusively [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]], it is a common surname among people of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]], [[Sinti]], and [[Swedes|Swedish]] ancestry.

'''Serena''' is a freeware horror adventure game developed by several video game development companies, including [[Senscape]], [[CBE Software]], [[Infamous Quests]], [[Digital Media Workshop]] and [[Guys from Andromeda]]. It was released for [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[OS X]]. The game previews the Dagon Engine that was supposed to be used in [[Asylum (2014 video game)|Asylum]]. The main characters are voiced by [[Josh Mandel (video game designer)|Josh Mandel]] and Sarah Wilson ([[YouTube]] blogger Pushing Up Roses), as well as a cameo from [[Guys from Andromeda]]'s [[Scott Murphy (video game designer)|Scott Murphy]]. Gameplay is first-person perspective, with fixed background screens and a point-and-click interface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/impressions-serena/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/impressions-serena/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The game tells a story of a man (voiced by [[Josh Mandel (video game designer)|Josh Mandel]]) who is waiting in a cabin for his wife, Serena, but can't remember anything about her. As he explores more of the cabin and examines the varying items throughout, his memories about her and their relationship begin returning, evoking multiple changes in his emotion.&lt;ref&gt;http://diaboliquemagazine.com/serena-video-game-review/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rootgamer.com/9841/news/serena-horror-game |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312115658/http://rootgamer.com/9841/news/serena-horror-game |archivedate=12 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Serena&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/a-disturbing-gift-for-fans-of-adventure-games-1512623141 |title=Impressions: 'A Disturbing Gift For Fans Of Adventure Games.' |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The title character is named after ''Serena Nelson'', an  advocate of adventure games funded by [[Kickstarter]]. For her activism, she has often been referred to as the "Hero of the Adventure Game Revival Movement". Following an incident where Nelson was [[Outing|outed]] for being a [[transgender]]ed person by a studio executive, the game designer Agustín Cordes made the game "Serena" in response to the perceived bullying of Nelson, and in support of her. The game neither involves Nelson's participation nor does the plot revolve around her treatment.&lt;ref name=Serena&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surveying''' or '''land surveying''' is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a '''land surveyor'''. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for [[ownership]], locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.

Surveyors work with elements of [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[regression analysis]], [[physics]], engineering, [[metrology]], [[programming language]]s, and the law. They use equipment, such as [[total station]]s, robotic total stations, [[theodolites]], GPS receivers, [[retroreflector]]s, [[3D scanner]]s, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, [[Geographic information system|GIS]], and surveying software.

Surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. The planning and execution of most forms of construction require it. It is also used in transport, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.

==Definition==
The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] defines the function of surveying as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition |url=http://www.fig.net/about/general/definition/index.asp |website=''fig.net'' |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;
* to determine, measure and represent land, three-dimensional objects, point-fields and trajectories;
* to assemble and interpret land and geographically related information,
* to use that information for the planning and efficient administration of the land, the sea and any structures thereon; and,
* to conduct research into the above practices and to develop them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Cadastre#History|Cartography#History|Topographic mapping#History}}

===Ancient surveying===
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig23--plumb rule.png|upright=0.4|thumb|alt=refer to caption |A plumb rule from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In [[ancient Egypt]], a [[rope stretcher]] would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the [[Nile River]]. The almost perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. The ''[[Groma surveying|Groma]]'' instrument originated in [[Mesopotamia]] (early 1st millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM 2008|author=Hong-Sen Yan &amp; Marco Ceccarelli|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4020-9484-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistoric monument at [[Stonehenge]] (c. 2500 BC) was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] described ways of measuring distant objects in his work ''[[Haidao Suanjing]]'' or ''The Sea Island Mathematical Manual'', published in 263 AD.

The Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD).&lt;ref name="Lewis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=M. J. T.|title=Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Izau5_ihmsC|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=23 April 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman surveyors were known as ''[[Gromatici]]''.

In medieval Europe, [[beating the bounds]] maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.

In England, [[William the Conqueror]] commissioned the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area's content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Printed image of surveying equipment. | Table of Surveying, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Abel Foullon described a [[plane table]] in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.

[[Gunter's chain]] was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]]. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.

[[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]] described a [[Theodolite]] that measured horizontal angles in his book ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571). Joshua Habermel ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. [[Jesse Ramsden]] introduced the first precision [[theodolite]] in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring [[angle]]s in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]] using an accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] invented an instrument that used a [[telescope]] with an installed [[crosshair]] as a target device, in 1640. [[James Watt]] developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the [[parallactic angle]] from which the distance to a point could be deduced.

Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of [[Triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116,1 kilometres). He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[resection (orientation)|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, [[Jacques Cassini]] and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César]] undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time, triangulation methods were by then well established for local map-making.

[[File:1870 Index Chart to GTS India-1.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of triangulation network covering India.| A map of India showing the Great Trigonometrical Survey, produced in 1870]]

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General [[William Roy]]'s [[Ordnance Survey]] of Great Britain began the [[Principal Triangulation of Britain]]. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out [[canal]]s, roads and rail.

In the US, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] created the [[Public Land Survey System]]. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.

[[Napoleon]] Bonaparte founded [[continental Europe]]'s first [[cadastre]] in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.
[[File:Camp of surverying party at Russel's Tank, Arizona, on eastern slope of Laja Range, 1,271 miles from Missouri River. (Boston Public Library) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A railroad surveying party at Russel's Tank, [[Arizona]] in the 1860s]]
[[Robert Torrens]] introduced the [[Torrens system]] in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.
Surveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the century surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. [[Trevor Wadley|Dr Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] developed the [[Tellurometer]] during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sturman|first1=Brian|last2=Wright|first2=Alan|title=The History of the Tellurometer|url=http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf|publisher=International Federation of Surveyors|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced [[electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves |first1=Marc |title=Geodimeter-The First Name in EDM |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225310/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |archivedate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahun|first1=Jerry|title=Electronic Distance Measurement|url=http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|website=''Jerrymahun.com''|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729013241/http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|archivedate=29 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments saved the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.

Advances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as [[total station]]s. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders, and on-board calculation programs.

The first satellite positioning system was the [[US Navy]] [[Transit (satellite)|TRANSIT system]]. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system's main purpose was to provide position information to [[Polaris missile]] submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious, and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.

The US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission to provide more accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Recent improvements to both satellites and receivers allow [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys get high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.

===21st century===
The [[theodolite]], [[total station]], and [[Real Time Kinematic|RTK]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] survey remain the primary methods in use.

Remote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and use of [[lidar]] for topographical surveys. [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] technology along with [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] image processing is also appearing.

The main surveying instruments in use around the world are the [[theodolite]], [[Tape measure|measuring tape]], [[total station]], [[3D scanner]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/[[GNSS]], [[dumpy level|level]] and [[Philadelphia rod|rod]]. Most instruments screw onto a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]] when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.

The theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate ''circles'', ''protractors'' or ''alidades'' to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.

The [[gyrotheodolite]] is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.

The [[total station]] is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

Modern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to [[satellite positioning system]]s, such as [[Global Positioning System]]. [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS systems have increased the speed of surveying, but they are still only horizontally accurate to about 20&amp;nbsp;mm and vertically to 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fbiZz-37XIYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=RTK+GPS+accuracy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pZ3H0k-hm1&amp;sig=Ml6Pyrt-tQzIaByRhOnzE_h_gcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result National Cooperative Highway Research Program: ''Collecting, Processing and Integrating GPS data into GIS'', p. 40.

GPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] that can be over 20&amp;nbsp;km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.

Surveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys makes them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place [[beacons]] on the ground (about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} apart). This method reaches precisions between 5–40&amp;nbsp;cm (depending on flight height).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf Toni Schenk, Suyoung Seo, Beata Csatho: ''Accuracy Study of Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Photogrammetry'', p. 118] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325194334/http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]]; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.

===Software===
Land surveyors, construction professionals and civil engineers using [[total station]], [[GPS]], [[3D scanner]]s and other collector data use Land Surveying Software to increase efficiency, accuracy and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/4843/|title=View DigitalGlobe Imagery Solutions @ Geospatial Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveying techniques==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|alt= A compass with extra sights for measuring bearings. |A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], still used commonly today by geographers, geologists and surveyors for field-based measurements]]

Surveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.
GPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.

===Distance measurement===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A Woman with a backpack holding a laser rangefinder, a handheld GPS and a Tablet computer. |Example of modern equipment for surveying ([[Field-Map]] technology): [[GPS]], [[laser rangefinder]] and field computer allows surveying as well as [[cartography]] (creation of map in real-time) and field data collection.]]
Before EDM devices, [[distance]]s were measured using a variety of means. These included chains with links of a known length such as a [[Gunter's chain]], or measuring tapes made of steel or [[invar]]. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to "break" (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. [[Surveyor's wheel|Perambulators]], or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. [[Tacheometry]] is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.

===Angle measurement===
Historically, horizontal angles were measured by using a [[compass]] to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with [[reticle]]s atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see [[theodolite]]). Levels and calibrated circles allowed measurement of vertical angles. [[Vernier scale|Vernier]]s allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century [[Transit (surveying)|transit]].

The plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 [[Francis Ronalds]] invented a [[Reflecting instrument#Surveying sector|reflecting instrument]] for recording angles graphically by modifying the [[Octant (instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180° difference. This is called a ''close''. If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the ''angular misclose''. The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.

===Levelling===
{{main article|Levelling}}
[[File:Tide station leveling.jpg|thumbnail|alt= A woman setting up an optical level on a tripod. |Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services staff member conducts tide station leveling in support of the US Army Corp of Engineers in Richmond, Maine.]]

The simplest method for measuring height is with an [[altimeter]]&amp;nbsp;using air pressure to find height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. ''Turning'' is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

===Determining position===
The primary way of determining one's position on the earth's surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the sun, moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument's position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on the earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the earth.

===Reference networks===
{{main article|Geodetic network}}
[[File:Traversing and Offsetting DP 79152.png|thumb|alt= A diagram of survey markers running along a shoreline. |A survey using traverse and offset measurements to record the location of the shoreline shown in blue. Black dashed lines are traverse measurements between reference points (black circles). The red lines are offsets measured at right angles to the traverse lines.]]

Few survey positions are derived from first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previous measured points. This forms a reference or ''control'' network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.

Survey points are usually marked on the earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to [[Trig beacon|large beacons]] that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments on this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.

''[[Triangulation]]'' is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for [[topographic]] maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements repeated for increased accuracy. See also [[Triangulation in three dimensions]].

''Offsetting'' is an alternate method of determining position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.

[[Traverse (surveying)|''Traversing'']] is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old reference mark or known position and places a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.

====Datum and coordinate systems====
Many surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the earth, but instead measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey's objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a 'datum' (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the earth's curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.

For larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the earth.

===Errors and accuracy===

A basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|last2=Faig|first2=Wolfgang|title=Surveying|date=1988|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-008303-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AFNBqbiLzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=surveying&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_jHnU6G6J87zoASz84CwBg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=surveying&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classes of survey errors:
*''Gross errors or blunders:'' Errors made by the surveyor during the survey. Upsetting the instrument, misaiming a target, or writing down a wrong measurement are all gross errors. A large gross error may reduce the accuracy to an unacceptable level. Therefore, surveyors use redundant measurements and independent checks to detect these errors early in the survey.
*''Systematic:'' Errors that follow a consistent pattern. Examples include effects of temperature on a chain or EDM measurement, or a poorly adjusted spirit-level causing a tilted instrument or target pole. Systematic errors that have known effects can be compensated or corrected.
*''Random:'' Random errors are small unavoidable fluctuations. They are caused by imperfections in measuring equipment, eyesight, and conditions. They can be minimized by redundancy of measurement and avoiding unstable conditions. Random errors tend to cancel each other out, but checks must be made to ensure they are not propagating from one measurement to the next.

Surveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used. Errors can be detected by comparing the results of the two measurements.

Once the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in his or her work, it is [[adjustment of observations|adjusted]]. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]] method, also known as the compass rule, and the [[least squares|principle of least squares]] method.

The surveyor must be able to distinguish between [[accuracy and precision]]. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25&amp;nbsp;ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.

==Types of surveys==
{{see also|Survey (disambiguation)|Survey (disambiguation)#Earth sciences}}

Local organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:
* ''As-built survey'': a survey that documents the location of recently constructed elements of a construction project. As-built surveys are done for record, completion evaluation and payment purposes. An as-built survey is also known as a 'works as executed survey'. As built surveys are often presented in red or redline and laid over existing plans for comparison with design information.
* ''[[Cadastral surveying|Cadastral or boundary surveying]]'': a survey that establishes or re-establishes boundaries of a parcel using a [[Land description|legal description]]. It involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the lines of the parcel. These take the form of iron [[rod (shaft)|rods]], [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], or concrete monuments in the ground, or [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] set in concrete or asphalt. The ''ALTA/ACSM'' Land Title Survey is a standard proposed by the [[American Land Title Association]] and the [[American Congress on Surveying and Mapping]]. It incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey.
* ''Control surveying'': Control surveys establish reference points to use as starting positions for future surveys. Most other forms of surveying will contain elements of control surveying.
* ''[[Construction surveying]]
* ''[[Deformation Monitoring|Deformation survey]]:'' a survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. First the positions of points on an object are found. A period of time is allowed to pass and the positions are then re-measured and calculated. Then a comparison between the two sets of positions is made.
* ''[[Dimensional control survey]]:'' This is a type of survey conducted in or on a non-level surface. Common in the oil and gas industry to replace old or damaged pipes on a like-for-like basis, the advantage of dimensional control survey is that the instrument used to conduct the survey does not need to be level. This is useful in the off-shore industry, as not all platforms are fixed and are thus subject to movement.
* ''Engineering surveying'': topographic, layout, and as-built surveys associated with engineering design. They often need geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice.
* ''Foundation survey'': a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foundation was constructed in the location, and at the elevation, authorized in the ''plot plan'', ''site plan'', or ''subdivision plan''.
* ''[[Hydrographic survey]]'': a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the shoreline and bed of a body of water. Used for navigation, engineering, or resource management purposes.
* ''[[Leveling]]'': either finds the elevation of a given point or establish a point at a given elevation.
* ''[[National Flood Insurance Program#Removal from NFIP|LOMA survey]]'': Survey to change base flood line, removing property from a [[Special Flood Hazard Area|SFHA]] special flood hazard area.
* ''Measured survey'' : a building survey to produce plans of the building. such a survey may be conducted before renovation works, for commercial purpose, or at end of the construction process.
* ''[[Mine survey|Mining surveying]]'': Mining surveying includes directing the digging of mine shafts and galleries and the calculation of volume of rock. It uses specialised techniques due to the restraints to survey geometry such as vertical shafts and narrow passages.
* ''Mortgage survey:''  A ''mortgage survey'' or ''physical survey'' is a simple survey that delineates land boundaries and building locations. It checks for ''[[Structural encroachment|encroachment]]'', building setback restrictions and shows nearby flood zones. In many places a mortgage survey is a precondition for a mortgage loan.
* ''[[Photogrammetry|Photographic control survey]]'': A survey that creates reference marks visible from the air to allow [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] to be [[Orthophoto|rectified]].
* ''Stakeout, layout or setout'': an element of many other surveys where the calculated or proposed position of an object is marked on the ground. This can be temporary or permanent. This is an important component of engineering and cadastral surveying.
* ''Structural survey'': a detailed inspection to report upon the physical condition and structural stability of a building or structure. It highlights any work needed to maintain it in good repair.
* ''Subdivision'': A boundary survey that splits a property into two or more smaller properties.
* ''Topographic survey'': a survey that measures the elevation of points on a particular piece of land, and presents them as [[contour line]]s on a plot.

===Plane and geodetic surveying===
Based on the considerations and true shape of the earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.

''Plane surveying'' assumes the earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the earth's shape are too small to matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''geodetic surveying'' the curvature of the earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIvvAwAAQBAJ | title=Surveying and Levelling | accessdate=28 July 2016 | author=N N Basak | pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.

Surveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[retaining wall]]s, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for ''[[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s'' (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.

Surveyors must have a thorough knowledge of [[algebra]], basic [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]]. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, [[real property]], and contracts.

Most jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:

* ''Survey assistants'' or ''chainmen'' are usually unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old reference marks, and mark points on the ground. The term 'chainman' derives from past use of [[measuring chain]]s. An assistant would move the far end of the chain under the surveyor's direction.

* ''Survey technicians''  often operate survey instruments, run surveys in the field, do survey calculations, or draft plans. A technician usually has no legal authority and cannot certify his work. Not all technicians are qualified, but qualifications at the certificate or diploma level are available.

* ''Licensed, registered, or chartered surveyors'' usually hold a degree or higher qualification. They are often required to pass further exams to join a professional association or to gain certifying status. Surveyors are responsible for planning and management of surveys. They have to ensure that their surveys, or surveys performed under their supervision, meet the legal standards. Many [[Principal (commercial law)|principals of surveying firms]] hold this status.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a [[post nominal letters|post nominal]], which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.

A licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.

In many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on [[survey monument]]s when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.

===Surveying institutions===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|alt= Uniformed group poses with theodolites, level staves and octant. |Surveying students with their professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century]]

Most countries' governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of [[geodetic network]]s. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.

Most jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the [[International Federation of Surveyors]] (Abbreviated FIG, for {{lang-fr|link=no|Fédération Internationale des Géomètres}}). They represent the survey industry worldwide.

===Building surveying===
{{Main article|Building surveying#Profession}}

Most English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. Building surveyors focus on investigating the condition of buildings as well as legal compliance work.

===Cadastral surveying===
{{main article|Cadastral surveying}}One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.

'''Cadastral land surveyors''' are licensed by governments.
The cadastral survey branch of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt; They consult with [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], [[US Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], [[US Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[US Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], and others. The BLM used to be known as the [[General Land Office]] (GLO).

In states organized per the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.

Cadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., &amp; Hermansen, K. (1995). Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds. Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noteworthy surveyors ===
Three of the four U.S. Presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] were land surveyors. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] [[Surveying in early America|surveyed]] colonial or frontier territories prior to serving office.

[[David T. Abercrombie]] practiced land surveying before starting an [[outfitter]] store of [[excursion]] goods. The business would later turn into [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] lifestyle clothing store.

[[Percy Fawcett|Percy Harrison Fawcett]] is a British surveyor that explored the jungles of South America attempting to find the [[Lost City of Z]]. His biography and expeditions were recounted in the book [[The Lost City of Z (book)|''The Lost City of Z'']] and were later adapted on [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film screen]].

[[Inō Tadataka]] produced the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques starting in 1800, at the age of 55.

[[File:Cl-triconti-en.PNG|thumb|280px|Map of '''Tricontinental Chile''' with possessions in South America, [[Oceania]] ([[Easter Island]]), and [[Antarctica]] ([[Chilean Antarctic Territory]])]]
'''Tricontinental Chile''' ({{lang-es|Chile tricontinental}}) is a [[geopolitic]]al concept denoting [[Chile]]'s unique position with its mainland in [[South America]], [[Easter Island]] in [[Oceania]] and the [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title= Chile: un país tricontinental |url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.icarito.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_152308993_152512596_1,00.html&amp;title=Chile%3A%20un%20pa%C3%ADs%20tricontinental |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continental Chile==
{{Main|Continental Chile}}
Continental Chile corresponds to the strip of territory along the southwestern coast of [[South America]] and its adjacent islands. Almost the entire population lives in continental Chile, which extends from 17°30’ S, at the border with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], to the [[Diego Ramírez Islands]] at  56°30’ S. The maximum width of {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}} is at 52°21’ S, at the [[Strait of Magellan]], whilst the minimum width is at 31°37’ S between Punta Amolanas and Paso de la Casa de Piedra.

==Insular Chile==
{{Main|Insular Chile}}
Insular Chile consists of a group of islands of volcanic origin in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], far from the continental coast. In the eastern group are the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] and the [[Desventuradas Islands]], which are grouped with South America, while [[Easter Island]] and the [[Isla Salas y Gómez]] geographically belong to [[Polynesia]] in [[Oceania]]. Easter Island (or Rapa Nui), is the westernmost part of Chile, situated at 27°S and 109°W.

==Chilean Antarctica==
{{Main|Chilean Antarctic Territory}}
The [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] is a claim of {{convert|1250000|km2|abbr=on}} of Antarctica between 53°W and 90°W and from 60°S to the [[South Pole]], overlapping with the claims of [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. As a signatory to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]], Chile has accepted the suspension of its claims of sovereignty without renouncing them, as well as the establishment of a conservation zone for scientific development.

If the Antarctic claim was included, the total area of Chile would be {{convert|2006096|km2|abbr=on}}, while the distance between the northern and southern extremes would be more than {{convert|8000|km|abbr=on}}.

Between these three distinct zones is the so-called [[Chilean Sea]]; portions of the [[continental shelf]] lie within the [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|370|km|abbr=on}}.

[[File:United-states-territorial-acquistions-midcentury.png|thumb|A government map, probably created in the mid-20th century, that depicts a simplified history of territorial acquisitions within the continental United States]]
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] with Great Britain defined the original borders of the United States. It generally stretched from the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in the west.  There were ambiguities in the treaty regarding the exact border with [[Canada]] to the north that led to disputes that were resolved by the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1987). ch 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the late 18th century, the new nation organized areas west of the [[Original thirteen states]] into several [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territories]], setting a template for future expansion.

===Louisiana Purchase===
The [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, was negotiated with Napoleon during the presidency of [[Thomas Jefferson]]; the territory was acquired from France for $15 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|15000000|1803|r=-6}}}} in present-day terms). A small portion of this land was ceded to Britain in 1818 in exchange for the [[Red River Basin]]. More of this land was ceded to Spain in 1819 with the Florida Purchase, but was later reacquired through Texas annexation and Mexican Cession.&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, ''The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Florida===
[[West Florida]] was declared to be a U.S. possession in 1810 by President [[James Madison]] after the territory had declared its independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samuel | first1 = C. Hyde Jr | year = 2010 | title = Consolidating the Revolution: Factionalism and Finesse in the West Florida Revolt, 1810 | url = | journal = Louisiana History | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Madison ordered the U.S. Army to take control. Six weeks later, the army entered and occupied the capital, [[St. Francisville, Louisiana|St. Francisville]], putting an end to the republic after 74 days of independence. Spain did not relinquish its claim to sovereignty (see [[West Florida Controversy]]) until ratification of the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]]. General [[Andrew Jackson]] personally accepted the delivery of West Florida from its Spanish governor on July 17, 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundaries, possessions, and conflicts in Central and North America and the Caribbean| page=298|year=1941|last=Ireland| first=Gordon|publisher=Octagon Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red River===
The parts of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Red River Colony]] south of the 49th parallel in the basin of the [[Red River Valley|Red River of the North]] were acquired in 1818 from Britain under the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]].

===East Florida===
The [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819 with Spain resulted in Spain's cession of [[East Florida]] and the [[Sabine Free State]] and Spain's surrender of any claims to the [[Oregon Country]]. Article III of the treaty, when properly surveyed, resulted in the acquisition of a small part of central [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name="AdamsOnistreatytext"&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty Text from the Avalon Project |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1819.asp |accessdate=November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Along Canada–US border===
[[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 with Britain split the disputed territory in Maine and New Brunswick and finalized the border with Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Carroll, "The Passionate Canadians: The Historical Debate about the Eastern Canadian-American Boundary," ''New England Quarterly'', Vol. 70, No. 1 (Mar., 1997), pp. 83–101 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/366528 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; including the disputed [[Republic of Indian Stream|Indian Stream territory]].

[[Texas Annexation]] of 1845: The independent [[Republic of Texas]] long sought to join the U.S., despite Mexican claims and the warning by Mexican leader [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] that this would be "equivalent to a declaration of war against the Mexican Republic." Congress approved the annexation of Texas on February 28, 1845. On December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state. Texas had claimed New Mexico east of the [[Rio Grande]] but had only made [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|one unsuccessful attempt]] to occupy it; New Mexico was [[Capture of Santa Fe|captured by the U.S. Army]] in August 1846 and then administered separately from Texas. Mexico acknowledged the loss of territory in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] of 1848.

===Oregon Territory===
[[Oregon Country]], the territory of North America west of the Rockies to the Pacific, was jointly controlled by the U.S. and Britain following the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]] until June 15, 1846 when the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the territory at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). The [[San Juan Islands]] were claimed and jointly occupied by the U.S. and the U.K. from 1846–72 due to ambiguities in the treaty (see [[Northwestern Boundary Dispute]]). Arbitration led to the sole U.S. possession of the San Juan Islands since 1872.

===Mexican Cession===
[[Mexican Cession]] lands were captured in the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846–48, and ceded by Mexico in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], where Mexico agreed to the present [[Mexico–United States border]] except for the later [[Gadsden Purchase]]. The United States paid $15 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|15000000|1847|r=-6}}}} in present-day terms) and agreed to pay claims made by American citizens against Mexico which amounted to more than $3 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3000000|1847|r=-6}}}} today).

===Gadsden Purchase===
In the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1853, the United States purchased a strip of land along the [[Mexico–United States border]] for $10 million (equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1853|r=-6}}}} in present-day terms), now in New Mexico and Arizona. The territory was also bought as Americans were passing through the land west to California.  After the American Mexican War, over the dispute of border claims, American bought the land to prevent future conflict.  Few historians would argue the territory was intended for a southern [[transcontinental railroad]].

==Since 1853==

The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an [[organized territory]] on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was closely linked by missionary work and trade to the U.S. by the 1880s. In 1893 business leaders [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrew the Queen of Hawaii]] and sought annexation. President [[Grover Cleveland]] strongly disapproved, so Hawaii set up an independent republic, the [[Republic of Hawaii]]. Southern Democrats in Congress strongly opposed a non-white addition. President [[William McKinley]], a Republican, secured a Congressional resolution in 1898, and the small republic joined the U.S. All its citizens became full U.S. citizens. One factor was the need for advanced naval bases to fend off Japanese ambitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Hawaiian Islands officially became an [[United States territory|incorporated territory of the U.S.]] in 1900. Following 94% voter approval of the [[Admission of Hawaii Act]], on August 21, 1959 the [[Territory of Hawaii]] became the state of [[Hawaii]], the 50th state.

With Hawaii came two remote coral atolls: the [[Palmyra Atoll]] which had been annexed by the U.S. in 1859, abandoned, then claimed in 1862 by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], and the [[Stewart Islands]], which had joined the Kingdom a few years before Palmyra.  At Hawaiian statehood in 1959, Palmyra and arguably the Stewarts were excluded from the new state.  Palmyra remained an incorporated U.S. territory, while the Stewarts were claimed and are now controlled by the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/og98005.pdf "U.S. Insular Areas: Application of the U.S. Constitution"] (pdf).

===Spanish colonies===

{{Main article|Spanish–American War}}
[[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and the [[Philippines]] (for which the United States compensated Spain $20 million, equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|20000000|1898|r=-6}}}} in present-day terms), were ceded by Spain after the [[Spanish–American War]] in the 1898 [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over [[Cuba]], but did not cede it to the United States, so it became a [[protectorate]]. All four of these areas were under United States Military Government (USMG) for extended periods. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902, and the Philippines became an independent nation in 1946.

This era also saw the first scattered protests against American imperialism. Noted Americans such as [[Mark Twain]] spoke out forcefully against these ventures. Opponents of the war, including Twain and [[Andrew Carnegie]], organized themselves into the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]].

During this same period the American people continued to strongly chastise the European powers for their imperialism. The [[Second Boer War]] was especially unpopular in the United States and soured Anglo-American relations. The anti-imperialist press would often draw parallels between the U.S. in the Philippines and the British in the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|1984|p=163}} "...&amp;nbsp;Will Show No Mercy Real Warfare Ahead For Filipino Rebels [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] Plan Adopted The Administration Weary of Protracted Hostilities.'

====Cuba====
Under the 1898 [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba, with the island to be occupied by the United States. Under the [[Teller Amendment]] Congress had already decided against annexation. Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902. Under the new Cuban constitution, however, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations through the Platt Amendment;&lt;ref name=knm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1646.html|title=Good Neighbor Policy|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this, however, was later renounced as part of Franklin Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor Policy]].&lt;ref name=knm /&gt; Under the [[Platt Amendment]] (1901), Cuba also agreed to lease to the U.S. the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|naval base]] at [[Guantánamo Bay]].

The naval base occupies land which the United States leased from Cuba in 1903 "...&amp;nbsp;for the time required for the purposes of coaling and naval stations."  The two governments later agreed that, "So long as the United States of America shall not abandon the said naval station of Guantanamo or the two Governments shall not agree to a modification of its present limits, the station shall continue to have the territorial area that it now has, with the limits that it has on the date of the signature of the present Treaty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/cuba/cuba002.htm|title=Agreement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval stations|date=February 23, 1903|publisher=The Avalon project, Yale Law School|accessdate=2007-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627104954/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/cuba/cuba002.htm|archivedate=June 27, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/cuba/cuba001.htm|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and Cuba|date=May 29, 1934|publisher=The Avalon project, Yale Law School|accessdate=2007-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627122832/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/cuba/cuba001.htm|archivedate=June 27, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puerto Rico====
On July 25, 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]], Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States with a landing at [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]]. As an outcome of the war, the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]] granted all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico U.S. citizenship in 1917. The U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own [[Governor of Puerto Rico|governor]] in 1948. In 1950, the Truman Administration allowed for a democratic [[referendum]] in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution without affecting the unincorporated territory status with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 3, 1950, Ch. 446, 64 Stat. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|local constitution]] was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov. Muñoz Marín on July 25, 1952, the anniversary of the 1898 arrival of U.S. troops. Puerto Rico adopted the name of ''Estado Libre Asociado'' (literally translated as "Free Associated State"), officially translated into English as [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]], for its [[body politic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexjuris.com/lexprcont.htm Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico – in Spanish (Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114003340/http://www.lexjuris.com/lexprcont.htm |date=2011-11-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://topuertorico.org/constitu.shtml Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico – in English (English translation)].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guam====
In [[Guam]], settlement by foreign ethnic groups was small at first. After [[World War II]] showed the strategic value of the island, construction of a huge military base began along with a large influx of people from other parts of the world. Guam today has a very mixed population of 164,000. The indigenous [[Chamorros]] make up 37% of the population. The rest of the population consists mostly of [[white American]]s and [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], with smaller groups of [[Chinese race|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans]], [[Micronesia]]ns, [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[India]]ns. Guam today is almost totally [[Americanization|Americanized]]. The situation is somewhat similar to that in Hawaii, but attempts to change Guam's status as an 'unincorporated' U.S. territory have yet to meet with success.

====Philippines====
{{Main article|History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|Philippine–American War}}
The [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]] began in April 1896. The Spanish–American War came to the Philippines on May 1, 1898, when the United States Navy's [[Asiatic Squadron]], commanded by Commodore [[George Dewey]], defeated the Spanish Pacific Squadron under [[Admiral]] [[Patricio Montojo y Pasarón]] during the [[Battle of Manila Bay (1898)|Battle of Manila Bay]]. On June 12, Philippine revolutionaries [[Independence Day (Philippines)|declared independence]] and establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. On December 10, 1898, the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Spanish–American War was signed. The treaty transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. This agreement was not recognized by the Philippine revolutionaries, who declared war against the United States on June 2, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/pa990602.html|title=Pedro Paterno's Proclamation of War|date=June 2, 1899|publisher=MSC Schools, Philippines|accessdate=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine–American War]] ensued. In 1901, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], president of the [[Malolos Republic]], was captured and pledged his allegiance to the American government.&lt;ref name=aguinaldo1901&gt;{{Citation|url=http://filipino.biz.ph/history/ag010419.html|title=Aguinaldo's Proclamation of Formal Surrender to the United States|date=April 19, 1901|publisher=Philippine Culture|accessdate=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. unilaterally declared an end to the conflict in 1902. Scattered fighting continued, however, until 1913.

The [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act]] of 1902 provided for the establishment of a [[bicameral legislature]] composed of an upper house consisting of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]], an appointed body with both American and Filipino members. and a popularly elected lower house, the [[Philippine Assembly]]. The Philippines became a U.S. colony in the fashion of [[Europe]]'s [[New Imperialism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with benevolent colonial practices. English joined Spanish as an official language, and English language education was made compulsory. In 1916, the United States passed the [[Philippine Autonomy Act]] and committed itself to granting independence to the Philippines "as soon as a stable government can be established therein."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/9-others/72-philippine-autonomy-act-jones-law.html |title=Philippine Autonomy Act (Jones Law) |date=August 28, 1916 |publisher=Corpus Juris |accessdate=2008-07-07 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3APhilippine+Autonomy+Act+%28Jones+Law%29&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085448/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/9-others/72-philippine-autonomy-act-jones-law.html |archivedate=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a step to full independence in 1946, partial autonomy as a [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] was granted in 1935.

Preparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the [[History of the Philippines#World War II and Japanese occupation|Japanese occupation]] of the Philippines during World War II. The United States suffered a total of 62,514 casualties, including 13,973 deaths in its attempt to liberate the Philippines from Imperial Japanese rule during the hard-fought [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines campaign]] from 1944–1945. Full independence came with the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|recognition of Philippine sovereignty by the U.S.]] in 1946.

===Wake Island===
[[Wake Island]] was annexed as empty territory by the United States in 1899 (the claim is currently disputed by the [[Marshall Islands]]).

===American Samoa===
Germany, the United States, and Britain colonized the Samoan Islands. The nations came into conflict in the [[Second Samoan Civil War]] and the nations resolved their issues, establishing [[American Samoa]] as per the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1899]]. The U.S. took control of its allotted region on June 7, 1900, with the Deed of Cession. ''[[Tutuila Island]]'' and ''[[Aunuu Island]]'' were ceded by their chiefs in 1900, then added to American Samoa.  ''[[Manua]]'' was annexed in 1904, then added to American Samoa.  ''[[Swains Island]]'' was annexed in 1925 (occupied since 1856), then added to American Samoa. (The claim is currently disputed by [[Tokelau]], a colonial territory of New Zealand.)  [[American Samoa]] was under the control of the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1900 to 1951. American Samoa was made a formal territory in 1929. From 1951 until 1977, Territorial Governors were appointed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Immigration of Americans was never as strong as it was, for instance, in Hawaii; indigenous Samoans make up 89% of the population. The islands have been reluctant to separate from the U.S. in any manner.

===Dominican Republic===
The Annexation of Santo Domingo was an attempted treaty during the later [[Reconstruction Era]], initiated by United States President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, to annex "Santo Domingo" (as the Dominican Republic was then commonly known) as a United States territory, with the promise of eventual statehood. President Grant feared some European power would take the island in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. He privately thought annexation would be a safety valve for African Americans who were suffering persecution in the US, but he did not include this in his official messages. Grant speculated that the acquisition of Santo Domingo would help bring about the end of [[slavery in Cuba]] and elsewhere. Militarily he wanted a US naval port in the Dominican Republic which would also serve as protection for a [[History of the Nicaragua Canal|projected canal across Nicaragua]].

On January 10, 1870 President Grant formally submitted Sec. Fish's Dominican Republic annexation treaty to the U.S. Senate. The treaty was stalled in the Senate until Sen. Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee started hearings in mid February, 1870. On 19 February, [[Dominican Republic annexation referendum, 1870|a referendum was held in the Dominican Republic]], in which nearly 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the annexation. Sec. Fish noted that the Senate was reluctant to pass any measures initiated by the Executive Branch. Sen. Sumner allowed the treaty to be debated openly on the Committee without giving his own opinion. However, on March 15, Senator Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee in a closed session voted to oppose the treaty 5 to 2. On March 24, in another closed session, Sen. Sumner came out strongly against the treaty. Sen. Sumner opposed the treaty believing annexation would be expensive, launch an American empire in the Caribbean, and would diminish independent Afro-Hispanic and African creole republics in the Western Hemisphere. Grant met with many Senators on Capitol Hill hoping to rally support for the Treaty, however, to no avail. Grant refused the suggestion that the treaty drop the Dominican statehood clause. Finally on June 30, 1870 the Senate defeated the Dominican Republic Annexation treaty by a vote of 28 to 28. Eighteen Senators had joined Sen. Sumner to defeat the Dominican annexation treaty.

The [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24)|first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic]] lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment.

From the start of the intervention until the [[US Marines]] withdrew in 1924, they were in almost continuous actions on both the squad and platoon levels, fighting numerous small-unit actions with elusive [[History_of_the_Dominican_Republic#Occupation|guerilla forces]]. Despite the ability of the Marines to bring a large amount of firepower to bear against the [[guerillas]] from both the ground and the air, the [[military occupation|occupation troops]] had their share of problems as well. Sometimes the enemy would successfully ambush a lone Marine patrol, killing all or most of its members, and would scatter before reinforcements arrived on the scene.

===Panama Canal Zone===

The [[Panama Canal Zone]] was an unorganized US territory located within the [[Republic of Panama]]. It was established under the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] in 1903 and disestablished in 1979 under the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]]. Panama gained full control over the [[Panama Canal]] in 1999.

===Virgin Islands===
A [[Danish West Indies status referendum, 1868|referendum on transferring ownership from Denmark to the United States]] was held on 9 January 1868 on the islands of [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Sankt Jan]] and [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Sankt Thomas]], two of three main islands in the [[Danish West Indies]]. Of the votes cast, 98% were in favor of the transfer, but it never materialized. A [[Danish West Indies status referendum, 1916|second referendum]] was held in all three islands on 17 August 1916, once again with overwhelming support for the transfer.

In 1917, the United States purchased the former [[Denmark|Danish]] [[colony]] of [[St. Croix]], [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St. John]] and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], which is now the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. The United States—which had made an earlier approach in 1902—purchased these islands because they feared that the islands might be seized as a [[submarine base]] during [[World War I]]. After several months of secret negotiations, a sales price of $25 million was agreed. A non-binding [[Danish West Indian Islands sale referendum, 1916|referendum in Denmark held in late 1916]] confirmed the decision to sell by a wide margin. The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 a few days before the U.S entered the war. The deal was ratified and finalized on January 17, 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The territory was renamed the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar31.html|title=Today in History: March 31 : Virgin Islands|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.

===Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands===

The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI) was a United Nations trust territory in [[Micronesia]] (western Pacific) administered by the United States from July 18, 1947, comprising the former [[League of Nations Mandate]] administered by Japan and taken by the U.S. in 1944. The various island groupings in the Trust Territory were later divided up. The ''[[Marshall Islands]]'' and the ''[[Federated States of Micronesia]]'' achieved independence on October 21, 1986.  ''[[Palau]]'' did so in 1994. All three nations signed [[Compact of Free Association|Compacts of Free Association]] with the United States.

===Mexican boundary===
* The [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] transferred {{convert|823|acre|km2}} of Mexican territory to the U.S., in areas near [[Presidio, Texas|Presidio]] and [[Hidalgo, Texas]], to build flood control channels. In exchange, the U.S. ceded {{convert|2177|acre|km2}} to Mexico, including five parcels near [[Presidio, Texas|Presidio]], the [[Horcon Tract]] containing the little town of [[Rio Rico, Texas]], and Beaver Island near [[Roma, Texas]]. The last of these transfers occurred in 1977.
* On November 24, 2009, the U.S. ceded 6 islands in the Rio Grande to Mexico, totaling {{convert|107.81|acres|km2}}. At the same time, Mexico ceded 3 islands and 2 cuts to the U.S., totaling {{convert|63.53|acres|km2}}. This transfer, which had been pending for 20 years, was the first application of Article III of the 1970 Boundary Treaty.
* The [[Chamizal Dispute|Chamizal Treaty]] of 1963, which ended a hundred-year dispute between the two countries near [[El Paso, Texas]], transferred {{convert|630|acres|km2}} from the U.S. to Mexico in 1967. In return, Mexico transferred {{convert|264|acres|km2}} to the U.S.
* The [[Rio Grande Rectification Project|Rio Grande Rectification Treaty]] of 1933 straightened and stabilized the {{convert|155|mi|km}} of river boundary through the highly developed [[El Paso-Juárez]] Valley. Numerous parcels of land (174) were transferred between the two countries during the construction period, 1935–1938. At the end, each nation had ceded an equal area of land ({{convert|2560.5|acres|km2}}) to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes 144|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min144.pdf|author=International Boundary and Water Commission|accessdate=2015-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308032837/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min144.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes 158|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min158.pdf|author=International Boundary and Water Commission|accessdate=2015-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308033025/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min158.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Banco Convention of 1905]] resulted in many exchanges of bancos (land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated from either country by a cutoff, often due to rapid accretion or avulsion of the alluvial channel) between the two nations, most often in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Under the treaty, the following transfers involving [[Texas]] occurred from 1910–1976:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Restless River, International Law and the Behavior of the Rio Grande |publisher=Texas Western Press |author=Mueller, Jerry E. |year=1975 |page=64 |isbn=9780874040500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the International Boundary Line is to be changed under Article III of the ''1970 Boundary Treaty''. The result is 138 proposed transfers of territory that remain pending further evaluation and approval by the [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] and the two governments. Upon resolution, the U.S. is to cede 7 islands and 60 cuts in the Rio Grande to Mexico, totaling {{convert|1251.2|acres|km2}}, while Mexico is to cede 3 islands and 68 cuts to the U.S., totaling {{convert|1275.9|acres|km2}}.

In 1925, to correct an unintended effect from an earlier treaty, the U.S. ceded to Canada two enclaves comprising two and one-half acres of water territory in the [[Lake of the Woods]].&lt;ref name = "Boggs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acls-aatc.ca/files/english/books/5.1.jpg |title= Map of the vicinity of the northwesternmost point of Lake of the Woods |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Mariana Islands===
The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] were part of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands but decided in the 1970s not to seek independence. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in political union with the United States was established in 1978.

A '''voting age''' is a [[age of majority|minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to [[suffrage|vote in a public election]]. Today, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below). Most  countries have set a minimum voting age, often set in their constitution. In a number of countries [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] for those eligible to vote, while in most it is optional.

When the [[suffrage|right to vote]] was being established in [[democracy|democracies]], the voting age was generally set at 21 or higher. In the 1970s many countries reduced the voting age to 18. The debate is ongoing in a number of countries on proposals to reduce the voting age to or below 18.

In 1890, Law No. 5, 1890, of the [[South African Republic]] set a voting age there of 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;

Before [[World War II|the Second World War]] of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 20 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aomol.net/000001/000138/html/am138--51.html ''"Lowering the Minimum Voting Age to 18  Years - Pro and Con Arguments"''], Constitutional Revision Study Documents of the [[Maryland]] Constitutional Convention Commission, 1968. Retrieved 5 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, reduced their voting ages to 18 years during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom (1969),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Representation of the People Act 1969]]''&lt;/ref&gt; with the United States ([[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution |26th Amendment]]) (1971), Canada, West Germany (1972), Australia (1974), France (1974), and others following soon afterwards. By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher. It was argued{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} that young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, and many{{quantify|date=November 2018}} people felt they should be able to vote at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sanders|first= Mark|title= Your Right To Vote|date= 2000|publisher= Raintree Steck- Vaugh company|location= United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2018}}

==Debate on lowering the voting age to 16==
[[File: NYRA Berkeley voting age protest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demonstration in favour of lowering the voting age by members of [[National Youth Rights Association|NYRA]] [[Berkeley, California]] (2004)]]
Around the year 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16. The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for [[municipal elections]] in some [[States of Germany]] was lowered to 16. [[Lower Saxony]] was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.&lt;ref name="16 locals"/&gt;

Arguments against lowering the voting age to sixteen include lack of political maturity. On the other hand, one of the major arguments for lowering the voting age to 16 is that at this age in most countries a person has reached the [[legal working age]] for most jobs and is liable to pay taxes and therefore [[No taxation without representation|should not have to pay taxes without the right to political representation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youngcitizens.org/lowering-the-voting-age-to-16 Lowering the voting age to 16]. ''Young Citizens''. Retrieved 21 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in [[U.S. states]], including [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://youthrights.org/votestatus.php Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age], National Youth Rights Association&lt;/ref&gt; but none was successful. A national reduction was proposed in 2005 in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Canada]], Bill C-261 (2005); [http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm Vote16, Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801045625/http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm |date=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of New South Wales]], Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Amendment (Voting Age) Bill (2005); [[Hansard]], 14 September 2005, [http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 p. 17686] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125157/http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 |date=29 September 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but these proposals were not adopted. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament [[Mogens Jensen]] presented an initiative to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]] to lower the voting age in Europe to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|title=edoc11895|format=PDF|accessdate=6 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527175929/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A report suggesting that consideration be given to reducing the voting age to 16 in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in [[Canberra]], Australia was tabled in the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|territorial legislature]] on 26 September 2007 and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACT to consider lowering voting age|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=26 September 2007|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/26/2043628.htm|accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, federal Opposition Leader [[Bill Shorten]] said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;ABC News, 31 October 2015, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-31/shorten-calls-for-voting-age-to-be-lowered-to-16/6901464 Bill Shorten calls for voting age to be lowered to 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
In 2007, Austria became the first member of the [[European Union]] to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes.&lt;ref name="Austria 4"/&gt; The voting age had been reduced in Austria from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992. At that time a voting age of 16 was proposed by the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], but was not adopted.&lt;ref name="NR pass"/&gt;

The voting age for municipal elections in some [[States of Austria|states]] was lowered to 16 shortly after 2000.&lt;ref name="16 locals"&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/AEM_10002-8073__E__N__S__W__.pdf ''How old is old enough?'' - the minimum age of voting and candidacy in UK elections: consultation paper], July 2003, UK [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], para. 3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Three states had made the reduction by 2003 ([[Burgenland]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]]),&lt;ref name="16 locals"/&gt; and in May 2003 [[Vienna]] became the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000030.html ''Austria joins the votes at 16 club''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911145438/http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000030.html |date=11 September 2007 }}, [[Votes at 16]].

Retrieved 6 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and so by the start of 2005 the total had reached at least five states out of nine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/9E8D42171C86FEE9C1256F8900731350?opendocument ''Committee on Rights of Child Considers Second Periodic Report of Austria''], [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UNHCHR]], 14 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of state law, reduction of the municipal voting age in the states of Burgenland, Salzburg and Vienna resulted in the reduction of the regional voting age in those states as well.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

After the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|2006 election]], the winning [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]]-[[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]] coalition announced on 12 January 2007 that one of its policies would be the reduction of the voting age to 16 for elections in all states and at all levels in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oleksyn|first=Veronika|title=Austrians split on voting at age 16 plan|publisher=AP/washingtonpost.com|date=12 January 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011202410.html|accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was set in motion by a Government announcement on 14 March,&lt;ref&gt;

On 20 November 2013, Malta lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections starting from 2015. The proposal had wide support from both the government and opposition, social scientists and youth organizations.

On Monday 29 January 2018, the Maltese Parliament debated to lower the voting age to 16 for general elections, European Parliament Elections and referenda.

On Monday, 5 March 2018, the Maltese Parliament unanimously voted in favour of amending the constitution, lowering the official voting age from 18 to 16, making Malta the second state in the [[European Union|EU]] to lower its voting age to 16.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/85054/vote_16_unanimously_approved&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Representation of the People Act 1969]]'' lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, with effect from 1970 and remained in force until the ''[[Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013]]'' which allowed 16 year olds to vote for the first time, but only in Scotland and only in that particular referendum.

Men in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote.  The [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/jul/02/royal-assent#S5CV0219P0_19280702_HOC_422 Hansard, House of Commons, fifth edition, vol 219, col 1035]&lt;/ref&gt; brought the voting age for women down to 21.

The reduction of the voting age to 16 in the United Kingdom was first given serious consideration on 15 December 1999, when the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] considered in Committee an amendment proposed by [[Simon Hughes]] to the ''Representation of the People Bill''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991215/debtext/91215-steven smells14.htm#91215-14_time0 HC Deb, 15 December 1999, Vol. 341, cc. 305-338.] Retrieved 3 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the reduction of a voting age below 18 had ever been put to a vote in the Commons.&lt;ref name="c336"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991215/debtext/91215-steven smells14.htm#91215-14_time0 HC Deb, 15 December 1999, Vol. 341, c. 336.] Retrieved 3 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government opposed the amendment, and it was defeated by 434 votes to 36.&lt;ref name="c336"/&gt;

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] chose not to include a provision reducing the voting age in the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006|Electoral Administration Act]] during its passage in 2006.

On 27 February 2006, the report of the [[Power Inquiry]] called for a reduction of the voting age, and of the [[age of candidacy|candidacy age]] for the House of Commons, to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political system faces 'meltdown'|publisher=BBC News|date=27 February 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4753876.stm|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], indicated in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he favoured a reduction provided it was made concurrently with effective [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=And so does Gordon Brown|publisher=Votes at 16|date=27 February 2006|url=http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000134/and_so_does_gordon_brown.html|accessdate=3 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117063519/http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000134/and_so_does_gordon_brown.html|archivedate=17 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 5 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission would examine the case for lowering the voting age. On launching the Paper in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], PM [[Gordon Brown]] said: "Although the voting age has been 18 since 1969, it is right, as part of that debate, to examine, and hear from young people themselves, whether lowering that age would increase participation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/debtext/70703-0004.htm HC Deb, 3 July 2007, Vol. 462, c. 819.] Retrieved 5 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Youth Parliament debates of 30 October 2009 in the House of Commons, Votes at 16 was debated and young people of that age group voted for it overwhelmingly as a campaign priority. Since that debate the issue has been raised in Prime Minister's Questions and has also gained the widespread support of the major political parties.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the United States, the debate about lowering voting age from 21 to 18 began during [[World War II]] and intensified during the [[Vietnam War]], when most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote, and the image of young men being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of voting successfully pressured legislators to lower the voting age nationally and in many states.

Currently, the Maine Green Independent Party, the state branch of the [[Green Party of the United States]], calls for the lowering of the voting age to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainegreens.org/index.php?sectionID=266&amp;pageID=590&amp;mode= |title=Green Platform|publisher=Mainegreens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Youth suffrage]] appears to be gaining ground in [[Massachusetts]]; three of the four Democratic United States Senate candidates in 2010 supported lowering the voting age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowerthevote.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/three-massachusetts-senator-candidates-support-lower-voting-age|title=Three Massachusetts Senator Candidates Support Lower Voting Age|publisher=Lowerthevote.wordpress.com|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Takoma Park, Maryland|City of Takoma Park, Maryland]] became the first place in the United States to lower its voting age to 16, for local (but not general) elections and referendums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/takoma-park-grants-16-year-olds-right-to-vote/2013/05/14/b27c52c4-bccd-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html|title=Takoma Park grants 16-year-olds right to vote|publisher=WashingtonPost.com|date=14 May 2013|first=Lindsay A.|last=Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/05/election-day-weird/3448145/|publisher=USA Today|title=16-year-olds voting?

===Venezuela===
A request to lower the voting age to 16 was made during consideration of revisions to the [[Constitution of Venezuela]] in 2007. [[Cilia Flores]], president of the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]], announced that the Mixed Committee for Constitutional Reform had found the idea acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Morgan|title=Further details of Chavez' package of constitutional reforms are emerging|publisher=Caracas Daily Journal|date=9 September 2007|url=http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=75781|accessdate=29 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233819/http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=75781|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following approval in the legislature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Walter|title=Venezuela May Lower Voting Age, Add Gay Rights in Constitution|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=11 October 2007|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aqg5jOxmM.Vg&amp;refer=latin_america|accessdate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amendment formed part of the package of constitutional proposals, and was defeated in the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007|2007 referendum]].

==Maximum voting age==
There are occasional calls for a maximum voting age, on the grounds that older people have less of a stake in the future of the country or jurisdiction and tend to vote on the basis of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]],[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11467418 Introduce a maximum voting age], [[New Zealand Herald]], 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting ages around the world==
Eighteen is the most common voting age, with a small minority of countries differing from this rule. Those with a national minimum age of 17 include East Timor, Greece, Indonesia, North Korea, [[South Sudan]] and Sudan. The minimum age is 16 in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and the [[Isle of Man]], Jersey and Guernsey (three self-governing British Crown Dependencies). People aged 16–18 can vote in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro if employed. The highest minimum voting age is 21 in several nations. Some countries have variable provision for the minimum voting age, whereby a lower age is set for eligibility to vote in state, regional or municipal elections.

The only known maximum voting age is in the [[Holy See]], where the franchise for electing a new Pope is restricted to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] under the age of 80.

==Chronology of lowering the voting age to 18==
The following is a [[chronology|chronological]] list of the dates upon which countries lowered the voting age to 18; unless otherwise indicated, the reduction was from 21.
