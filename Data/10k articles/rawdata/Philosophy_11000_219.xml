'''Adam Karl August von Eschenmayer''' (originally '''Carl'''; 4 July 1768{{snd}}17 November 1852) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[physician]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Neuenbürg]] in [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]] in 1768. After receiving his early education at the Caroline academy of [[Stuttgart]], he entered the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was given the degree of doctor of medicine. He practised for some time as a physician at [[Sulz am Neckar|Sulz]], and then at [[Kirchheim unter Teck|Kirchheim]], and in 1811 he was chosen extraordinary professor of [[philosophy]] and [[medicine]] at Tübingen. In 1818 he became ordinary professor of [[practical philosophy]], but in 1836 he resigned and took up his residence at Kirchheim, where he devoted his whole attention to philosophical studies.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Eschenmayer, Adam Karl August von|volume=9|pages=764-765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Eschenmayer's views are largely identical with those of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], but he differed from him in regard to the knowledge of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. He believed that in order to complete the arc of truth, philosophy must be supplemented by what he called ''non-philosophy'' ({{lang-de|Nichtphilosophie}}), a kind of mystical illumination by which was obtained a belief in [[God]] that could not be reached by mere intellectual effort.&lt;ref&gt;Höffding, H., ''Hist. of Mod. Phil.'', Eng. trans. vol. 2, 1900, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; He carried this tendency to [[mysticism]] into his physical researches, and was led by it to take a deep interest in the phenomena of [[animal magnetism]]. He ultimately became a devout believer in demoniacal and spiritual possession; and his later writings are all strongly impregnated with [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5950">'''Arnold Boate''' (1606–1653) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physician, writer and [[Hebraist]] who spent much of his life abroad, and lived for several years  in [[Dublin]]. There he married Margaret Dongan, a judge's daughter, whom he portrayed lovingly in his book ''The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.340&lt;/ref&gt; He was the brother of [[Gerard Boate]], author of ''The Natural History of Ireland'', for which Arnold supplied much of the material.  Both Gerard and Arnold were members of the [[Hartlib circle]].

==Background==
Born Arnold de Boot in [[Gorinchem]] in the [[Netherlands]], he was a younger son of the [[knight]] Godfried de Boot (c.1570-1625) and  his wife Christine van Loon.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p.283&lt;/ref&gt; Like his brother he attended the [[University of Leiden]] and qualified as a [[doctor of medicine]]. He also developed a deep interest in [[Hebrew]] studies and in particular the correct reading of the [[Old Testament]]. His first book, co-written with Francis Taylor and entitled ''Examen Praefationis Morini in Biblia Graeca de Textus Ebraici et Graeci authoritate'' was published in [[Leiden]] in 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He and  his brother Gerard moved to [[London]] about 1630 to practice medicine. It was said that they became involved in a dispute with the [[Royal College of Physicians]], but Arnold was lucky enough to become personal physician to [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester was later appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] and,  though he never actually went to Ireland, he may have recommended Arnold to his  Irish friends. Arnold's writings had already brought him to the attention of [[James Ussher]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]], and it was Ussher who invited Arnold to Ireland in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt; He became Ussher's personal physician, and was later appointed [[Surgeon-General]] to the [[Irish Army]]. He also built up a flourishing private practice among the Dutch community in [[Dublin]].

In 1641 Gerard and Arnold co-wrote ''Philosophia Naturalis Reformata'', an attack upon [[Aristotelianism]].    Arnold's experience as an army doctor also led him to write ''Diverse remarkable passages .. of our Army in Ireland (1642) ''and'' Observationes medicae de affectibus a veteribus omissis (1649).

His marriage, which was  a love match, to Margaret Dongan, daughter of [[Thomas Dongan (judge)|Thomas Dongan]], judge of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]]  and his first wife Grace Palmer strengthened his ties with the Irish Protestant ruling class, although his father-in-law, according to Elrington  Ball, was not much respected, partly because he was known to be a [[Roman Catholic]] who conformed to the [[Protestant]] faith only for the purpose of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold however wrote  of Dongan in his memoir of Margaret  with affection and respect. Dongan was a wealthy man, but suffered heavy losses during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball p,340&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1644 Arnold decided to quit Ireland. He moved briefly to stay with his brother in London but then settled permanently in [[Paris]]. Much of his later career was spent in scholarly dispute with Louis Capel who had
questioned his Biblical readings and the result was a lengthy pamphlet war, involving several scholars on both sides, including Ussher.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his brother he was a member of the [[Hartlib Circle]], the circle of scholars who corresponded with [[Samuel Hartlib]] on scientific, religious and political issues, and he is credited with having established the Irish branch of the circle; even after he left Ireland he acted as a conduit between Hartlib and Ussher. Gerard's most famous work ''The Natural History of Ireland'' was written at Hartlib's suggestion from material collected by Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt; After Gerard's death in 1650 Hartlib suggested that Arnold continue the work, but Arnold himself died in Paris in 1653.

==Family==
On [[Christmas Day]] 1642 Arnold married Margaret Dongan (1626-1651).&lt;ref&gt;Ball p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Of their three children two died young. Mariana, their only surviving daughter, married Marcus Beyerman. Margaret died in April 1651 from complications during [[pregnancy]].

Arnold was devoted to his wife and shortly after her death published a remarkable tribute, ''The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman as it has been acted by Mistress Margaret Dongan'', which was dedicated to [[Thomas Sydserf]], [[Bishop of Galloway]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert p.283&lt;/ref&gt; It paints a picture of a young woman notable for beauty, religious fervour, kindness, peaceful nature, charity and  family loyalty

The '''Ba'Alawi tariqa''' ({{lang-ar|طريقة آل باعلوي}}), also known as the '''Tariqa Alawiyya''' is a [[Sufi order]] centered in [[Hadhramawt]], [[Yemen]], but now spread across the [[Indian Ocean]] rim along with the [[Hadhrami diaspora]]. The order is closely tied to the [[Ba'Alawi sadah]] family.

It was founded by [[Muhammad al-Faqih Muqaddam|al-Faqih Muqaddam As-Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali Ba'Alawi al-Husaini]], who died in the year 653 AH (1232 CE). He received his [[ijazah]] from [[Abu Madyan]] in Morocco via two of his students.&lt;ref&gt;Anne K. Bang, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCgzr5jKQEkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sufis and Scholars of the Sea: Family Networks in East Africa, 1860–1925], Routledge, 2003, pg 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Madyan]] was a student of [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], as well as one of the shaikhs in the [[Shadhili]]ya tariqa chain of spiritual transmitters from Muhammad. The members of this Sufi way are mainly [[sayyid]]s whose ancestors hail from the valley of [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]], in the southern part of [[Yemen]], although it is not limited to them.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

The chain of [[ijazah]] of spiritual Sufi transmission from al-Faqih Muqaddam Sayyid Muhammad traces back to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] via his cousin [[Ali]] and from him, his son [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husain]].{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}} 

==The Origin==
The name Ba'Alawi itself is a [[Hadhrami Arabic|Hadhrami]] contraction of the terms Bani 'Alawi or the Clan of 'Alawi.

In the early 4th Century Hijri at 318 H, [[Ahmad al-Muhajir|Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhaajir]] bin Isa ar-Rumi bin Muhammad al-Naqib bin [[Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq]] migrated from Basrah, Iraq first to Mecca and Medina, and then to Hadhramout, to avoid the chaos then prevalent in the [[Abbasid|Abbassid]] Caliphate, where descendants of Muhammad were continuously being suspected of arson and revolt against the caliph.  Most descendants of Muhammad known as [[sayyid]]s enjoyed much followings due to their steep knowledge in Islam and its teachings, both esoteric and exoteric.  Although such personalities may not have political ambitions, having huge followings means that they always attract the suspicions of the caliphate.

The name 'Alawi refers to the grandson of Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhajir, who was the first descendant of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husain]], Muhammad's grandson, to be born in [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] and the first to bear such a name.

Thus all the 'Alawi [[sayyid]]s of [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] are his progeny, and his descendants has since spread far and wide to the Arabian Peninsula, India especially in northern states of Surat and Ahmadebad and along the Malabar Coasts, North and West Coast of Africa, India, and the countries of the Malay Archipelago spreading [[Sunni]] Islam of the [[Shafii]] school and the Ba'Alawi Tariqah brand of Sufism.

Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order, according to historians, is linked to [[Abu Madyan|Madyaniyya]] Sufi order.  It is also influenced by [[Qadiriyya]], all because the founder, [[Muhammad al-Faqih al-Muqaddam]] received the spiritual transmissions from them.&lt;ref name="aziz"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQICAwAAQBAJ| title=Religion and Mysticism in Early Islam: Theology and Sufism in Yemen| volume=26| first=Muhammad |last=Ali Aziz|

As the founding father of the Sufism in Hadhramaut, he received the title of the ''[[Qutb|Qutb al-Irshad wa Ghausil al-'Ibad Wa al-Bilad]]'' ({{lang-ar|قطب الارشاد وغوث العباد والبلاد}}) of the Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order, which is the highest rank in Sufism (see also [[Abdal]]).&lt;ref name="aziz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nurmuhammad.com/NaqshbandiSecrets/qutbanniyya.htm| title=Qutbanniyya|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lontar.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/20280795-Lutfhi%20Fathimah%20Handayani.pdf|title=Kebertahanan Organisasi Islam berideologi Tasawuf|first=Luthfi|last=Fathimah Handayani|format=thesis|publisher=Universitas Indonesia|year=2012|language=id|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.sufiwiki.com/Awliya|title=Awliya|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the followers of Ba 'Alawiyya functioned secretly for about five centuries.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_U-S9cgKGIC| title=The Other Islam: Sufism and the Road to Global Harmony| first=Stephen |last=Schwartz|edition=unabridged| publisher=Crown Publishing Group| year=2008| isbn=978-0-385-52665-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrines==
Like many other Sufi orders, Ba 'Alawi order supports the doctrine of outward (''zahir'') and inward (''batin''). The outward aspect of this tariqa consists of pursuing religious sciences and ritual practices while its inward aspect is the attainment of Sufi stations (''maqamat'') and states (''ahwal''). The virtues of the order is that its adherents never disclose their secrets (''sawn al-asrar'') and they preserve them from uninitiated. The outward aspect follows [[Al-Ghazali]]'s practices as described in his ''Ihya Ulum al-Deen'', while the inward aspect is similar to [[Shadhili|Shadiliyya]] Sufi order.&lt;ref name="aziz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111209102407/http://tariqa.sites.uol.com.br/ {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic doctrine of Ba 'Alawiyya is the purification of heart through saintly life.  Even Though it is a Sufism and an offshoot of [[Qadiriyya]], but it does not have ''Khalwah'' (seclusion for purposes of spiritual exercise) and does not renounce worldly activities.&lt;ref name="mapilla"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlb5BrabQd8C| title=Mappila Muslims: A Study on Society and Anti Colonial Struggles| first=Husain |last=Raṇṭattāṇi| publisher=Other Books| year=2007| isbn=978-81-903887-8-8| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasizes the teaching and practicing ''[[Akhlaq]]'' as exemplified by the Prophet [[Muhammad]].

Imam Ahmad bin Isa al-Muhajir and his son, according to majority of historians, spread the legal school of [[Shafi'i]] and [[Ash'ari]] for theology. A few historians had pointed out that Ba 'Alawis incline to [[Shia Islam|Shiism]] because many of the Shiites had followed some of the order of Ba Alawis in certain regions&lt;ref name="mapilla"/&gt; In fact, some of the practices done in Ba'Alawiyya are similar to Shiah's practices, such as [[Ziyarat]] or building [[Shrine]]s.

R.B. Serjeant summarizes the main points of Ba 'Alawiyya tariqa: The Sayyids affirm it is the best ''Tariqa'' based on [[Koran|al-Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]] and the beliefs of pious ancestors (''al-Aslaf Shalihin''), but act with humility, piety and lofty motive.  The follower must love obscurity, dislike manifestation, withdraw from madding crowd, but he still has to warn and advice in matters of religious duty.  He must also show kindness to his family, relatives, neighbors, friends, acquaintances, tribes and to all other Muslims.&lt;ref name="aziz"/&gt;

The tradition was transmitted orally in its first generation, so no books were written. Later on, transmission through writing became more important to clarify some obscurity.  Books such as ''al-Burqa'', ''al-Ma'arij'', ''al-Kibrit al-Ahmar'', ''al-Juz al-Latif'' were then written to preserve the gradual disappearance of the tariqa.&lt;ref name="aziz"/&gt;   The tariqa also teaches the adherents to give [[da'wah]] and disseminate Islam peacefully without violence. This explains why Islam could have spread easily in South East Asian countries and was accepted by the indigenous people, where the followers brought Islam peacefully and mostly through trading and marriage (this because the men did not bring their wives abroad).&lt;ref name="freitag"&gt;{{cite book| title=Hadhrami Traders, Scholars and Statesmen in the Indian Ocean, 1750s to 1960s| series=Volume 57 of Social, economic, and political studies of the Middle East and Asia|

Ba 'Alawiyya followers also practice other outward-aspect traditions not taught in ''Ihya Ulum al-Deen''. For example, it is common for the Ba 'Alawiyya followers in the past, mainly in Hadhramaut and [[Malay Archipelago]], to perform [[Taqbil]], especially to respected [[Habib]]s.&lt;ref name="mapilla"/&gt;  Annual spiritual activities such as [[Mawlid]], ''Khaul'' (anniversary commemoration of the death of a family member or to highly respected persons in the community&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr40qWoVQRwC| title=Islam Beyond Conflict: Indonesian Islam and Western Political Theory Law, ethics and governance| editor=Azyumardi Azra| editor2=Wayne Hudson| publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7546-7092-6| page=237 | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or practices performed routinely such as ''Majlis [[Dhikr]]'' (Dhikr assemblies, usually by reciting {{transl|ar|dhikr}} or {{transl|ar|wirid}} such as ''Wird al-Latif'' or ''Ratib'' by [[Abdullah ibn Alawi al-Haddad|Habib Abdullah bin Alwi al-Haddad]] after every [[Fajr]] and [[Maghrib]] time),&lt;ref name="bekasi"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQLYAAAAMAAJ| title=Tradisi pembacaan ratibul Haddad di Bekasi: laporan penelitian| first=Aam | last=Abdillah| publisher=Pusat Penelitian, IAIN Sunan Gunung Djati| place=Bandung|year=1998|page=56| language=id| accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tahlil]]'' (another form of Dhikr assembly, but usually is performed if somebody dies), Reading of classical Islamic books,&lt;ref name="khatam"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bahrusshofa.blogspot.com/2008/07/tradisi-khatam-bukhari.html| title=Tradisi Khatam Bukhari|language=id|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ziyarat]] are practices followed by Ba 'Alawiyya.&lt;ref name="turmudi"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thrtmDsd6KAC| title=Struggling for the Umma: Changing Leadership Roles of Kiai in Jombang, East Java| series=Islam in Southeast Asia Series|first=Endang |last=Turmudi| publisher=ANU E Press|year=2006| isbn=978-1-920942-43-4| page=214| accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these events it is not uncommon to see [[Haḍra]]s and [[Qasida]]s also recited and sometimes accompanied with [[Rebana]]s. Some of the above practices (such as mawlid or qasida) even performed in wedding ceremonies by Ba 'Alawi communities.&lt;ref name="aziz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turmudi"/&gt;

The influences of Ba 'Alawi tariqa can be found also in a few large Islamic organizations.  For example, the rituals performed by members of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] such as ''Tahlil'', mawlid or ziyarat are all influenced by and can be traced back to the Ba 'Alawiyya teachings, where [[Hadhrami Sheikhdom|Hadhrami]] of Ba 'Alawiyya migrated and taught the tariqa in [[Java]] since 18th centuries.

Some of the prominent figures of this tariqa are:

'''Brahmavidya '''(derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words [[Mantra|brahma]] and [[vidya|vidyā]]) is that branch of scriptural knowledge derived primarily through a study of the divine. Brahmvidya is the knowledge and spiritual knowledge of divine faith/God/existence. Put together, it means knowledge of the mantra/absolute. Brahmavidya is considered to be the highest ideal of classical. Brahmvidya does not pertain to hinduism, many other faiths practice and learn brahmvidya through different means, the Sikhs practice and learn brahmvidya through their Guru, the eternal Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Each faith teaches about the divine through different studies, yet the brahmvidya is one and the same - Truth itself.

In the Puranas, this is divided into two branches, the first one dealing with the vedic mantras and is called [[Para Vidya|para vidya]] or former knowledge, and the latter dealing with the study of the upanishads and is called the apara vidya or latter knowledge. Both para and apara vidya constitute brahma vidya.

==Etymology==
'''Brahma '''- The word ''brahma'' is used in modern [[Hinduism]] to refer to the name of a god who is a part of the [[Hindu trinity]], for more information see [[Brahman (disambiguation)]]. However, in the context of traditional Vedic study, it holds two meanings. In the Pūrva [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] philosophy, which is based on a study of the [[samhita]] and [[brahmana]] sections of the vedas, the word brahma refers to the vedic mantras. In the uttara Mimamsa i.e. Vedanta philosophy, which is based on a study of the [[Aranyakas|Aranyaka]] and the [[Upanishads|Upanishad]] sections of the vedas, the word ''Brahma'' means the absolute universal reality called [[Brahman]].

'''Vidya''' - The word ''vidyā'' (विद्या) means "knowledge,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|Macdonell's]] Sanskrit Lexicon [http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE&amp;searchhws=yes definition] is "knowledge, learning, science"&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root -''vid''- ("to know"), also seen in the word [[Vedas|Veda]]. Its cognates in other [[Indo-European languages]] are: 
* [[Greek language|Greek]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BC%B6%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BD εἶδον] for ἐϝιδον ("I saw"), [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BF%E1%BC%B6%CE%B4%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek οἶδα] for ϝοιδα ("I know")
* [[Latin]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/videre#Latin vidēre] ("to see")
* [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] věděti
* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] witan, wait
* [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wizzan#Old_High_German wizzan], [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wissen#German wissen] ("to know")
* [[English language|English]] wisdom, wit

==Current usage==
In modern Hinduism, Brahmavidya is used to mean a spiritual study of Hindu scriptures with the aim of realizing the ultimate reality. Different modern Hindu leaders have defined it in the context of their own systems of philosophy.

[[Swami Sivananda]], the founder of the [[Divine Life Society]] opines that Brahmavidya is the "Science of sciences" or the "Science of the Absolute".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brahmavidya by Swami Sivananda Saraswathi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Climatic Research Unit email controversy}}
[[File:Hubert Lamb Building.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Hubert Lamb Building, University of East Anglia, where the Climatic Research Unit is based]]
'''Climatic Research Unit documents''' including thousands of e-mails and other [[computer file]]s were stolen from a server at the [[Climatic Research Unit]] of the [[University of East Anglia]] in a [[Climatic Research Unit hacking incident|hacking incident in November 2009]]. The documents were redistributed first through several blogs of [[global warming skeptics]], who alleged that the documents indicated misconduct by leading climate scientists. A series of investigations rejected these allegations, while concluding that CRU scientists should have been more open with distributing data and methods on request.  Precisely six committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;The six major investigations covered by secondary sources include:  [http://www.deccanherald.com/content/61233/uk-climategate-inquiry-largely-clears.html House of Commons Science and Technology Committee] (UK); [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/science/earth/08climate.html Independent Climate Change Review] (UK); [http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/04/oxburgh-report-clears-controvers.html International Science Assessment Panel] (UK); [https://web.archive.org/web/20100704031346/http://views.washingtonpost.com/climate-change/post-carbon/2010/07/by_juliet_eilperin_a_pennsylvania.html Pennsylvania State University] (US);  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-10899538 United States Environmental Protection Agency] (US); [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/02/24/science-climategate-noaa.html Department of Commerce] (US).&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of [[Human impact on the environment|human activity]] remained unchanged by the end of the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Biello, David (Feb., 2010). "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=negating-climategate Negating 'Climategate']". ''Scientific American''. '''(302)''':2. 16. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}. "In fact, nothing in the stolen material undermines the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and that humans are to blame"; See also: Lubchenco, Jane (2 December 2009) House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (House Select Committee).

"...the e-mails really do nothing to undermine the very strong scientific consensus and the independent scientific analyses of thousands of scientists around the world that tell us that the Earth is warming and that the warming is largely a result of human activities." As quoted in the report published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110330133202/http://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/2011.02.18_IG_to_Inhofe.pdf Office of Inspector General].&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident occurred shortly before the opening December 2009 [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen global climate summit]]. It has prompted general discussion about increasing the openness of scientific data (though the majority of climate data have always been freely available). Scientists, scientific organisations, and government officials have stated that the incident does not affect the overall scientific case for climate change. [[Andrew Revkin]] reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hacked E-Mail Is New Fodder for Climate Dispute |first=Revkin |last=Andrew |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 November 2009  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/science/earth/21climate.html?ref=science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the documents==
The material comprised more than 1,000 e-mails, 2,000 documents, as well as commented [[source code]], pertaining to [[climate change]] research covering a period from 1996 until 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters 23 Nov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5AM4AH20091123|title=Hacked climate e-mails awkward, not game changer|last=Gardner|first=Timothy|date=23 November 2009 |work=Green Business|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the e-mails which have been widely publicised included discussions of how to combat the arguments of climate change sceptics, unflattering comments about sceptics, queries from journalists, and drafts of scientific papers.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 20 Nov"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|title=Hacked E-Mail Is New Fodder for Climate Dispute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/science/earth/21climate.html?_r=3|work=The New York Times|date=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been assertions that these discussions indicated efforts to shut out dissenters and their points of view,&lt;ref name="WSJ 23 Nov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125883405294859215|title=Climate Emails Stoke Debate:Scientists' Leaked Correspondence Illustrates Bitter Feud over Global Warming|last=Johnson |first=Keith |date=23 November 2009 |work=U.S. NEWS |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included discussions about destroying files in order to prevent them from being revealed under the UK [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].&lt;ref name="Moore 24 Nov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/globalwarming/6637006/Climate-change-scientists-face-calls-for-public-inquiry-over-data-manipulation-claims.html |title=Climate change scientists face calls for public inquiry over data manipulation claims |last=Moore |first=Matthew |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2010-01-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mdXqWeCz?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/globalwarming/6637006/Climate-change-scientists-face-calls-for-public-inquiry-over-data-manipulation-claims.html |archivedate=8 January 2010 |quote=said Lord Lawson, Margaret Thatcher's former chancellor who has reinvented himself as a critic of climate change science.

"It may be that there's an innocent explanation for all this... but there needs to be a fundamental independent inquiry to get at the truth." |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A review by the [[Associated Press]] of all the e-mails found that they did not support claims of faking of science, but did show disdain for sceptical critics. Scientists had discussed avoiding sharing information with critics, but the documents showed no evidence that any data was destroyed. Researchers also discussed in e-mails how information they had released on request was used by critics to make personal attacks on researchers.&lt;ref name="ap_2009-12-12"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/12/12/climategate-science-not-faked-but-not-pretty_print.htm |title=Climategate: Science Not Faked, But Not Pretty |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] said "Some of the emails probably had poorly chosen words and were sent in the heat of the moment, when I was frustrated. I do regret sending some of them. We've not deleted any emails or data here at CRU." He confirmed that the e-mails that had sparked the most controversy appeared to be genuine.&lt;ref name="Guardian 24 Nov"&gt;Hickman, Leo, "and agencies",  [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/24/climate-professor-leaked-emails-uea "Climate scientist at centre of leaked email row dismisses conspiracy claims"], 24 November 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 25 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-mails===
Most of the e-mails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate research, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences. The controversy has focused on a small number of e-mails, particularly those sent to or from climatologists Phil Jones, the head of the CRU, and [[Michael E. Mann]] of [[Pennsylvania State University]] (PSU), one of the originators of the graph of temperature trends dubbed the "[[Hockey stick controversy|hockey stick graph]]".&lt;ref name="PI Dec 8"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Penn State scientist at center of a storm |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/78665162.html |last=Flam |first=Faye |authorlink=Faye Flam |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2009-12-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203175744/http://www.philly.com:80/inquirer/magazine/78665162.html?viewAll=y|archivedate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics and climate change researchers said that nothing in the emails proved wrongdoing, and dismissed the allegations.&lt;ref name="WSJ 23 Nov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 24 Nov" /&gt; Independent reports said that the e-mails did not affect evidence that man made global warming is a real threat, and e-mails were being misrepresented to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct, but there were disturbing suggestions that scientists had avoided sharing scientific data with sceptical critics.&lt;ref name="ap_2009-12-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/ |title=Climategate |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Information Commissioner's Office]] stated that "the ''prima facie'' evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent ''prima facie'' evidence.&amp;nbsp;... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter."&lt;ref name=CruICO/&gt; The [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] criticised the ICO for making "a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate", but also blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and called for a full investigation to resolve the questions raised.&lt;ref name="Times 2010-03-31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7081921.ece |title=Climate-row professor Phil Jones should return to work, say MPs |author=Ben Webster |date=31 March 2010 |publisher=The Times |quote= |accessdate=2010-04-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech 3103"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/uk-parliament-clears-climatologists-calls-for-more-openness.ars |title=UK Parliament clears climatologists, calls for more openness |author=John Timmer |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press conducted a review of the e-mails and concluded that they showed scientists fending off sceptics, but did not support claims that global warming science had been faked. They stated that "One of the most disturbing elements suggests an effort to avoid sharing scientific data with critics skeptical of global warming", and mentioned ethical problems with this action due to the fact that "free access to data is important so others can repeat experiments as part of the scientific method". They cited a science policy expert as stating that it was "normal science politics, but on the extreme end, though still within bounds". The AP sent the emails to three climate scientists they selected as moderates, who did not change their view that man-made global warming is a real threat.&lt;ref name="ap_2009-12-12" /&gt; The three scientists are on the record elsewhere supporting an outside, independent review of the allegations of misconduct at both the CRU and [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name="WaTimes Dec 28"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biased reporting on Climategate|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/28/biased-reporting-on-climategate/|publisher=[[Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarising its own analysis, [[FactCheck]] stated that claims by climate sceptics that the emails demonstrated scientific misconduct amounting to fabrication of global warming were unfounded, and emails were being misrepresented to support these claims. While the emails showed a few scientists being rude or dismissive, this did not negate evidence that human activities were largely responsible for global warming, or the conclusions of the 2007 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] report which used the CRU as just one of many sources of data.&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt;

An editorial in the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated that the e-mails had not shown anything that undermined the scientific case on human caused global warming, or raised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own papers. Scientific openness requires public availability of data used to reach conclusions, but researchers had been hampered in this by contractual restrictions on some data, and in certain countries national meteorological services were too slow to provide data sets on request. The e-mail theft highlighted "the harassment that denialists inflict on some climate-change researchers, often in the form of endless, time-consuming demands for information under the US and UK Freedom of Information Acts. Governments and institutions need to provide tangible assistance for researchers facing such a burden." While scientists are human and "unrelenting opposition to their work can goad them to the limits of tolerance", they "should strive to act and communicate professionally, and make their data and methods available to others, lest they provide their worst critics with ammunition."&lt;ref name="Nature_2009-12-03"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/462545a| pmid = 19956212| year = 2009| title = Climatologists under pressure| volume = 462| issue = 7273| page = 545| journal = Nature|bibcode = 2009Natur.462..545. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC's chairman, [[Rajendra K. Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]], described the CRU's scientists "as highly reputed professionals, whose contributions over the years to scientific knowledge are unquestionable" and described their datasets as "totally consistent with those from other institutions, on the basis of which far-reaching and meaningful conclusions were reached in the [2007 IPCC report]."&lt;ref name="Guardian 4 Jan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Climate change has no time for delay or denial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/jan/04/climate-change-delay-denial|last=Pachauri|first=Rajendra|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November the University of East Anglia issued a statement on the contents of the e-mails: "There is nothing in the stolen material which indicates that peer-reviewed publications by CRU, and others, on the nature of global warming and related climate change are not of the highest quality of scientific investigation and interpretation."&lt;ref name="UEA 01 Dec"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRUupdate |title=CRU Update 1 December |publisher=[[University of East Anglia]] – Communications Office |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lnKYt5cA?url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRUupdate |archivedate=5 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its report to the [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[Institute of Physics]] stated that the emails reveal evidence of "determined and coordinated refusals" to comply with scientific traditions through "manipulation of the publication and peer-review system" and "intolerance to challenge".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18599-climategate-scientist-questioned-in-parliament.html Climategate scientist questioned in Parliament]. 2 March 2010. ''New Scientist'']&lt;/ref&gt; This report was used by climate sceptics to bolster claims that the problem of global warming is exaggerated. This forced the Institute of Physics to confirm that its position was that "the basic science is well enough understood to be sure that our climate is changing, and that we need to take action now to mitigate that change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/02/institute-of-physics-emails-inquiry-submission | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Institute of Physics forced to clarify submission to climate emails inquiry | first=David | last=Adam | date=2010-03-02 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experts considered that the correction was still inadequate, with climatologist Andy Russell describing the allegation of data suppression as "incorrect and irresponsible". The institute said that the statement had been prepared by their energy subcommittee, but would not reveal who had produced it. It did say that the subcommittee included an IOP official named Peter Gill, whose company provides services to the energy industry and who has written that for many people, the subject of anthropogenic global warming "has become a religion, so facts and analysis have become largely irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7050737.ece Times Online – Energy consultant 'influenced climate evidence']&lt;/ref&gt; The institute said that Gill was not the main source of information and that other members of the sub-committee were also critical of CRU. [[Evan Harris]], a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[Science and Technology Select Committee]], said "Members of the Institute of Physics&amp;nbsp;... may be concerned that the IOP is not as transparent as those it wishes to criticise." However the institute told the Guardian that the submission was "approved by three members of its science board" and supplied comments from an anonymous board member stating "The institute should feel relaxed about the process by which it generated what is, anyway, a statement of the obvious... the points [the submission] makes are ones which we continue to support, that science should be practiced openly and in an unbiased way."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/05/climate-emails-institute-of-physics-submission Climate emails inquiry: Energy consultant linked to physics body's submission | Environment | The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most quoted phrase took words from an e-mail of 16 November 1999 written by [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] which referred to a graph he was preparing as a diagram for the cover of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) statement on the status of global climate in 1999.&lt;ref name="UEA 23 Nov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRU-update |title=Climatic Research Unit update |publisher=[[University of East Anglia]] – Communications Office |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lnKwmBZL?url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRU-update |archivedate=5 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 9 Feb part2" /&gt; Jones wrote:

The "trick" was a technique to combine data series, and "the decline" was a well known issue with [[Keith Briffa]]'s reconstruction using certain tree ring proxies which appeared to decline after 1950, when measured temperatures were rising. The email was widely misquoted as a "trick" to "hide the decline" as though it referred to a decline in measured global temperatures, but this was obviously untrue as when the email was written temperatures were far from declining: 1998 had been the warmest year recorded. On 9 December 2009 [[Sarah Palin]] said the truncated phrase showed a "highly politicised scientific circle" had "manipulated data to 'hide the decline' in global temperatures", and at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, senator Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] quoted Jones, and said "Of course he means hide the decline in temperatures".&lt;ref name="Guardian 9 Feb part2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/climategate-bogus-sceptics-lies |title=Part two: How the 'climategate' scandal is bogus and based on climate sceptics' lies &amp;#124; Environment |author=Fred Pearce |authorlink=Fred Pearce |date=9 February 2010 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-03-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann]]'s paper on temperature trends published by Michael Mann in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1998, which combined various proxy records and related them to actual temperature records: it included a figure later dubbed the "[[Hockey stick controversy|"hockey stick" graph]], which clearly distinguished between the proxy and instrumental data. Mann described the "trick" as simply a concise way of showing the two kinds of data together while still clearly indicating which was which. He said that there was nothing "hidden or inappropriate" about it, and that his method of combining proxy data had been corroborated by numerous statistical tests and matched thermometer readings taken over the past 150&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="PI Dec 8" /&gt; A press release by the University of East Anglia said that the "trick" was using instrumental data to meet a requirement of showing temperatures more recent than those covered by the proxy based temperature reconstructions, and that the use of the word "trick" was not intended to imply any deception.&lt;ref name="UEA 24 Nov" /&gt; An editorial in ''Nature'' said that 'trick' was slang for a clever (and legitimate) technique.&lt;ref name="Nature_2009-12-03" /&gt;

The phrase "hide the decline" referred specifically to the [[divergence problem]] in which some post 1960 tree ring proxy data indicates a decline while measured temperatures rise. The reconstruction by Briffa ''et al.'' was based solely on tree ring data, which shows a strong correlation with temperature from the 19th century to the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name="UEA 24 Nov" /&gt; They had published a statement on the divergence problem in 1998, and had recommended that the post 1960 part of their reconstruction should not be used.&lt;ref name="Briffa97" &gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/35596| year = 1998| last1 = Briffa | first1 = K.

The implications of the decline are discussed in Chapter 2 of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]], and in  Chapter 6 of the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4)&lt;ref name="UEA 24 Nov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] WG1, Section 2.3.2.1, "high latitude tree-ring density variations have changed in their response to temperature in recent decades, associated with possible non-climatic factors (Briffa et al., 1998a) ...."&lt;/ref&gt; which describes discussion of various possible reasons for the divergence which does not affect all the trees, and says that there is no consensus about the cause. It notes that Briffa ''et al.'' specifically excluded the post 1960 data, which is therefore not shown in the graph of their tree ring reconstruction in the AR4 report.&lt;ref name=IP4ch6&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter6.pdf |title=Chapter 6, Palaeoclimate |author= |authorlink= |format=PDF |work=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),  |publisher=IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |pages=472–73 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- undue weight to fringe view [[Stephen McIntyre]] says that in his review comments on the AR4 report he objected to this graph being truncated, and said that the whole reconstruction should be shown with comments to deal with the "divergence problem". The IPCC response was that this would be inappropriate.&lt;ref name="YLETV1"&gt;[http://ohjelmat.yle.fi/mot/arkisto/mot_ilmastogate/transcript_english Transcript of "Climategate" documentary], [[YLE TV1]] Finland, first broadcast 7 Dec. 2009.

[[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] wrote in ''The New York Times'' that "the graph adorned the cover of a report intended for policy makers and journalists. The nonexperts wouldn’t have realized that the scariest part of that graph — the recent temperatures soaring far above anything in the previous millennium — was based on a completely different measurement from the earlier portion. It looked like one smooth, continuous line leading straight upward to certain doom." &lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/science/01tier.html "E-Mail Fracas Shows Peril of Trying to Spin Science"] by [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]], ''The New York Times'', published 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney quotes [[Michael E. Mann]] replying to a skeptic who raised  this very issue about tree-ring data at the [[RealClimate]] blog, "No researchers in this field have ever, to our knowledge, ‘grafted the thermometer record onto’ any reconstruction. It is somewhat disappointing to find this specious claim (which we usually find originating from industry-funded climate disinformation Web sites) appearing in this forum." Tierney continued, "Dr. Mann now tells me that he was unaware, when he wrote the response, that such grafting had in fact been done in the earlier cover chart, and I take him at his word. But I don’t see why the question was dismissed so readily, with the implication that only a tool of the fossil-fuel industry would raise it." &lt;ref name=Tierney/&gt;

In December 2009, most scientists interviewed by ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' considered there was ample other evidence supporting the original graph and they had not changed their views on the issues. In an exception, [[Richard Lindzen]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] alleged that the emails "explicitly refer to falsification and rigging of data" in covering up the divergence problem of tree ring proxies for the 1960s, which he said called earlier periods into question, and said "The trick here is replacing the kind of data you're using with something to make it look different.". Other climatologists disputed Lindzen's accusations. Thomas Peterson of the [[National Climatic Data Center]] said he had seen nothing in the emails that called the fundamental science into question, and Andrew Solow of [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] agreed that there was no trickery, saying he would use the word trick to describe some methodological step, but expressed the view that the basis of reconstructions had been unclear.&lt;ref name="PI Dec 8" /&gt; Several scientific sources state that the decline being referred to is a decline in tree ring climate proxy metrics, not temperature.&lt;ref name="inquirer_20091203"&gt;[[Philadelphia Inquirer]], 3 December 2009: [http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/78395917.html Penn State professor: Research is sound], last accessed 20091207  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214045710/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/78395917.html |date=14 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 7 Dec"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1946082,00.html |title=The Stolen E-Mails: Has 'Climategate' Been Overblown?|work=[[Time Magazine]] |last=Walsh |first=Bryan |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Watson, Royal Society Research Professor at the UEA, said that the scientists had drawn the line to follow the tree-ring reconstruction up to 1960 and the measured temperature after that."&lt;ref name="timesonline 6948008"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6948008.ece |title=Climate change e-mails have been quoted totally out of context |publisher=[[The Times]] |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2009-12-08 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- comment this out for the moment, it's giving a fringe view without proper context McIntyre said that the "trick to hide the decline" consisted of removing tree-ring data from the later half of the 20th century.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had issued an "endangerment finding" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on excessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this citing the email were raised by the state of [[Texas]] and conservative activists and business groups the [[Coalition for Responsible Regulation]], the [[Southeastern Legal Foundation]], the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and the coal company [[Peabody Energy]]. They said the email "evidences CRU staff’s effort to deliberately manipulate data to yield desired results", and highlighted the word "trick".

In response to an e-mail mentioning a recent paper in the scientific journal [[Climate Research (journal)|''Climate Research'']] that questioned assertions that the 20th century was abnormally warm, Mann wrote in an e-mail of 11 March 2003:

:"I think we have to stop considering ''Climate Research'' as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal."&lt;ref name="wsjms"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125902685372961609 |title=Lawmakers Probe Climate Emails |last=Johnson |first=Keith |author2=Naik, Gautam |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mf4zh4pc?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125902685372961609.html |archivedate=9 January 2010 |quote=Dr. Mann wrote, "I think we have to stop considering 'Climate Research' as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal." […] Dr. Mann said Monday that he didn't think there was anything wrong in telling his colleagues that "we shouldn't be publishing in a journal that's activist." […] Hans von Storch […]East Anglia researchers "violated a fundamental principle of science," he said, by refusing to share data with other researchers. "They built a group to do gatekeeping, which is also totally unacceptable," he added. "They play science as a power game." |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann told the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' that he didn't feel there was anything wrong in saying "we shouldn't be publishing in a journal that's activist."&lt;ref name="wsjms" /&gt;

Mann was not alone in expressing concern about the peer review process of the journal. Half of the journal's editorial board, including editor-in-chief [[Hans von Storch]], resigned in the wake of controversy surrounding the article's publication. The publisher later admitted that the paper's major findings could not "be concluded convincingly from the evidence provided in the paper. [''Climate Research''] should have requested appropriate revisions of the manuscript prior to publication."&lt;ref name="Climate Research Editorial"&gt;[http://www.int-res.com/articles/misc/CREditorial.pdf Climate Research: an article unleashed worldwide storms]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 18 December 2009 column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ), [[Pat Michaels]] alleged that pressure from Jones and Mann was responsible for the resignations at ''Climate Research''.&lt;ref name="Michaels WSJ Dec09"&gt;[[Pat Michaels|Michaels, Pat]], "[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11072 How to Manufacture a Climate Consensus]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 18 December 2009; "Sceptical climatologist and Cato Institute fellow" Michaels's statement characterized as "allegations" in: [[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/peer-review-block-scientific-papers Emails reveal strenuous efforts by climate scientists to 'censor' their critics]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In a response also published in the WSJ, von Storch said that he left the post as chief editor of ''Climate Research'' "with no outside pressure, because of insufficient quality control on a bad paper – a skeptic's paper, at that."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans von Storch|Von Storch, Hans]], "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704238104574601443947078538 Good Science, Bad Politics]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce6"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/peer-review-block-scientific-papers Emails reveal strenuous efforts by climate scientists to 'censor' their critics]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels said the incident demonstrated how peer reviewed literature had been biased to prevent himself and others of like mind from publishing.&lt;ref name="Michaels WSJ Dec09" /&gt; In a response published by the WSJ, Mann said the only bias was for "well-reasoned writing that is buttressed by facts" and climate skeptics such as [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[John Christy]] had no problems with publishing their work in mainstream journals. He pointed to presidential science adviser [[John Holdren]]'s 2003 statement that Michaels had "published little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael E. Mann|Mann, Michael]], "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703478704574612400823765102 Science Must Be Unpolluted by Politics]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 31 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/HoldrenRPCClimateComments.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-03-14 | date=9 June 2003 | author=John P.

The independent review commissioned by the University of East Anglia found that the strong reaction of the scientists to the Soon and Baliunas paper "was understandable, and did not amount to undue pressure on Climate Research."&lt;ref name="Muir Russell"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Russell | first = Muir | title = The Independent Climate Change Email inquiry | url = http://www.cce-review.org/News.php | publisher = the Review Team | date = 7 July 2010 | accessdate = 19 January 2012 }} [http://www.cce-review.org/pdf/FINAL%20REPORT.pdf p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was petitioned about this issue by the [[Coalition for Responsible Regulation]], the [[Ohio Coal Association]], [[Peabody Energy]], the [[Southeastern Legal Foundation]], and the [[Government of Texas|State of Texas]]  The EPA  concluded that the emails expressed displeasure but did not show that any action was in fact taken, and it is "expected and appropriate that researchers choose in which journals to publish, as well as recommend to their peers journals in which to publish or not publish. In this case, the bottom line is that the underlying science at issue has been shown to be flawed. The scientists’ actions were focused on this lack of scientific merit and the process that lead to it, and not an attempt to distort the science or the scientific literature." The EPA considered that "If anything, their actions aimed to police the peer review process and rectify a problem that threatened its scientific integrity."&lt;ref name="EPA vol3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment/downloads/response-volume3.pdf | title = EPA’s Response to the Petitions to Reconsider the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, Volume 3: Process Issues Raised by Petitioners | accessdate = 2012-01-10 | date =14 April 2011 | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) }} pp. 48–51, 64–65, 73–76&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alleged exclusion of papers from IPCC report====
In July 2004, referring to ''Climate Research'' having published a paper by "MM", thought to be [[Ross McKitrick]] and [[Pat Michaels]], and another paper by [[Eugenia Kalnay]] and [[Ming Cai]], Jones emailed his colleagues saying, "I can't see either of these papers being in the next [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] report. Kevin [Trenberth] and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!"  At that time, Jones and [[Kevin E. Trenberth]] were lead authors on a chapter in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Trenberth told the investigating journalist "I had no role in this whatsoever. I did not make and was not complicit in that statement of Phil's. I am a veteran of three other IPCC assessments. I am well aware that we do not keep any papers out, and none were kept out. We assessed everything [though] we cannot possibly refer to all literature... Both of the papers referred to were in fact cited and discussed in the IPCC." He also made a statement agreed with Jones, that "AR4 was the first time Jones was on the writing team of an IPCC assessment. The comment was naive and sent before he understood the process." Jones could have been expected to be aware of the rules as he had been a contributing author for more than ten years, but this was his first time as a lead author with a responsibility for content of the complete chapter.&lt;ref name="Pearce6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Pearce | first = Fred | authorlink = Fred Pearce | title = The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth About Global Warming  | publisher = Guardian Books | date = 17 Jun 2010 | location = London | pages =137–38  | isbn =0-85265-229-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC has stated that its procedures mean there is "no possibility of exclusion of any contrarian views, if they have been published in established journals or other publications which are peer reviewed."&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt; Its chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, stated that the papers that had been criticised "were actually discussed in detail in chapter six of the Working Group I report of the AR4 ([[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]). Furthermore, articles from the journal ''Climate Research'', which was also decried in the emails, have been cited 47 times in the Working Group I report."&lt;ref name="Guardian 4 Jan" /&gt;

A ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editorial stated that the UEA scientists had been sharply critical of the quality of the two papers, but "neither they nor the IPCC suppressed anything: when the assessment report was published in 2007 it referenced and discussed both papers."&lt;ref name="Nature_2009-12-03"/&gt; Peter Kelemen, a professor of [[geochemistry]] at [[Columbia University]]'s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said that "If scientists attempted to exclude critics' peer-reviewed papers from IPCC reports, this was unethical in my view."&lt;ref name="popularmech_2009-12-01"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4338343.html?do=print |title=What East Anglia's E-mails Really Tell Us About Climate Change |last=Kelemen |first=Peter |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m33oK4QO?url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4338343.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajendra Pachauri responded that the IPCC has "a very transparent, a very comprehensive process which ensures that even if someone wants to leave out a piece of peer reviewed literature there is virtually no possibility of that happening."&lt;ref name="wsj_2009-12-03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703939404574567921682049840 |title=The Real Copenhagen Option |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m37SsdqB?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703939404574567921682049840.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of information====
{{main|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit}}
Several e-mails relating to freedom of information issues were the focus of controversy. In a 2 February 2005 e-mail, Phil Jones advised Michael Mann:

:"And don't leave stuff lying around on [[ftp]] sites – you never know who is trawling them. The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years. If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK, I think I'll delete the file rather than send to anyone. Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20&amp;nbsp;days?—our does! The UK works on precedents, so the first request will test it. We also have a [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]], which I will hide behind.&lt;ref name="wsj_2009-11-24"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Climate Science and Candor |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |page=1 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=2009-11-24 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704779704574553652849094482 |accessdate=10 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m3AzrwzS?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704779704574553652849094482.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |quote=Editor's note: The following are emails we've selected from more than 3,000 emails and documents that were hacked last week from computers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another e-mail sent in May 2008, Jones asked Mann:

:"Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|AR4]]? Keith will do likewise.... Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same? I don't have his new email address."&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 28 Nov"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/climate-change/news/article.cfm?c_id=26&amp;objectid=10612165&amp;pnum=0 |title=A climate scandal, or is it just hot air? |last=Gibson |first=Eloise |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m33TOj7p?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/climate-change/news/article.cfm?c_id=26&amp;objectid=10612165&amp;pnum=0 |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the emails were published, Jones had already announced in [[Nature (journal)|Nature News]] (on 12 August 2009) that he was working to release the raw data in a systematic way, and was writing to all the [[List of meteorology institutions|National Meteorological Organisations]] requesting their agreement to waive confidentiality.&lt;ref name="metdata"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heffernan | first1 = O. | title = Climate data spat intensifies | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7257 | page = 787 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1038/460787a | pmid=19675615}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Heffernan | first = Olive | title = Climate Feedback: McIntyre versus Jones: climate data row escalates | url = http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2009/08/mcintyre_versus_jones_climate_1.html | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature.com]] | date = 12 August 2009 | accessdate =2 August 2011 }}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Pearce|2010|pp=143–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 2009, four days after the start of the email controversy, the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, and the remainder would be released when permissions were given.&lt;ref name="update 2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = CRU update 2  | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRUupdate | publisher=University of East Anglia (UEA)  | date = 24 November 2009 | accessdate =2 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics asserted that the e-mails showed that scientists were conspiring to delete e-mails and documents to prevent them from being released.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 28 Nov" /&gt; [[George Monbiot]], a supporter of the scientific consensus, wrote that Jones' resignation was warranted on the basis of his statement in this email alone,&lt;ref name="Monbiot-Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Monbiot |first=George |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/nov/25/monbiot-climate-leak-crisis-response| title=Pretending the climate email leak isn't a crisis won't make it go away |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 November 2009 |quote=If you take the wording literally, in one case he appears to be suggesting that emails subject to a request be deleted, which means that he seems to be advocating potentially criminal activity. Even if no other message had been hacked, this would be sufficient to ensure his resignation as head of the unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statement Monbiot later retracted.

[[Pro-vice-chancellor|Pro-Vice Chancellor]] of Research at the University of East Anglia, [[Trevor Davies]], said that no data were deleted or "otherwise dealt with in any fashion with the intent of preventing the disclosure".&lt;ref name= "NZ Herald 28 Nov" /&gt; In response to allegations that CRU avoided obligations under the [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|UK Freedom of Information Act]], independent investigator Muir Russell plans to review CRU's "policies and practices regarding requests under the Freedom of Information Act".&lt;ref name="msnbc_2009-12-03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34257159/ns/us_news-environment/ |title=University in climate flap details inquiry reach – Outside reviewer named, will eye e-mails for data 'manipulation' |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m3AamBR3?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34257159/ns/us_news-environment/ |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) oversees the application of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]. The Deputy Information Commissioner, Graham Smith, issued a statement which was published on 27 January 2010 and said that the e-mails showed that an FOI request made by David Holland, a climate sceptic from [[Northampton]], had "not [been] dealt with as they should have been under the legislation." Section 77 of the FOI Act prohibited public authorities from intentionally preventing the disclosure of restricted information, but it was too late to impose sanctions as there was a six-month statutory time limit. He was advising the university of East Anglia on its legal obligations, and the ICO would be considering whether to take regulatory action once reports of the independent and police investigations were available.  The university said it had not been made aware of the statement by Smith.&lt;ref name="Randerson_2010-01-27_Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/27/uea-hacked-climate-emails-foi |title=University in hacked climate change emails row broke FOI rules &amp;#124; Environment |author=James Randerson |date=27 January 2010 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2010-01-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its submission to the Science and Technology Select Committee, the university denied allegations that it had refused to release raw data in breach of the FOIA.&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/25/uea-rejects-lost-data-claims |title=University of East Anglia rejects lost climate data claims &amp;#124; Environment |author=Press Association |authorlink= |date=25 February 2010  |publisher=[[The Guardian]]  |quote= |accessdate=2010-02-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently released an exchange of correspondence with the Information Commissioner's Office to clarify that, in their opinion, the University had not been found in breach of any part of the FOI Act. UEA stated that the ICO had not completed its investigations and had not established any breach of the law, and that it had not sought any further evidence on the matter. It said that the ICO statement only referred to ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence, and that Mr. Holland's request at issue concerned private e-mails.&lt;ref name=CruICO&gt;{{Cite web|title=Correspondence between University of East Anglia and the Information Commissioner's Office|url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/CRUstatements/ICOcorrespondence|date=26 Feb 2010 |publisher=University of East Anglia|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter from the ICO had stated that "the ''prima facie'' evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent ''prima facie'' evidence.&amp;nbsp;... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter." &lt;ref name=CruICO/&gt; [[Evan Harris]], a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Member of Parliament]], told ''[[The Times]]'' that it would be unwise for the university to attempt to portray the ICO's letter in a positive light, as the correspondence would be examined by the Committee. The UEA told the newspaper that the point being made in their submission was that "there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out."&lt;ref name="Times 2010-02-27"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7043566.ece University ‘tried to mislead MPs on climate change e-mails’], ''[[The Times]]'' 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The university said that the point being made in their submission was that "there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out."&lt;ref name="Times 2010-02-27" /&gt; The [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] report blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and said it had "found ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics". The committee also criticised the ICO, and said that it made "a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate", but accepted that the six month statute of limitations restriction was insufficient, and said that this should be reviewed. It called for a full investigation by the Muir Russell inquiry or by the Information Commissioner, to resolve the question of whether there had been a breach of Section 77 of the FOIA.&lt;ref name="Times 2010-03-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech 3103" /&gt;

In an e-mail of 12 November 2009, climate scientist [[Benjamin Santer]] of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] commented on an FOI request for data and correspondence from climate sceptic blogger [[Stephen McIntyre]]:&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt;

:"My personal opinion is that both FOI requests [for data related to a 2008 paper and for correspondence dating back to 2006] are intrusive and unreasonable. Steven McIntyre provides absolutely no scientific justification or explanation for such requests.... McIntyre has no interest in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of climate change. He has no interest in rational scientific discourse.... We should be able to conduct our scientific research without constant fear of an "audit" by Steven McIntyre; without having to weigh every word we write in every email we send to our scientific colleagues."&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt;

In an Associated Press interview, McIntyre disagreed with his portrayal in emails, and said "Everything that I've done in this, I've done in good faith."&lt;ref name="ap_2009-12-12" /&gt;

[[FactCheck]] stated that the great majority of CRU's data is already freely available, and the scientists were reluctant to supply their own correspondence, code and data to people whose motives seemed questionable to them. It is not clear that any deliberate obstruction happened, and emails show the scientists discussing with university officials and lawyers their obligations under the new legislation, informing critics that data is already freely available, or that the information has been sent to them. This question is to form part of the East Anglia investigation.&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt;

The University of East Anglia stated that the great majority of CRU climate data was already freely available, but the remainder was mainly owned by National Meteorological Services around the globe and subject to non-publication agreements. The [[Met Office]] was requesting new agreements to allow it to republish the raw data.&lt;ref name="UEA 24 Nov" /&gt; CRU has a web page describing the progress that had previously been made in releasing this data, and giving details of non-publication agreements including the restrictions placed by the Met office on use of its data for bona fide research programmes.&lt;ref name="urlCRU Data Availability"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/availability/ |title=CRU Data Availability |publisher=[[Climatic Research Unit]] |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlNERC-Met Office agreement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/surface/met-nerc_agreement.html |title=NERC-Met Office agreement |date=2003-11-19 |publisher=[[British Atmospheric Data Centre]] |quote=Data sets must not be passed on to third parties under '''any''' circumstances.&amp;nbsp;...

[Use of bold for emphasis per original]|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later BBC interview, Phil Jones said that the land station records developed at CRU show close agreement with the independent [[National Climatic Data Center|NCDC]] and [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|GISS]] official records, which are based on raw data freely available from the [[Global Historical Climatology Network]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 2010-02-13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8511670.stm |title= Q&amp;A: Professor Phil Jones |author=Roger Harrabin |authorlink=Roger Harrabin |date=13 February 2010|publisher= [[BBC News]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Met Office requests, some National Meteorological Services gave full or conditional agreement, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Poland]]. In discussions with the ICO about FOIA requests which had been made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations.

====Gaps in understanding temperature variations====
Critics also highlighted a passage in an e-mail sent by [[Kevin E. Trenberth|Kevin Trenberth]] on 12 October 2009 that discussed gaps in scientific understanding of recent temperature variations, in which Trenberth wrote:

:"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't,"&lt;ref name="NYTimes 20 Nov" /&gt;

Trenberth told the Associated Press that the email referred to an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trenberth | first1 = KE | year = 2009 | title = An imperative for climate change planning: tracking Earth's global energy | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 19–27 | doi = 10.1016/j.cosust.2009.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he authored calling for improvement in measuring global warming to describe unusual data, such as rising sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref name="AP 22 Nov"&gt;{{cite news | last=Staff | title=Scientist: Leak of climate e-mails appalling|url=http://www.physorg.com/news178199129.html|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''travesty'' refers to what Trenberth sees as an inadequate observing system that, were it more adequate, would be able to track the warming he believes is there.&lt;ref name="wired 20 Nov"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/11/climate-hack/ |title=Hacked E-Mails Fuel Global Warming Debate | publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=2009-11-25 |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on his NCAR webpage Trenberth states that,

:"It is amazing to see this particular quote lambasted so often. It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate variability. It is quite clear from the paper that I was not questioning the link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and warming, or even suggesting that recent temperatures are unusual in the context of short-term natural variability."&lt;ref name="Trenberth-NCAR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/Trenberth/statement.html |title=CGD's Climate Analysis Section (CAS) |author=Kevin Trenberth |authorlink=Kevin Trenberth |year=2010 |publisher=[[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] |quote= |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611224809/http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/Trenberth/statement.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code and documentation===
The CRU files also included programs written in [[Fortran]], [[Comment (computer programming)|programmer comments]] and a [[README|readme file]], which attracted considerable attention from programmers.&lt;ref name="McCullagh2"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/24/taking_liberties/entry5761180.shtml Congress May Probe Leaked Global Warming E-Mails] by [[Declan McCullagh]], [[CBS News]], 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The log covered more than four years work by a programmer, who had been frustrated by problems in relating climate data from numerous international sources.&lt;ref name="SMH-12-04"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-email-mess-hits-australia-20091204-kb39.html|title=Climate email mess hits Australia|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | first=Paola | last=Totaro | date=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a BBC [[Newsnight]] report, [[software engineer]] [[John Graham-Cumming]] said the code was "below the standard you'd expect in any commercial software" because it lacked clear [[Software documentation|documentation]] or an audit history. Graham-Cumming also reported finding a [[Software bug|bug]] in the code's [[Exception handling|error handling]] which, if it occurred, would ignore data without warning.&lt;ref name="newsnight-code"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8395514.stm|title=CRU's programming 'below commercial standards'|publisher=[[BBC Newsnight]] | date=2009-12-04 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myles Allen]], head of the Climate Dynamics group at the [[University of Oxford]], said that the code investigated by Newsnight had nothing at all to do with the [[HadCRUT]] temperature record used for climate reconstructions, which is maintained at the [[Met Office]] and not at CRU. When he challenged Newsnight on this, they responded that "Our expert's opinion is that this is climate change code" and declined to retract the story. He commented that on the same basis "the quality of the code I use to put together problems for our physics undergraduates shows that we should not trust results from my colleagues who work on the [[Large Hadron Collider]] on the grounds that "it is all physics code"."&lt;ref name="Myles Allen, guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/11/science-climate-change-phil-jones |title=Science forgotten in climate emails fuss &amp;#124; Comment is free |author=Myles Allen |authorlink=Myles Allen |date=11 December 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-01-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) investigation established that the programming notes recorded the process of updating the CRU TS2.1 dataset product to TS3.0. This product includes multiple climate variables, including temperatures, rainfall and cloud cover, and has nothing to do with the HadCRUT temperature record which uses the separate CRUTEM land temperature dataset. The CRU programmer had the difficult task of merging datasets at the same time as migrating code to a new computer system, finding ways of dealing with inconsistencies in data from disparate  organisations, improving quality control and debugging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US EPA| 2010|loc=[http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment/petitions/volume1.html#1-3-3-3  1.3.3.3 “Harry Read Me” file and other code ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Corpuscularianism''' is a physical theory that supposes all matter to be composed of minute [[particle]]s. The theory became important in the seventeenth century; amongst the leading corpuscularians were [[Thomas Hobbes]],&lt;ref name=Hobbes&gt;Kenneth Clatterbaugh, ''The Causation Debate in Modern Philosophy, 1637-1739'', Routledge, 2014, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gaukroger, ''Descartes: An Intellectual Biography'', Clarendon Press, 1995, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Gassendi]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[[Vere Claiborne Chappell]] (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Locke'', Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;[http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/609.ral5q.fall04/LecturePDF/L20-LIGHTII.pdf virginia.edu] – Newton's Particle Theory of Light Lecture notes. Lindgren, Richard A. Research Professor of Physics. University of Virginia, Department of Physics.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

==Overview==
Corpuscularianism is similar to the theory of [[atomism]], except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided.  In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards the production of gold by transmutation.  Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: "secondary" qualities as distinguished from "primary" qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm The Mechanical Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611053822/http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm |date=June 11, 2008 }} - Early modern 'atomism' ("corpuscularianism" as it was known)&lt;/ref&gt; Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory for centuries and was blended with [[alchemy]] by early scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]] in the 17th century.

In his work ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' (1661), Boyle abandoned the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ideas of the [[classical elements]]—earth, water, air, and fire in favor of corpuscularianism. In his later work, ''The Origin of Forms and Qualities'' (1666), Boyle used corpuscularianism to explain all of the major Aristotelian concepts, marking a departure from traditional [[Aristotelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osler|first=Margaret J.|title=Reconfiguring the World. Nature, God, and Human Understanding, from the Middle Ages to Early-Modern Europe|page=127|year=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-9656-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] used corpuscularianism to justify his political theories in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name=Hobbes/&gt; It was used by Newton in his development of the [[corpuscular theory of light]],&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt; while Boyle used it to develop his [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] corpuscular philosophy, which laid the foundations for the [[Chemical Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ursula Klein|title= Styles of Experimentation and Alchemical Matter Theory in the Scientific Revolution|journal=Metascience|publisher=Springer|issn=1467-9981|volume=16|issue=2|date=July 2007|doi=10.1007/s11016-007-9095-8|pages=247–256 esp. 247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alchemical corpuscularianism==

[[William R. Newman]] traces the origins from the fourth book of [[Aristotle]], ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Late medieval and early modern corpuscular matter theories'' Volume 1 of ''Medieval and Early Modern Science'', Christoph Lüthy, J. E. Murdoch, William R. Newman BRILL, 2001, p. 306 {{ISBN|978-90-04-11516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "dry" and "moist" exhalations of Aristotle became the alchemical '[[sulfur]]' and '[[mercury (element)|mercury]]' of the eighth-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Islamic alchemist]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815). [[Pseudo-Geber]]'s ''Summa perfectionis''&lt;ref name="Newman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=William Royall|title=Atoms and alchemy: chymistry and the experimental origins of the scientific revolution|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy5sxK7pHGIC|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-57697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains an [[Alchemy|alchemical]] theory where unified sulfur and mercury corpuscles, differing in purity, size, and relative proportions, form the basis of a much more complicated process.&lt;ref&gt;The Mineral Exhalation Theory of Metallogenesis in Pre-Modern Mineral Science JOHN A.

==Importance to the development of modern scientific theory==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
Several of the principles which corpuscularianism proposed became tenets of modern chemistry.

*The idea that compounds can have secondary properties that differ from the properties of the elements which are combined to make them became the basis of [[molecular chemistry]]. 
*The idea that the same elements can be predictably combined in different ratios using different methods to create compounds with radically different properties became the basis of [[stoichiometry]], [[crystalography]], and established studies of [[chemical synthesis]]. 
*The ability of chemical processes to alter the composition of an object without significantly altering its form is the basis of [[fossil]] theory via [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]] and the understanding of numerous metallurgical, biological, and geological processes.

'''Donald West "Don" Harward''' is an American philosopher who served as the sixth [[Lane Hall|President of Bates College]] from March 1989 to November 2002, where he was succeeded by the first female president, [[Elaine Tuttle Hansen]].

== Early life and career ==
Harward received his B.A. in mathematics from [[Maryville College]], then his M.A. from [[American University]], and Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. Harward then taught at the [[University of Delaware]] and the [[College of Wooster]], where he served as a dean and vice president of academic affairs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/past-presidents/bates-college-presidents/donald-west-harward/|title=Donald West Harward {{!}} Past Presidents {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/150-years/bates-greats/donald-w-harward/|title=Donald W. Harward {{!}} 150 Years {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1989, Harwad was tapped to succeed [[Thomas Hedley Reynolds]] as the sixth President of Bates College. His first years leading the college revolved around stressing the importance of egalitarian values and involvement in the community through the creation of a thesis program, and the strengthening of the study-abroad program. Overall, he would create 22 new programs available to students and faculty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He expanded the [[Campus of Bates College|campus of Bates]] by constructing [[Campus of Bates College|Pettengill Hall]], the [[Campus of Bates College|Residential Village]], and the Bates College Coastal Center at Shortridge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Harward stepped down from the Bates presidency on November 1, 2002. Three years later in 2005, The Harward Center for Community Partnerships was opened in Lewiston in his honor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Harward currently serves as a senior advisor for the [[American Council on Education]] Fellows Program and a senior fellow with the [[Association of American Universities|American Association of American Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bates.edu/commencement/annual/y2003/honorands/donald-w-harward-biography/|title=Donald W.

'''Fernando González Ochoa''' (April 24, 1895&amp;nbsp;– February 16, 1964), was a [[Colombia]]n writer and [[existentialist]] [[philosopher]] known as "''el filósofo de Otraparte''" (''The Philosopher from somewhere else''). He wrote about [[sociology]], [[history]], [[art]], [[morality]], [[economics]], [[epistemology]] and [[theology]] in a magisterial and creative way, using different genres of literature. González is considered one of the most original writers of Colombia during the 20th century. His ideas were controversial and had a great influence in the Colombian society at his time and today. The González work was the inspiration of [[Nadaism]], a literary movement founded by one of his disciples, [[Gonzalo Arango]]. The ''Otraparte'' Villa, his house in [[Envigado]], is today a museum and the headquarters of the cultural foundation to preserve and promote his legacy. The place was declared a National Patrimony of Colombia in 2006.

=== Context ===

[[File:Fernandogonzalesparentsfamilyotraparte1907.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The children of Daniel and Pastora González: Alfonso, Daniel, Alberto, Graciela, Fernando (the philosopher) and Sofía. Standing up in front Jorge. A picture of 1907.]]

González lived during the beginning of the 20th century (1895–1964), a time of change, political turbulence and revolutions in industry. He was born seven years after the new political agreement  of a more conservative constitution (1888) that gave great influence to the [[Catholic Church]] in Colombian society, especially in the education of future generations. Four years after, when he was 4 years old, the nation fell in a bloody [[civil war]], the 1899 - 1902 [[Thousand Days War]]. The other important event that happened during his life was in 1903 when Colombia lost [[Panama]]. In 1926 the [[Banana massacre]] gave evidence of the labor problems of the different growing Colombian industries. He lived also in one of the first industrialist trade centers of the country, the [[Medellín|Metropolitan Area of Medellín]] and the first to start an [[industrial revolution]] in Colombia during the 1930s. González was also a witness of the emerging of [[Fascism]] in [[Italy]] when he was consul of Colombia in that country. In 1948 the killing of the presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]] opened the doors of a new political instability with [[El Bogotazo]]. All these events are reflected in the works and thoughts of Fernando González Ochoa.

=== Early life ===

Fernando González Ochoa was born in [[Envigado]], a city in the [[Aburrá Valley]] ([[Department of Antioquia|Antioquia State]]). He was the second of seven children. His parents were Daniel González and Pastora Ochoa. His father was a school teacher, the inspiration of one of his books (''El Maestro de Escuela''). He was expelled from the school of the [[Presentation Sisters]] of Envigado because he insulted a sister after being punished.&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Ochoa Moreno: "''[http://www.otraparte.org/imagen/nj-joven-1.html Born to rebellion]''" (Spanish), from the archive gallery of Fernando González, Corporación Otraparte. Retrieved on May 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Something similar would happen soon after  he joined the [[Jesuit]] College of [[Medellín]], but this time because he was caught reading [[Nietzsche]]. The young González faced his teacher of philosophy, Rev. Quiroz, saying that nothing can be and can not be at the same time. He was a sophomore in high school when the Jesuits asked him to leave the school.

=== Formation ===

[[File:Gonzalezandisaza1915.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The young Fernando González at right with his friend Fernando Isaza in 1915.]]

In 1915 he became a member of [[Los Panidas]], a group of sceptics, with [[León de Greiff]], [[Ricardo Rendón]], Félix Mejía Arango, Libardo Parra Toro, José Manuel Mora Vásquez and Eduardo Vasco, among other young intellectuals. In 1916 González published his first book, ''Pensamientos de un viejo'' (Thoughts of an Oldman), which presentation was written by [[Fidel Cano]], the founder of [[El Espectador]] newspaper. In 1919 González got his diploma in law by [[University of Antioquia]], however his thesis, "''El derecho a no obedecer''" (The Right Not To Obey) was not welcome by the Academic Council of the University. González had to do some modifications to the text and published it under the title of "Una tesis" (A Thesis).

=== Judge ===
[[File:Fernandogonzalesnevadodelruizotraparte.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Fernando González in [[Nevado del Ruiz]] Snow Mountain in 1929 during the visits that inspired his work "''Viaje a pie''" ("Trip By Foot").]]

In 1921 he became Judge of the Superior Tribunal of [[Manizales]]. In 1922 he married in Medellín Margarita Restrepo Gaviria, the daughter of former president [[Carlos E. Restrepo]]. In 1928 he is nominated Second Judge of the Medellín Tribunals where he knew Benjamín Correa who was to be one of his best friends. With Correa he visited several towns in the states of Antioquia, [[Department of Caldas|Caldas]] and [[Valle del Cauca]]. From those visits he got the inspiration to one of his most popular books, ''Viaje a pie'' (Journey on Foot), published in 1929, but forbidden by the [[Archbishop]] of Medellín under the penalty of mortal sin.

González went to [[Venezuela]] in 1931 to meet dictator [[Juan Vicente Gómez]]. He considered Gómez a sprout of Libertador [[Simón Bolívar]] and they became friends. The dictator was the godfather of one of the sons of González and this one dedicated a work to him, "''Mi compadre''".

=== Consul in Italy ===

González was nominated by President [[Enrique Olaya Herrera]] a consul of Colombia in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] in 1932. He went with his family to the [[Europea]]n country and that same year ''Le Libre Libre'', a publishing house of [[Paris]], published his book ''Don Mirocletes''. About that work [[Manuel Ugarte]] wrote a letter to him from [[Nice]] saying:

{{cita|"When your book arrived I had at the moment the visit of [[Gabriela Mistral]] and we read with delight some chapters. There is so much force of evocation, so profound irony in the irreverent commentary and so much grace in elegant style!"&lt;ref name="Vivencia cronológica"&gt;Javier Henao Hidrón: "[http://www.otraparte.org/vida/henao-javier-1.html Vivencia cronológica]", Archive of the Otraparte Corporation. Retrieved on May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From [[Spain]] he received two letters of [[José Vasconcelos]] on December 14 and 30, 1932. Vasconcelos wrote:

{{cita|"You are thinking with freedom and that is what we need in America, which always they think in response to an attitude (...) The conferences are a delight, a bitter delight, with depth (...) Your page on the stamp of [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]] is wonderful, I was excited, I almost cry."&lt;ref name="Vivencia cronológica"/&gt;}}

He received other letter of the Colombian writer [[José María Vargas Vila]], who was exiled in [[Madrid]]. Vargas wrote to him:

{{cita|"You have the vice to think and the virtuous to say beautifully what you think; an Artist-Thinker, that is a rare product in this latitudes; you fills in fullness that model; I can not hide that what I love more in your books is the air of controversy that you can breathe in them; that breath fighter is invigorating and toning; to live is to fight."&lt;ref&gt;Javier Henao Hidrón: "[http://www.otraparte.org/vida/henao-javier-1.html Vivencia cronológica]", Archive of the Otraparte Corporation. Retrieved on May 9, 2008. Original in Spanish: "''Tiene usted el vicio de pensar, y la virtud de decir bellamente lo que piensa; un Pensador-Artista, es un producto muy raro en nuestras latitudes; usted llena en plenitud ese modelo; no he de ocultarle que lo que amo más en sus libros es el aire de polémica que se respira en ellos; ese hálito de combate, es vivificante y tonificador; vivir es combatir''".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1933 the Italian police found a book notes with critics to the regimen of [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[Fascism]]. He was transferred to [[Marsella]] due to a petition of the Italian government. That book notes were the origin of his work ''El hermafrodita dormido'' (The Asleep Hermaphrodite), a book with his experiences in the classic art museums of Italy. The book was published in [[Spain]] in 1934.

=== Bucarest Villa ===

In 1934 González returned to Colombia establishing in his town, Envigado, to live in a finca he called "Bucarest Villa". There he started to publish the ''Antioquia Magazine'' until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Henao Hidrón: "[http://www.otraparte.org/vida/henao-javier-1.html Vivencia cronológica]", Archive of the Otraparte Corporation. Retrieved on May 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 the ''Arturo Zapata'' Printing Press of [[Manizales]] published his "''El Remordimiento''" (The Remorse), an essay in theology written in Marsella ([[France]]) and ''Letters to [[Estanislao Zuleta]]''.

The former president of [[Ecuador]], [[José María Velasco Ibarra]], who was exiled in Colombia, visited González in Bucarest Villa in 1936 and they became very good friends. To Velasco he dedicated some chapters of ''Los negroides'' (The Negroid People) where González called Velasco the first "Politician-Thinker" of the Americas. By his part, Velasco called González in his work ''Conciencia o Barbarie: Exégesis de la Conciencia Política Americana'' (Conscience or Barbarism: Exegesis of the American Political Conscience), published first by the ''Atlántida'' Printing Press of Medellín, "the most original and deep of the South American sociologists".&lt;ref&gt;José María Velasco Ibarra: Conciencia o Barbarie: Exégesis de la Conciencia Política Americana, Medellín, 1937. Republished in Buenos Aires. Spanish. Note: "America" in Spanish refers to the North and South American continents.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that year died in [[Madrid]] the [[Venezuela]]n novelist [[Teresa de la Parra]] with whom González had a good friendship since 1930 when she visited him in Envigado. It was also the year of ''Los negroides'' publication, an essay on New Granada ([[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Ecuador]]), saying that it is the only American region where the merger of races will create an original culture for a man unified. Such merger is a principle of promises and appalling realities at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;José María Velasco Ibarra: Conciencia o Barbarie: Exégesis de la Conciencia Política Americana, Medellín, 1937. Republished in Buenos Aires. Spanish. Note: "America" in Spanish refers to the North and South American continents.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Otraparte Villa ===

He started in 1940 the construction of his villa in Envigado that at that time he called ''La Huerta del Alemán'' (The Garden of the German), but the [[World War II]] would make him to change the name for ''Otraparte'' (Other Place). The villa was designed with architect [[Carlos Obregón]], engineer [[Félix Mejía Arango]] and painter [[Pedro Nel Gómez]]. That year he published "Santander", an essay about General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]. The writer [[Tomás Carrasquilla]], his friend and the most admired by him Colombian novelist, died.

In ''Otraparte'' he received the American playwright [[Thornton Wilder]] to whom he dedicated his work ''El maestro de escuela'' (The School Teacher). Wilder was in Colombia as a cultural ambassador of his country in South America and wrote about the ''Garden of the German'': "It is more delightful than all Chapinero".

On April 9, 1949, Colombia shuddered with the killing of presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]] in [[Bogotá]]. González dedicated to him some thoughts in 1936 in ''Los negroides'':

{{cita|"Today I met Jorge Eliecer Gaitán. He is a lively little [[mestizo]], reader. He speaks and you put attention. How is he a man of action? I have known in my life three Don Juans: they never spoke about love. I have known two actives: they were silent. (...) How come to be that he made a political Party? In order to be listened. He is the will to talk made man; the instinct to talk made his face and all his body. He is the body of the man who talks."&lt;ref name="the life of F. González"&gt;Cited by Javier Henao Hidrón in his essay about [http://www.otraparte.org/vida/henao-javier-1.html the life of F. González]. Archive of the Otraparte Corporation. Retrieved on May 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 1949 of that year, after [[El Bogotazo]], González wrote in the edition of his ''Antioquia Magazine'':

{{cita|"The Colombian people is above its class director; this one does not exist, but it is the cross-eyed abortion of what they call here university. Was it what inspired Gaitán to elaborate that sentence that he used to delight the multitudes: The people is superior to its leaders?"&lt;ref name="the life of F. González"/&gt;}}

In 1953 he was nominated consul of Colombia in Europe, but he stayed most of the time in [[Bilbao]] where he studied [[Simon Bolívar]] and [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. His friend Thornton Wilder and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] asked to include his name in the list of candidates to the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] of 1955 and for two times he was in nominated.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge A. Zapata Z.: "[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos22/gonzalez-ochoa/gonzalez-ochoa.shtml Fernando González Ochoa]". Monografías.com. Retrieved on May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The writers [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[Jacinto Benavente]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]] admired his work.

In September 1957 González returned to Colombia, to his ''Otraparte'' villa, until his death in 1964. In 2006 President [[Álvaro Uribe]] approved Law 1068 to exalt the memory, life and work of the Antioquean philosopher Fernando González and declared ''Otraparte'' Home Museum in Envigado as a national patrimony.

== Thought ==

Fernando González is called the "Philosopher of Authenticity"&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Restrepo González: "[http://www.otraparte.org/vida/restrepo-alberto-3.html ¿Fernando González filósofo?]" (tr.en "Is Fernando González a philosopher?). Periódico El Colombiano, April 26, 2000. Archive of Corporación Otraparte. Retrieved on May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and his thought is related to the experience of his life as a man. He used to say that we must live in the simple but bringing awareness of the essentials.&lt;ref name="Jorge A. Zapata 2008"&gt;Jorge A. Zapata: "[we must live in the simple but bringing awareness of the essentials Fernando González]", Monografías.com. Retrieved on May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought about the Colombian man and, thus, the [[Latin America]]n, their personality, fights and expressions. He called himself the "Philosopher of the Personality of [[South America]]". He wrote that the Latin American man might develop the individuality to arise from their anonymity. He criticized what he called the ''Latin American vanity'' that was without substance and invited to express the personality with energy, giving to life the highest value.&lt;ref name="Jorge A. Zapata 2008"/&gt;

González thought his time as the decadence of the principle of freedom and individualism for an action of flocks following calves to worship ([[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]]). He missed the man of the ancient [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and the [[Renaissance|Renaissance man]].

{{God}}
'''Fideism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|eɪ|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|f|aɪ|d|i|-}}) is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that [[faith]] is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). The word ''fideism'' comes from ''fides'', the Latin word for [[faith]], and literally means "faith[[-ism]]".{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}

[[Theology|Theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]] have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[idea]]s, [[morality]], and [[religious belief]]s. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]]; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2  section 2.2]}}  There are a number of different forms of fideism.&lt;ref name = Quinn2000&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Quinn | editor-first = Philip L | last = Taliaferro | first = Charles | year = 2000 | title = A companion to philosophy of religion | page = 376 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9X-3sPj9m34C&amp;pg=PA376 | isbn = 0-631-21328-7 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Alvin Plantinga]] defines "fideism" as "the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth". The fideist therefore "urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason.{{Refn | Plantinga, Alvin (1983). "Reason and Belief in God" in Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (eds.), ''Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God'', page 87. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press).{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}}}}  The fideist seeks [[truth]], above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}} Plantinga's definition might be revised to say that what the fideist objects to is not so much "reason" per se—it seems excessive to call [[Blaise Pascal]] anti-rational—but ''[[evidentialism]]'': the notion that no belief should be held unless it is supported by evidence.

=== History ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science}}

=== Theories of truth ===
{{main article |Truth#Major theories}}
The doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:
* [[Correspondence theory of truth]]
* [[Pragmatic theory of truth]]
* [[Constructivist epistemology]]
* [[Consensus theory of truth]]
* [[Coherence theory of truth]]
* [[Subjectivism]]

Some{{Which|date=June 2012}} forms of fideism outright reject the correspondence theory of truth, which has major philosophical implications. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} only claim a few religious details to be [[axiom]]atic.

=== Tertullian ===

Tertullian's ''De Carne Christi'' (On the Flesh of Christ])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Beyond Fideism: Negotiable Religious Identities| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tyTSs_dqwkcC | publisher= Ashgate| year= 2010| first = Olli-Pekka | last = Vainio| page= 25 | series = Transcending boundaries in philosophy and theology | ISBN = 978-1-40940679-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is [[Absurdity|absurd]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm | last = Tertullian | publisher = New Advent | title = On the Flesh of Christ | series = Fathers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is sometimes cited as an example of views of the [[Church Fathers]], but this appears to be a misquotation of Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/sider_credo.htm|title=Tertullian:  Sider, R.D., Credo Quia Absurdum?, Classical World 73 (1980) pp.417-9|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Tertullian, First Theologian of the West| first =Eric | last = Osborn | publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luther ===
[[Martin Luther]] taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false." And "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, "Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Luther | first = Martin | year = 1883–2009 | ISBN = 0-85964-464-2 | place = Weimar | language = German | title = Tischreden |trans-title=Table talks | series = Werke: kritische Gesammtausgabe | publisher = Hermann Böhlau | volume = 3. aus den dreißiger Jahren | section = Die Sammlung von Konrad Cordatus (Schluß) | number = 2938a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blaise Pascal and fideism ===
[[File:Blaise Pascal Versailles.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Blaise Pascal]]]]
Another form of fideism is assumed by [[Pascal's Wager]]. Blaise Pascal invites the [[atheism|atheist]] considering [[faith]] to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | p = 49}} He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his ''[[Pensées]]'', Pascal writes:
{{Quote | Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they cannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that it is foolishness, ''stultitiam''; and then you complain because they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not lacking in sense. | ''Pensées'', no. 233}}

Pascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to [[deism]] instead of revealed religion: "The God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]—not the god of the philosophers!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pensées | last = Pascal | first = Blaise | language = French |trans-title=Thoughts | publisher = Charles Louandre | place = Paris | year = 1854 | page = 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamann and fideism ===
Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of [[David Hume]] he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redmond |first=M.|year=1987|title= The Hamann-Hume Connection|journal= Religious Studies|volume= 23|issue=1|pages= 97|publisher=Cambridge University Press|jstor= 20006314|doi=10.1017/s0034412500018564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like [[Spinozism]] that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Isaiah | last = Berlin | title=Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder|author-link = Isaiah Berlin |page=297|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U1373duui04C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard===
Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and his followers in [[Christian existentialism]]. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', are under [[pseudonym]]s; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.

In ''Fear and Trembling'', Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted [[murder]], perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | pp = 50–51}} He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the "absolute paradox", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a "[[leap of faith]]".

===James and "will to believe"===
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}
American [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]] introduced his concept of the "[[The Will to Believe|will to believe]]" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.

William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

=== Wittgenstein and fideism&lt;!--Linked from 'Template:Wittgenstein'--&gt; ===
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a "form of life" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled "Wittgensteinian Fideism", [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a "fideistic" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or "[[grammar]]". This view—commonly called '''Wittgensteinian fideism'''—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2 section 2.2]}} Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|D. Z. Phillips]], who is also the best-known "Wittgensteinan fideist". In their book ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?'' (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position "collapses", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled "On Obstacles of the Will" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled "Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also "advances" philosophical discussion concerning it.

=== Fideism and presuppositional apologetics ===
[[Presuppositional apologetics]] is a Christian system of [[apologetics]] associated mainly with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page= 117|title= Epistemological crises, dramatic narratives, and apologetics: the ''ad hominem'' once more| first = Michael W | last = Payne|url=http://files.wts.edu/uploads/pdf/publications/wtj/payne-spring-02.pdf|journal=Westminster Theological Journal|issue=63|year=2002|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the [[revelation]] contained in the [[Bible]] is [[axiom]]atic, rather than [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentally]] necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic [[foundationalism]]). To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the "Transcendental Argument for God's existence" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.

[[Presuppositional apologetics]] could be seen as being more closely allied with [[foundationalism]] than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.

== Criticism ==

=== Fideism rejected by the Catholic Church ===
Catholic doctrine rejects fideism. The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', representing [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]'s great regard for [[Thomism]], the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from [[rationalism]], has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: ''fides quaerens intellectum'', "faith seeking understanding", is his formula.

The official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The [[Anti-Modernist oath]] promulgated by [[Pope Pius X]] required Catholics to affirm that:
{{Quote | God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from the created world (cf. Rom. 1:20), that is, from the visible works of creation, as a cause from its effects, and that, therefore, his existence can also be demonstrated&amp;nbsp;...}}

Similarly, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' teaches that:
{{Quote | Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', ss. 37.}}

[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against "a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God".

==== Fideist currents in Catholic thought ====
Historically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by [[Joseph de Maistre]], emphasized faith in [[tradition]] as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay ''[[Du pape]]'' ("On the [[Pope]]"), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: [[science]] was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and "no religion can resist science, except one".

Another refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of "[[sign of contradiction|signs of contradiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wojtyla | first = Carol | author-link = Pope John Paul II | title = Sign of contradiction | publisher = St. Paul Publications | year = 1979 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.

=== As sin ===
Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. "Blind faith" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
* [[Peter Abelard]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Sic et Non]]''
* [[Lord Herbert]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury#De Veritate|De Veritate]]''

=== As relativism ===
Fideism can lead to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1998|title = Rationality and cultural relativism|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfRXYYhpLekC |editor-link = Edward Craig (philosopher)| editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure [[fringe religions]], as neither can be advocated or disputed.

=== A case for reason ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science#Philosophy of science}}
These critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. [[Galileo Galilei]], for example, said that "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."

On the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.

A '''free and open-source graphics device driver''' is a [[software stack]] which controls [[Graphics hardware|computer-graphics hardware]] and supports [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics-rendering]] [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) and is released under a [[free and open-source software]] license. Graphics [[device driver]]s are written for specific hardware to work within a specific [[operating system kernel]] and to support a range of APIs used by applications to access the graphics hardware. They may also control output to the display if the [[display driver]] is part of the graphics hardware. Most free and open-source graphics device drivers are developed by the [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]] project. The driver is made up of a [[compiler]], a [[List of rendering APIs|rendering API]], and software which manages access to the graphics hardware.

Drivers without freely (and legally) -available source code are commonly known as ''binary drivers''. Binary drivers used in the context of operating systems that are prone to ongoing development and change (such as Linux) create problems for end users and [[Package (package management system)|package]] maintainers. These problems, which affect system stability, security and performance, are the main reason for the independent development of free and open-source drivers. When no technical documentation is available, an understanding of the underlying hardware is often gained by [[clean room design|clean-room reverse engineering]]. Based on this understanding, device drivers may be written and legally published under any [[software license]].

In rare cases, a manufacturer's driver source code is available on the Internet without a [[free license]]. This means that the code can be studied and altered for personal use, but the altered (and usually the original) source code cannot be freely distributed. Solutions to bugs in the driver cannot be shared, significantly reducing the utility of such drivers in comparison to free and open-source drivers.

[[File:Linux Graphics Stack 2013.svg|thumb|right|500px|alt=Flowchart; see caption|Illustration of the Linux graphics stack]]

There are objections to binary-only drivers based on copyright, security, reliability and development concerns. As part of a wider campaign against [[binary blob]]s, [[OpenBSD]] lead developer [[Theo de Raadt]] said that with a binary driver there is "no way to fix it when it breaks (and it will break)"; when a product which relies on binary drivers is declared to be [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] by the manufacturer, it is effectively "broken forever."&lt;ref name=opencon-2006&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Theo de Raadt]]|date=2006-12-03 |title=Open Documentation for Hardware|work=Presentation slides from OpenCON 2006|url=http://www.openbsd.org/papers/opencon06-docs/index.html|accessdate=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has also stated that binary drivers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8804204/what-does-binary-means-in-device-driver|title=What does "binary" means in device driver?|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "hide bugs and workarounds for bugs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html#39|title = 3.9: "Blob!"|accessdate = 2007-02-12|publisher=OpenBSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; an observation which has been somewhat vindicated by flaws found in binary drivers (including an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]able [[Software bug|bug]] in Nvidia's 3D drivers discovered in October 2006 by [[Rapid7]]). It is speculated that the bug has existed since 2004; Nvidia have denied this, asserting that the issue was only communicated to them in July 2006 and the 2004 bug was a bug in X.Org (not in Nvidia's driver).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Nvidia.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/Nvidia.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1971|title=Linux - How does the Rapid7 Advisory R7-0025 affect the NVIDIA Unix driver?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary drivers often do not work with current versions of open-source software, and almost never support development snapshots of open-source software; it is usually not directly possible for a developer to use Nvidia's or ATI's proprietary drivers with a development snapshot of an X server or a development snapshot of the Linux kernel. Features like [[kernel mode-setting]] cannot be added to binary drivers by anyone but the vendors, which prevents their inclusion if the vendor lacks capacity or interest.

In the [[Linux kernel]] development community, [[Linus Torvalds]] has made strong statements on the issue of binary-only modules: "I ''refuse'' to even consider tying my hands over some binary-only module ... I want people to know that when they use binary-only modules, it's ''their'' problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/1999/0211/a/lt-binary.html|title=a/lt-binary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another kernel developer, [[Greg Kroah-Hartman]], has said that a binary-only kernel module does not comply with the kernel's license (the [[GNU General Public License]]); it "just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/ols_2006_keynote.html|title=Myths, Lies, and Truths about the Linux kernel|first=Greg|last=Kroah-Hartman|publisher=linux kernel monkey log}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and computer scientist [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] has expressed concern that the [[digital rights management]] scheme in Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] operating system may limit the availability of the documentation required to write open drivers, since it "requires that the operational details of the device be kept confidential."&lt;ref name=vista-cost&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter Gutmann|date=2006-12-26 |title=A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection|url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html#oss|accessdate=2007-01-28 |authorlink=Peter Gutmann (computer scientist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of binary drivers, there are objections due to [[free software]] philosophy, software quality and [[computer insecurity|security]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/195351/ Linux Weekly News, Aug 14, 2006: ''X.org, distributors, and proprietary modules'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that the redistribution of closed-source Linux kernel modules may be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/ols_2006_keynote.html|author=[[Greg Kroah-Hartman]]|publisher=[[Linux Symposium]]|title=Myths, Lies, and Truths about the Linux kernel|year=2006|quote=So, here's the simple answer to this issue: Closed source Linux kernel modules are illegal. That's it, it is very simple. I've had the misfortune of talking to a lot of different IP lawyers over the years about this topic, and every one that I've talked to all agree that there is no way that anyone can create a Linux kernel module, today, that can be closed source. It just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff. Again, it's very simple. Now no lawyer will ever come out in public and say this, as lawyer really aren't allowed to make public statements like this at all. But if you hire one, and talk to them in the client/lawyer setting, they will advise you of this issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linux kernel has never maintained a stable in-kernel [[application binary interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt |title=The Linux Kernel Driver Interface |accessdate=2014-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104101751/https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that proprietary drivers may contain [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s, like the one found in [[Samsung Galaxy]]-series modem drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SamsungGalaxyBackdoor|title=SamsungGalaxyBackdoor|date=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Linux Graphics Stack and glamor.svg|thumb|500px|alt=Another flowchart; see caption|In the future, [[AMD Radeon Software Crimson|libGL-fglrx-glx]] could use the [[Direct Rendering Manager|libDRM]] of the Radeon open-source driver instead of the proprietary [[binary blob]]; most of the investment is in the userspace driver.]]

When applications such as a 3D [[game engine]] or a [[3D computer graphics software]] shunt calculations from the CPU to the GPU, they usually use a special-purpose API like [[OpenGL]] or [[Direct3D]] and do not address the hardware directly. Because all [[translation (computing)|translation]] (from API calls to GPU [[opcode]]s) is done by the device driver, it contains specialized knowledge and is an object of optimization. This takes time and money. Leakage of device-driver source code (whether published under a free license or not) can give competitors an advantage — especially newcomers to graphic acceleration, who would gain considerable knowledge without bearing the costs of developing the knowledge.

The [[desktop computer]] market was long dominated by PC hardware using the [[x86]]/[[x86-64]] instruction set and GPUs available for the PC. With three major competitors (Nvidia, AMD and Intel). The main competing factor was the price of hardware and raw performance in 3D computer games, which is greatly affected by the efficient translation of API calls into GPU opcodes. The display driver and the [[video decoder]] are inherent parts of the graphics card: hardware designed to assist in the calculations necessary for the decoding of video streams. As the market for PC hardware has dwindled, it seems unlikely that new competitors will enter this market and it is unclear how much more knowledge one company could gain by seeing the source code of other companies' drivers.

The mobile sector presents a different situation. The functional blocks (the [[application-specific integrated circuit]] display driver, 2- and 3D acceleration and video decoding and encoding) are separate [[semiconductor intellectual property]] (SIP) blocks on the chip, since hardware devices vary substantially; some [[portable media player]]s require a display driver that accelerates video decoding, but do not require 3D acceleration. The development goal is not only raw 3D performance, but system integration, power consumption and 2D capabilities. There is also an approach which abandons the traditional method ([[Analog television|Vsync]]) of updating the display and makes better use of [[sample and hold]] technology to lower power consumption.

During the second quarter of 2013 79.3 percent of [[smartphone]]s sold worldwide were running a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/07/android-nears-80-market-share-in-global-smartphone-shipments-as-ios-and-blackberry-share-slides-per-idc/ | title = Android Nears 80% Market Share In Global Smartphone Shipments, As iOS And BlackBerry Share Slides, Per IDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Linux kernel dominates smartphones. Hardware developers have an incentive to deliver Linux drivers for their hardware but, due to competition, no incentive to make these drivers free and open-source. Additional problems are the Android-specific augmentations to the Linux kernel which have not been accepted in [[BitTorrent (software)|mainline]], such as the [[Atomic Display Framework]] (ADF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/565422/ |title=Atomic Display Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADF is a feature of 3.10 AOSP kernels which provides a [[Direct Rendering Manager#DMA Buffer Sharing and PRIME|dma-buf]]-centric framework between Android's hwcomposer [[HAL (software)|HAL]] and the kernel driver. ADF significantly overlaps with the [[Direct Rendering Manager|DRM]]-[[Mode setting|KMS]] framework. ADF has not been accepted into mainline, but a different set of solutions addressing the same problems (known as [[atomic mode setting]]) is under development. Projects such as [[Hybris (software)|libhybris]] harness Android device drivers to run on Linux platforms other than Android.

Device drivers are the abstraction layer between software concepts and hardware circuitry. They are a standard interface to peripherals, hiding the details of how the circuitry solves things from the programmer. Almost any system operation eventually maps to a physical device. The kernel embeds device drivers for every peripheral in the computer system.

[[File:Gallium3D vs DRI graphics driver model.svg|thumb|alt=Illustration of differences between Gallium3D and Direct Rendering Infrastructure models|Although Mesa ([[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI]]) and [[Gallium3D]] have different driver models, they share [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] code.]]

Free and open-source drivers are primarily developed on and for [[Linux]] by Linux kernel developers, third-party programming enthusiasts and employees of companies such as [[Advanced Micro Devices]]. Each driver has five parts:
# A Linux kernel component [[Direct Rendering Manager|DRM]]
# A Linux kernel component [[KMS driver]] (the [[display controller]] driver)
# A libDRM user-space component (a wrapper library for DRM system calls, which should only be used by Mesa 3D)
# A [[Mesa 3D]] user-space component. This component is hardware-specific; it is executed on the CPU and translates OpenGL commands, for example, into machine code for the GPU. Because the device driver is split, [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshalling]] is possible. Mesa 3D is the only free and open-source implementation of [[OpenGL]], [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenVG]], [[GLX]], [[EGL (API)|EGL]] and [[OpenCL]]. In July 2014, most of the components conformed to [[Gallium3D]] specifications. A fully functional State Tracker for [[Direct3D]] version 9 is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and an unmaintained tracker for Direct3D versions 10 and 11 is written in [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2013-July/041900.html|title=Direct3D 9 state tracker|accessdate=15 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720011019/https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2013-July/041900.html|archivedate=20 July 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wine (software)|Wine]] has Direct3D version 9. Another Wine component translates Direct3D calls into OpenGL calls, working with OpenGL.
# [[Device Dependent X]] (DDX), another 2D graphics device driver for [[X.Org Server]]

The [[Direct Rendering Manager|DRM]] is [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]]-specific. A [[Video Electronics Standards Association|VESA]] driver is generally available for any operating system. The VESA driver supports most graphics cards without acceleration and at display resolutions limited to a set programmed in the video [[BIOS]] by the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/|title=Index of /doc/Documentation/fb/|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linux AMD graphics stack.svg|thumb|alt=Diagram|Linux device drivers for AMD hardware in August 2016]]
[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD's]] proprietary driver, [[AMD Catalyst]] for their [[Radeon]], is available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (formerly fglrx). A current version can be downloaded from AMD's site, and some Linux distributions contain it in their repositories. It is in the process of being replaced with an AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver combining the open-source kernel, X and Mesa multimedia drivers with closed-source OpenGL, OpenCL and Vulkan drivers derived from Catalyst.

The FOSS drivers for [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]-AMD GPUs are being developed under the name Radeon (xf86-video-ati or xserver-xorg-video-radeon). They still must load proprietary microcode into the GPU to enable hardware acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/stable/firmware-linux-nonfree Details of Debian package firmware-linux-nonfree in Stable] Debian.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Radeon 3D code is split into six drivers, according to GPU technology: the radeon, r200 and r300 classic drivers and r300g, r600g and radeonsi [[Gallium3D]] drivers:
*Radeon supports the [[Radeon R100|R100]] series.
*R200 supports the [[Radeon R200|R200]] series.
*R300g supports pre-[[unified shader model]] microarchitectures: [[Radeon R300|R300]], [[Radeon R400|R400]] and [[Radeon R500|R500]].
*R600g supports all [[TeraScale (microarchitecture)|TeraScale (VLIW5/4)]]-based GPUs: [[Radeon R600|R600]], [[Radeon R700|R700]], [[Radeon HD 5000 Series|HD 5000 (Evergreen)]] and [[Radeon HD 6000 Series|HD 6000 (Northern Islands)]].
*Radeonsi supports all [[Graphics Core Next]]-based GPUs: [[Radeon HD 7000 Series|HD 7000]], [[Radeon HD 8000 Series|HD 8000]] and [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|Rx 200]] (Southern Islands, Sea Islands and Vulcanic Islands).

[[Arm Holdings]] is a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|fab]]less semiconductor company which licenses [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]s. Although they are known for the licensing the [[ARM architecture|ARM instruction set]] and [[List of ARM microprocessor cores|CPUs]] based on it, they also develop and license the [[Mali (GPU)|Mali series]] of GPUs. On January 21, 2012, [[Phoronix]] reported that [[Luc Verhaegen]] was driving a reverse-engineering attempt aimed at the Arm Holdings Mali series of GPUs (specifically, the Mali-200 and Mali-400 versions). The reverse-engineering project, known as Lima, was presented at [[FOSDEM]] on February 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvRJ_8K8baI|title=Phoronix.com - FOSDEM 2012 - Open-Source ARM Mali|first=|last=phoronix|date=6 February 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=arm_mali_reverse Phoronix, Jan 21 2012: ''An Open-Source, Reverse-Engineered Mali GPU Driver'']&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 2013, Verhaegen demonstrated [[Quake III Arena]] in timedemo mode, running on top of the Lima driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libv.livejournal.com/23886.html |title=Quake 3 Arena timedemo on top of the lima driver! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209235426/http://libv.livejournal.com/23886.html |archivedate=2013-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, a Lima developer posted the driver for inclusion in the Linux kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/755084/|title=Lima DRM driver [LWN.net]|author=|date=|website=lwn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARM has indicated no intention of providing support for their graphics acceleration hardware licensed under a free and open-source license. However, ARM employees sent patches for the Linux kernel to support their ARM HDLCD [[display controller]] and Mali DP500, DP550 and DP650 SIP blocks in December 2015 and April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/667575/ |title=drm: Add support for the ARM HDLCD display controller  |publisher=[[Linux kernel mailing list]] |date=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1604.0/00503.html |title=Initial support for ARM Mali Display Controller |publisher=[[Linux kernel mailing list]] |date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imagination Technologies ===

[[Imagination Technologies]] is a fabless semiconductor company which develops and licenses [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]s, among which are the [[PowerVR]] GPUs. Intel has manufactured a number of [[Comparison of Intel graphics processing units#PowerVR based|PowerVR-based]] GPUs. PowerVR GPUs are widely used in mobile [[System on a chip|SoCs]]. The company does not provide a FOSS driver or public documentation for the PowerVR. Due to its wide use in embedded devices, the [[Free Software Foundation]] has put reverse-engineering of the PowerVR driver on its high-priority project list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/#powervr Free Software Foundation, Apr 25, 2005: ''High Priority Free Software Projects'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vivante ===
{{See also|Vivante_Corporation#Products|l1=Vivante GCxxxx}}
[[Vivante Corporation]] is a fabless semiconductor company which licenses [[semiconductor intellectual property core]]s and develops the GCxxxx series of GPUs. A Vivante proprietary, closed-source Linux driver consists of kernel- and user-space parts. Although the kernel component is open-source ([[GNU General Public License|GPL]]), the user-space components—consisting of the GLES(2) implementations and a HAL library—are not; these contain the bulk of the driver logic.

Wladimir J. van der Laan found and documented the state bits, command stream and [[shader]] ISA by studying how the blobs work, examining and manipulating command-stream dumps. The Etnaviv Gallium3D driver is being written based on this documentation. Van der Laan's work was inspired by the Lima driver, and the project has produced a functional-but-unoptimized Gallium3D LLVM driver. The Etnaviv driver has performed better than Vivante's proprietary code in some benchmarks, and it supports Vivante's GC400, GC800, GC1000, GC2000, and GC3000 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/laanwj/etna_viv/wiki|title=laanwj/etna_viv|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Etnaviv was added to [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]] with both OpenGL ES 2.0 and Desktop OpenGL 2.0 support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=c9e8b49b885242d84ba031dacef5aa4a5ac1e5b6 |title=etnaviv: gallium driver for Vivante GPUs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broadcom]] develops and designs the [[VideoCore]] GPU series as part of their [[System on a chip|SoCs]]. Since it is used by the [[Raspberry Pi]], there has been considerable interest in a FOSS driver for VideoCore.&lt;ref group="Broadcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTA1MTc|title=Phoronix on the Raspberry Pi GPU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raspberry Pi Foundation, in co-operation with Broadcom, announced on October 24, 2012 that they open-sourced "all the ARM (CPU) code that drives the GPU".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, the announcement was misleading; according to the author of the reverse-engineered Lima driver, the newly open-sourced components only allowed message-passing between the ARM CPU and VideoCore but offered little insight into Videocore and little additional programability.&lt;ref group="Broadcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/open-source-arm-userspace/#comment-34981|title=Open Source ARM userland - Raspberry Pi|date=24 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Videocore GPU runs an [[Real-time operating system|RTOS]] which handles the processing; video acceleration is done with RTOS firmware coded for its proprietary GPU, and the firmware was not open-sourced on that date.&lt;ref group="Broadcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2221|title=Open Source ARM userland - Raspberry Pi|date=24 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was neither a [[toolchain]] targeting the proprietary GPU nor a documented [[instruction set]], no advantage could be taken if the firmware source code became available.

He was a member of the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] and served as their delegate to the [[Basle Congress (1869)|Basle Congress]] of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (i.e. the First International) held in 1869.&lt;ref name="Rapport"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mollin|first1=Gabriel|title=Rapport sur le congrès de Bâle|date=1870|publisher=Armand le Chevalier|location=Paris|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k836062/f1.image|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarka-SPIP"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOLLIN, Gabriel - Dictionnaire international des militants anarchistes|url=http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article8727|website=militants-anarchistes.info|publisher=Collectif Sarka-SPIP|accessdate=24 October 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married in 1873 and his wife had a child. But in 1875 he was detained in the [[:fr:Centre Hospitalier Sainte Anne|Sainte-Anne Hospital Centre]] having been diagnosed as suffering from mental derangement brought about by alcoholism. He left the asylum on 22 January 1876, accusing his psychiatrist and fellow positivist [[Jean-François Eugène Robinet]] of having him locked up so that his wife would leave and take away his son.&lt;ref name="Sarka-SPIP"/&gt;

A '''Gaian''' is a radical [[Green politics|Green]] who views the [[ecology]] of the Earth's [[biosphere]] not only as the basis of human moral examples, but of all [[cognition]] and even [[sentience]].  Advocates of this view claim that since we live as part of one planet's [[photosynthesis]] chain and are trapped within its [[gravity]] well, we are effectively components of one large body&amp;mdash;that being the global ecology of Earth itself.

Another name for this [[value theory]] is "[[radical values environmentalism]]," which holds that individuals and societies are ways to create such a thriving [[ecosystem]], but cannot be considered as being ends in themselves.

An early advocate of this view was [[Buckminster Fuller]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} who developed the [[Dymaxion Map]] of the world, the first [[world projection]] to show the [[continent]]s on a flat surface without visible distortion&amp;mdash;and the earth as being essentially one island in one [[ocean]].  In ''[[Critical Path (book)|Critical Path]]'', 1981, he claimed to prove that "gravity is love."{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Critics say this view makes humans "slaves of the Earth" and argue that human destiny is to spread out to find or form many living worlds.  In contrast, some ''Gaians'' see such colonists as locusts or a disease, and may see all human beings as elements of a single Earth-wide ecology, if not [[organism]].  They are often hard to differentiate from members of the [[New Age]] movement, with which they share the goal of deep [[spirituality|spiritual]] integration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Political Gaians are a relatively recent offshoot of the [[ecology movement]]&amp;mdash;and get their name from the [[Gaia hypothesis]], a postulate first devised by [[James Lovelock]] holding that the [[biosphere]] tends to [[homeorhetic balance]] or even [[homeostasis]] (with the implication that human beings should be working toward such balances or states.)

"Gorgias" (Oxford, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[sophist]], [[pre-Socratic]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[rhetoric]]ian who was a native of [[Leontinoi]] in [[Sicily]]. Along with [[Protagoras]], he forms the first generation of [[Sophism|Sophists]]. Several [[doxography|doxographers]] report that he was a pupil of [[Empedocles]], although he would only have been a few years younger. "Like other Sophists, he was an itinerant that practiced in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to ask miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies."&lt;ref name="Guthrie"&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''The Sophists'' (New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "Gorgias the [[Nihilism|Nihilist]]" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=%22Gorgias+the+Nihilist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y7THVOyXLIfEgwTg44OYDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg|title=A dictionary of philosophy in the words of philosophers |author=J.

Gorgias was born sometime between 490 and 480 BC in [[Leontinoi]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony in eastern [[Sicily]] that was allied with [[Classical Athens|Athens]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=6}} His father's name was Charmantides.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=6}} He had a brother named Herodicus, who was a physician, and sometimes accompanied him during his travels.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=6–7}} He also had a sister, whose name is not known, but whose grandson dedicated a golden statue to his great uncle at [[Delphi]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} It not known whether Gorgias married or had children.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} Gorgias is said to have studied under the Sicilian philosopher [[Empedocles|Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa}} 490 – {{circa}} 430 BC), but it is not known when, where, for how long, or in what capacity.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} He may have also studied under the rhetoricians [[Corax of Syracuse]] and [[Tisias]],{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} but very little is known about either of these men, nor is anything known about their relationship with Gorgias.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}}

It is not known what kind of role Gorgias may have played in the politics in his native Leontinoi,{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} but it is known that, in 427 BC, when he was around sixty years old, he was sent to Athens by his fellow-citizens as the head of an embassy to ask for Athenian protection against the aggression of the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} After 427 BC, Gorgias appears to have settled in mainland Greece, living at various points in a number of city-states, including Athens and [[Larisa]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} He was well-known for delivering orations at [[Panhellenic Games|Panhellenic Festivals]] and is described as having been "conspicuous" at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} There is no surviving record of any role he might have played in organizing the festivals themselves.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}}

Gorgias's primary occupation was as a teacher of rhetoric.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}} According to [[Aristotle]], his students included [[Isocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, fr. 130 [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Rose]] = [[Quintilian]] 3.1.13.&lt;/ref&gt; (Other students are named in later traditions; the ''[[Suda]]'' adds [[Pericles]], [[Polus]], and [[Alcidamas]],&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Gorgias''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] mentions [[Antisthenes]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Philostratus]], "I understand that he attracted the attention of the most admired men, [[Critias]] and [[Alcibiades]] who were young, and [[Thucydides]] and Pericles who were already old.  [[Agathon]] too, the tragic poet, whom Comedy regards as wise and eloquent, often Gorgianizes in his iambic verse").&lt;ref&gt;''Lives of the Sophists'' 1.9, trans. George Kennedy in ''The Older Sophists'', ed. R.K. Sprague (Columbia, S.C., 1972), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, although they are not described as his students, Gorgias is widely thought to have influenced the styles of the historian [[Thucydides]], the tragic playwright [[Agathon]], the doctor [[Hippocrates]], the rhetorician [[Alcidamas]], and the poet and commentator [[Lycophron]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=7}}

Gorgias is reputed to have lived to be one hundred and eight
years old (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He won admiration for his ability to speak on any subject (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He accumulated considerable wealth; enough to commission a gold statue of himself for a public temple.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Rosamond Kent, ''The Older Sophists'', [[Hackett Publishing Company]] ({{ISBN|0-87220-556-8}}), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; After his Pythian Oration, the Greeks installed a solid gold statue of him in the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He died at [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]].

==Philosophy==
The philosophies of the pre-Socratic Greek Sophists are controversial among scholars in general, due to their highly subtle and ambiguous writings and also to the fact that they are best known as characters in [[Dialogues of Plato|Plato's dialogues]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=2–3}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|pages=28–32}} Gorgias, however, is particularly frustrating for modern scholars to attempt to understand.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=2–3}} While scholars debate the precise subtleties of the teachings of [[Protagoras]], [[Hippias]], and [[Prodicus]], they generally agree on the basic frameworks of what these thinkers believed.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=3}} With Gorgias, however, scholars widely disagree on even the most basic framework of his ideas, including over whether or not that framework even existed at all.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=3}} The greatest hindrance to scholarly understanding of Gorgias's philosophy is that the vast majority of his writings have been lost{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=4}} and those that have survived have suffered considerable alteration by later copyists.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=4–5}}

These difficulties are further compounded by the fact that Gorgias's rhetoric is frequently elusive and confusing;{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=2–3, 5–6}} he makes many of his most important points using elaborate, but highly ambiguous, metaphors, similes, and puns.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=5–6}} Many of Gorgias's propositions are also thought to be sarcastic, playful, or satirical.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=6}} In his treatise ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|On Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle characterizes Gorgias's style of oratory as "pervasively ironic" and states that Gorgias recommended responding to seriousness with jests and to jests with seriousness.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=6}} Gorgias frequently blurs the lines between serious philosophical [[discourse]] and satire,{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=6}} which makes it extremely difficult for scholars to tell when he is being serious and when he is merely joking.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=2–3}} Gorgias frequently contradicts his own statements and adopts inconsistent perspectives on different issues.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=3}} As a result of all these factors, Scott Porter Consigny calls him "perhaps the most elusive of the polytropic quarry hunted in Plato's ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=3}}

Gorgias has been labelled "The Nihilist"&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenkrantz, G. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gronbeck, B. E. 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Philosophy from Thales to the Present Time by Friedrich Ueberweg: History of the ancient and mediaeval philosophy, Volume 1, Friedrich Ueberweg, Hodder and Stoughton, 1872 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Crime of Credulity, Herbert Newton Casson,P. Eckler, 1901 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; because some scholars have interpreted his thesis on "the non-existent" to be an argument against the existence of anything that is straightforwardly endorsed by Gorgias himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=C. Francis|title=Gorgias|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/gorgias/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nihilism]] is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is associated with pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Alan|title=Nihilism|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gorgias presented his nihilist arguments in ''On Non-Existence''; however, the original text is no longer extant. We only know his arguments through commentary by [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]’s ''De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McComiskey |first=Bruce |title=Gorgias, "On Non-Existence": Sextus Empiricus, "Against the Logicians" 1.65-87, Translated from the Greek Text in Hermann Diels's "Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker |journal=Philosophy and rhetoric |year=1997 |volume=30 |issue=1 |page=45 |jstor=40237935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly Gorgias developed three sequential arguments: first, that nothing exists; second, that even if existence exists, it is inapprehensible to humans; and third, that even if existence is apprehensible, it certainly cannot be communicated or interpreted to one’s neighbors. 

That being said, there is consensus in late 20th century and early 21st century scholarship that the label 'nihilist' is misleading, in part because if his argument were genuinely meant to support nihilism it would be self-undermining. The argument, of course, ''is'' itself something, and has pretensions to communicate knowledge, in conflict with its explicit pronouncement that there is nothing and that it can't be known or communicated. Gisela Striker argues: "I find it hard to believe that anyone should ever have thought that Gorgias seriously advocated the view that nothing is and that he was, therefore, a 'nihilist.'&lt;ref&gt;Striker, Gisela. "Methods of sophistry." Essays on Hellenistic Epistemology and Ethics (1996): p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Caston states: "Gorgias would have to be not merely disconsolate, but quite dull-witted, to have missed the conflict between his presentation and its content"&lt;ref&gt;Caston, Victor. "Gorgias on Thought and its Objects." Presocratic philosophy: Essays in honor of Alexander Mourelatos (2002): p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Wardy says, "This sadly mistaken reading overlooks the most obvious consequence of Gorgias' ''paradoxologia'' (παραδοξολογία): his message refutes itself, and in consequence, so far from constituting a theory of ''logos'', it confronts us with a picture of what language cannot be, with what it cannot be assumed to aspire to be."&lt;ref&gt;Wardy, Robert. The birth of rhetoric: Gorgias, Plato and their successors. Routledge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Gigon and Newiger make similar points.&lt;ref&gt;Gigon, Olof. "Gorgias' Über das Nichtsein'." Hermes (1936): p213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newiger, Hans-Joachim. Untersuchungen zu Gorgias' Schrift über das Nichtseiende. Walter de Gruyter, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical innovation==
Gorgias ushered in rhetorical innovations involving structure and ornamentation, and the introduced ''[[paradoxologia]]'' – the idea of paradoxical thought and paradoxical expression. For these advancements, Gorgias has been labeled the "father of [[sophistry]]" (Wardy 6). Gorgias is also known for contributing to the diffusion of the [[Attic Greek|Attic Greek dialect]] as the language of literary prose. Gorgias was the first orator known to develop and teach a "distinctive style of speaking" (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33).

Gorgias’ extant rhetorical works—''Encomium of Helen'' (Ἑλένης ἐγκώμιον), ''Defense of Palamedes'' (Ὑπέρ Παλαμήδους ἀπολογία), ''On Non-Existence'' (Περὶ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος ἢ Περὶ φύσεως), and ''Epitaphios'' (Επιτάφιος) —come to us via a work entitled ''Technai'' (Τέχναι), a manual of rhetorical instruction, which may have consisted of models to be memorized and demonstrate various principles of rhetorical practice (Leitch, et al. 29). Although some scholars claim that each work presents opposing statements, the four texts can be read as interrelated contributions to the up-and-coming theory and art (''[[Techne|technē]]'') of rhetoric (McComiskey 32).  Of Gorgias’ surviving works, only the ''Encomium'' and the ''Defense'' are believed to exist in their entirety.  Meanwhile, there are his own speeches, rhetorical, political, or other. A number of these are referred to and quoted by [[Aristotle]], including a speech on Hellenic unity, a funeral oration for Athenians fallen in war, and a brief quotation from an ''Encomium on the Eleans.'' Apart from the speeches, there are paraphrases of the treatise "On Nature or the Non-Existent." These works are each part of the [[Diels-Kranz]] collection, and although academics consider this source reliable, many of the works included are fragmentary and corrupt.  Questions have also been raised as to the authenticity and accuracy of the texts attributed to Gorgias (Consigny 4).

Gorgias’ writings are intended to be both rhetorical (persuasive) and performative. He goes to great lengths to exhibit his ability of making an absurd, argumentative position appear stronger.  Consequently, each of his works defend positions that are unpopular, paradoxical and even absurd. The performative nature of Gorgias’ writings is exemplified by the way that he playfully approaches each argument with stylistic devices such as parody, artificial figuration and theatricality (Consigny 149).  Gorgias’ style of argumentation can be described as poetics-minus-the-meter (''poiêsis-minus-meter'').  Gorgias argues that persuasive words have power (''dunamis'') that is equivalent to that of the gods and as strong as physical force.  In the ''Encomium'', Gorgias likens the effect of speech on the soul to the effect of drugs on the body: "Just as different drugs draw forth different humors from the body – some putting a stop to disease, others to life – so too with words: some cause pain, others joy, some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion" (Gorgias 32). The ''Encomium'' "argues for the totalizing power of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bizzell | last2 = Herzberg | title = The Rhetorical Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorgias also believed that his "magical incantations" would bring healing to the human psyche by controlling powerful emotions.  He paid particular attention to the sounds of words, which, like poetry, could captivate audiences. His florid, rhyming style seemed to hypnotize his audiences (Herrick 42).  

Unlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not profess to teach ''[[Arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence, or, virtue). He believed that there was no absolute form of ''arete'', but that it was relative to each situation. For example, virtue in a slave was not the same as virtue in a statesman. He believed that rhetoric, the art of persuasion, was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.

Much debate over both the nature and value of rhetoric begins with Gorgias. [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''Gorgias'' presents a counter-argument to Gorgias’ embrace of rhetoric, its elegant form, and performative nature (Wardy 2).  The dialogue tells the story of a debate about rhetoric, politics and justice that occurred at a dinner gathering between Socrates and a small group of Sophists. Plato attempts to show that rhetoric does not meet the requirements to actually be considered a ''technê'' but rather is a somewhat dangerous "knack" to possess, both for the orator and for his audience, because it gives the ignorant the power to seem more knowledgeable than an expert to a group.

==''On the Non-Existent''==
Gorgias is the author of a [[lost work]]: ''On Nature or the Non-Existent'' (also ''On Non-Existence''). Rather than being one of his rhetorical works, it presented a theory of being that at the same time refuted and parodied the [[Eleatic]] thesis. The original text was lost and today there remain just two paraphrases of it. The first is preserved by the philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in ''Against the Professors'' and the other by the anonymous author of ''[[On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias]]''.  Each work, however, excludes material that is discussed in the other, which suggests that each version may represent intermediary sources (Consigny 4). It is clear, however, that the work developed a skeptical argument, which has been extracted from the sources and translated as below:
			
# Nothing exists;
# Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and
# Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.
# Even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood.

The argument has largely been seen as an ironic refutation of [[Parmenides]]' thesis on Being. Gorgias set out to prove that it is as easy to demonstrate that being is one, unchanging and timeless as it is to prove that being has no existence at all.  Regardless of how it "has largely been seen" it seems clear that Gorgias was focused instead on the notion that true objectivity is impossible since the human mind can never be separated from its possessor.

"How can anyone communicate the idea of color by means of words since the ear does not hear colors but only sounds?" This quote, written by the Sicilian philosopher Gorgias, was used to show his theory that ‘there is nothing’, ‘if there were anything no one would know it’, ‘and if anyone did know it, no one could communicate it’. This theory, thought of in the late 5th century BC, is still being contemplated by many philosophers throughout the world. This argument has led some to label Gorgias a [[nihilism|nihilist]] (one who believes nothing exists, or that the world is incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).

For the first main argument where Gorgias says, "there is no-thing", he tries to persuade the reader that thought and existence are not the same. By claiming that if thought and existence truly were the same, then everything that anyone thought would suddenly exist. He also attempted to prove that words and sensations couldn’t be measured by the same standards, for even though words and sensations are both derived from the mind, they are essentially different. This is where his second idea comes into place.

==Rhetorical works==

===''Encomium of Helen''===
[[Image:Helen of Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[Helen of Troy (painting)|Helen of Troy]]'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] (1898, London)]]

The Encomium of Helen is considered to be a good example of [[epideictic]] oratory and was supposed to have been Gorgias' "show piece or demonstration piece," which was used to attract students (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). In their writings, Gorgias and other sophists speculated "about the structure and function of language" as a framework for expressing the implications of action and the ways decisions about such actions were made" (Jarratt 103). And this is exactly the purpose of Gorgias’ ''Encomium of Helen''. Of the three divisions of rhetoric discussed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''Rhetoric'' (forensic, deliberative, and epideictic), the ''Encomium'' can be classified as an [[epideictic]] speech, expressing praise for [[Helen of Troy]] and ridding her of the blame she faced for leaving Sparta with Paris (Wardy 26).

Helen – the proverbial "Helen of Troy" – exemplified both sexual passion and tremendous beauty for the Greeks.  She was the daughter of [[Zeus]] and Leda, the Queen of Sparta, and her beauty was seen by the Trojans as the direct cause of the decade long [[Trojan War]] between [[Greece]] and [[Troy]]. The war began after the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]] asked Paris (a Trojan prince) to select who was the most beautiful of the three. Each goddess tried to influence Paris’ decision, but he ultimately chose Aphrodite who then promised Paris the most beautiful woman.  Paris then traveled to Greece where he was greeted by Helen and her husband [[Menelaus]].  Under the influence of Aphrodite, Helen allowed Paris to persuade her to elope with him.  Together they traveled to Troy, not only sparking the war, but also a popular and literary tradition of blaming Helen for her wrongdoing.  It is this tradition which Gorgias confronts in the ''Encomium''.

The ''Encomium'' opens with Gorgias explaining that "a man, woman, speech, deed, city or action that is worthy of praise should be honored with acclaim, but the unworthy should be branded with blame" (Gorgias 30).  In the speech Gorgias discusses the possible reasons for Helen’s journey to Troy. He explains that Helen could have been persuaded in one of four ways: by the gods, by physical force, by love, or by speech (''logos''). If it were indeed the plan of the gods that caused Helen to depart for Troy, Gorgias argues that those who blame her should face blame themselves, "for a human’s anticipation cannot restrain a god’s inclination" (Gorgias 31).  Gorgias explains that, by nature, the weak are ruled by the strong, and, since the gods are stronger than humans in all respects, Helen should be freed from her undesirable reputation.  If, however, Helen was abducted by force, it is clear that the aggressor committed a crime.  Thus, it should be he, not Helen, who should be blamed.  And if Helen was persuaded by love, she should also be rid of ill repute because "if love is a god, with the divine power of the gods, how could a weaker person refuse and reject him?  But if love is a human sickness and a mental weakness, it must not be blamed as mistake, but claimed as misfortune" (Gorgias 32).  Finally, if speech persuaded Helen, Gorgias claims he can easily clear her of blame.  Gorgias explains: "Speech is a powerful master and achieves the most divine feats with the smallest and least evident body.  It can stop fear, relieve pain, create joy, and increase pity" (Gorgias 31). It is here that Gorgias compares the effect of speech on the mind with the effect of drugs on the body. He states that Helen has the power to "lead" many bodies in competition by using her body as a weapon (Gumpert, 74). This image of "bodies led and misled, brought together and led apart, is of paramount importance in Gorgias' speech," (Gumpert, 74).

While Gorgias primarily used metaphors and paradox, he famously used "figures of speech, or schemata," (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa). This included balanced clauses ([[isocolon]]), the joining of contrasting ideas ([[antithesis]]), the structure of successive clauses (parison), and the repetition of word endings ([[homoeoteleuton]]) (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). The ''Encomium'' shows Gorgias' interest in argumentation, as he makes his point by "systematically refuting a series of possible alternatives," (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). It is an [[encomium]] of the "rhetorical craft itself, and a demonstration of its power over us," (Gumpert, 73). According to Van Hook, ''The Encomium of Helen'' abounds in "amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets" (122).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Van Hook | first = LaRue | title = The Encomium of Helen by Gorgias | journal = The Classical Weekly | volume = 6| issue = 16| pages = 122–3 | date = February 15, 1913 | doi=10.2307/4386697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Defense of Palamedes''===
In the ''Defense of Palamedes'' Gorgias describes logos as a positive instrument for creating ethical arguments (McComiskey 38).  The ''Defense'', an oration that deals with issues of morality and political commitment (Consigny 38), defends [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] who, in [[Greek mythology]], is credited with the invention of the alphabet, written laws, numbers, armor, and measures and weights (McComiskey 47).

In the speech Palamedes defends himself against the charge of treason.  In Greek mythology, [[Odysseus]] – in order to avoid going to Troy with [[Agamemnon]] and Menelaus to bring Helen back to [[Sparta]] – pretended to have gone mad and began sowing the fields with salt.  When Palamedes threw Odysseus' son, [[Telemachus]], in front of the plow, Odysseus avoided him, demonstrating that he was sane.  Odysseus, who never forgave Palamedes for making him reveal himself, later accused Palamedes of betraying the Greeks to the Trojans.  Soon after, Palamedes was condemned and killed (Jarratt 58).

In this epideictic speech, like the ''Encomium'', Gorgias is concerned with experimenting with how plausible arguments can cause conventional truths to be doubted (Jarratt 59).  Throughout the text, Gorgias presents a method for composing logical (''logos''), ethical (''ethos'') and emotional (''pathos'') arguments from possibility, which are similar to those described by Aristotle in ''Rhetoric''.  These types of arguments about motive and capability presented in the ''Defense'' are later described by Aristotle as forensic ''[[topoi]]''.  Gorgias demonstrates that in order to prove that treason had been committed, a set of possible occurrences also need to be established.  In the ''Defense'' these occurrences are as follows: communication between Palamedes and the enemy, exchange of a pledge in the form of hostages or money, and not being detected by guards or citizens.  In his defense, Palamedes claims that a small sum of money would not have warranted such a large undertaking and reasons that a large sum of money, if indeed such a transaction had been made, would require the aid of many confederates in order for it to be transported.  Palamedes reasons further that such an exchange could neither have occurred at night because the guards would be watching, nor in the day because everyone would be able to see.  Palamedes continues, explaining that if the aforementioned conditions were, in fact, arranged then action would need to follow.  Such action needed to take place either with or without confederates; however, if these confederates were free men then they were free to disclose any information they desired, but if they were slaves there was a risk of their voluntarily accusing to earn freedom, or accusing by force when tortured.  Slaves, Palamedes says, are untrustworthy.  Palamedes goes on to list a variety of possible motives, all of which he proves false.

Through the ''Defense'' Gorgias demonstrates that a motive requires an advantage such as status, wealth, honour, and security, and insists that Palamedes lacked a motive (McComiskey 47-49).

===''Epitaphios'' (or the Athenian funeral oration)===
This text is considered to be an important contribution to the genre of epitaphios.  During the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such funeral orations were delivered by well-known orators during public burial ceremonies in Athens, whereby those who died in wars were honoured.  Gorgias’ text provides a clever critique of 5th century propagandist rhetoric in imperial Athens and is the basis for Plato’s parody, ''[[Menexenus_(dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' (Consigny 2).

==Reception and legacy==
===In antiquity===
[[Plato]] was one of Gorgias’ greatest critics and a student of Socrates.  Plato’s dislike for sophistic doctrines is well known, and it is in his eponymous dialogue that both Gorgias himself as well as his rhetorical beliefs are ridiculed (McComiskey 17).

In his dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato distinguishes between [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], characterizing Gorgias as a shallow, opportunistic orator who entertains his audience with his eloquent words and who believes that it is unnecessary to learn the truth about actual matters when one has discovered the art of persuasion.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=1, 36}} In the dialogue, Gorgias responds to one of Socrates’ statements as follows: "Rhetoric is the only area of expertise you need to learn.  You can ignore all the rest and still get the better of the professionals!" (Plato 24).

Gorgias, whose ''On Non-Existence'' is taken to be critical of the [[Eleatic]] tradition and its founder [[Parmenides]], describes philosophy as a type of seduction, but he does not deny philosophy entirely, giving some respect to philosophers.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=37}}

Plato answers Gorgias by reaffirming the Parmenidean ideal that being is the basic substance and reality of which all things are composed, insisting that philosophy is a dialectic distinct from and superior to rhetoric (Wardy 52).

Aristotle also criticizes Gorgias, labeling him a mere Sophist whose primary goal is to make money by appearing wise and clever, thus deceiving the public by means of misleading or sophistic arguments.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=1, 36}}

Despite these negative portrayals, Gorgias's style of rhetoric was highly influential.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=1–2}} Gorgias's ''Defense of Helen'' influenced [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]''{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=2}} and his ''Defense of Palamedes'' influenced the development of western dicanic argument, including possibly even Plato's version of the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=2}}

===Modern reception===
For almost all of western history, Gorgias has been a marginalized and obscure figure in both philosophical thought and culture at large.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}} In the nineteenth century, however, writers such as the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770 – 1831) and the English classicist [[George Grote]] (1794 – 1871) began to work to "rehabilitate" Gorgias and the other Sophists from their longstanding reputation as unscrupulous charlatans who taught people how to persuade others using rhetoric for unjust causes.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}} As early as 1872, the English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] (1838 – 1900) was already calling this the "old view".{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}} Modern sources continue to affirm that the old stereotype of the Sophists is not accurate.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}}

Since the late twentieth century, scholarly interest in Gorgias has increased dramatically{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}} and the amount of research conducted on him is even beginning to rival the research on his more traditionally popular contemporary [[Parmenides]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}} Gorgias's distinctive writing style, filled with antithesis and figurative language, has been seen as foreshadowing the later development of [[Menippean satire]], as well as, in more recent times, the [[mannerism|mannerist]], [[grotesque]], and [[carnivalesque]] genres.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=2}} Several scholars have even argued that Gorgias's thoughts on the nature of knowledge, language, and truth foreshadow the views of modern philosophers such as [[Martin Heidigger]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Amélie Rorty]], and [[Stanley Fish]].{{sfn|Consigny|2001|pages=1–2}} Nonetheless, many academic philosophers still ridicule any efforts to portray Gorgias as a serious thinker.{{sfn|Consigny|2001|page=1}}

{{Contains Arabic text|section}}
'''''Hikmah''''' (also '''''Hikmat''''', {{lang-ar|حكمة}}, ''{{transl|ar|ḥikma}}'', literally [[wisdom]], philosophy; rationale, underlying reason,&lt;ref name="wehr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehr|first1=Hans|editor1-last=Cowan|editor1-first=J. Milton|title=A DIctionary of Modern Written Arabic, Arabic-English|date=1961|publisher=MacDonald &amp; Evans Ltd.|page=197|edition=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a concept in [[Islamic philosophy]] and law.

[[Mulla Sadra]] defined ''hikmah'' as "coming to know the essence of beings as they really are" or as "a man's becoming an intellectual world corresponding to the objective world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cooper|first=John|title=Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|volume=6|pages=595–599|location=London; New York|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=978-0415073103|via=Islamic Philosophy Online|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Islamic commentaries describe hikmah as "to know the best of things by way of the best of sciences ...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Mandhur|title=Lisan al-'Arab|pages=15/30}}&lt;/ref&gt; having experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Asma'i|title=as-Sihah|pages=5/1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "justice in judging", "knowledge of the reality of things",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taj al-'Arus'|pages=8/353}}&lt;/ref&gt; "that which prevents ignorance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Faris's|title=Mu'jam Maqayis al-Lughah|pages=2/91}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting "things in their proper places, assigning them to their proper status", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taysir al-Karim ar-Rahman|pages=1/233}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Qayyim]], the highest and most exclusive of the three levels of hikmah are "reserved for the [[Sahabah|Companions]] over the rest of the [[Ummah]], and it is the highest level that the [Islamic] scholars can reach."{{cn|date=November 2016}}

As a term of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Taqi Usmani]] describes it as meaning "the wisdom and the philosophy taken into account by the legislator while framing the [Islamic] law or the benefit intended to be drawn by [the law's] enforcement". One Dr Dipertua calls it "the objectives and wisdom" as "prescribed by Shariah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asyraf Wajdi Bin Dato’ Hj. Dusuki Yang Dipertua|title=The Challenge of Realizing Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Finance|url=http://www.iais.org.my/e/attach/2015/maqasid2015/pdf/keynote3_ppt.pdf|website=iais.org.my|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani gives as an example the secular law for traffic lights, where ''illat'' (another term of ''fiqh'' meaning "the basic feature of a transaction that causes relevant law to be applied") is obedience to stopping at red lights, and ''hikmah'' is traffic safety -- avoiding vehicle and pedestrian collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Usmani |first1=Muhammad Taqi |title=The Historic Judgment on Interest Delivered in the Supreme Court of Pakistan |publisher=albalagh.net |location=Karachi, Pakistan|url=http://www.albalagh.net/Islamic_economics/riba_judgement.pdf |date=December 1999 |ref=MTUHJI1999 |}}, paras 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iatrogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "brought forth by the healer") refers to any effect on a person resulting from any activity of one or more other persons acting as healthcare professionals or promoting products or services as beneficial to health which does not support a goal of the person affected.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Iatrogenesis|publisher=medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|title=Iatrogenesis &amp;#124; definition of iatrogenesis by Medical dictionary|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/iatrogenesis|publisher=merriam-webster.com|title=Iatrogenesis Medical Definition &amp;#124; Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Nemesis the expropriation of health|author1=Illich, I.|author2=Hose, R.|publisher=Elkrimbouziane|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kUkjRSyWNmYC&amp;pg=PA1967#v=onepage|page=1967|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=What Dying People Want: Practical Wisdom For The End Of Life|author=Kuhl, D.|date=2003|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9780786725830|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QfiLuC7a47sC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage|page=55|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Idea of Social Structure, the|author=Coser, L.A.|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=9781412846967|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ByFhcDveoK0C&amp;pg=PA336#v=onepage|page=336|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-iatrogenesis.html|publisher=encyclopedia.com|title=iatrogenesis - Dictionary definition of iatrogenesis &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some iatrogenic effects are clearly defined and easily recognized, such as a [[medical complication|complication]] following a surgical procedure (''e.g.'', [[lymphedema]] as a result of breast cancer surgery); less obvious ones, such as complex drug interactions, may require significant investigation to identify.

Cases of iatrogenesis may include:
* complications arising from a medical procedure or treatment
* [[side effect]]s of possible [[drug interaction]]s
* [[medical error]]s
* [[negligence]]
* use of [[contaminated]] instruments
* [[anxiety]] or annoyance in the patient, physician or treatment provider in relation to medical procedures or treatments
* [[unnecessary medical treatment]] resulting from a physician's decision

Unlike an [[adverse event]], an iatrogenic effect is not always harmful.&lt;ref name=Jacobs-2008/&gt; For example, a [[scar]] created by surgery is said to be iatrogenic even though it does not represent improper care and may not be troublesome.

Professionals who may cause iatrogenic harm to patients include [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, [[medical laboratory scientist]]s and [[therapist]]s. Iatrogenesis can also result from [[complementary and alternative medicine]] treatments. Globally, as of 2013, an estimated 20&amp;nbsp;million negative effects from treatment occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment, up from 94,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* [[Complication (medicine)|Risk]] associated with medical interventions
** [[Adverse effect]]s of prescription drugs
** Overuse of drugs (causing, for example, [[antibiotic resistance]] in [[bacteria]])
** Prescription [[drug interaction]]
* [[Medical error]]s
** Incorrect [[Medical prescription|prescription]], perhaps due to illegible [[handwriting]] or computer [[typos]]
** Faulty procedures, techniques, information, methods, or equipment
** [[Negligence]]
** [[Nosocomial infection]]s

==Causes and consequences==

===Medical error and negligence===

Iatrogenic conditions do not necessarily result from [[medical error]]s, such as mistakes made in [[surgery]], or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a [[Medication|drug]]. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, [[radiation therapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] — necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect — frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as [[hair loss]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[diabetes insipidus]], [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[brain damage]], [[lymphedema]], infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, as in the case of [[diabetes]] consequential to the removal of all or part of the [[pancreas]].

The incidence of iatrogenesis may be misleading in some cases. For example, ruptured [[aortic aneurysm]] is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die during or after an operation will still be considered iatrogenic deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated.

Other situations may involve actual [[negligence]] or faulty procedures, such as when [[Pharmacotherapy|pharmacotherapist]]s produce handwritten prescriptions for drugs.

===Adverse effects===

A very common iatrogenic effect is caused by [[drug interaction]], i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all medications a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating or attenuating the intended therapeutic effect). Such situations can cause significant [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]]. Adverse reactions, such as [[allergy|allergic reactions]] to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as iatrogenic.

The evolution of [[antibiotic resistance]] in [[bacteria]] is iatrogenic as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Finland M |title=Emergence of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, 1935-1975 |journal=Rev. Infect. Dis. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4–22 |year=1979 |pmid=45521|doi=10.1093/clinids/1.1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved in response to the overprescription of [[antibiotic]] drugs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Certain drugs are toxic in their own right in therapeutic doses because of their mechanism of action. [[Alkylating antineoplastic agent]]s, for example, cause [[DNA damage]], which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, [[alkylation]] causes severe side-effects and is actually [[carcinogenic]] in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In a similar manner, [[arsenic]]-based medications like [[melarsoprol]], used to treat [[trypanosomiasis]], can cause [[arsenic poisoning]].

Adverse effects can appear mechanically. The design of some surgical instruments may be decades old, hence certain adverse effects (such as tissue trauma) may never have been properly cauterized.{{clarify|date=January 2015}}

===Psychiatry===

In psychiatry, iatrogenesis can occur due to [[Medical error|misdiagnosis]] (including diagnosis with a false condition, as was the case of [[hystero-epilepsy]]&lt;ref name="spanos"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Spanos, Nicholas P. |title=Multiple Identities &amp; False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective |publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) |year=1996 |isbn=1-55798-340-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). An example of a partially iatrogenic condition due to common misdiagnosis is [[bipolar disorder]], especially in pediatric patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pruett Jr |first=John R.|author2=Luby, Joan L. |year=2004 |title=Recent Advances in Prepubertal Mood Disorders: Phenomenology and Treatment |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/466375_print |accessdate= 2008-05-04 |doi=10.1097/00001504-200401000-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions such as [[somatoform disorder]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] are theorized to have significant sociocultural and iatrogenic components.&lt;ref name=Abbey1993&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Abbey, S.E. | year = 1993 | title = Somatization, illness attribution and the sociocultural psychiatry of chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Ciba Found Symp | volume = 173 | pages = 238–52 |pmid=8491101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] is hypothesized to be prone to iatrogenic complications based on treatment modality.&lt;ref name=Boscarino&gt;{{Cite journal| author =Boscarino, JA | year =2004 | title = Evaluation of the Iatrogenic Effects of Studying Persons Recently Exposed to a Mass Urban Disaster | url = http://mailer.fsu.edu/~cfigley/IatrogenicEffectsfinal3p1.pdf | accessdate =  2008-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625161528/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~cfigley/IatrogenicEffectsfinal3p1.pdf |archivedate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatric treatment of some conditions and populations, such as [[substance abuse]],&lt;ref name=Moos2005&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Moos, R.H. | year = 2005 | title = Iatrogenic effects of psychosocial interventions for substance use disorders: prevalence, predictors, prevention | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 595–604 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01073.x |url=http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/addi/abstract.00008514-200505000-00006.htm;jsessionid=LpCb6sF6cx1sMvkMlc5h62MCCWh1Gj5vyLBz0ydpfn36tl31Y8Kn!1379360954!181195629!8091!-1 | pmid = 15847616}}&lt;/ref&gt; and antisocial youths&lt;ref name=Weiss2005&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Weiss, B. |author2=Caron, A. |author3=Ball, S. |author4=Tapp, J. |author5=Johnson, M. |author6= Weisz, J.R.  | year = 2005 | title = Iatrogenic effects of group treatment for antisocial youths | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 1036–1044 | url =http://eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ734173&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ734173 | doi = 10.1037/0022-006X.73.6.1036 | pmid = 16392977}}&lt;/ref&gt; are regarded as carrying significant risks for iatrogenesis. At the other end of the spectrum, [[dissociative identity disorder]] is considered by a minority of theorists to be a wholly iatrogenic disorder with the bulk of diagnoses arising from a tiny fraction of practitioners.&lt;ref name="spanos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Braun1989&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Braun, B.G. | year = 1989 | journal = Dissociation |volume=2 |issue=2 | title = Iatrophilia and Iatrophobia in the diagnosis and treatment of MPD (Morose Parasitic Dynamism)|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1794/1425| accessdate = 2008-05-04|pmid=| pages =  43, 161–2, 165–6, 171–2 passim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of association of any particular condition with iatrogenesis is unclear and in some cases controversial. The over-diagnosis of psychiatric conditions (with the assignment of mental illness terminology) may relate primarily to clinician dependence on subjective criteria. The assignment of pathological nomenclature is rarely a benign process and can easily rise to the level of emotional iatrogenesis, especially when no alternatives outside of the diagnostic naming process have been considered. Many former patients come to the conclusion that their difficulties are largely the result of the power relationships inherent in psychiatric treatment, which has led to the rise of the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement.

===Iatrogenic poverty===

Meessen et al. used the term "iatrogenic poverty" to describe impoverishment induced by medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Meessen, B. |author2=Zhenzhong, Z. |author3=Van Damme, W. |author4=Devadasan, N. |author5=Criel, B. |author6=Bloom, G. |title= Iatrogenic poverty |journal= Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=581–4 |year=2003  |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.2003.01081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impoverishment is described for households exposed to catastrophic health expenditure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Xu |title= Protecting Households from Catastrophic Health Spending |journal= Health Affairs |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=972–83 |year=2007 |pmid= 17630440|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.4.972 |last2= Evans |first2= DB |last3= Carrin |first3= G |last4= Aguilar-Rivera |first4= AM |last5= Musgrove |first5= P |last6= Evans |first6= T |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to hardship financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Kruk |title= Borrowing And Selling To Pay For Health Care In Low- And Middle-Income Countries |journal= Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=10056–66 |year=2009 |pmid= 19597204|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.1056 |last2= Goldmann |first2= E. |last3= Galea |first3= S.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, worldwide, over 100,000 households fall into [[Poverty#Health care|poverty]] due to health care expenses. A study reported that in the United States in 2001, illness and [[medical debt]] caused half of all personal [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url= http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/bankruptcy_study.html | title= Medical Bills Leading Cause of Bankruptcy, Harvard Study Finds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in countries in [[Transition economy|economic transition]], the [[willingness to pay]] for [[health care]] is increasing, and the supply side does not stay behind and develops very fast. But the regulatory and protective capacity in those countries is often lagging behind. Patients easily fall into a vicious cycle of illness, ineffective therapies, consumption of savings, indebtedness, sale of productive assets, and eventually poverty.

===Social and cultural iatrogenesis===

The 20th-century social critic [[Ivan Illich]] broadened the concept of medical iatrogenesis in his 1974 book ''Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Illich, Ivan|title=Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health|publisher=Calder &amp; Boyars|location=London|year=1974 |isbn=0-7145-1096-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by defining it at three levels.
*First, clinical iatrogenesis is the injury done to patients by ineffective, unsafe, and erroneous treatments as described above. In this regard, he described the need for [[evidence-based medicine]] 20 years before the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce |first=Wright |year=2003 |title=Obituary: Ivan Illich |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9352 |pages=185 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12233-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Second, at another level social iatrogenesis is the [[medicalization]] of life in which medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device companies have a vested interest in sponsoring sickness by creating unrealistic health demands that require more treatments or treating non-diseases that are part of the normal human experience, such as age-related declines. In this way, aspects of medical practice and medical industries can produce social harm in which society members ultimately become less healthy or excessively dependent on institutional care. He argued that medical education of physicians contributes to medicalization of society because they are trained predominantly for diagnosing and treating illness, therefore they focus on disease rather than on health. Iatrogenic poverty (above) can be considered a specific manifestation of social iatrogenesis.
*Third, cultural iatrogenesis refers to the destruction of traditional ways of dealing with, and making sense of, death, suffering, and sickness. In this way the medicalization of life leads to cultural harm as society members lose their autonomous coping skills. It is worth noting that in these critiques "Illich does not reject all benefits of modern society but rejects those that involve unwarranted dependency and exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnet |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Ivan Illich and the Nemesis of Medicine |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=273–286 |pmid=14620464 |doi=10.1023/a:1025991708888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Globally it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment, an increase of 51 percent from 94,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; In the United States, estimated deaths per year include:

* 12,000 due to unnecessary surgery
* 7,000 due to medication errors in hospitals
* 20,000 due to other errors in hospitals
* 80,000 due to [[nosocomial]] infections in hospitals
* 106,000 due to non-error, negative effects of drugs

Based on these figures, iatrogenesis may cause as many as 225,000 deaths per year in the United States (excluding recognizable error). An earlier [[Institute of Medicine]] report estimated 230,000 to 284,000 iatrogenic deaths annually.&lt;ref name="starfield" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Evidence demonstrating the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in 1823 Vienna (left vertical line) correlated with incidence of fatal childbed fever. The onset of chlorine handwash in 1847 is noted (right vertical line). For comparison, rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784-1849|view rates]]). [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Semmelweis]] 1861.]]

The term [[wikt:en:iatrogenesis#English|iatrogenesis]] means ''brought forth by a healer'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:en:ἰατρός#Ancient Greek|ἰατρός]] (''iatros'', "healer") and [[wikt:en:γένεσις#Ancient Greek|γένεσις]] (''genesis'', "origin"); as such, in its earlier forms, it could refer to good or bad effects.

Since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], people have recognized the potentially damaging effects of medical intervention. "First do no harm" (''[[primum non nocere]]'') is a primary Hippocratic mandate in modern [[bioethics|medical ethics]]. Iatrogenic illness or death caused purposefully or by avoidable error or negligence on the healer's part became a punishable offense in many civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Organization Development in Healthcare: Conversations on Research and Strategies |editors=Wolf, Hanson, Moir, Friedman, Savage |date=July 12, 2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Pub |isbn=978-0-85724-709-4 |page=292 |series=Advances in Health Care Management Series #10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of pathogens from the autopsy room to maternity patients, leading to shocking [[historical mortality rates of puerperal fever]] (also known as "childbed fever") at maternity institutions in the 19th century, was a major iatrogenic catastrophe of the era. The infection mechanism was first identified by [[Ignaz Semmelweis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanninen|first=O|author2=Farago, M. |author3=Monos, E. |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, the prophet of bacteriology|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|year=1983|volume=4|issue=5|pages=367–370|pmid=6354955|jstor=30142576|doi=10.1017/S0195941700059762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[scientific medicine]] in the 20th century, it could be expected that iatrogenic illness or death might be more easily avoided. [[Antiseptic]]s, [[anesthesia]], [[antibiotic]]s, better surgical techniques, [[evidence based medicine|evidence-based]] [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] and [[best practices]] continue to be developed to decrease iatrogenic side effects and [[death|mortality]].

The '''innocent prisoner's dilemma''', or '''parole deal''', is a detrimental effect of a legal system in which admission of guilt can result in reduced sentences or early parole. When an innocent person is wrongly convicted of a crime, legal systems which need the individual to admit guilt, for example as a prerequisite step leading to parole, punish an innocent person for his integrity, and reward a person lacking in integrity. There have been many cases where innocent prisoners were given the choice between freedom, in exchange for claiming guilt, and remaining imprisoned and telling the truth. Individuals have [[died in prison]] rather than admit to crimes which they did not commit.

It has been demonstrated in Britain that prisoners who freely admit their guilt are more likely to re-offend than prisoners who maintain their innocence. Other research, however, has found no clear link between denial of guilt and recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clark Baim|author2=Lydia Guthrie|title=Changing Offending Behaviour: A Handbook of Practical Exercises and Photocopiable Resources for Promoting Positive Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-0-85700-928-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=recidivism 39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law professor Daniel Medwed says convicts who go before a parole board maintaining their innocence are caught in a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] which he calls "the innocent prisoner’s dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/06/04/nyregion/1247467961918/the-innocent-prisoner-s-dilemma.html |title=The 'Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma' - Video Library - The New York Times |publisher=Video.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31 |first=Rob |last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false admission of guilt and remorse by an innocent person at a parole hearing may prevent a later investigation proving their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=960125 |title=The Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma: Consequences of Failing to Admit Guilt at Parole Hearings by Daniel Medwed :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to individuals==

===In the United Kingdom===
Michael Naughton, founder of the [[Innocence Network]] UK (INUK), says work carried out by the INUK includes research and public awareness on wrongful convictions, which can effect policy reforms. Most important is the development of a system to assess prisoners maintaining innocence, to distinguish potentially innocent prisoners from the prisoners who claim innocence for other reasons like "ignorance, misunderstanding or disagreement with criminal law; to protect another person or group from criminal conviction; or on 'abuse of process' or technical grounds in the hope of achieving an appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/08/innocence-network | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Naughton | title=Students for justice: the Innocence Network | date=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, he says, is being adopted by the prison parole board and prison service, for prisoners serving "indeterminate sentences (where the prisoner has no release date and does not get out until a parole board decides he or she is no longer a risk to the public). Previously, such prisoners were treated as 'deniers' with no account taken of the various reasons for maintaining innocence, nor the fact that some may actually be innocent." Those prisoners are unable to achieve parole unless they undertake offence-behaviour courses that require the admission of guilt as a prerequisite. This was represented in the ''Porridge'' episode ''[[Pardon Me (Porridge)|Pardon Me]]''.  However, in recent years, this has diminished in significance; at the time Simon Hall ended his denials to murder in 2012, the Ministry of Justice denied that this would have any impact on his tariff, and his last online posting had concerned being released from prison in spite of his denials.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hall confesses to Joan Albert murder 12 years on https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-23611821&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[murder of Linda Cook]] was committed in [[Portsmouth]] on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial led to a [[miscarriage of justice]] when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old [[Royal Navy]] sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="olden"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Olden |first=Mark |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |title=Justice - but at what cost? |work=[[The Independent]] |page=10 |date=2003-08-19 |accessdate=2009-08-14 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810100122/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaw|first=Danny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3039608.stm|title=Sailor awaits murder appeal ruling|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the [[Parole Board for England and Wales|parole board]], but he refused to do so and said: "I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do.

&lt;/ref&gt; Downing claimed that had he falsely confessed he would have been released over a decade earlier. Because he did not admit to the crime he was classified as "IDOM" (In Denial of Murder) and ineligible for parole under English Law.

===In the United States===

In the United States the reality of a person being innocent, called "[[actual innocence]]", is not sufficient reason for the justice system to release a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/3/30/georgia_and_the_us_supreme_court_tinkering_with_the_machinery_of_death&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a verdict has been made, it is rare for a court to reconsider evidence of innocence which could have been presented at the time of the original trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles regarding its treatment of prisoners who may be actually innocent have been criticized by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A. (2009, August 19) "Troy Davis and the Meaning of 'Actual Innocence'". Democracy Now. Retrieved on August 11, 2017 from https://www.democracynow.org/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Murray, who was convicted of murder in 1979, said, "When the judge asked me did I have anything to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn’t communicate. I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man." The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said "Nineteen years is a long time. [....] But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior." Murray agreed with the parole officer, but maintained his innocence: "I agree! But again, I just didn't do it."

In a news interview, Murray says he went before a parole board four times, maintaining his innocence until the fifth: "I said what the hell, let me tell these people what they want to hear." He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. "I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. [...] I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work." His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, [[Medwed's Second Look clinic]], a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindgatemedia.com/lesson/wrongfully-convicted-prisoners-often-denied-parole/ |title=Wrongfully Convicted Prisoners Often Denied Parole |publisher=Mindgate Media |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Cole|Timothy Brian Cole]] (1960–99) was an African American military veteran and a student wrongly convicted of [[rape|raping]] a fellow student in 1985. Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While [[incarceration|incarcerated]], Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavandera|first=Ed|title=Family seeks to clear man who died in prison|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2009-02-05|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/05/texas.exoneration/index.html|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated", his mother stated in a press interview. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison.

Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. She stated that investigators botched the gathering of evidence and withheld information from her, causing her to believe that Cole was the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearing could lead to exoneration in Cole rape case|publisher=[[News 8 Austin]]|date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=231175|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe [[asthma]]. [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] later showed him to be innocent.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Wade|title=Family Of Man Cleared By DNA Still Seeks Justice|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=2009-02-05|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100249923|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999; ten years later, a district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. He was posthumously pardoned.

The dilemma can occur even before conviction. [[Kalief Browder]] was arrested in May 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent the next three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial, much of it in solitary. During court appearances, prosecutors routinely asked for a short delay which would turn into a much lengthier wait. At times, Browder was offered plea bargains, and at one point, he was encouraged to plead guilty to misdemeanors, for which he would be sentenced to time already served and released. When he refused the plea deal, insisting on his innocence, the judge noted "If you go to trial and lose, you could get up to fifteen [years]." Eventually, in May 2013, the case was dismissed because prosecutors had lost contact with the only witness they had to the alleged crime.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|title=Before the Law|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2014-10-06|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to society==
Gabe Tan reported a British conference in 2011, "the dilemma of maintaining innocence", concluded "Denial is not a valid measure of risk. In fact, research has shown that prisoners who openly admit to their crimes have the highest risk of re-offending."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Gabe-Tan-APL-PPMI-Report-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Michael Naughton suggested the focus on new evidence by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], rather than an examination of serious problems with evidence at original trials, meant in many cases “that the dangerous criminals who committed these crimes remain at liberty with the potential to commit further serious crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/ccrcreform Potential Wrongful Convictions: Failed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission | INUK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Forde cited two studies at the conference. One, a ten-year study of 180 sex offenders by Harkins, Beech and Goodwill found prisoners who claimed to be innocent were the least likely to be re-convicted, and that those who 'admitted everything', claiming to be guilty, were most likely to re-offend. He also told the conference research by Hanson ''et al.'' in 2002, the denial by the prisoner of their offences had no bearing on their likelihood of re-offending.&lt;!--first paragraph ref repeats here--&gt;

'''Joseph Demarco''' (1718–1793) was a Maltese medical practitioner, a scientist, and a major philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were mostly philosophical [[psychology]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarco's extensive interests make him quite unique. Indeed, though his main concern was human health, in his case this must be understood in the widest of meanings. Certainly, he was fascinated by the mechanisms of the human body, but also with its infirmities, especially within their psychological and social contexts. This brought him to be very much attracted to the philosophical underpinnings of the human condition in all of its aspects. Both his life and his writings are proof enough of this.

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Demarco was born on January 2, 1718, at [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Vella, H.C.R. Vella, ed., ''Joseph Demarco: On the Passage of Air from the Lungs into the Blood System'', Malta University Press, Malta, 1999, p. xxii and note p. xxxvii. It might be worth noting here that R. Mifsud Bonnici’s ''Dizzjunarju Bijo-Bibljografiku Nazzjonali Malti'' (1960), erroneously states that Demarco was born on November 9, 1723 (p. 171). The same goes with the date provided by M. Montebello, ''op. cit.''. Apparently both publications have used a mistaken common source, which was D. Ignatio Saverio Mifsud’s 1760 ''Stromatum Melitensium'', XV, ff. 11–18, at the Malta National Library. In this regard, see J. Galea, ‘Doctor Giuseppe De Marco’, ''The St. Luke’s Hospital Gazette'', VII, 1, Malta, 1972, pp. 3–13.&lt;/ref&gt; This seaport and dry-dock hub was also a place where many different peoples congregated. More so since the then [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[António Manoel de Vilhena]], had given free entry to the harbours to all nations.

Fortunate enough to be born within a well-off family, Demarco was given a good education (including a solid knowledge of Latin), probably at the [[Collegium Melitense]] of the Jesuits in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, his eyes were set on the medical profession, one highly regarded and very much encouraged by the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. Already as a young boy, his medical intellectual curiosity drew him to speculate about the effect of atmospheric conditions on the human body, as his writing from 1933 (''De Aere''),&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''op. cit.'', vol. II, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; at only fifteen years of age, attests. Of course, he was also very much interested in understanding physical illnesses, as his writing from 1741 (''De Tumoribus Humoralibus''),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''.&lt;/ref&gt; on swellings caused by liquid retention, shows. In addition, he was from an early age piqued by instances of pathological madness, common to congested urban areas as his home-town, [[Cospicua]], was, and made some particular observations about the phenomenon (especially that caused by rabies) around 1742 (''Tractatus de Rabie'').&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demarco, Joseph - Manuscript page.jpg|thumb|A page from one of Demarco's manuscripts]]

However, during this formative time Demarco also entertained interests in other scientific areas. Still in his early twenties, around 1742 he engaged himself in speculations on standard [[trigonometry]] (''Trattato della Trigonometria Piana'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; and elementary arithmetic (''Vulgaris Arithmeticæ Elementaris Theoria''),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; giving them also some philosophical depth. During the same period, he wrote short studies on [[hydrostatics]] in general (''Breve Compendio dell’Idrostatica'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and on hydrostatic sources and technology (''Trattato de Fonti e Machine Adrostiche'').&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France interlude===
At just 24 years of age, in 1742, Demarco went to [[France]] to pursue a medical degree. Naturally, this was made possible by his parents’ financial resources. He studied at the [[University of Montpellier]] [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] [[région]] of the south of [[France]]. In particular, he studied under the renowned physician and botanist, [[François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix]]. This is also attested by a document written by Demarco, ''Physiologie Cursus: Anatomico – meccanico – experimentalis'' (A Course in Physiology: Anatomical – mechanical – experimental; 1765) which originates from De Sauvages’ course on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 99; [[National Library of Malta]] [NLM], Manuscript [MS.] 39#3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarco's writings during this period bear out to his professional and proficient stance in medical matters. In particular, one may note his investigations dealing with chest (''Tractatus De Morbis Pectoris'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and abdominal ailments (''De Morbis Abdominis'').&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''.&lt;/ref&gt; In all probability, it was this dexterity and expertise which convinced his lecturers to trust him, from amongst his peers, with a course on physics (as his ''Traité de Physique'' attests).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This must have been highly prestigious for the young freshman.

Having completed his two-year course in medicine, Demarco defended his thesis in 1743. It was entitled ''Dissertatio Physiologica de Respiratione, ejusque Uso Primario'' (Physiological Aspects of Respiration and its Primary Significance''). The work was published a year later, in 1744, at Montpellier.&lt;ref&gt;Vella, ''op.cit.'', p. xxii and xl.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta period===
Demarco returned to [[Malta]] as Doctor of Medicine, but also with a keen eye on social affairs. It seems that his acquaintance with [[Illuminist]] philosophy while in France enhanced his sensitivity towards communal needs and societal acclimatisation. Nevertheless, throughout his long career he never directly involved himself in any political activity, not even when the [[French Revolution]] erupted on the European scene.

His commitment was of a purely medical nature. And if every now and then he reached out into philosophical spheres, he always did this in strict relationship to his medical speculations. Demarco, in fact, did not seem sympathetic towards any revolutionary beliefs or objectives. On the contrary, he was a close collaborator and a personal friend of the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]], who immediately, on Demarco's return to Malta, chose him as Principle Medical Officer for the [[Maltese Islands]]. His loyalty to the [[Knights Hospitallers]] went unblemished throughout his entire life.

===Professional career===
Demarco's main professional asset was his sharp eye for observation. This is amply attested by the thirty-four works we have from his forty-two-year career in Malta after his return from Paris. All of his speculative reflections, including his philosophical ones, squarely rest on the authority of concrete experience and on pure sense data.

Though highly proficient from a professional point of view, Demarco was consistently appealed by the theoretical foundations of the medical art and by the intellectual and academic relationships which particular illnesses suggested. As seen from his various works, he inquired into philosophy in general, social philosophy, physics, pathology (as he had in his youth), mechanical physics, experimental philosophy, philosophical physiology, science in general, and various other fields of an academic and rational nature.

In 1788, when Demarco was 70 years of age (and already in poor health himself), the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], requested that he went to [[Tripoli]], then an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province, to see to the health of the pasha there, who was gravely ill. This incident demonstrates the high esteem in which Demarco was held. Not only was the matter complicated from medical point of view, but also politically sensitive (having a Christian medic treated a Muslim leader). Fortunately, the mission was a success, and Demarco's standing was never as strong. While in [[Tripoli]] he continued to indulge his scientific and philosophical curiosity by making copiousness notes about the quality of the soil, the atmosphere, and also about local customs. He even took down observations about various illnesses and diseases, particularly (as was his passion) on the types of pathological madness he encountered there.

===Death===
On his return to Malta, Demarco showed serious signs of physical decline. The Order of [[Knights Hospitallers]] which he loved was fatally in trouble, not only because of the revolution in France, but also for its internal bankruptcy, corruption, and loose morals. It seemed that Demarco was passing away together with a whole age.

He died at [[Cospicua]], his home-town, on August 13, 1793, and was buried at the parish church at [[Cospicua]].

==Published works==
Demarco's published works are just a handful. They are the following. While the latter three are of some interest to philosophy, the first is of a medical interest only.
* '''''Dissertatio Physiologica de Respiratione, ejusque Uso Primario''''' (Physiological Aspects of Respiration and its Primary Significance; written in 1743, and published in 1744).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; – The publication contains six chapters respectively dealing with the following: the organs of breathing and their strength; the nature and peculiarities of respiratory air; the function of breathing; the instruments of expiration, their powers, functions, and the reciprocation of this action; the phenomena of respiration; and the primary use of respiration. The work, which is made up of some 100 pages, and written in Latin, has little philosophical value. It was published by A. Rochard in Montpellier.
* '''''Tractatus Mechanicus de Non Naturalibus''''' (A Study on Artificial Mechanics; 1748)&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''op. cit.'', vol. II, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; – This book in Latin was published in [[Avignon]], [[France]], by Francis Girard (Palateâ Sancti Desiderii). It bears the long subtitle: ''Qui est brevis explicatio mutationum, quas in humano corpore producuut Aer, Diaeta, etc. simul cum inquisitione in naturam et usum balneorum. Quibus præfixa est Doctrina Secretionis, pluribus in propositionibus'' (Which contains brief explanations on certain changes which occur in the human body because of man's environment and his ways of living, and so forth, the same as happens because of living in a natural environment u the use of baths. In which is added some teaching about the distinctions between animals, and also some distinctions).

:The publication, which contains 402 pages, is beautifully presented with gilded edges. The material presented is extremely interesting and very detailed, and particularly relevant to philosophy. Basically it deals with the physical functions of human beings, particularly seen under the aspect of the natural environment. Demarco’s basic philosophy throughout the book is that, the more human beings are removed from nature and from natural living, the more they are susceptible to illnesses and, consequently, the more they move towards nature and live in harmony with it, the healthier they will be.

:The book is divided in nine chapters. It opens with a preface, a warning to the reader, and a list of 22 proposition concerning the differences between animals. This part is based on the teachings of [[Aristotle]]. At the end, Demarco includes a separate study called ''Tractatus de Hepate'' (A Treatise concerning [[Hipatitis]]).

:The nine chapters might be considered under two aspects. While the first five focus on the unnatural causes of physical malfunctions in humans, the last four concentrate on the effects that the environment and natural living have on the human body. The first five chapters respectively deal with the effects which an artificial environment have on the heart, on respiration, on the body, on the brain, and on body temperature. The successive four chapters respectively deal with the beneficial effects on the body which ensue from the natural environment, therapeutic baths, food, and drink.
* '''''De Lana''''' (Concerning Wool; 1759)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; – This 367-page book was published in Malta at the printing press of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in Valletta. It mainly deals with the proper application of wool in well-being and sickness. This indicates that's Demarco's intent here was not merely technical. Indeed, the work is not exactly philosophical. Nonetheless, Demarco explores the connection between the industrial production of wool fabric and human living, and the relationship between the growth of wool and mechanics. The work bears the official approbation of [[Henry Ercole]], amongst others, on behalf of the competent authorities. At the end of the book, Demarco also includes a separate study, which is the following:
* '''''De Chocholata''''' (Concerning Chocolate; 1760)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; – The work is made up of three chapters over 28 pages, and carries the subtitle: * ''Dissertatio de Chocholata ejusque usu e abusu in medicina ubi inquiritur etiam: an potione cocholate jejunium ecclesiasticum frangatur'' (A dissertation on the use and abuse of chocolate in medical matters, and whether chocolate breaks ecclesiastical fasts). Despite the title of this work, which might be seen as frivolous, the study is a very interesting one, both from an historical and cultural point of view as well as from a moral approach. In Demarco's time, chocolate was a liquid product imported from beyond European shores, and whose precise nature was not yet known. The moral problems apparently created by chocolate consumption must have been very relevant at the time. In fact, the censors’ comments on the subject (including [[Henry Ercole]] are given importance by being placed on separate pages for clarity's sake. In his study, Demarco focuses on the medicinal usefulness of chocolate (its addictive substance, for instance), and on its moral aspect (whether it is a kind of sweet or simply a vegetation).

==Extant manuscripts with philosophical interest==
All of Demarco's manuscripts are held at the [[National Library of Malta]] in [[Valletta]], and still in their manuscript form. Though some interest in the man's activities and intellectual endeavours had always been kept alive amongst academics, little serious effort had ever been made to bring his scientific and philosophical accomplishments fully out in the open. The ones commented upon here are solely those which retain some philosophical interest. Of course, from a medical point of view all of his works would be relevant and worthy of thorough comprehension.

All manuscripts are written in Demarco's typical minuscule, crammed and barely legible handwriting, which of course makes reading, transliteration, translation and study immensely difficult. This is one of the most pertinent reasons, amongst others, for which Demarco's intellectual enterprise remains unexplored completely unto this day.

===Philosophy===
* '''''De Logica''''' (Concerning Logic; ''c.'' 1760)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 304; NLM, MS. 1359/1.&lt;/ref&gt; – A work in Latin (with unnumbered pages) which bears the subtitle ''Prælectiones Nonnullæ'' (A Few Instructions). It seems to have been intended as an introduction to logic for beginners.
* '''''Atrium in Universam Physicam Experimentalem''''' (An Introduction to Universal Experimental Physics; 1760)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 98; NLM, MS. 1359#2.&lt;/ref&gt; – This extant manuscript in Latin is incomplete and was left in draft form by Demarco himself. It is a commentary on the first book of [[Aristotle]]’s ''De Naturalibus'' (On Natural Things) or, in other words, on his ''De Sensu et Sensato'' (On Sense and Sensibility) of his ''Parva Naturalia'' (Brief Comments on Natural Things). What brought Demarco to commence this commentary was a new publication issued at [[Avignon]], [[France]], of [[Aristotle]]’s work.
* '''''Varia''''' (Miscellaneous; ''c.'' 1760)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 241; NLM, Manuscripts [MSS.] 38 and 39.&lt;/ref&gt; – Two Latin manuscripts which are together composed of 550 folios. They contain a colossal number of reflections in no order whatsoever. Herein Demarco simply jotted down any thought and musing as they came to mind. Very often is quite difficult to distinguish one from the other. At the end of the work, Demarco was considerate enough to include an index of contents. Obviously this was for his own use, as it is absolutely impossible to follow.
* '''''Generalis Philosophiæ Atrium''''' (A General Introduction to Philosophy; 1763)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 91; NLM, MS. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; – The main idea of this manuscript in Latin is to provide a general introduction to what Demarco calls ''philosophiæ experimentalis'' (experimental philosophy) and all its divisions. The work has 43 chapters organised under 13 titles. The extant manuscript also includes marginal notes added by Demarco himself. The content deals with philosophy by respectively focusing on its qualifications; its structure; its objectives; its initial history; its history after classical times; its development; its academic divisions; the growth of its schools of thought; its main themes; its results; important [[Presocratic]] themes, and their meaning. The last title is reserved for some general comments concerning philosophy.

===Social philosophy===
* '''''Epistola Dedicatoria''''' (A Memorial Missive; 1754)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 146; NLM, MS. 39#2,&lt;/ref&gt; – Text of an open letter in Latin supposedly sent from [[Senglea]], [[Malta]], on January 12, 1754, to Don Josepho de Dueñas, one of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in Malta. The 15-folio long letter is certainly of a historical and literary value. However, also is interesting for the fact that it reveals some of Demarco's philosophical aptitudes.
* '''''Delle Torture''''' (Concerning Torture; ''c.'' 1750)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 223; NLM, MS. 1359#8.&lt;/ref&gt; – This manuscript in Italian had been left unfinished by Demarco himself. It is a very interesting study on the use of torture (common still in Demarco's day) from different angles. Nonetheless, Demarco stops short of expressing any moral pronouncement on the subject.
* '''''Mannarino''''' (Mannarino; 1773)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 14; NLM, MS. 1360.&lt;/ref&gt; – This is another open letter dedicated to a personality in [[Malta|Maltese]] history, Don Gaetano Mannarino. This priest was actually a contemporary of Demarco. From February 1773, he organised a group of fellow priests who, eventually, took up arms against [[Francisco Ximenes de Texada]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], in protest for retracting some of their rights and privileges. The actual revolt of the priests took place on September 9, 1775. Nonetheless, Demarco's letter was written on October 22, of two years earlier. It still addresses some of the presumed issued which were being brought forward by the priests. Typically (and revealingly), in his missive Demarco sides with the Grand Master's point of view, and admonishes Mannarino and his collaborators for being so unreasonable and unruly.

===Pathology===
* '''''Fasti: Morborum Melitensis''''' (A Record: Maltese Infirmities; 1763–87)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 161; NLM, MS. 36#1.&lt;/ref&gt; – An interesting document in which Demarco progressively recorded his thoughts and reflections. The manuscript, which is composed of 296 folios, is reserved for observations concerning infirmities of the body and also of the soul. Some entries are of philosophical interest. The document opens with a Latin preface, and closes with a Latin epilogue and, finally, 50 aphorisms.
* '''''Physiologie Cursus: Anatomico – meccanico – experimentalis''''' (A Course in Physiology: Anatomical – mechanical – experimental; 1765)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 99; NLM, MS. 39#3.&lt;/ref&gt; – A study in Latin which deals with various aspects of physiology. Though the mechanistic concept of the body and of creation is accepted as basic, Demarco produces some objections and discussions for the acknowledgement of its absolute validity.
* '''''Patologicus Brevis Cursus''''' (A Short Course in Pathology; 1774)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 82; NLM, MS. 37#2.&lt;/ref&gt; – A work in Latin which goes into the nature of mental illnesses. The content is divided in 222 parts.

===Philosophical physiology===
* '''''Tractatus de Rabie''''' (A Treatise concerning [[Rabies]]; ''c.'' 1742)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 131; NLM, MS. 1345#4.&lt;/ref&gt; – This Latin composition is made up of only 23 folios. The content, which does not include any internal divisions, was the work of a young Demarco probably before studying in [[France]]. It largely focuses on the nature of anger, especially from a physiological point of view. Nevertheless, Demarco also sees it fit to touch upon some philosophical themes here and then.
* '''''Tractatus de Affectione''''' (A Treatise on the Passions; 1764)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 8; NLM, MS. 36#7.&lt;/ref&gt; – The main theme of this manuscript in Latin is the passions which overcome humans when their freedom of will becomes wanting. The work, which is made up of 76 folios, is divided in subtitles. At the end it includes an index of contents.

===Science===
* '''''Trattato della Trigonometria Piana''''' (A Treatise concerning Standard [[Trigonometry]]; 1742)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 228; NLM, MS. 568&lt;/ref&gt; – The work bears the subtitle: ''Con un breve saggio della Geometria Practica'' (With a brief study concerning Practical Geometry). The manuscript is made up of 212 folios, and written in Italian. The content is divided in Explications, Definitions (meaning concepts), and Propositions (including examples). The work is basically about flat triangles as distinguishable from spherical triangles.
* '''''Vulgaris Arithmeticæ Elementaris Theoria''''' (A Common Theory of Elementary Arithmetic; ''c.'' 1742)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 29; NLM, MS. 1345#5&lt;/ref&gt; – This manuscript in Latin is made up of 58 folios, and divided into subtitles. Demarco focuses respectively on algebra, numerics, addition, and other arithmetic functions. An effort seems to have been made to make such an abstract subject understandable by non-professionals.
* '''''Traité de Physique''''' (A Treatise concerning the Human Body; 1745)&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. II, p. 97; NLM, MS. 36#6.&lt;/ref&gt; – Notes in French of a course given by Demarco at the [[University of Montpellier]] while terminating his studies there. The content is divided in Subtitles and Sections. Of course, it deals with various aspects of the physical constitution of human beings.

==Appreciation==
Joseph Demarco has rarely been considered holistically. Medical academics have concentrated on some of his works which deal with health issues, philosophers have focused on works which have philosophical significance, and classicists have directed their attention to one or two of his works which offer interesting Latin features. Notwithstanding, no comprehensive and wide-ranging study of the man, his times and his accomplishments has ever been made. This is direly wanting.

As seen above, the larger part of Demarco's works are still in manuscript form, and this makes them impossible to be studied. Though the outlines of some of his work are generally identified and acknowledged, the greater number of his compositions remain unfamiliar and shrouded in obscurity.

With regard to philosophy in particular, a systematic and critical study of Demarco is still to be done. In general, it cannot be said that his philosophy is known at all, not even in general. This must necessarily entail arduous of transliteration and translation which might well be daunting. Nevertheless, it seems that Demarco certainly merits such attention and consideration.

In [[philosophy]] and [[media studies]], a '''knowledge space''' is described as an emerging anthropological space in which the knowledge of individuals becomes the primary focus for social structure, values, and beliefs. The concept is put forward and explored by philosopher and media critic [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] in his 1997 book ''Collective Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Levy, ''Collective Intelligence'', trans. Robert Bononno, Perseus Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropological Space ==
Levy's notion of the "knowledge space" relies on his conception of anthropological spaces, which he defines as "a system of proximity (space) unique to the world of humanity (anthropological), and thus dependent on human technologies, significations, language, culture, conventions, representations, and emotions" (5). Building on the language of the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], he states that "anthropological spaces in themselves are neither infrastructures nor superstructures but planes of existence, frequencies, velocities, determined within the social spectrum" (147). Each space contains "worlds of signification" (149) by which humans come to understand and make sense of the world. Furthermore, although one space may dominate, many spaces can and do exist simultaneously.

Levy describes three existing anthropological spaces. They are:
# ''Earth'' - This space corresponds with hunter-gatherer eras in which people identify themselves by familial relationships, derive meaning via intimate connection with the signifier, and where conceptions of time are driven by reminiscence. Passed down narratives become the guiding instruments that exist within the body of the community.
# ''Territorial'' - This space corresponds to the rise of civilizations and the insistent division of things and signs. Within this space history becomes closed and authoritative.  Within territorial space people identify themselves by property ownership and nationality and look to religion for guidance, with the book become the substrate of choice.
# ''Commodity'' - This space corresponds to the rise of industrial revolution and world-markets in which people begin to identify themselves through one's career and wealth. In this space, meaning becomes illusory, our sense of time becomes abstract and uniform (through the use of clocks) while our sense of space becomes configured into a network. Statistics and probability become guiding concepts and indexes and networks of information becomes the substrate through which knowledge is passed on. (175,210)

==The emerging knowledge space==
The knowledge space is an emerging anthropological space which, while it has always existed (139), is only now coming into fruition as a guiding space of humanity. In this space, singularities (individuals) are recognized as singularities and knowledge becomes the guiding value for humanity. Since all human experience represents unique knowledge, within the knowledge space all individuals are valued for their unique knowledge regardless of race (earth space), nationality (territorial space), or economic status (commodity space). Within this space static identity gives way to the "quantum identities" as individuals become participates and the distinction between of "us" and "them" disappears (159). Instead, humanity forms "collective intelligences" in which knowledge is valued and freely traded. What is "real" becomes "that which implies the practical activity, intellectual and imaginary, of living subjects" (168). Life, experiences, and knowledge become the underlying and ever changing guiding path for human societies.

== Relation to Technology ==
Levy's theories rely heavily on the technological developments of the 1990s, particularly the rise of biotechnology, nanotechnology, the Internet, new media and information technologies. In chapter 3, he describes how technologies have made a shift from the molar to the molecular (a move which makes literal a distinction by Delueze and Guattari) in that technologies now handle units as individuals (his term is "singularities") rather than in mass. He suggests that this mirrors our rising recognition of the individuals as singularities rather than massive conglomerated groups.

'''Lev Isaakovich Shestov''' ({{lang-ru|Лев Исаа́кович Шесто́в}}, 1866 – 1938), born '''Yeguda Leib Shvartsman''' ({{lang-ru|Иегуда Лейб Шварцман}}), was a Russian [[existentialist]] philosopher, known for his "philosophy of despair". Born in [[Kiev|Kyiv]] ([[Russian Empire]]) on {{OldStyleDate|February 12|1866|January 31}}, he emigrated to France in 1921, fleeing from the aftermath of the [[October Revolution]]. He lived in Paris until his death on November 19, 1938.

== Life ==
Shestov was born Lev Isaakovich Schwarzmann in [[Kiev]] into a [[Jewish]] family. He obtained an education at various places, due to fractious clashes with authority. He went on to study [[law]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[Moscow State University]] but after a clash with the Inspector of Students he was told to return to Kiev, where he completed his studies.

Shestov's dissertation prevented him from becoming a doctor of law, as it was dismissed on account of its revolutionary tendencies. In 1898 he entered a circle of prominent Russian intellectuals and artists which included [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Diaghilev]], [[Dmitri Merezhkovsky]] and [[Vasily Rozanov]]. Shestov contributed articles to a journal the circle had established. During this time he completed his first major philosophical work, ''Good in the Teaching of [[Tolstoy]] and Nietzsche: Philosophy and Preaching''; two authors profoundly impacting Shestov's thought.

He developed his thinking in a second book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Frederich Nietzsche]], which increased Shestov's reputation as an original and incisive thinker. In ''All Things Are Possible'' (published in 1905) Shestov adopted the [[aphorism|aphoristic]] style of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to investigate the difference between Russian and European Literature. Although on the surface it is an exploration of numerous intellectual topics, at its base it is a sardonic work of Existentialist philosophy which both criticizes and satirizes our fundamental attitudes towards life situations. [[D.H. Lawrence]], who wrote the Foreword to S.S. Koteliansky's literary translation of the work,&lt;ref&gt;'All Things Are Possible', Koteliansky Translation (1920 / Secker, London).&lt;/ref&gt; summarized Shestov's philosophy with the words: " 'Everything is possible' - this is his really central cry. It is not nihilism. It is only a shaking free of the human psyche from old bonds. The positive central idea is that the human psyche, or soul, really believes in itself, and in nothing else".&lt;ref&gt;'Foreword' to 'All Things Are Possible' by D.H.Lawrence (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; Shestov deals with key issues such as religion, rationalism, and science in this highly approachable work, topics he would also examine in later writings such as ''In Job's Balances''.&lt;ref&gt;'Introduction' to 'All Things Are Possible' by [[Edouard d'Araille|Prof. Edouard d'Araille]] (2001/LTP Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; Shestov's own key quote from this work is probably the following: "...we need to think that only one assertion has or can have any objective reality: that nothing on earth is impossible. Every time someone wants to force us to admit that there are other, more limited and limiting truths, we must resist with every means we can lay hands on".

Shestov's works were not met with approval even by some of his closest Russian friends. Many saw in Shestov's work a renunciation of [[reason]] and [[metaphysics]], and even an espousal of [[nihilism]]. Nevertheless, he would find admirers in such writers as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and his friend [[Georges Bataille]].

In 1908 Shestov moved to [[Freiburg]], Germany, and he stayed there until 1910, when he moved to a small Swiss village named [[Coppet]]. During this time the author worked prolifically. One of the fruits of these labours was the publication of ''Great Vigils'' and ''Penultimate Words''. He returned to Moscow in 1915, and in this year his son Sergei died in combat against the Germans. During the Moscow period, his work became more influenced by matters of religion and [[theology]]. The seizure of government by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917&amp;nbsp;made life difficult for Shestov, and the Marxists pressured him to write a defence of Marxist doctrine as an introduction to his new work, ''Potestas Clavium''; otherwise it would not be published. Shestov refused this, yet with the permission of the authorities he lectured at the University of Kiev on [[Greek philosophy]].

Shestov's dislike of the Soviet regime led him to undertake a long journey out of Russia, and he eventually ended up in France. The author was a popular figure in France, where his originality was quickly recognized. In Paris, he soon befriended, and much influenced, the young [[Georges Bataille]]. That this Russian was newly appreciated is attested by his having been asked to contribute to a prestigious French [[philosophy]] journal. In the interwar years, Shestov continued to develop into a thinker of great prominence. During this time he had become totally immersed in the study of such great theologians as [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Plotinus]], whilst at the same time lecturing at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1925. In 1926 he was introduced to [[Edmund Husserl]], with whom he maintained a cordial relationship despite radical differences in their philosophical outlook. In 1929, during a return to [[Freiburg]] he met with [[Edmund Husserl]], and was urged to study Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Milosz, [http://shestov.phonoarchive.org/milosz.html "Shestov, or the Purity of Despair"], ''Emperor of the Earth'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1977), pp. 91–119&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of Kierkegaard prompted Shestov to realise that his philosophy shared great similarities, such as his rejection of [[idealism]], and his belief that man can gain ultimate knowledge through ungrounded [[Subjectivity|subjective]] thought rather than [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] reason and [[Verificationism|verifiability]]. However, Shestov maintained that Kierkegaard did not pursue this line of thought far enough, and continued where he thought the Dane left off. The results of this tendency are seen in his work ''Kierkegaard and Existential Philosophy: Vox Clamantis in Deserto'', published in 1936, a fundamental work of [[Christian existentialism]].

Despite his weakening condition Shestov continued to write at a quick pace, and finally completed his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Athens and Jerusalem]]''. This work examines the dichotomy between freedom and [[reason]], and argues that reason be rejected in the discipline of [[philosophy]]. Furthermore, it adumbrates the means by which the [[scientific method]] has made philosophy and science irreconcilable, since science concerns itself with [[empirical]] observation, whereas (so Shestov argues) philosophy must be concerned with [[Freedom of will|freedom]], [[God]] and [[immortality]], issues that cannot be solved by science.

In 1938, Shestov contracted a serious illness whilst at his vacation home. During this final period, he continued his studies, concentrating in particular on [[Indian philosophy]] as well as the works of his contemporary [[Edmund Husserl]], who had died recently. Shestov himself died at a clinic in Paris.

== Philosophy ==

=== The philosophy of despair ===
[[File:Shestov Lev.jpg|thumb|right|Lev Shestov]]
Shestov's philosophy is, at first sight, not a philosophy at all: it offers no systematic unity, no coherent set of propositions, no theoretical explanation of philosophical problems. Most of Shestov's work is fragmentary. With regard to the form (he often used aphorisms) the style may be deemed more web-like than linear, and more explosive than argumentative. The author seems to contradict himself on every page, and even seeks out paradoxes. This is because he believes that life itself is, in the last analysis, deeply paradoxical, and not comprehensible through logical or rational inquiry. Shestov maintains that no theory can solve the mysteries of life. Fundamentally, his philosophy is not 'problem-solving', but problem-generating, with a pronounced emphasis on life's enigmatic qualities.
 
His point of departure is not a theory, or an idea, but an experience, the experience of despair, which Shestov describes as the loss of certainties, the loss of freedom, the loss of the [[meaning of life]]. The root of this despair is what he frequently calls 'Necessity', but also 'Reason', 'Idealism' or 'Fate': a certain way of thinking (but at the same time also a very real aspect of the world) that subordinates life to ideas, [[abstraction]]s, generalisations and thereby kills it, through an ignoring of the uniqueness and livingness of reality.

'Reason' is the obedience to and the acceptance of Certainties that tell us that certain things are eternal and unchangeable and other things are impossible and can never be attained. This accounts for Shestov's philosophy being a form of [[irrationalist|irrationalism]], though it is important to note that the thinker does not oppose reason, or science in general, but only rationalism and scientism: the tendency to consider reason as a sort of omniscient, omnipotent God that is good for its own sake. It may also be considered a form of personalism: people cannot be reduced to ideas, social structures, or mystical oneness. Shestov rejects any mention of "omnitudes", "collective", "all-unity." As he explains in his masterpiece ''Athens and Jerusalem'':

''"But why attribute to God, the God whom neither time nor space limits, the same respect and love for order? Why forever speak of "total unity"? If God loves men, what need has He to subordinate men to His divine will and to deprive them of their own will, the most precious of the things He has bestowed upon them? There is no need at all. Consequently, the idea of total unity is an absolutely false idea....It is not forbidden for reason to speak of unity and even of unities, but it must renounce total unity - and other things besides. And what a sigh of relief men will breathe when they suddenly discover that the living God, the true God, in no way resembles Him whom reason has shown them until now!"''

Through this attack on the "self-evident", Shestov implies that we are all seemingly alone with our suffering, and can be helped neither by others, nor by philosophy. This explains his lack of a systematic philosophical framework.

=== Penultimate words: surrender versus struggle ===
But despair is not the last word, it is only the 'penultimate word'. The last word cannot be said in human language, can't be captured in theory. His philosophy begins with despair, his whole thinking ''is'' desperate, but Shestov tries to point to something ''beyond'' despair - and beyond philosophy.

This is what he calls 'faith': not a belief, not a certainty, but another way of thinking that arises in the midst of the deepest doubt and insecurity. It is the experience that "everything is possible" (Dostoevsky), that the opposite of Necessity is not chance or accident, but possibility, that there does exist a god-given freedom without boundaries, without walls or borders. Shestov maintains that we should continue to struggle, to fight against Fate and Necessity, even when a successful outcome is not guaranteed. Exactly at the moment that all the oracles remain silent, we should give ourselves over to God, who alone can comfort the sick and suffering soul. In some of his most famous words he explains:

''"Faith, only the faith that looks to the Creator and that He inspires, radiates from itself the supreme and decisive truths condemning what is and what is not. Reality is transfigured. The heavens glorify the Lord. The prophets and apostles cry in ecstasy, "O death, where is thy sting? Hell, where is thy victory?" And all announce: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him."'' (Quoting [[1 Corinthians]] 15:55, 2:9)

Furthermore, although a [[Jewish existentialism|Jewish philosopher]], Shestov saw in the [[resurrection of Christ]] this victory over necessity. He described the incarnation and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as a transfiguring spectacle by which it is demonstrated that the purpose of life is not "mystical" surrender to the "absolute", but ascetical struggle:

''"Cur Deus homo? Why, to what purpose, did He become man, expose himself to injurious mistreatment, ignominious and painful death on the cross? Was it not in order to show man, through His example, that no decision is too hard, that it is worth while bearing anything in order not to remain in the womb of the One? That any torture whatever to the living being is better than the 'bliss' of the rest-satiate 'ideal' being?"''

Likewise, the final words of his last and greatest work, ''Athens and Jerusalem'', are: ''"Philosophy is not Besinnen [think over] but struggle. And this struggle has no end and will have no end. The kingdom of God, as it is written, is attained through violence."'' (cf [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:12)

=== Influence ===

| source = [[Isaiah Berlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramin Jahanbegloo, ''Conversations with Isaiah Berlin'' (London 2000), pp. 201–2&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Shestov was highly admired and honored by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] and [[Sergei Bulgakov]] in Russia, [[Jules de Gaultier]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Paul Celan]] and [[Albert Camus]] in France, and [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[John Middleton Murry]] in England. Among Jewish thinkers, he influenced [[Hillel Zeitlin]].

Today, Shestov is little known in the English-speaking world. This is partly because his works have not been readily available. Partly the specific themes he discusses are unfashionable and "foreign". A sombre and yet ecstatic atmosphere permeates his writings. And his quasi-nihilistic position and religious outlook are an unsettling and incongruous combination, at first sight.

He did however influence writers such as Albert Camus (who wrote about him in ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), [[Benjamin Fondane]] (his 'pupil'), the poet [[Paul Celan]], and notably [[Emil Cioran]], who writes about Shestov:

:''"He was the philosopher of my generation, which didn't succeed in realizing itself spiritually, but remained nostalgic about such a realization. Shestov [...] has played an important role in my life. [...] He thought rightly that the true problems escape the philosophers. What else do they do but obscuring the real torments of life?"'' (Emil Cioran: ''Oeuvres'', Gallimard, Paris 1995, p. 1740, my translation.)

Shestov also appears in the work of [[Gilles Deleuze]]; he is referred to sporadically in ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'' and also appears in ''[[Difference and Repetition]]''.

More recently, alongside Dostoyevsky's philosophy, many have found solace in Shestov's battle against the rational self-consistent and self-evident; for example Bernard Martin of Case Western Reserve University, who translated his works now found online [external link below]; and the scholar Liza Knapp,&lt;ref&gt;Liza Knapp, [https://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/DS/06/143.shtml "The Force of Inertia in Dostoevsky's 'Krotkaja'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101135147/http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/DS/06/143.shtml |date=2013-11-01 }}, ''Dostoevsky Studies'', Vol. 6 (1985), pp. 144–57&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''The Annihilation of Inertia: Dostoevsky and Metaphysics''. This book was an evaluation of Dostoyevsky's struggle against the self-evident "wall", and refers to Shestov on several occasions.

According to Michael Richardson's research on [[Georges Bataille]], Shestov was an early influence on Bataille and was responsible for exposing him to Nietzsche. He argues that Shestov's radical views on theology and an interest in extreme human behavior probably coloured Bataille's own thoughts.

{{Compact ToC |seealso=yes|refs=yes}}

==A==
*[[Gordon W. Allport]]: author of ''The Individual and his Religion'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]] pp. 189, 202, 335&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nathan Aviezer ]]

==B==
*[[Ian Barbour]]: author of ''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Peacocke]], ''Science and the Christian Experiment'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1971, in the preface (p.vii) writes "These [issues] have been most magisterially surveyed by [[Ian Barbour|I. G. Barour]] in his ''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'' (London, 1966) and I willingly refer the reader to that work for a systematic and documented account."&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arnold O. Benz]]: astrophysicist at [[ETH Zurich]], author of ''The Future of the Universe'' (2002) and ''Astrophysics and Creation'' (2017)
*[[Mani Lal Bhaumik]]: author of ''Code Name God'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.codenamegod.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nader El-Bizri]]: author of ''The Phenomenological Quest between [[Avicenna]] and [[Heidegger]]'', general editor of the series ''Epistles of the [[Brethren of Purity]]'' (tenth century encyclopaedia of science, philosophy and religion), co-Editor of ''[[Islamic Philosophy]] and Occidental [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] in Dialogue'', and editor of the "Islam Division" of ''Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Religions''.
*[[Herman Branover]]
*[[John Hedley Brooke]]: Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and Religion at the [[University of Oxford]] (1999–2006)
*[[Ralph Wendell Burhoe]]: an important twentieth century pioneer interpreter of the importance of religion for a scientific and technological world.
*[[Edwin Arthur Burtt|E. A. Burtt]]: author of ''The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Issues in Science and Religion]] pp. 34, 36, 51, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==C==
*[[Fritjof Capra]]: author of ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975).
*[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]: author of ''Science and Christ'' (1965, English Translation).
*[[Francis Collins|Francis S. Collins]]: director of the Human Genome Project, author of ''[[The Language of God]]'' (2006).
*[[Charles Coulson|C. A. Coulson]]: author of ''Science and Christian Belief'' (1955).&lt;ref name=SnR&gt;[[Ian Barbour]] in ''Science and Religion: New Perspectives on the Dialogue'' (1968) (p.xi) writes &lt;blockquote&gt; "The problem of Part Two is the relation between religion and ''the methods of science.'' Is the scientific method the only path to knowledge? Are theology and science similar enterprises (as Coulson and Schilling argue) or are they radically different (as Evans suggests)? Such questions about the relation of religion to science as a way of knowing are more basic than problems arising from particular scientific theories. Many persons today find that their religious beliefs are challenged not by any specific scientific discoveries but by the conviction that assertions in science can be proven while those in religion cannot. Science has been one of the influences on the "death of God" movement, as Ferre's essay indicates. Both Ferre and Evans provide careful philosophical analyses of the problem of verifying or evaluating theological statements. The central issue of Part Two, then, is the status of religious beliefs in an age of science. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

*"Differences between Scientific and Religious Asseritions, [[Donald D. Evans]], pages 101-133
*"Science and the Death of 'God'", [[Frederick Ferre]], pages 134-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Adrian (2006). "Not a Gap in Sight: Fifty Years of Charles Coulson's Science and Christian Belief". [http://www.spck.org.uk/cat/theology.php Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622094920/http://www.spck.org.uk/cat/theology.php |date=2008-06-22 }} Volume 109: pp.21-27. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"With suitable changes of language and illustration, Coulson's Science and Christian Belief could be rewritten for the present day without having to remove any of his fundamental arguments. Indeed, his observation that the rise of science has led to a loss of tradition throughout the world is a view which is now held very widely as well as being a noted cause for concern."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]]: author of ''Augustine to Galileo: The History of Science A.D. 400 - 1650''.

*[[Pierre Duhem]]: well known for his works on the philosophy and history of science, especially in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;"Pierre Duhem, himself a distinguished physicist, initiated in heroic fashion, almost singlehandedly, the modern study of the history of medieval science by the simple but effective expedient of reading and analyzing as many medieval scientific manuscripts as possible." — Palter, Robert M. (1961). [https://archive.org/stream/towardmodernscie001652mbp#page/n3/mode/2up Preface to ''Toward Modern Science''], Vol. I. New York: The Noonday Press, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Harold K. Schilling]]: author of ''Science and Religion'' (1962).&lt;ref name=SnR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Barbour]], ''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'' (1966), p. 152 writes "The scientific community, like any group in society, has a set of attitudes which are influenced by but not identical with those of the culture at large. Schilling ["A Human Enterprise" Science, June 6, 1958, Vol. 127, p.1324] gives a vivid portrayal: &lt;blockquote&gt;
It has its own ideals and characteristic way of life; its own standards, mores, conventions, signs and symbols, language and jargon, professional ethics, sanctions and controls, authority, institutions and organizations, publications; its own creeds and beliefs, orthodoxies and heresies--and effective ways of dealing with the latter. This community is affected, as are other communities, by the usual vagaries, adequacies, and shortcomings of human beings. It has its politics, its pulling and hauling, its pressure groups; its differing schools of thought, its divisions and schisms; its personal loyalties and animosities, jealousies, hatreds, and rallying cries; its fads and fashions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary B. Hesse]] reviews his book ''Science and Religion: An Interpretation of Two Communities'' in Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Volume 3, Issue 1, (Autumn, 1963), page 112-113, where she writes &lt;blockquote&gt;"There remain however persistent, half-conscious, impressions among the religious that science is somehow a danger to true spirituality, and among the non-religious that science has once and for all refuted the claims of religion. Professor Schilling's book has the important merit of taking seriously the intellectual and social aspects of these half-conscious impressions, and of showing how mis- taken is the belief that science and religion can go their separate ways in utter disregard of each other. ...reading this book no one ought to doubt that the stereotypes described at the outset are not merely caricatures, but serious distortions. But still the synthetic view which is surely the aim of the book somehow fails to come across with the requisite punch. Is this because yet deeper issues remain to be discussed? Can the claim of Christianity to be based on experience in a way parallel to science really be sustained? And if not, then what is its relation to expe- rience? And what about the vexed question of religious language?" &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret MacDonald''' (9 April 1907 – 7 January 1956) was a British analytic [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grayling|first=Anthony C.|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754694}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in the areas of philosophy of language, political philosophy and aesthetics.

==Life and Education==
Margaret MacDonald was born in London and abandoned as a child. She was educated at [[Birkbeck College, London]] and was awarded a first class degree in philosophy in 1932, followed by a PhD in 1934. Her PhD supervisor was [[Susan Stebbing]] and she provided MacDonald with financial assistance during her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Addis|first=Mark|editor=Brown, Stuart|chapter=MacDonald, Margaret (1907-56)|title=The Dictionary of Twentieth-century British Philosophers|year=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|location=Bristol|isbn=184371096X|pages=601–605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald joined [[Girton College, Cambridge]], as a Pfeiffer Research Fellow in Moral Sciences between 1934–37. While at Cambridge, she studied under [[G.E. Moore]] and was part of the inner circle of students that  [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] taught.&lt;ref name="Waite1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waite|first=Mary Ellen|title=History of women philosophers, vol. 4|year=1995|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=0792328086|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fellow student [[Alice Ambrose]] she secretly (since he did not allow this) made notes during Wittgenstein's lectures, which were later published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Alice|title=Wittgenstein's lectures : Cambridge, 1932-1935; from the notes of Alice Ambrose and Margaret Macdonald|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631101411}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later convinced Wittgenstein to allow them continue to write his lectures down.

From 1937–41 MacDonald taught philosophy at [[St Hilda's, Oxford]], where she was also librarian.  During the war she was temporary principal in the Board of Trade. This was followed by a lectureship at [[Bedford College, London]].&lt;ref name="Waite1995" /&gt; At this time, she was one of a very small number of women teaching philosophy outside of Oxford University. From 1947 she was also a lecturer on Ethics to staff at the Home Office. She became reader in philosophy at Bedford College in 1955.

MacDonald's early articles were criticisms of the work of contemporary philosophers, however she later concentrated on aesthetics, particularly how language relates to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Margaret|editor=Elton, William|chapter=Some Distinctive Features of Arguments used in Criticism of the Arts|title=Aesthetics and language|date=1954|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also interested in political philosophy and published a significant article 'Natural Rights'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Margaret|title=Natural Rights|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|year=1946|volume=47|pages=225–250|jstor=4544427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper she argues against the idea that natural rights are founded on the natural law. Her view is summarised by Jonathan Wolf as: "...statements of natural rights are akin to decisions, declaring ‘here I stand’, and...uses an analogy with another area of critical judgement—in her case literary appreciation—to point out the possibility of rational argument through the presentation of reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Jonathan|editor1-last=Beaney|editor1-first=Michael|chapter=Analytic Political Philosophy|title=Oxford Handbook of The History of Analytic Philosophy|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199238842|page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work attracted substantial attention at the time. Two of her articles were reprinted in the Logic and Language (1951) series which included articles that were representative of current philosophical trends.

MacDonald helped to found the philosophy journal ''[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]'' together with [[Susan Stebbing]], [[C.A. Mace]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]] in 1933. She was also the journal's editor from 1948 until 1956.

She died in London in 1956, following heart surgery, aged just 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saw|first=Ruth|title=Dr Margaret MacDonald|journal=Analysis|year=1956|volume=16|issue=4|pages=73–74|doi=10.1093/analys/16.4.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|noerror}}'''''Marialis Cultus''''' (English: ''Marian Devotion'') is the title of a [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] [[Apostolic exhortation|Apostolic Exhortation]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] issued on February 2, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19740202_marialis-cultus_en.html Pope Paul VI's Apostolic Letter Marialis Cultus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stravinskas, 2002, ''Catholic Dictionary'', OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-390-2}} pages 370-371&lt;/ref&gt;  It is subtitled: "''For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary''", and focuses Marian devotions, clarifiying the way in which the Roman Catholic Church celebrates and commemorates [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary, the mother of Jesus]].  The preparation of the document reportedly took 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/documents/MC.html History of Marialis Cultus at University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhortation has three parts:

:*Part 1 discusses the history of Catholicism's Marian devotions, as well as their rationale.
:*Part 2 focuses on what should/will take place in the Church's Marian devotions in the future
:*Part 3 touches on the [[Angelus]] and the [[Rosary]] prayers.

''Marialis Cultus'' gives guidelines for devotions to Mary by the Church – that is, it attempts to make sure that all Marian liturgical celebrations and public expressions of devotion align with established doctrine. It noted that every element of the church’s prayer life, including Marian devotions, should draw its inspiration from the Bible and harmonize with the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiccourier.com/commentary/father-mcbrien/renewal-of-authentic-marian-piety-needed/ McBrien, "Renewal of authentic Marian piety needed", ''Catholic Courier'', Diocese of Rochester, New York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083943/http://www.catholiccourier.com/commentary/father-mcbrien/renewal-of-authentic-marian-piety-needed/ |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusion to the document emphasizes the theological and pastoral value of devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].

'''Merab Mamardashvili''' ({{lang-ka|მერაბ მამარდაშვილი}}, {{lang-ru|Мера́б Константи́нович Мамардашви́ли}}; September 15, 1930 – November 25, 1990) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], Doctor of Sciences (1968), professor (1972). He was born in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] (Eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). In 1955 he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[Moscow State University]]. From 1968 to 1987 he was a deputy editor of the scientific journal "Voprosi Filosofii" ("Questions of Philosophy"). He became a professor of the Moscow State University and a senior research fellow of the [[Moscow]] Institute of Philosophy of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. From 1987-1990 Mamardashvili was head of the Department of the [[Akaki Tsereteli|Tsereteli]] Institute of Philosophy of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] and Professor of the [[Tbilisi State University]].

In his life only a few books were published, his lectures (for his style of lecturing he and others called them "conversations" or "dialogues" and he was called "Russian (or Georgian) [[Socrates]]") were taped and published after his death by his disciple Yuri Senokosov. Lecturing abroad, Mamardashvili gave talks in [[Germany]], [[France]], and other countries. He died from a heart attack at Moscow [[Vnukovo airport]] on November 25, 1990 and was buried in [[Tbilisi]] in a family grave on the Saburtalo cemetery.

Influenced by [[René Descartes]] and classical [[German philosophy]] (especially [[Immanuel Kant]]), Mamardashvili contributed to [[rationalism|rationalist]] theory of perception.
His main research fields were: general [[gnosology|gnoseological]] notion of processes of analysis and synthesis, the [[methodology]] of science and of the historic-philosophical studies, the role of consciousness in social being, the relationship between consciousness and the aesthetics, the overall meta-theory of language and consciousness. He considered the consciousness the ultimate subject of philosophy. Some of the most famous phrases, coined by Mamardashvili are: "consciousness is paradoxicalness impossible to get used to" &lt;ref&gt; https://web.archive.org/web/20130328102318/http://philosophy.ru/library/mmk/paradox.html &lt;/ref&gt;, "consciousness is an experience of inexperiensible experiences", "phenomenology is the accompanying feature of all the philosophy", "loneliness is my profession" and so on.

In the preview to the edition of the major compilation of his works by St. Petersburg publishing house "Azbooka-classica" in 2002 he has been introduced "one of the most interesting contemporary philosophers, a man of impeccable style, magical fascination and rare kindness". It was also noted there, that all of his interests were concentrated around the human [[personality]], its [[freedom]] and [[duty|responsibility]], on the role of philosophy in life and its place in the culture.

In May 2001 a monument to him was unveiled in [[Tbilisi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">{{short description|philosophical concept related to empathy and sympathy}}
'''Mimpathy''' ({{lang-de|Nachfühlen}}, literally "after experience") is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept related to [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]. In [[Dagobert D. Runes]]' 1942 ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', contributor Herman Hausheer defines mimpathy as the sharing of another's feelings on a matter, without necessarily experiencing feelings of sympathy.&lt;ref name="runes"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Max Scheler]] describes mimpathy, or "[[emotion]]al imitation", as the basis for sympathy, but of no help in understanding another person in and of itself. Scheler identifies four types of sympathy:
#''Compathy'', or emotional solidarity, the immediate sharing of the same emotion with another
#Genuine ''sympathy'', in which sorrow is experienced "in an act of understanding experienced as such an act", and the objective source of emotion is not shared
#''Transpathy'', or [[emotional contagion]], a state introduced in a group, "automatic and without understanding", by the emotional display of another
#''Unipathy'', or genuine emotional identification with another, an "intensified" and "involuntary" form of transpathy, which may present as a ''[[folie à deux]]''.&lt;ref name="olinick"/&gt;

Academic Karen E. Smythe, in analyzing the fiction of [[Mavis Gallant]], described mimpathy as a combination of [[mimesis]] and [[empathy]], an acting out of "self-dramas" as a means of interpreting the suffering of literary characters.&lt;ref name="smythe"/&gt;

The Hebrew phrase '''''mitzvah goreret mitzvah, averah goreret averah''''' (Hebrew: מצווה גוררת מצווה; עברה גוררת עברה.) "one good deed will bring another good deed, one transgression will bring another transgression," (''[[Pirkei Avot|Sayings of the Fathers]]'' 4:2) expresses the belief in [[Judaism]] that following one [[mitzvah|commandment]] leads to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJbiDdCkqlIC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=%22Mitzvah+goreret+mitzvah%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X7ASTP-FH8WqlAewmIyICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mitzvah%20goreret%20mitzvah%22&amp;f=false |title=Raising a mensch - Shelley Kapnek Rosenberg - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rME9oA4ixUEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA68&amp;dq=%22Mitzvah+goreret+mitzvah%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X7ASTP-FH8WqlAewmIyICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mitzvah%20goreret%20mitzvah%22&amp;f=false |title=Teaching Jewish Virtues: Sacred ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saying is found in the [[mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenberg |first=Zushe |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/519136/jewish/The-Tefillin-That-Helped-Cope-With-Life-and-With-Death.htm |title=The Tefillin That Helped Cope With Life and With Death - Stories |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' 4:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybB7OMk3nnwC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Mitzvah+goreret+mitzvah%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X7ASTP-FH8WqlAewmIyICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mitzvah%20goreret%20mitzvah%22&amp;f=false |title=Striving toward virtue: a ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which such an effect can take place. One can be as a result of inspiration, in which the act of a mitzvah is witnessed by others, who in turn, follow in their footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tP-tMShhzlwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Mitzvah+goreret+mitzvah%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X7ASTP-FH8WqlAewmIyICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mitzvah%20goreret%20mitzvah%22&amp;f=false |title=Succeeding at Jewish education: how ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is by [[habit (psychology)|habit]], in which a person becomes accustomed to performing a mitzvah regularly.&lt;ref&gt;''Living courageously'' By Samuel Chiel, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast to this belief is called ''aveira goreret aveira'' in which the commission of an ''[[aveira]]'' (sin) leads to another sin.

The phrase has often been used in songs for children to encourage the performance of good works.  One popular song, written by Andy Vogel in 1986, was recorded on the Reform Jewish movement's "NFTY at 50" album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YPF2EW/ref=dm_ws_sp_tlw_trk1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407362167&amp;sr=1-42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely sung in the Reform Jewish movement.

==Examples==
* A person places money in a pushka ([[tzedaka]] collection box). This is seen by others, who in turn are inspired to place money in the box.
* A person helps someone in need, and feels good about themself and therefore continues to do help others.

{{Wiktionary|moral turpitude}}
'''Moral turpitude''' is a legal concept in the [[United States]] and some other countries that refers to "an act or behavior that gravely violates the sentiment or accepted standard of the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/legal/moral%20turpitude|title=Law Dictionary: moral turpitude|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Merriam-Webster]]|publisher=|access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term appears in [[immigration to the United States|U.S. immigration law]] beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="usvisa"&gt;[http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article13.htm A Crime Involving Moral Turpitude! What in the World is That?] US immigration and visa lawyers in London&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "moral turpitude" might escape precise definition, but it has been described as an "act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/49/103.html Chadwick v. State Bar, 49 Cal. 3d 103, 110, 776 P.2d 240, 260 Cal.Rptr. 538 (1989)] ; [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/420/1338/539005/ Sosa-Martinez v. United States AG, 420 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir. 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of a crime or other conduct as constituting moral turpitude has significance in several areas of law. First, prior conviction of a crime of moral turpitude (or in some jurisdictions, "moral turpitude conduct", even without a conviction) is considered to have a bearing on the honesty of a witness and might be used for purposes of the [[witness impeachment|impeachment of witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/people-v-wheeler-11 People v. Wheeler, 4 Cal.4th 284, 295-296, 841 P.2d 938, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, offenses involving moral turpitude may be grounds to deny or revoke state professional licenses such as teaching credentials,&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/320/f3d/1119/ballard-v-independent-school-district-no-of-bryan-county-al-we Ballard v. Independent School Dist., 320 F.3d 1119 (10th Cir. 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; licenses to practice law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/49/103.html Chadwick v. State Bar, 49 Cal.3d 103, 776 P.2d 240, 260 Cal.Rptr. 538 (1989)]&lt;/ref&gt; or other licensed profession. Third, this concept is of great importance for [[immigration]] purposes in the United States, [[Canada]] (prior to 1976), and some other countries, since offenses which are defined as involving moral turpitude are considered bars to immigration into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)] ;  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/316.10 8 CFR 316.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American immigration law==
A conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) causes a person to be inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(2)(a)(i) of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act). There are petty offense exceptions to this rule, but these exceptions do not change the meaning of the question on the [[Visa Waiver Program]] or on the visa application form, and cannot be self-certified. A controlled substance violation causes the alien to be inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(2)(i)(II) of the INA. They are two different sections of the law. A controlled substance violation is a CIMT. The immigration administrative proceeding does not use a controlled substance violation as a CIMT. A visa waiver program applicant admissibility is determined at the port of entry and they are subject to section 212(a) and 217 of the INA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/ineligibilities.html Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915114143/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/ineligibilities.html |date=2017-09-15 }} Section 212(a) and 217 of the INA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visa Waiver Program===
The second question on document I-94W for those visiting the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program asks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have you ever been arrested or convicted for an offense or crime involving moral turpitude or a violation related to a controlled substance; or been arrested or convicted for two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentence to confinement was five years or more; or been controlled substance trafficker; or are you seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Little guidance is provided to the traveler as to which offenses are included in the definition. However, the Web site of the [[Embassy of the United States in London|U.S. embassy in London]] states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Travelers who have been arrested, even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction, those with criminal records, (the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act does not apply to U.S. visa law), certain serious communicable illnesses, those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from, the United States, or have previously overstayed on the VWP are not eligible to travel visa free under the Visa Waiver Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://london.usembassy.gov/niv/vwp3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216024731/http://london.usembassy.gov/niv/vwp3.html |archivedate=2015-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This appears to be at variance with the question on form I-94W and information supplied by the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], as there are many offenses that are not considered to involve moral turpitude.

===U.S. government guidance on determining moral turpitude===
A definition of moral turpitude is available for immigration purposes from the [[Foreign Affairs Manual]], available on the [[United States Department of State]] website.&lt;ref name = FAM&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cba.org/cba/cle/pdf/imm06_chang_app1.pdf | title = U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 9 - Visas: 9 FAM 40.21(A) N2 Moral turpitude | accessdate = 2008-12-07 | format = pdf | author = [[United States Department of State]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government publishing office website (8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(i)).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-1994-title8/pdf/USCODE-1994-title8-chap11-subchapII_2-partV-sec1251.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For offenses (or arrests on suspicion of such offenses) occurring outside the U.S., the locally defined offense must be considered against the U.S. definitions, and in such cases it is the definition of the offense (as defined in the appropriate country) which is considered for immigration purposes, and not the circumstances of the individual's actual case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/n.7-crimes_involving_moral_turpitude.pdf § N.7 Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a state law offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude for federal immigration purposes is decided on a statute by statute basis, because each state statute might cover a different range of behaviors, some of which may not necessarily involve moral turpitude under the Federal definition. For an example of a criminal statute that seems like it would categorically involve moral turpitude, but actually does not because the statute covers some behavior that does not involve moral turpitude, see the Ninth Circuit case Castrijon-Garcia v. Holder, No. 09-73756 (9th Cir. 2013) (simple kidnapping under California Penal Code § 207(a) is not a categorical crime involving moral turpitude).&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/01/09/09-73756.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathan Birnbaum''' ({{lang-he|'''נתן בירנבוים'''}}; pseudonyms: "Mathias Acher", "Dr. N. Birner", "Mathias Palme", "Anton Skart", "Theodor Schwarz", and "Pantarhei"; 16 May 1864 – 2 April 1937) was an [[Austria]]n writer and journalist, [[Jew]]ish thinker and [[nationalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Bridger, David |title=''The New Jewish Encyclopedia'' |publisher= New York, Behrman House |year= 1962 |ISBN= 978-0-87441-120-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=The New Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/zionism |title=The Religion Book:Zionism |publisher=answers.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life had three main phases, representing a progression in his thinking: a [[Zionism|Zionist]] phase (c. 1883 – c. 1900); a Jewish cultural autonomy phase (c. 1900 – c. 1914) which included the promotion of the [[Yiddish]] language; and religious phase (c. 1914–1937) when he turned to Orthodox Judaism and became staunchly anti-Zionist.

He married Rosa Korngut (1869–1934) and they had three sons: [[Solomon Birnbaum|Solomon (Salomo) Birnbaum]] (1891–1989), [[Menachem Birnbaum]] (1893–1944), and [[Uriel Birnbaum]] (1894–1956).

== Early life ==
Birnbaum was born in [[Vienna]] into an [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish family with roots in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and Hungary.&lt;ref name="EncyclopaediaJudaica"&gt;"Birnbaum, Nathan" (2007). ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''.  2nd ed. Vol. 3. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. pp. 714-716.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Menachem Mendel Birnbaum, a merchant, hailed from [[Ropczyce|Ropshitz]], Galicia, and his mother, Miriam Birnbaum (née Seelenfreund), who was born in northern Hungary (in a region sometimes called the [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpathian Rus]]), of a family with illustrious rabbinic lineage, had moved as a child to [[Tarnów|Tarnow]], Galicia, where the two met and married.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Jess (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7nqjOCSVJm0C&amp;pg=PA17 Nathan Birnbaum and Jewish Modernity: Architect of Zionism, Yiddishism, and Orthodoxy]''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1882 to 1886, Birnbaum studied [[law]], philosophy and Near Eastern studies at the [[University of Vienna]].

== Zionism ==
In 1883, at the age of 19, he founded [[Kadimah (student association)|Kadimah]], the first Jewish (Zionist) [[student association]] in Vienna, many years before [[Theodor Herzl]] became the leading spokesman of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]]. While still a student, he founded and published the periodical ''Selbstemanzipation!'',&lt;ref&gt;"Self-[[Emancipation of the Jews|Emancipation!"]] 1885–1894, with some interruptions, renamed 1894 "Juedische Volkszeitung"&lt;/ref&gt; often written in large part by Birnbaum himself.  In it he coined the terms "Zionistic", "Zionist", "Zionism" (1890), and "political Zionism" (1892).&lt;ref&gt;Alex Bein, Herzl Year Book vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;6, New York, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum played a prominent part in the [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897) where he was elected Secretary-General of the [[Zionist Organization]]. He was associated with and was one of the most important representatives of the cultural, rather than political, side of Zionism. However, he left the Zionist Organization not long after the Congress. He was unhappy with its negative view of [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jewry]] and the transformation of the Zionist ideals into a party machine.

His next phase was to advocate Jewish cultural autonomy, or [[Golus nationalism]], concentrating in particular on the Jews of eastern Europe. He advocated for the Jews to be recognized as a people among the other peoples of the empire, with [[Yiddish]] as their official language. He ran (in Buczacz, eastern Galicia) on behalf of the Jews (and with the support of the local Ukrainians) as candidate for the Austrian parliament. Although he had a majority of the votes, his election was thwarted by corruption of the electoral process by the local Polish faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Joshua A.|title=Ideology, Society &amp; Language: The Odyssey of Nathan Birnbaum|year=1987|publisher=Karoma Publishers Inc|location=Ann  Arbor, MI|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chief convener of the [[Czernowitz Conference|Conference for the Yiddish Language]] held in [[Czernowitz]], August 30&amp;nbsp;–September 3, 1908. It was the first Yiddish-language conference ever to take place. At the conference, he took the place of his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist [[Sholem Aleichem]] who was critically ill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/yiddish/Tshernovits/fridh.html First Yiddish Language Conference.  Louis Fridhandler, Two roads to Yiddishism (Nathan Birnbaum and Sholem Aleichem)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1912 onwards, Birnbaum became increasingly interested in Orthodox Judaism, and he became a fully observant Orthodox Jew in about 1916. He continued to act particularly as an advocate for the Jews of eastern Europe and the Yiddish language. From 1919 to 1922, he was General Secretary of the [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisroel]], a widely-spread and influential Orthodox Jewish organization. He founded the society of the "Olim" (Hebrew for the "Ascenders"), a society with a specific program of action dedicated to the spiritual ascent of the Jewish people.

== Later life ==
Birnbaum, decrying political Zionism, 1919:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And is it at all possible that we, who regard Judaism as our one and only treasure, should ever be able to compete with such expert demagogues and loud self-advertisers as they [the Zionists]? It is surely not necessary that we should. We are, after all, still the mountains and they the grain, and all we need to do is to gather all our forces in a world organization of religious Jews, and it will follow of itself, and without the application of any great political cunning on our part, that we shall have it in our power to prevent what must needs be prevented and to carry out what we have to carry out. But there is no need first to create this world organization of religious Jews. It is already in existence. The world knows its name, it is Agudas Yisroel [The Union of Israel].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He continued to write and lecture. His most well-known publication of this period of his life was "Gottes Volk", 1918 (German), "God's Folk", 1921 (Yiddish), translated into Hebrew as "Am Hashem" (1948), and translated into English under the title "Confession" (1946), slightly abridged.{{dubious|Obviously missing bits. Source has been deleted.|date=February 2018}}

In 1933, at the time of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] rise to power, Birnbaum and his wife, together with their son Menachem (an artist) and family, who at that time were all living in Berlin, fled to [[Scheveningen]], [[Netherlands]], with the help of businessman and diplomat Henri B. van Leeuwen (1888-1973). There, Birnbaum, van Leeuwen, and banker Daniel Wolfe published the anti-Zionist newspaper ''Der Ruf'' ("The Call"). (Menachem and his family were murdered by the Nazis in 1944.) At the same time, their son Solomon (Professor of Yiddish and Hebrew paleography) and his family fled from Hamburg to England. Their other son, Uriel, an artist and poet, and his family fled from Vienna to the Netherlands in 1939. Van Leeuwen, also an Orthodox Jew, became a Dutch anti-Zionist leader and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] survivor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antonyloewenstein.com/2014/02/15/jews-backing-academic-boycott-against-israel/ Jews backing academic boycott against Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum died in Scheveningen in 1937 after a period of severe illness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17688">The '''New Life Movement''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|新|生|活|運|動}} |p=Xīn Shēnghuó yùndòng}}) was a government-led civic movement in 1930s China to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality and to ultimately unite China under a centralised ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as head of the government and the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] launched the initiative on 19 February 1934 as part of an anti-Communist campaign, and soon enlarged the campaign to target the whole nation.{{sfnb|Yip|1992| p = 287}}

Chiang and his wife, [[Soong Mei-ling]], who played a major role in the campaign, advocated a life guided by four virtues, ''[[Li (Confucianism)|lǐ]]'' (禮/礼, proper rite), ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' (義/义, righteousness or justice), ''lián'' (廉, honesty and cleanness) and ''chǐ'' (恥/耻, shame; sense of right and wrong).{{sfnb|Chiang|1934}} The campaign proceeded with help of the [[Blue Shirts Society]] and the [[CC Clique]] within the Nationalist Party, and Christian missionaries in China.&lt;ref name="schok"&gt;Schoppa, R. Keith. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M6_tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3A2g1y80xsQbIC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=New+Life+Movement The Revolution and Its Past] (New York: Pearson Prentic Hall, 2nd ed. 2006, pp. 208–209 .&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
The New Life Movement was founded at a time when China, already weakened by Western [[imperialism]], faced the threats of rising [[Japanese militarism]], [[Warlord Era|domestic factionalism]] and [[communism]]. The launch of the New Life Movement was set in the context the Chiangs' growing concern with corruption, and moral decadence that they blamed on foreign influences. Historian [[Colin Mackerras]] writes that “Corruption was an abiding feature of Chiang Kai-shek’s rule" and that nepotism and bribery were rife among the bureaucracy. Chiang charged that “If we do not weed the present body of corruption, bribery, perfunctoriness, and ignorance, and establish instead a clean, effective administration, the day will soon come when the revolution will be started against us as we did the Manchus”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mackerras, Colin.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=p_nJAwAAQBAJ China in transformation 1900-1949]. N.p.: Pearson Longman, 2018, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang further claimed that the life of a Chinese man could be summarised with words such as “[[hedonism]]”, to signify his unprincipled and controlled pursuit of pleasure; “laziness” to represent his negligence and carelessness; as well as “unbearable filthiness” in every aspect of his life.{{sfnb|Dirlik|1975| p = 954}} Chiang's political rival, [[Wang Jingwei|Wang Ching-wei]] described Chinese life as a life of "smoking," "sickness," "gambling," "filth," "ghosts" (i.e., superstition), and "indolence”. Wang argued the fundamental psychological basis of such behaviour was "lackadaisicalness"  (''suibian zhuyi'') and "self seekingness" (''zili zhuyi''). He contended that “lackadaisicalness” led to lives without a sense of right or wrong, and hence with no distinctions or purpose. "Self-seekingness," he argued, led to the rejection of all outside interference with this kind of behaviour as encroachment on "freedom". There was no consideration for others and their rights, only of one's own comfort, inevitably obstructing social life and group solidarity.{{sfnb|Dirlik|1975| p = 955}}

In Chiang's mind, these concerns were compounded by the influx of foreign ideas following the [[New Culture Movement]] and [[May Fourth Movement]] which fostered Western concepts such as liberalism, pragmatism and nationalism as well as more radical ideas including [[Marxism]] respectively. The Movement attempted to counter such threats through a resurrection of traditional Chinese morality, which it held to be superior to modern Western values. As such the Movement was based upon [[Confucianism]], mixed with [[Christianity]], [[nationalism]] and [[authoritarianism]] that have some similarities to [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="schok" /&gt; It rejected [[individualism]] and [[liberalism]], while also opposing [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

Soong Mei-ling called for a program of spiritual enlightenment. She wrote in''Forum'', an American magazine, in 1935, that "the mere accumulation of great wealth is not sufficient to enable China to resume her position as a great nation." There must be, she continued, "also revival of the spirit, since spiritual values transcend mere material riches. She played a major role both in launching the Movement and in representing its public face.{{sfnb|Li|2006 | pp= 101–102}}[[File:Soong May-ling stitching uniform for soldiers.jpg|thumb|150px|Soong Meiling Stitching a Uniform For Soldiers]]

Chiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and [[Methodist]] notion of self-cultivation and correct living for the Movement; to this end it prescribed proper etiquette on every aspect of daily life. He considered the New Life Movement a key part of the program to carry out the "principle of the people's livelihood" in [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]]. However implementing the Movement was suspended indefinitely in the approach to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

== Doctrines and principle beliefs ==
Chiang Kai-shek’s September 1934 speech stated that the New Life Movement aimed at the "promotion of a regular life guided by the four virtues,"  – '[[Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ]]' (proper rite), ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yì]]' (righteousness or justice), ''lián ''(honesty and cleanness) ''and chǐ'' (shame; sense of right and wrong)''. These virtues, he went on,
:must be applied to ordinary life in the matter of food, clothing, shelter, and action. The four virtues are the essential principles for the promotion of morality. They form the major rules for dealing with men and human affairs, for cultivating oneself and for adjustment to one’s surroundings. Whoever violates these rules is bound to fail, and a nation that neglects them will not survive.” {{sfnb|Chiang|1934|p = [http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/cup/chiang_kaishek_new_life.pdf 1]}}

Chiang later extended the four virtues to eight by the addition of “Promptness”, “Precision,” “Harmoniousness,” and “Dignity”. These elements were summarized in two basic forms: “cleanliness” and “discipline” and were viewed as the first step in achieving a “new life”.  People were encouraged to engage in modern polite behaviour, such as not to spit, urinate or sneeze in public. They were encouraged to adopt good table manners such as not making noises when eating.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Influences on the Movement ==
The ideological strictness of the New Life Movement had many similarities with [[Neo-Confucianism]], which had been the dominating [[moral philosophy]] of the previous centuries. The New life Movement “four virtues” were taken from Confucian school of thought. Paul Linebarger had stated that “its [the New Life Movement’s] principles consist of a simple restatement of the cardinal Confucian personal virtues, interpreted to suit modern conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. A. Linebarger, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40350/40350-h/40350-h.htm Government in Republican China]'', (New York: McGraw Hill, 1938) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Lloyd Eastman saw Chiang’s goal as unifying China under a singular ideology, a [[Fascism|fascist]] one at that, with the resulting New Life Movement being a popularized or a “sloganized Confucianism”.{{sfnb|Eastman|1974|p = 67}} According to Keith Schoppa, the new set of beliefs was seen to be easy to execute, with four main virtues backed by 95 further sub-rules that regulated the everyday life of the regular Chinese&amp;nbsp; citizen.&lt;ref&gt;R. Keith Schoppa, ''Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History'' 3rd Edition, (Boston: Prentice Hall, 2011), 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement was also shaped by Chiang's [[Christianity]]. According to Elmer Clark, the new doctrine was “an ambitious moral and ethical enterprise which proposed nothing less than a Chinese renaissance, a complete reformation of the habits, customs and manners of one fourth of the human race, to bring them more in line with the accepted morals of Christian civilisation”.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer T. Clark,&amp;nbsp;''The Chiangs of China,&amp;nbsp;''(New York: Abington-Cokesbury Press, 1943), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Overlapping moral guidelines exist between Confucianism and Christianity. The 95 rules placed in the New Life movement often blur the lines between the influence of the two on the Movement, such as “do not gamble” or “be polite and courteous to women and children”.

There is a totalitarian aspect to the Movement. Dirlik sees the movement as a "modern [[Counter-revolutionary|counterrevolution]]" opposed to an "anti-revolutionary [[conservatism]]" due to the fact that it instrumentalised traditional moral codes and societal constructs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other historians regard this movement as imitating [[Nazism|German Fascism]] and being a neo-[[Nationalism|nationalistic]] movement used to elevate Chiang's control of everyday lives. [[Frederic Wakeman]] suggested that the New Life Movement was "Confucian fascism".&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, Frederic, Jr. (1997). “A Revisionist View of the Nanjing Decade: Confucian Fascism.” ''The China Quarterly'' 150: 395–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Despite the grandiose goal of revitalising and revolutionising China, the New Life Movement ultimately ended in failure as both domestic and foreign reception remained paltry throughout the duration of the movement. The combination of the movement’s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and the seeming banality of its concerns caused both Chinese and foreign commentators to ignore the significance of New Life ideology and intentions and instead to stress the more superficial aspects of the movement. Consequently, the movement was approached variously as a joke, or to those taking it more seriously, a shallow and antiquated regression to Chinese tradition when tradition had already proved incapable of solving China’s problems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Arif Dirlik. “The Ideological Foundations of the New Life Movement: A Study in Counterrevolution.”&amp;nbsp;''The Journal of Asian Studies'', vol. 34, no. 4, 1975, p. 946, www.jstor.org/stable/2054509.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement’s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and abstract code of ethics contrasted sharply with the promises of the Communists, who spoke sharply and to the point on taxation, distribution of land and the disposition of overlords.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Hahn,&amp;nbsp;''The Soong Sisters,&amp;nbsp;''(Garden City, NY: Garden City Publishing Co., 1941), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of a Chinese citizen, the policies of Marxists are far more practical and coherent, leading to the lack of significance attributed to the New Life Movement. On a Western perspective, Chiang’s complex code of ethics was far too abstract and lacking in action to be useful or pragmatic, perceived as being superficial and inordinately idealistic. &amp;nbsp;

The lack of popular domestic reception is exacerbated by the behaviour of the [[Blue Shirts Society|Blue Shirts]], a far-right fascist group that enforced the rules of the New Life Movement. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] writes “by 1936, the Blue Shirts were running amok, driven by excesses of zeal and brutality, giving the New Life Movement a bad name.&amp;nbsp;The Literary Digest&amp;nbsp;observed that year, ‘Most likely to upset the teacups were Chiang’s own civilian, anti-foreign, bombing, stabbing, shooting ‘Blue Shirt’ terrorists, who once useful, now unmanageable, have become something of a Frankenstein monster.”&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sterling Seagrave,&amp;nbsp;''The Soong Dynasty,&amp;nbsp;''(New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1985), 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the violent and repressive behaviour of the Blue Shirts compounded the less than enthusiastic reception of the Movement, further attributing to it a negative reputation as well.

== Implementations ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:One year anniversary of the New Life Movement.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Chinese officials celebrating the one year anniversary of the New Life Movement]] --&gt;The New Life Movement aimed to control Chinese lifestyles. Some measures and moral codes included: opposition to littering and spitting at random; opposition to [[opium]] use; opposition to [[conspicuous consumption]]; rejection of immoral entertainment in favour of artistic and athletic pursuits; courteous behaviour; saluting the flag. Chiang urged citizens to bathe with cold water, since the (supposed) Japanese habit of washing their faces with cold water was a sign of their military strength.

Chiang relied on government law enforcement to reinforce moral behaviour. Task forces were created in different regions to implement the movement, yet, in reports from some districts on the implementation, the movement was seen to be severely underfunded, understaffed and poorly understood by law enforcement officials.

The [[Blue Shirts Society|Blue Shirts]] were also instrumental in the implementation of the New Life movement. The neo-right wing group at first, was useful to Chiang, correcting the behaviour of those not following the four virtues and the further 95 rules placed. However, they soon turned to force to reinforce Chiang's ideals, giving bad publicity and views on the movement. The excessive violence used by the Blue Shirts encompassed the movement, leading to a reluctant public in following the new dogma in place by the KMT.

==Historical evaluations==
In the words of [[Soong Mei-ling]]'s biographer, the New Life Movement was a "curious East-West ideological fusion of neo-Confucian precepts, thinly disguised, New Testament Christianity, YMCA-Style social activism, elements of Bushido—the samurai code—and European fascism, along with a generous dose of New England Puritanism." {{sfnb|Li |2006| p = 102}} [[Arif Dirlik]] explains the Movement as motivated by the need to counter Communist success in both ideological appeal and political organization. {{sfnb|Dirlik|1975|}}

He has collaborated musically with his wife, American singer and musician [[Zeena Schreck]], Australian percussionist [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]], [[Boyd Rice|NON]], [[Death in June]], and the British actor [[Christopher Lee]] whose first album Schreck conceived of and produced. As a solo artist, his song "Lord Sutekh's Dream" was released by German record label The Epicurean in conjunction with Schreck's May 28, 2016 concert at the [[Epicurean Escapism Festival]] in Berlin. Since that concert Schreck has recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass), and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion.) After a performance at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig noted as one of the best concerts at the WGT by German music site der Schwarze Welt [http://der-schwarze-planet.de/mein-schreckliches-wgt-2017/], Schreck and his band released the vinyl EP The Futura Model on The Epicurean label [https://epicureanescapism.bandcamp.com/album/the-futura-model]. A monthly radio program The Nikolas Schreck Show premiered on Berlin's Radio On 31 October, 2017 [https://soundcloud.com/user-687235752/the-nikolas-schreck-show-halloween-scare-a-thon-2017-broadcast-by-radio-on-berlin]

His books include ''The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman'' (2011) ''Demons of the Flesh: The Complete Guide to Left Hand Path Sex Magic'' (2002) co-authored with [[Zeena Schreck|Zeena]], ''Flowers from Hell: A Satanic Reader'' (2001), ''The Satanic Screen: An Illustrated Guide to the Devil in Cinema'', (2001) and the first edition of ''The Manson File'' (1988). 

His film appearances include the 1989 documentary, [[Charles Manson Superstar]], which he directed, ''Usher'', the last film of [[Curtis Harrington]], and [[Mortuary Academy]]. He teaches Tantric Buddhist meditation.

==Career==
Schreck was the founder, frontman, and sole constant member of the magical musical collective [[Radio Werewolf]] from 1984–1993, whose recordings include ''The Fiery Summons'' (1989), ''The Lightning and the Sun'' (1989), ''Bring Me the Head of Geraldo Rivera! A Benediction in Four Movements'' (1990), ''Songs for the End of the World'' (1991), ''Witchcraft/Boots: A Tribute to the Sinatras'' (1991), ''Love Conquers All'' (1992) and 2012's compilation ''The Vinyl Solution''.

Schreck is the author of ''The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman'' (2011) ''Demons of the Flesh: The Complete Guide to Left Hand Path Sex Magic'', (2002) co-authored with [[Zeena Schreck|Zeena]], ''Flowers from Hell: A Satanic Reader'' (2001), ''The Satanic Screen: An Illustrated Guide to the Devil in Cinema'', (2001) and the first edition of ''The Manson File'' (1988).

In 1997, Schreck produced the first full-length album by British actor [[Christopher Lee]] ''Christopher Lee Sings Devils, Rogues &amp; Other Villains'' which was released on Schreck's Wolfslair label.

Schreck's forthcoming series of novels ''The Dallas Book of the Dead'' was previewed in a reading broadcast on NPR's Berlin Stories in July, 2013. He directed the documentary ''[[Charles Manson Superstar]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Manson Superstar|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097047/|work=IMDb.com|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has appeared in several other documentaries and films. 

Before his 2003 conversion to [[Tantric Buddhism]], and his earlier renunciation of Satanism, Schreck was a prominent black magician who co-led the magical school The Werewolf Order with [[Zeena Schreck|Zeena]] from 1988-1999. He worked closely in the late 1980s with [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]], although he was not a member of the Church. Schreck was a Master of the [[Temple of Set]] before resigning with several others in 2002 due to religious and administrative differences. In 2002, Schreck was one of the founding members of the Sethian Liberation Movement (formerly the Storm) which is currently located in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=December 17, 2002 Disinfo description of Temple of Set High Priestess Zeena Schreck, along with several Masters, Priests, Orders and Elements of the Temple of Set who resigned en masse to form The Storm, later renamed Sethian Liberation Movement|url=http://www.parareligion.ch/schreck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his Facebook page, Nikolas Schreck's band Kingdom of Heaven will perform a concert at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] music festival in Leipzig, Germany on May 22, 2015. Kingdom of Heaven's first album ''XXIII'' was released on iTunes and Amazon on 10 April 2015.

Nikolas Schreck performed live in Germany for the first time since 1992 in a sonic ritual concert entitled In Her Thrall: Evokation des Ewig-Weiblichen at Tower Transmissions Music Festival IV in Dresden on 27 September 2014, collaborating with noted percussionist [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]]. A documentary concert film of the concert, also entitled ''In Her Thrall'' was photographed by Boa Thor and released via Schreck's World Operations. Schreck's song "O, A Weird Flower!" from this concert was released on the Epicurean label CD "All My Sins Remembered - The Sonic Worlds of John Murphy" in June 2016. Since then, he has recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass) and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion) with whom he recorded the vinyl EP The Futura Model, released in October 2017. 

In 2014, Schreck taught a public class "Sonic Magic in Theory and Praxis: A Two-Day Workshop for Magicians and Musicians" at the NK Projekt in Berlin, Germany, which was described as "a rare two-day course in the magical art of applying ritual magic, consciousness alteration and spiritual initiation to music". He has taught subsequent lectures on sonic magic in Leipzig's Black Whitsun event in June 2017 and in Berlin in October 2017 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-B0sZI92mM]

On January 17 2018 Schreck is scheduled to deliver a LDN lecture in London entitled ''The Charles Manson Conspiracy'' [https://uk.funzing.com/funz/ldn-talks-the-charles-manson-conspiracy-13719]

==Music==

===Kingdom of Heaven===

In 2012, Nikolas Schreck (vocalist/lyricist) and James Collord (bassist/multi-instrumentalist) founded their musical collaboration Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) whose songs ''In Dreamland'' and ''Midnight in Cairo'' were premiered on a Nightwatch Radio interview in November 2013.

Kingdom of Heaven's first single ''The Ballad of Lurleen Tyler'' was made available via iTunes in December 2013, followed in March 2014 by a video for the song on the Kingdom of Heaven YouTube channel.

In May 2014, Nikolas Schreck was interviewed on the Green Tea Berlin radio program broadcast by Alex Radio and 88.4 Berlin which featured the European radio premiere of Kingdom of Heaven's song ''Enemy on Both Sides'', which Schreck introduced as the ''theme to a non-existent James Bond movie''

In March 2015, Schreck's Facebook page announced that Kingdom of Heaven would perform a concert at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen music festival in Leipzig Germany on May 22, 2015.

He has since then recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass) and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion) with whom he recorded the vinyl EP The Futura Model, released in October 2017. 

===Radio Werewolf===
{{main|Radio Werewolf}}

Schreck founded the band Radio Werewolf in 1984. His theatrical ritual performances as the group's lead singer, billed as Rallies of the Radio Werewolf Youth Party, provoked controversy, as did provocative appearances on several television programs. Tension over the contentious nature of the band's music led to the departure of co-founder Evil Wilhelm from Radio Werewolf shortly after their participation in the notorious 8-8-88 Rally in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Music Connection"&gt;The Music Connection, "Who Needs a Record Deal when you're Busy Taking over the World?" Vol 3, #12, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Race Reason"&gt;{{Cite episode
 | title = Race and Reason Interview with Radio Werewolf
 | series = Radio Werewolf 
 | location = Los Angeles
 | date = July 8, 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was hostility during the breakup, the band members later reconciled. Schreck's 1989 LP ''The Fiery Summons'' was the first Radio Werewolf album, although the previous formation recorded a still unreleased album in 1987.

Key to the bands beliefs about themselves was the existence of what they termed the "dominant frequency" or "alpha frequency." Schreck explained the band by saying "Radio Werewolf is a sound, a vibration, a certain frequency from another world. I just transmitted it. The bodies and minds of all the people who tuned into that frequency were the mediums that broadcast came through on. I only get credit for ”creating” it because I have a big mouth, I was in the front of the stage, and I was the one the media paid the most attention to."&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;Nikolas Schreck on Radio Werewolf, The Manson Mystique, and the Satanic Panic of the 1980s: Interview by Christophe Lorenz, 2008 (Le Gourou du rock)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zeena Schreck]] served as Radio Werewolf co-director from 1988-1993, the group's most prolific period, which saw the release of their recordings ''Songs for the End of the World'', ''The Lightning and the Sun'', ''Bring Me the Head of Geraldo Rivera!'', ''Witchcraft-Boots: A Tribute to the Sinatras '' and ''Love Conquers All''.

In 2012, Radio Werewolf's ''The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts, Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions'' was released by World Operations. The compact disc, the first official Radio Werewolf release since 1992, compiles newly remastered re-releases of 12 ambient sonic magic tracks from Zeena and Nikolas Schreck's rare Radio Werewolf vinyl recordings between 1989-1992 as well as 2 bonus tracks never previously released to the public.

==Video Werewolf==

Schreck's 1989 documentary, ''Charles Manson Superstar'', told the story of [[Charles Manson]]'s life as well as interviewing him in San Quentin Prison. The documentary featured parts of an originally hour and a half long interview of Manson, as well as many photographs and video footage, of the [[Manson Family]], [[Spahn Ranch]], and other related topics. Also discussed were Manson's alleged ties to [[Nazi]] movements (which he denied) and to various [[Satanism|Satanic]] movements. Other Video Werewolf releases include ''The Zurich Experiment'', which documented Radio Werewolf's last public concert.

==Writings==

===The Manson File===
Schreck's "The Manson File" (1988) is a thorough study of the philosophy, music and spiritual ideas of Charles Manson. The book brings Manson's previously obscure ATWA ecology concept and his religious devotion to the Gnostic god Abraxas to public attention. Schreck posited that the demonization of Manson (and perhaps the martyrdom of Manson by other groups) is the result of media sensationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = The Manson File

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman|url=http://www.nikolasschreck.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47%3Athe-manson-file-myth-and-reality-of-an-outlaw-shaman&amp;catid=34&amp;Itemid=55#manson_en|work=Nikolas Schreck|publisher=Nikolas Schreck|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Nikolas Schreck|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schreck's ''The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman'', a new and greatly expanded edition of over 900 pages was released in France as "Le Dossier Manson : Mythe Et Réalité D’un Chaman Hors-La-Loi". Schreck delves deeply into previously unknown aspects of Manson's life and the Tate-La Bianca murders to present evidence that the "Helter Skelter" theory put forth by prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi had little if anything to do with the reality of the crimes. According to Schreck, the murders of Sharon Tate and the others actually resulted from conventional underworld rivalries between drug dealer associates [[Charles "Tex" Watson|Charles Watson]] and [[Jay Sebring]], who Schreck contends was linked to the Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As of August 2011, the new version of Schreck's book became available in English format, on his personal website. A mass market edition was published in December 2011. Leading alternative culture source ''[[Metal Impact]]'' praised ''The Manson File'', congratulating it on its comprehensive view of the subject, and for taking an academic stance, rather than the sensationalism of Vincent Bugliosi's ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIKOLAS SCHRECK (usa) - Artiste|url=http://www.metal-impact.com/index.php?name=Interviews&amp;req=showcontent&amp;id=394&amp;POSTNUKESID=e21f090cf1212482ae31170732fe82af|work=Metal-Impact|publisher=Metal-Impact|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Mortne2001|language=French, English|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
{{Redirect|Demons of the Flesh|the song|Demons of the Flesh (song)}}

Schreck's ''Flowers From Hell: A Satanic Reader'' was released in 2001. The book detailed the history of the use of Satan as a symbol, archetype, and deity in fiction throughout history, from ancient to modern times, and through several different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Satanic Screen: An Illustrated Guide to the Devil in Cinema'' was also released in 2001. The book revealed a detailed study of the use of the devil (in all his various forms) in film media throughout its existence. In an interview with American Movie Classics, Schreck noted that: "I think people's ideas of the devil and of Satan in the 20th century have largely been shaped and dictated by imagery from the cinema. I've studied the black arts in history and practice for many decades, and I found that Satanism had been looked at in terms of literature and music but never in terms of cinema."&lt;ref&gt;"American Movie Classics Interviews Author Nikolas Schreck" 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Demons of the Flesh: The Complete Guide to Left Hand Path Sex Magic'', released in 2002, Schreck and his wife Zeena explored the theory, history and practice of erotic sorcery and worship of the feminine in all of the world's religions. Presented as a ritual fusing of male and female, the book refutes common Western Satanic misconceptions of the left hand path by tracing its origins in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, and presents a crash course of magical exercises based on the Schrecks' own experiences as practitioners of what they term the sinister current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Our Teachings''' (''Kashti-Nooh'' in Urdu) is an Urdu book published in 1902 by the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya movement]], [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] of [[Qadian]], India. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]] claimant, attempted to revive the purported original and pristine teachings of Islam. He entitled the book "Noah's Ark", implying that those who wanted to be saved from the deluge of irreligion and materialism should join the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

Hamzah's best-praised work, readings have generally focused on religious themes&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; mainly from an Islamic perspective, although Christian influences have been suggested.

== Writing ==
"Padamu Jua" was written by [[Amir Hamzah]], a [[Langkat Regency|Langkat]]-born [[Malay people|Malay]] writer who studied in Dutch schools. The poem is not dated (indeed, none of Hamzah's works are){{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=9}} Poet Laurens Koster Bohang considers "Padamu Jua" to have been written between 1933 and 1937,{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=8}} while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature [[A. Teeuw]] dates it to 1936/1937.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=126}} The time was one of great emotional turmoil for Hamzah, who was required to marry the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Langkat|Sultan of Langkat]], who had funded his studies in [[Java]]. At the time Hamzah had reportedly fallen in love with a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] woman while studying, and was forced to leave her.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=13}}

== Structure ==
The 28-line poem consists of 84&amp;nbsp;words. It is dominated by the vowels ''a'' and ''u'', which are often repeated either as the [[diphthong]] ''au'' or the [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] ''ua''; such combinations occur in 35 per cent of the words and 64 per cent of the lines. [[Consonant]]s are often repeated, emphasising the interconnection between different words in a line.{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|p=109}}

== Analysis ==
Indonesian literary critic [[Zuber Usman]] writes that the poem describes a meeting between Amir Hamzah and God, depicted either as a meeting between lovers or between a servant and his Lord.{{sfn|Usman|1959|pp=232–233}} He writes that the first two lines depict Hamzah's feelings after he was told that he was to be married, how all his hopes for the future were destroyed by the announcement. The next couplet depicts a return to God and Islam, a religion which Hamzah had followed devoutly as a child. The following four lines Usman reads as depicting the light of God, an answer to the emptiness which Hamzah faces.{{sfn|Usman|1959|p=234}} Hamzah diverts his physical love and disappointment over worldly issues, but soon feels disappointed, as if God is toying with him, as if in a fit of jealousy God will not allow him to have his true love. Ultimately he is unable to abandon God, and returns, surrendering himself to a God who hovers "between clarity and fogginess"{{efn|Original: "''antara terang dan samar-samar.''"}}{{sfn|Usman|1959|pp=235–237}} However, he must wait&amp;nbsp;– alone&amp;nbsp;– for God to return.{{sfn|Usman|1959|p=237}} Australian critic of Indonesian literature Keith Foulcher gives a similar reading,{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|p=109}} while Jassin reads the poem as a statement that Hamzah would like to meet God.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|pp=33–34}}

Documentarian [[HB Jassin]] writes that critics, such as [[Bakri Siregar]], have seen an influence of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], as depicted in the [[Bible]]. He indicates several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view, including the depiction of an anthropomorphic God (not allowed in orthodox Islam) and the idea of a jealous God. He writes that the concept of a jealous God is not found in Islam, but is in the Bible, citing {{Bibleverse||Exodus|20:5|KJV}} and {{Bibleverse||Exodus|34:14|KJV}}.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|pp=33–34}} Jassin, however, attributes this to [[artistic license]],{{sfn|Jassin|1962|pp=33–34}} while Foulcher attributes it to a dynamic and unstable God.{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|p=107}}

== Publication and reception ==
"Padamu Jua" was first published in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Poedjangga Baroe]]'', a literary magazine which Hamzah had helped establish, together with the rest of ''Nyanyi Sunyi''.{{sfn|Jassin|1962|p=212}} It was later published as the first titled poem in a standalone book; the collection had seen its third printing by 1949.{{sfn|Hamzah|1949|p=1}} An English translation by [[Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana]], Sabina Thornton, and [[Burton Raffel]] was published in 1967.{{sfn|Raffel|1968|pp=26–27}} "Padamu Jua" has been used in several school books for teaching Indonesian at senior high school levels.

"Padamu Jua" is Hamzah's best-praised work.{{sfn|Foulcher|1991|p=107}} Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature [[A. Teeuw]] described the poem as most valuable, with "the most direct, most powerful, most exact, and most period-appropriate formulation of the relationship between God and humans".{{efn|Original: ... perumusan yang paling langsung, paling bertenaga, paling tepat, dan paling sesuai dengan zaman, tentang hubungan antara Tuhan dengan manusia.''"}}{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=143}}

The '''paradoxes of material implication''' are a group of [[formula]]e that are truths of [[classical logic]] but are intuitively problematic.

The root of the [[paradox]]es lies in a mismatch between the interpretation of the validity of [[logical implication]] in natural language, and its formal [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] in classical logic, dating back to [[George Boole]]'s algebraic logic. In classical logic, [[material conditional|implication]] describes conditional if-then statements using a [[truth-functional]] interpretation, i.e. "p implies q" is '''defined''' to be "it is not the case that p is true and q false". Also, "p implies q" is equivalent to "p is false or q is true". For example, "if it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella", is equivalent to "it is not raining, or I will bring an umbrella, or both". This truth-functional interpretation of implication is called material implication or material conditional.

The paradoxes are logical statements which are true but whose truth is intuitively surprising to people who are not familiar with them. If the terms 'p', 'q' and 'r' stand for arbitrary [[proposition]]s then the main paradoxes are given formally as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;(\neg p \land p) \to q&lt;/math&gt;, p and its [[negation]] imply q. This is the ''paradox of entailment''.
# &lt;math&gt;p \to (q \to p)&lt;/math&gt;, if p is true then it is implied by every q.
# &lt;math&gt;\neg p \to (p \to q)&lt;/math&gt;, if p is false then it implies every q. This is referred to as 'explosion'. In these cases, the statement &lt;math&gt;p \to q&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[vacuously true]].
# &lt;math&gt;p \to (q \lor \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;, either q or its negation is true, so their [[disjunction]] is implied by every p.
# &lt;math&gt;(p \to q) \lor (q \to r)&lt;/math&gt;, if p, q and r are three arbitrary propositions, then either p implies q or q implies r. This is because if q is true then p implies it, and if it is false then q implies any other statement. Since r can be p, it follows that given two arbitrary propositions, one must imply the other, even if they are mutually contradictory. For instance, "Nadia is in Barcelona implies Nadia is in Madrid, or Nadia is in Madrid implies Nadia is in Barcelona." This truism sounds like nonsense in ordinary discourse.
# &lt;math&gt;\neg(p \to q) \to (p \land \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;, if p does not imply q then p is true and q is false. NB if p were false then it would imply q, so p is true. If q were also true then p would imply q, hence q is false. This paradox is particularly surprising because it tells us that if one proposition does not imply another then the first is true and the second false.

The paradoxes of material implication arise because of the truth-functional definition of material implication, which is said to be true merely because the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false or the [[consequent]] is true. By this criterion, "If the moon is made of green cheese, then the world is coming to an end," is true merely because the moon isn't made of green cheese. By extension, any contradiction implies anything whatsoever, since a contradiction is never true. (All [[paraconsistent logic]]s must, by definition, reject (1) as invalid.) Also, any [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] is implied by anything whatsoever, since a tautology is always true.

To sum up, although it is deceptively similar to what we mean by "logically follows" in ordinary usage, material implication does not capture the meaning of "if... then".

==Paradox of entailment==

As the best known of the paradoxes, and most formally simple, the paradox of [[entailment]] makes the best introduction.

In natural language, an instance of the paradox of entailment arises:
:''It is raining''
And
:''It is not raining''
Therefore
:''George Washington is made of rakes.''

This arises from the [[principle of explosion]], a law of [[classical logic]] stating that inconsistent premises always make an argument valid; that is, inconsistent premises imply any [[logical consequence|conclusion]] at all. This seems paradoxical because although the above is a logically valid argument, it is not [[Soundness of deductive reasoning|sound]] (not all of its premises are true).

===Construction===
[[Validity (logic)|Validity]] is defined in classical logic as follows: 
:''An [[Logical argument|argument]] (consisting of [[premise]]s and a conclusion) is valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. ''

For example a valid argument might run:
:''If it is raining, water exists'' (1st premise)
:''It is raining'' (2nd premise)
:''Water exists'' (Conclusion)

In this example there is no possible situation in which the premises are true while the conclusion is false. Since there is no [[counterexample]], the argument is valid.

But one could construct an argument in which the premises are [[consistent|inconsistent]]. This would satisfy the test for a valid argument since there would be ''no possible situation in which all the premises are true'' and therefore ''no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false''.

For example an argument with inconsistent premises might run:
:''It is definitely raining'' (1st premise; true)
:''It is not raining'' (2nd premise; false)
:''George Washington is made of rakes'' (Conclusion)

As there is no possible situation where both premises could be true, then there is certainly no possible situation in which the premises could be true while the conclusion was false. So the argument is valid whatever the conclusion is; inconsistent premises imply all conclusions.

===Explanation===
The strangeness of the paradox of [[entailment]] comes from the fact that the definition of validity in [[classical logic]] does not always agree with the use of the term in ordinary language. In everyday use ''validity'' suggests that the premises are consistent. In classical logic, the additional notion of ''soundness'' is introduced. A sound argument is a valid argument with all true premises. Hence a valid argument with an inconsistent set of premises can never be sound. A suggested improvement to the notion of logical validity to eliminate this paradox is [[Relevance logic|relevant logic]].

==Simplification==
The classical paradox formulae are closely tied to the formula,

* &lt;math&gt;(p \land q) \to p&lt;/math&gt;

the principle of Simplification, which can be derived from the paradox formulae rather easily (e.g. from (1) by Importation). 
In addition, there are serious problems with trying to use material implication as representing the English "if ... then ...". For example, the following are valid inferences:

# &lt;math&gt;(p \to q) \land (r \to s)\ \vdash\ (p \to s) \lor (r \to q)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(p \land q) \to r\ \vdash\ (p \to r) \lor (q \to r)&lt;/math&gt;

but mapping these back to English sentences using "if" gives paradoxes. The first might be read "If John is in London then he is in England, and if he is in Paris then he is in France. Therefore, it is either true that (a) if John is in London then he is in France, or (b) that if he is in Paris then he is in England." Using material implication, if John really is in London, then (since he is not in Paris) (b) is true; whereas if he is in Paris, then (a) is true. Since he cannot be in both places, the conclusion that at least one of (a) or (b) is true is valid.

But this does not match how "if ... then ..." is used in natural language: the most likely scenario in which one would say "If John is in London then he is in England" is if one ''does not know'' where John is, but nonetheless knows that ''if'' he is in London, he is in England. Under this interpretation, both premises are true, but both clauses of the conclusion are false.

The second example can be read "If both switch A and switch B are closed, then the light is on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A is closed, the light is on, or that if switch B is closed, the light is on." Here, the most likely natural-language interpretation of the "if ... then ..." statements would be "''whenever'' switch A is closed, the light is on", and "''whenever'' switch B is closed, the light is on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when ''both'' switches are closed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7972">The '''principle of individuation''' is a criterion that individuates or numerically distinguishes the members of the kind for which it is given, that is by which we can supposedly determine, regarding any kind of thing, when we have more than one of them or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kim &amp; Sosa p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as a 'criterion of identity' or 'indiscernibility principle'.  The history of the consideration of such a principle begins with [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)]] 1034a 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;  It was much discussed by the [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266–1308) with his "[[haecceity]]" and later, during [[Renaissance]], by [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), [[Bonaventure Baron]] (1610–1696) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716).  

==Aristotle==
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|Aristotle]]

Taking issue with the view expressed in certain Platonic dialogues that universal [[theory of forms|Forms]] (such as the Good, the Just, the Triangular and so on) constitute reality, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) regarded an individual as something real in itself.  An individual therefore has two kinds of unity: specific and numerical.  Specific unity (that is unity of the [[species]] to which an individual belongs) is a unity of nature which the individual shares with other individuals.  For example, twin daughters are both human females, and share a unity of nature.  This specific unity, according to Aristotle, is derived from Form, for it is form (which the medieval philosophers called [[quiddity]]) which makes an individual substance the kind of thing it is.  But two individuals (such as the twins) can share exactly the same form, yet not be one in number.  What is the principle by which two individuals differ in number alone?  This cannot be a common property. As [[Bonaventure]] later argued, there is no form of which we cannot imagine a similar one, thus there can be 'identical' twins, triplets, quadruplets and so on.  For any such form would then be common to several things, and therefore not an individual at all. What is the criterion for a thing being an individual?

In a passage much-quoted by the medievals, Aristotle attributes the cause of individuation to matter:

{{Quotation | The whole thing, such and such a form in this flesh and these bones, is Callias or Socrates; and they are different owing to their matter (for this is different), but the same in species, for the species is indivisible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

==The Middle Ages==
=== Boethius to Aquinas ===

The late Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (480–524) touches upon the subject in his [[Isagoge]], where he says that things which are individuals and are discrete only in number, differ only by accidental properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Ea vero quae individuae sunt et solo numero discrepunt, solis accidentibus distant''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Persian philosopher [[Avicenna]] (980-1037) first introduced a term which was later translated into [[Latin]] as ''signatum'', meaning 'determinate individual'.  Avicenna argues that a nature is not of itself individual, the relation between it and individuality is an accidental one, and we must look for its source not in its essence, but among accidental attributes such as quantity, quality, space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not work out any definite or detailed theory of individuation.  His successor [[Averroes]] (1126–1198) argued that matter is numerically one, since it is undetermined in itself and has no definite boundaries.  However, since it is divisible, this must be caused by quantity, and matter must therefore have the potential for determination in three dimensions (in the same way a rough and unhewn lump of marble has the potential to be sculpted into a statue).

The theories of Averroes and Avicenna had a great influence on the later theory of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1224–1274).  Aquinas never doubted the Aristotelian theory of individuation by matter, but was uncertain which of the theories of Avicenna or Averroes are correct.  He first accepted the theory of Avicenna that the principle of individuation is matter designated (''signata'') by determinate dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;''De Ente et Essentia'', c. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but later abandoned this in favour of the Averroist theory that it is matter affected by unterminated dimension which is the principle.&lt;ref&gt;''In Boethium de Trinitate'' Q.4 a2&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, he seems to have returned to the first theory when he wrote the ''Quodlibeta''.&lt;ref&gt;Quodlibet XI a6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotus to Suárez===
[[Giles of Rome]] (1243–1316) believed that individuation happens by the quantity in the matter.

[[Duns Scotus]] held that individuation comes from the numerical determination of form and matter whereby they become ''this'' form and ''this'' matter.  Individuation is distinguished from a nature by means of a [[formal distinction]] on the side of the thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Opus Oxeniensis'' dist. III q2 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Later followers of Scotus called this principle [[haecceity]] or 'thisness'.  The [[nominalist]] philosopher [[William of Ockham]] (1287–1347) regarded the principle as unnecessary and indeed meaningless, since there are no realities independent of individual things.  An individual is distinct of itself, not multiplied in a species, since species are not real (they correspond only to concepts in our mind).  His contemporary [[Durandus of Saint-Pourçain|Durandus]] held that individuation comes about through actual existence. Thus the common nature and the individual nature differ only as one conceived and one existing.&lt;ref&gt;''In Sent'' II, d3 q. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The late scholastic philosopher [[Francisco Suárez]] held, in opposition to Scotus, that the principle of individuation can only be logically distinguished from the individual being.  Every being, even an incomplete one, is individual of itself, by reason of its being a thing.  Suárez maintained that, although the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of Plato, yet they do not constitute ''in reality'' one and the same humanity; there are as many "formal unities" (in this case, humanities) as there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but only an essential or ideal unity. The formal unity, however, is not an arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists in the nature of the thing before any operation of the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysical Disputations V, sec. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rida''' ({{lang-ar|رضا}}, ''Riḍā'') is one of the lives discussed in [[Sufism]] as well as early Islamic belief. The term "''riḍā''" literally means 'the fact of being pleased or contented; contentment, approval&lt;ref&gt;Ed(s). "Riḍā." ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition''. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 8 April 2010 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0920&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;'. In religious context, this term is interpreted as ''satisfaction'' or "''perfect contentment'' with God's will or decree".&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, ''Mystical Dimensions of Islam'' (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1975), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also frequently given as a male first name in Shīʻa Muslim communities, however is it also a male name given in the [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] community, and in the [[Druze]] community. Sometimes alternately spelled: ''Ridha'', after the eighth Shīʻa Imām, ʻAlī ibn Mūsā al-Riḍā ([[Ali al-Ridha|Ali ar-Ridha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within Islam==

''Riḍā'' is often found rather vaguely within the English translation of the [[Quran|Qur'an]], and in the life accounts of [[Sufism|Sufi]] saints such as Rābiʻa al-ʻAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya ([[Rabia of Basra|Rabia al-Adawiyya]]). According to Annemarie Schimmel, author of ''Mystical Dimensions of Islam'', "riḍā is closely related to [[shukr]], or gratitude", another virtue within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Shimmel, ''Mystical Dimensions of Islam'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible related virtues would be [[sabr]], [[Maqaam|faqr]], [[tawakkul]], and [[Asceticism|zuhd]]; all coalescing to form "perfect sincerity" or ''ikhlas''.

==Within the Qur'an==

The following are some examples of possible interpretations of ''riḍā'' within the Qur'an:

*"(All) people are a single nation; so Allah raised prophets as bearers of good news and as warners, and He revealed with them the Book with truth, that it might judge between people in that in which they differed; and none but the very people who were given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them, revolting among themselves; so Allah has guided by His will those who believe to the truth about which they differed and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right path." '''(2:213)'''
*"Thus it is due to mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; so when you have decided, then place your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust." '''(3:159)'''
*"And if they were content with what Allah and His Apostle gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Apostle too; surely to Allah do we make our petition." '''(9:15)'''
*"Indeed we shall have forged a lie against Allah If we go back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from It, and it befits us not that we should go back to it, except if Allah our Lord please: Our Lord comprehends all things :n His knowledge; in Allah do we trust: Our Lord! decide between us and our people with truth; and Thou art the best of deciders." '''(7:89)'''
*"There is no harm in the Prophet doing that which Allah has ordained for him; such has been the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and the command of Allah is a decree that is made absolute." '''(33:38)'''
*"He it is Who gives life and brings death, so when He  decrees an affair, He only says to it: Be, and it is." '''(40:68)'''
*"And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not; and whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for him; surely Allah attains His purpose; Allah indeed has appointed a measure for everything." '''(65:3)'''

==Rabi'a==

The following are a couple examples of ''riḍā'' within the life of [[Rabia of Basra|Rabi'a]], a female [[Sufi]] saint:

*''"When Rabi'a grew older, her mother and father died. A great famine occurred in Basra. The sisters were separated, and Rabi'a fell into the hands of a wicked man who sold her for a few [[dirham]]s. That master ordered her to work long and hard.

''One day on the street, she fled from the indignity. She fell and broke her hand. She put her face on the ground and said,'I am a stranger without mother or father. I am captive and my hand is broken. None of this saddens me. All I need is for you to be pleased with me, to know whether you are pleased with me or not.' ''

''She heard a voice say, 'Do not be sad. Tomorrow a grandeur will be yours such that the closes of the heavenly company will take pride in you.'"''&lt;ref&gt;Attar, "Memorial of the Friends of God," in ''Early Islamic Mysticism'', ed. and trans. Michael A. Sells (New York: Paulist Press, 1996),156.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''"They asked, 'When is a servant of God contented?' ''
''She said, 'When he is as thankful for tribulation as he is for bliss.' ''
''They asked, 'When a sinner repents, does He accept him or not?' ''
''She said, 'How can he repent, unless the Lord gives him repentance and accepts him? Until He gives him repentance, he cannot repent.'"''&lt;ref&gt;Attar, Ibid, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and research==
Makkreel was born in 1939 in [[Antwerp]], Belgium, grew up in the Netherlands, and received his Ph.D. from  [[Columbia University]]. He also taught at the University of California, San Diego and was the Editor of the Journal of the History of Philosophy from 1983 till 1998.

His work has focused on the German philosophers [[Dilthey]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Makkreel is most well known for emphasizing the roles of the imagination, judgment and interpretation within Kant's critical system. The implications of Kant's conception of reflective judgment for [[hermeneutics]] and for the theory of the human sciences are also central to Makkreel's writings. In particular he has argued for the relevance of Kant's determinant-reflective judgment distinction for Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction. Some other themes that pervade Makkreel's writings include the difference between orientational and foundational principles as well as the relation between reflexive awareness and reflective consciousness.

'''Sean B. Carroll''' (born September 17, 1960) is an American [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biologist]], author, educator and executive producer. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Genetics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His studies focus on the evolution of [[cis-regulatory element]]s in the [[regulation of gene expression]] in the context of [[biological development]], using ''[[Drosophila]]'' as a model system. He is a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], of the [[American Philosophical Society]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170915195158/https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2017&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Association for Advancement of Science]], as well as a [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] investigator.

==Biography==
Carroll was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. He has stated that, as a kid, he would flip over rocks looking for snakes, and at age 11 or 12, he started keeping snakes. This activity led him to notice the patterns on the snakes and wonder how those form. Carroll got his [[B.A.]] in Biology at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], his [[Ph.D.]] in immunology from [[Tufts University]] and did [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] work at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name="fi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/sean-b-carroll |title=Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science |year=2012 |publisher=Franklin Institute |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Carroll is at the forefront of a field known as [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (also known as "evo-devo"), studying how gene changes control the evolution of body parts and patterns. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and an investigator for the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Scientists|url=http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/sean-b-carroll|website=HHMI|publisher=Howard Hughes Medical Institute|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Carroll set up a laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison "focused on understanding how genes get used in different ways to generate the diversity of form that we see".&lt;ref name="fi" /&gt; The Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology lists Carroll's interests as "Genetic control of body pattern in fruit flies, butterflies, and other animals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCMB Investigators|url=http://molbio.wisc.edu/LCMB-Faculty|website=Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology at UW-Madison|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll's team has shown, in a series of papers, how the activation of genes during the embryonic stages of the ''Drosophila'' fruit fly control the development of its wings, and has been searching for the butterfly's counterparts of these genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas|title=How Nature Makes a Butterfly's Wing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/how-nature-makes-a-butterfly-s-wing.html|accessdate=4 May 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=5 July 1994|page=C9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he received the Shaw Scientist Award from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaw Scientist Award Recipients|url=http://www.greatermilwaukeefoundation.org/about-us/awards/shaw-scientist-award-recipients/|website=Greater Milwaukee Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Carroll was interviewed by PBS as part of the [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] documentary "[[The Family That Walks on All Fours]]",&lt;ref name="nova all fours"&gt;{{cite web|title=NOVA: Family That Walks on All Fours|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/allfours/|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a family in Turkey that has members who walk on their hands and feet. In this interview, he discusses the possible genetic underpinnings of this family's condition.

From September 2009&lt;ref name="nyt shark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean B|title=In a Shark's Tooth, a New Family Tree|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/science/15creature.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2017|ref=remarkable1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to March 2013,&lt;ref name="nyt mimicry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean B|title=Solving the Puzzles of Mimicry in Nature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/science/solving-the-puzzles-of-mimicry-in-nature.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2017|ref=remarkablelast}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a column for ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "Remarkable Creatures", where he would discuss findings in animal evolution.

In 2010, he was named vice-president for science education of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;ref name="hhmi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhmi.org/about/carroll.html |title=Sean B. Carroll, HHMI Vice President for Science Education |publisher=Howard Hughes Medical Institute |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the HHMI launched a documentary film initiative to produce science features for television, to which Carroll was appointed as one of the executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HHMI Launches Documentary Film Unit to Create Science Features for Television|url=http://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-launches-documentary-film-unit-create-science-features-television|website=HHMI|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, one such film, called ''[http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/day-mesozoic-died The Day the Mesozoic Died]'', retracing the investigation that led to the discovery of the asteroid collision that triggered the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|mass extinction at the end of that Era]], was introduced by Carroll at a National Teacher's Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HHMI Premieres New Film Showcasing One of Science's Greatest Detective Stories|url=http://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-premieres-new-film-showcasing-one-sciences-greatest-detective-stories|website=HHMI|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Carroll received the ''Stephen Jay Gould Prize'' from the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stephen Jay Gould Prize|url=http://www.evolutionsociety.org/index.php?module=content&amp;type=user&amp;func=view&amp;pid=12|website=Society for the Study of Evolution|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSE 2010 Stephen Jay Gould Prize|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O71tde0Vt6Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was awarded the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Life Science from the [[Franklin Institute]] "for proposing and demonstrating that the diversity and multiplicity of animal life is largely due to the different ways that the same genes are regulated rather than to mutation of the genes themselves."&lt;ref name="fi" /&gt; 
In 2016, he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize at the Rockefeller University.&lt;ref name="lewis thomas prize"&gt;{{cite web |title=Presentation of the 2016 Lewis Thomas Prize to Sean B. Carroll |url=https://giveandjoin.rockefeller.edu/events/lewis-thomas/2016 |publisher=[[The Rockefeller University]] |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll is a proponent of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carroll | first1=Sean B | year=2008 | title=Evo-Devo and an Expanding Evolutionary Synthesis: A Genetic Theory of Morphological Evolution | url=| journal=Cell | volume=134 | issue=| pages=25–36 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.030 | pmid=18614008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, Carroll has been listed on the Advisory Council of the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |title=Advisory Council |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810112828/https://ncse.com/about/advisory-council |archivedate=2013-08-10 |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Science writer Peter Forbes, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', calls ''[[Endless Forms Most Beautiful (book)|Endless Forms Most Beautiful]]'' an "essential book" and its author "both a distinguished scientist ... and one of our great science writers." In Forbes's view, in ''The Serengeti Rules'' Carroll "manages to unite natural history with the hard science of genomics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Forbes |first1=Peter |title=The Serengeti Rules by Sean B Carroll review – a visionary book about how life works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/the-serengeti-rules-sean-b-carroll-review |accessdate=15 April 2016 |agency=The Guardian |date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise S. Mead, reviewing ''The Making of the Fittest'' for the [[National Center for Science Education]], notes that Carroll provides "some of the overwhelming evidence for evolution provided in DNA", using different lines of inquiry such as DNA sequences that code for genes no longer in use, and evidence of evolutionary change. Mead notes that evolutionary theory has predictive power, as with icefish whose ancestors had [[haemoglobin]], but no longer needing it in icy water, they have lost it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mead |first1=Louise S. |title=Review: The Making of the Fittest |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |date=2008 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=37–39 |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/28/1/review-making-fittest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Erwin|Douglas H. Erwin]], reviewing ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'' for ''Artificial Life'', remarks that life forms from ''[[Drosophila]]'' to man have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – in man's case, only some 20,000, which is about the same as a fly. He notes the "astonishing morphological diversity" of animals coming from "such a limited number of genes". He praises Carroll's "insightful and enthusiastic" style, writing in a "witty and engaging" way, pulling the reader into the complexities of [[Hox (gene)|Hox]] and [[PAX-6]], as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms, and much else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas J. |title=Book Review: Endless Forms Most Beautiful |journal=Artificial Life |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sin Suk-ju''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 신숙주, [[hanja]]: 申叔舟; August 2, 1417 &amp;ndash; July 23, 1475) was a [[Korean people|Korean]] politician  during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. He served as Prime Minister from 1461 to 1466 and again from 1471 to 1475.

Shin was an accomplished [[polyglot]], and was particularly well educated in the [[Chinese language]].&lt;ref name="h294"&gt;Handel (2014): 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as a personal linguistic expert to [[King Sejong]], and was intimately involved in the creation and application of the Korean alphabet known in modern times as [[Hangul]].&lt;ref name="h294" /&gt;  Sin used the newly created hangul system to create an accurate transcription of spoken [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Mandarin Chinese]] in 15th century [[Ming dynasty]] China.&lt;ref name="h294"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Coblin|first= W. South|year= 2000|title=A Brief History of Mandarin|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=120|issue=4|pages=537–552|jstor=606615}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These transcriptions haven proven accurate and reliable, and his transcriptions are now "an invaluable source of information on the pronunciations of Ming-era [Mandarin]."&lt;ref name="h294" /&gt;

{{Tax protest in the United States}}
{{UStaxation}}
'''Tax protesters''' in the United States advance a number of '''conspiracy arguments''' asserting that [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|courts]] and various [[List of United States federal agencies|agencies]] within the federal government—primarily the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS)—are involved in a deception deliberately designed to [[wikt:procure|procure]] from individuals or entities their wealth or profits in [[wikt:contravention|contravention]] of law.  Conspiracy arguments, though related to, are distinct from [[Tax protester constitutional arguments|constitutional]], [[Tax protester statutory arguments|statutory]], and [[Tax protester administrative arguments|administrative]] arguments.  Proponents of such [[argument]]s contend that all three branches of the United States government are working [[wikt:covertly|covertly]] to [[Fraud|defraud]] the taxpayers of the United States through the illegal imposition, assessment and collection of a [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]].

==Conspiracy arguments, in general==
Tax protester [[Irwin Schiff]], following his criminal [[conviction (law)|conviction]] for tax fraud that resulted in the imposition of a 13-year prison sentence, released a statement asserting in part that "the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental, criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law". Schiff's web site continues to state: "Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when Congress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in conspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice {{sic}} prosecutors have been illegally and criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection with a tax that nobody owes."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.paynoincometax.com/ www.paynoincometax.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223725/http://www.paynoincometax.com/ |date=2015-08-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One tax protester web site, called www.tax-freedom.com, quotes from an article by [[Milton William Cooper|William Cooper]] titled "BATF/IRS - Criminal Fraud", from the publication ''Veritas'' (issue no. 6, September 1995), as follows:
{{quote|Investigation of the alleged Internal Revenue Service and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] has disclosed a broad, premeditated conspiracy to defraud the Citizens of the United States of America. Examination of the [[United States Code]], the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], the [[United States Statutes at Large|Statutes at Large]], [[Congressional Record]], the [[Federal Register]], and Internal Revenue manuals too numerous to list, reveals a crime of such magnitude that words cannot adequately describe the betrayal of the American people. What we uncovered has clearly been designed to circumvent the limitations of the Constitution for the United States of America and to implement the [[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]] within the 50 States. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed that, in the effort to create a classless society, a "graduated income tax" could be used as a weapon to destroy the middle class. &amp;hellip; Through the clever use of language, the government promotes the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tax-freedom.com/origins.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119021540/http://www.tax-freedom.com/origins.txt |archivedate=2006-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claims made in support of the income tax conspiracy include:
*The courts rely only on the many cases where tax protesters lost, and ignore those few where tax protesters prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Evans, [http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#suppression Tax Protester FAQ arguments about judges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502182441/http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html |date=2016-05-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The gold fringe around the United States flag, as displayed in all courts, designates them as [[Admiralty court]]s, which cannot hear other kinds of cases, or signal that the court is operating under [[martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;American Patriot Friends Network Accessed 16 October 2008 {{cite web |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/flag.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010011901/http://www.apfn.org/apfn/flag.htm |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No court has ever upheld this argument, as neither the presence (or absence) of a flag (or of any other standard or element of decor), nor the fringe on a flag (which has no [[heraldry|heraldic]] or [[vexillology|vexillological]] significance), has any bearing whatsoever on the jurisdiction of a court. In ''United States v. Greenstreet'', the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted:
{{quote|Defendant Greenstreet's response to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment identifies this Court as an 'Admiralty Court' without further discussing his allegation. If his reference is to be construed as a jurisdictional challenge, his motion is denied. Others have attempted to persuade the judiciary that fringe on a United States flag denotes a court of admiralty. In light of the fact that this Court has such a flag in its courtroom, the issue is addressed. The concept behind the theory the proponent asserts is that if a courtroom is adorned with a flag which happens to be fringed around the edges, such decor indicates that the court is one of admiralty jurisdiction exclusively. To think that a fringed flag adorning the courtroom somehow limits this Court's jurisdiction is frivolous &amp;hellip; Unfortunately for Defendant Greenstreet, decor is not a determinant for jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Greenstreet'', 912 F.Supp. 224 (N.D. Tex. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==="Capital letters" argument===
{{Main|Strawman theory}}

Some tax protesters (and occasionally persons brought before courts&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12471068116002246140&amp;q=united+states+v.+stinson&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_vis=1 ''United States v. Stinson (2005)]. Retrieved Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that because the titles of court cases identify the parties in all [[capital letter]]s, the persons thus identified are "fictitious entities". In other words, a court hearing a case titled "STATE v. JOHN Q. SMITH" has no authority over the defendant, "John Q. Smith", because the capitalization of the name means the court is addressing a person who does not exist. Such an argument was made by [[Eddie Ray Kahn]], a co-defendant of [[Wesley Snipes]] in the latter's high-profile tax evasion case. Kahn "made several missteps and peculiar motions. For example, he sought to be immediately freed because the indictment lists his name in all capital letters, and he claimed U.S. attorneys have no jurisdiction because Florida supposedly was never ceded to the federal government". The court denied these motions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22637256/ Stakes high for Snipes in Florida tax fraud case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116074019/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22637256/ |date=2008-01-16 }}, [[MSNBC]], January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

No court has ever upheld such an argument. See, e.g. ''United States v. Frech''&lt;ref&gt;149 F.3d 1192 (10th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; ("Defendants' assertion that the capitalization of their names in court documents constitutes [[constructive fraud]], thereby depriving the district court of jurisdiction and venue, is without any basis in law or fact"); ''United States v. Washington''&lt;ref&gt;947 F.Supp. 87, 92 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; ("defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because 'KURT WASHINGTON,' spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is 'Kurt Washington.' This contention is baseless"). See also ''United States v. Ford''&lt;ref&gt;2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,670 (D.N.M. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; (taxpayer's argument—that an IRS summons was invalid because the IRS capitalized all the letters in the taxpayer's name in the caption of a petition—was ruled to be frivolous). Similar arguments have been raised unsuccessfully about things such as the presence or absence of punctuation, or of a middle name or middle initial.

==Conspiracy theory regarding government employees and tax forms==
One group, calling itself [[We the People Foundation|"We the People"]], has stated that government personnel are engaged in a conspiracy in connection with Federal tax forms and "OMB [Office of Management and Budget] control numbers" in connection with a criminal tax case involving a tax protester:
{{quote|In sum, the PRA [the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]]] requires that all government agencies display valid OMB control numbers and certain disclosures directly on all information collection forms that the public is requested to file. [The defendant's] sole defense was he was not required to file an IRS [[Form 1040]] because it displays an invalid OMB control number.

Government officials knew that if the case went to trial, it would expose the fraudulent, counterfeit 1040. They also must have known that a trial would expose the ongoing conspiracy between OMB and IRS to publish 1040 forms each year that those agencies knew were in violation of the PRA. That would raise the issue that the Form 1040, with its invalid control number, is being used by the Government to cover up the underlying constitutional tort -- that is, the enforcement of a direct, unapportioned tax on the labor of every working man, women and child in America.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.givemeliberty.org/ on 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Conspiracy arguments involving Zionism and Freemasonry==
One convicted tax protester, [[Edward Lewis Brown]], has charged that law enforcement officials who surrounded his property in a standoff over his refusal to surrender after his conviction were part of a "[[Zionism|Zionist]], [[Illuminati]], [[Freemasonry|Free Mason]] movement," and that the federal government had no jurisdiction in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Senz, "Ed Brown says Feds have no jurisdiction in New Hampshire," ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', June 8, 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Ed+Brown+says+feds+have+no+jurisdiction+in+New+Hampshire&amp;articleId=844a9c5f-5475-4d71-a149-102ea693ee4b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130953/http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Ed+Brown+says+feds+have+no+jurisdiction+in+New+Hampshire&amp;articleId=844a9c5f-5475-4d71-a149-102ea693ee4b |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Hampshire Union Leader'' also reported that "the Browns believe the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the federal income tax are part of a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|deliberate plot perpetrated by Freemasons]] to control the American people and eventually the world."&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Senz, "Browns say they will either walk free, or die," ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', June 19, 2007 at {{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Browns+say+they+will+either+walk+free%2c+or+die&amp;articleId=a02db0e8-8042-474e-8a82-1fb5dc2f6306 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012005816/http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Browns+say+they+will+either+walk+free%2C+or+die&amp;articleId=a02db0e8-8042-474e-8a82-1fb5dc2f6306 |archivedate=2007-10-12 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on February 2, 2007, on the radio show "Constitution for the Defense," Ed Brown said:
{{quote|I'm not quite sure you understand the ramifications of what's going on right now. This is massive. This is international. We are fed up with the Zionist Illuminati. That's what this is all about. Loud and clear. Zionist Illuminati. Lawyers, whatever they are, okay, it's going to stop. And if the judge is a member of that, I know that McAuliffe [the Federal judge in Brown's tax case] is, I know that U.S. Attorney Colantuono is, they'd better stop. This is a warning. You can do whatever you want to me. My job is to get the message out, and I'm getting the message out, and I'm warning you guys - not you guys [referring to the radio show hosts], them - to cease and desist their unlawful activity in this country and every other country because once this thing starts, we're going to seek them out and hunt them down. And we're going to bring them to justice. So anybody wishes to join them, you go right ahead and join them. But I promise you, long after I'm gone, they're going to seek out every one of you and your bloodline.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Sanger-Katz, "Browns on the record," ''Concord Monitor'', April 27, 2007.[http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070427/REPOSITORY/704270339/0/BUSINESS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213945/http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070427%2FREPOSITORY%2F704270339%2F0%2FBUSINESS |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The standoff between Brown and law enforcement officials ended with his imprisonment after his arrest in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press,
"U.S. Marshal: Convicted Tax Evaders Arrested," Oct. 4, 2007, WCAX-TV Vermont, at {{cite web |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=7172194&amp;nav=4QcS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120215655/http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=7172194&amp;nav=4QcS |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Convicted Tax Evaders Arrested in New Hampshire: Couple who holed up at compound for months taken into custody," Oct. 4, 2007, MSNBC, at {{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21142564/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008235122/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21142564/ |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/05/tax.standoff/index.html|title=Feds tricked holed-up tax evaders - CNN.com|first=From  Deb Feyerick and Eden Pontz|last=CNN|date=|website=www.cnn.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011023404/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/05/tax.standoff/index.html|archivedate=2007-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments about money==
Some protesters have argued that [[Federal Reserve note]]s (better known as dollar bills) are not actually money, because the [[Constitution]] only permits the government to "coin" money, and requires that such money be exchangeable for gold or silver; therefore, printed bills are instead [[symbols]] for use in [[barter]]ing, and being paid in dollars is not the receipt of taxable income.  This argument was brought before a court in ''Wilson v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;1998 WL 937356 (D. Colo. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The court responded:
{{quote|The contention that paper money is illegal has been consistently rejected. … Congress has exercised this power by delegation to the federal reserve system.  12 U.S.C. section 411. Federal reserve notes are legal tender for all debts, including taxes. 31 U.S.C. section 392 [now {{usc|31|5103}}]; ''Milam v. U.S.'' [[case citation|524 F.2d 629]] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir.]] 1974). The United States Constitution, art. 1, section 10, 'prohibits the states from declaring legal tender anything other than gold or silver, but does not limit Congress' power to declare what shall be legal tender for all debts.' ''U.S. v. Rifen'', [[case citation|577 F.2d 1111, 1112]] ([[8th Cir.]] 1978).  Since Congress has done so, there can be no valid challenge to the legality of federal reserve notes. ''United States v. Anderson'', [[case citation|584 F.2d 369, 374]] ([[10th Cir.]] 1978).}}

Other occasionally encountered arguments from tax protesters include the notion that U.S. currency is valueless or unauthorized by the Constitution because the currency is [[fiat money]] untied to the [[gold standard]]. No court has upheld the validity of that argument.

The argument that Federal reserve notes are not taxable income when paid to a taxpayer because the notes are not gold and silver and may not be redeemed for gold and silver, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous Federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6702}}, as amended by section 407 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922 (Dec. 20, 2006). See Notice 2008-14, I.R.B. 2008-4 (Jan. 14, 2008), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (superseding Notice 2007-30); see also Notice 2010-33, I.R.B. 2010-17 (April 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged immunity or exemptions for minority groups==
Arguments have been made asserting that members of certain historically disadvantaged minority groups are not obliged to pay taxes. Such arguments have been made, and rejected, with respect to [[African American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Avery-Carter v. Commissioner'', 66 T.C.M. (CCH) 1596 (1993) (rejecting argument that African Americans are not obligated to pay taxes).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Hill v. Commissioner'', 70 T.C.M. (CCH) 13 (1995) (rejecting argument that Native Americans are not obligated to pay taxes).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[native Hawaiians]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marsh v. Commissioner'', 79 T.C.M. (CCH) 1327 (2000) (rejecting that native Hawaiians are not obligated to pay taxes), aff'd, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 1354 (9th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments have been made in countries other than the United States. For example, such an argument was rejected in the case of a [[Māori people|Māori]] citizen seeking to avoid payment of taxes in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kaihau v. New Zealand Inland Rev. Dept.'' [1990] 3 NZLR 344 (Highcourt, Auckland, 1990) (rejecting argument that Maoris are not obligated to pay New Zealand taxes).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil liability==
With respect to the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the distinction between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, the amount of money due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.

A related concept is that under American jurisprudence, different standards of proof are required in civil and criminal proceedings. Normally, to be convicted of a crime, the defendant must have had a specific [[mens rea]], or guilty mental state. For criminal violations of the income tax law, this generally means that the prohibited conduct (whether failure to file, failure to pay, or engaging in some affirmative act to evade the tax), must have been accompanied by an intentional violation of a legal duty of which the defendant was aware. By contrast, to establish civil liability to pay the tax, no ''mens rea'' on the part of the defendant is required to be proven.

'''Tobias Barreto de Meneses''' (June 7, 1839 – June 26, 1889) was a Brazilian poet, philosopher, jurist and literary critic.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; He is famous for creating the "[[Condorism]]" and revolutionizing Brazilian Romanticism and poetry. He is patron of the 38th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Life==
Barreto was born in Vila de Campos do Rio Real (renamed "Tobias Barreto" in his honor in 1909), a town in the southern part of Sergipe. He learnt his first letters with Manuel Joaquim de Oliveira Campos, and he also studied [[Latin]] with [[priest]] Domingos Quirino. Barreto was so dedicated to the course that, in the future, he would become a [[Latin]] professor in [[Itabaiana]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

In 1861 he left for Bahia in order to attend a [[seminary]]; however, having soon realized that it was not his vocation, he quit. Between 1864 and 1865 he became a private tutor in many subjects. He also tried to become a Latin (and later [[Philosophy]]) teacher at the Ginásio Pernambucano, but was not successful at the institution.

Barreto was an enthusiast of the [[German culture]], such an interest being induced by the reading of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Ludwig Büchner]]. Following Haeckel, he was a noted early [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; For this reason he established a [[German language]]-newspaper, ''Der Deutsche Kämpfer'' ([[German language|German]] for ''The German Fighter''). It was short-lived and had little influence.

Moving away to [[Escada, Pernambuco|Escada]], he married a [[colonel]]'s daughter. He spent ten years there before returning to Recife. He died there in 1889 at a friend's house.

''The Journal of Tourism Studies'', 1(2), 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; seminal article suggested that this type of tourism was much larger than official estimates suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''&lt;/ref&gt;  Most official data collections differentiate travel as being for either leisure, business, or VFR purposes.  In many destinations, VFR is the largest or second-largest form of travel by size.  Definitions have been traditionally lacking due to the complexities involved in understanding VFR travel. VFR travellers can state a VFR purpose of visit but that does not necessarily mean that they are staying with those friends / relatives.  Similarly, they may be accommodated by friends / relatives although have a different purpose of visit.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''&lt;/ref&gt; 

One definition put forward has been "VFR travel is a form of travel involving a visit whereby either (or both) the purpose of the trip or the type of accommodation involves visiting friends and / or relatives" &lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2007). "VFR Travel - an examination of the expenditures of VFR travellers and their hosts." ''Current Issues in Tourism'', 10 (4), p.369&lt;/ref&gt;  This has subsequently been developed into a VFR definitional model to describe it visually.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

VFR expenditures tend to be quite broad; spread widely throughout the community rather than confined to the narrow tourism sector (McKercher, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;McKercher, B. (1995). An examination of host involvement in VFR travel. ''Proceedings from the National Tourism and Hospitality Conference 1995''. Council for Australian University Tourism and Hospitality Education, 246-255.&lt;/ref&gt; In some expenditure categories, VFR travellers have been shown to outspend non-VFR travellers (Seaton &amp; Palmer, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, A. &amp; Palmer, C. (1997). Understanding VFR Tourism behaviour: the first five years of the United Kingdom tourism survey. ''Tourism Management'', 18(6), 345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison, Verginis et al., 2000) &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, A., Verginis, C., &amp; O’Leary, J. (2000).

'''''What the Koran Really Says: Language, Text and Commentary''''' (2002) is a book edited and translated by [[Ibn Warraq]] and published by [[Prometheus Books]].  The book is a collection of classical essays, some translated for the first time, that provide commentary on the traditions and language of the [[Koran]], discussing its grammatical and logical discontinuities, its Syriac and Hebrew foreign vocabulary, and its possible [[Christian]], Coptic and Qumranic sources.

Within the book is an article written by [[Gerd R. Puin]] titled "Observations on Early Qu'ran Manuscripts in Sana'a".  Professor Puin is a German scholar and an authority on Qur'anic historical [[orthography]], the study and scholarly interpretation of ancient manuscripts, and a specialist in [[Arabic calligraphy]].  Professor Puin was the head of a restoration project, commissioned by the Yemeni government, which spent a significant amount of time examining the ancient Qur'anic manuscripts discovered in Sana'a, [[Yemen]], in 1972.  In Mr. Warraq's book, Professor Puin has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"My idea is that the Qur’an is a kind of cocktail of texts that were not all understood even at the time of Muhammad. Many of them may even be a hundred years older than Islam itself. The Qur’an claims for itself that it is ‘mubeen’, or clear. But [contrary to popular belief] if you look at it, you will notice that every fifth sentence or so simply does not make sense…the fact is that a fifth of the Qur’anic text is just incomprehensible. If the Qur’an is not comprehensible, if it can’t even be understood in Arabic, then it’s not translatable into any language. That is why Muslims are afraid. Since the Qur’an claims repeatedly to be clear but is not - there is an obvious and serious contradiction. Something else must be going on".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews==
In his review of the book, political scientist [[As'ad AbuKhalil]] states that Ibn Warraq collected old writings by Orientalists who have been long discredited and added that "the more rigid and biased the Orientalists, the better for Warraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = AbuKhalil | first = As'ad| year = 2004| title = "The Islam Industry" and Scholarship: Review Article| journal = Middle East Journal | volume = 58| issue = 1| pages = 130–137| jstor = 4329978| publisher = Middle East Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
