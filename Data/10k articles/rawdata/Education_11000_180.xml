In Portuguese middle-schools, a five-point grading scale is used, where:

* 5 (very good or excellent) is the best possible grade (90-100%),
* 4 (good) (70-89%),
* 3 (satisfactory) indicates "average" performance (50-69%),
* 2 (unsatisfactory) (20-49%),
* 1 (poor) is the lowest possible grade (0-19%). 

In high-schools and universities, a 20-point grading scale is used. When it is the case of the final grade of an academic degree, each grade is assigned a qualitative mark by degree (depending on the university, the students have at most a final grade of 16 or 17, being almost impossible for students to have a final score between 18-20): &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decreto-Lei n.o 42/2005 de 22 de Fevereiro|url=https://dre.pt/application/file/606224|website=Diário da República Eletrónico|accessdate=21 July 2015|page=1494|language=Portuguese|format=PDF|date=22 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andorra National Library''' ({{lang-ca|Biblioteca Nacional d'Andorra}}) was §founded in 1930, then re-opened in 1974.&lt;ref name=BibHist&gt;{{cite web|title=La Biblioteca Nacional|url=http://www.bibliotecanacional.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=5|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional d'Andorra|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in Casa Bauró,&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt; an old [[manor house]] in the Andorran capital, [[Andorra la Vella]].&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt; Amongst other functions, it is the [[legal deposit]] and copyright library for [[Andorra]].&lt;ref name=BibLegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Dipòsit legal|url=http://www.bibliotecanacional.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=22|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional d'Andorra|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Andorra National Library was created on September 8, 1930&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt; with the aim of providing book lending services to the people of the valleys of [[Andorra]] (''les Valls d'Andorra''). It was initially housed in the hall of lost steps (''sala dels passos perduts'') in the [[Casa de la Vall]] (the headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra]]). Its creation resulted from an initiative of the Andorran Society of Barcelona Residents (''Sociedat Andorrana de Residents a Barcelona'') together with contributions from various private individuals, and followed in the wake of the founding of other socio-cultural entities such as the Association for the Protection of Catalan Education (''Associació Protectora de l'Ensenyança Catalana'').&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt;

The new library was established in 1974. The initial collection of around 2,500 volumes came mainly from the library of the Casa de la Vall, but also included donations from the Catalan Book Exposition, donations from various publishing houses, and works acquired by the General Council of Andorra.&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt;

In 1986, after being housed in various locations, the library moved to a building called Prada Casadet. Although this building housed both the National Library and the Public Library of the Government of Andorra at the time, a small room was dedicated exclusively to the national collection.&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt;

In 1996, with the collections having grown considerably, it was decided to restructure and separate the services. The National Library of Andorra was therefore relocated to a building called Casa Bauró whilst the rest of the collection remained at Prada Casadet.&lt;ref name=BibHist/&gt;

In addition to its other roles, the Andorra National Library has acted as the national [[ISBN]] agency for Andorra since 1987.&lt;ref name=BibAnd&gt;{{cite web|title=Agència d'Andorra de l'ISBN|url=http://www.bibliotecanacional.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional d'Andorra|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era lending books largely happens by Public Libraries. Generally worldwide [[public libraries]] are [[non-profit organizations]] offering book lending services free to their patrons and are generally funded through taxes and donations or by the state.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grants &amp; Related Programs - State Aid to Public Libraries|url = http://mblc.state.ma.us/grants/state_aid/|website = mblc.state.ma.us|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Appropriations {{!}} Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|url = http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/libraryfunding|website = www.ala.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are accessible to general public and are run by civil servants, state employees, or volunteers.

Besides the public libraries, private libraries also provide lending services, and are usually run by individuals, associations, or by corporate organizations and universities. [[Private libraries]] usually require a subscription or membership to the library (paid or unpaid) and provide services specific to the organization, area or university.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

==Book rentals==
Historically before the [[industrial revolution]], books were too expensive for commoners to buy, and there were businesses which made profit by renting out books for a fee. ''[[Kashi-hon]]'' in [[Japan]] was one of such businesses. In modern era in developing and developed nations, for-profit book rental services have started to lend physical [[books]], [[audiobook]] CDs, e-books, and audiobook MP3s through stores and/or by an online (website) interface after popularization of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)|url = http://www.w3.org/|website = www.w3.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most book rental companies provide books with doorstep delivery using logistic services. Following the popular [[Netflix]] model for video rental, many book companies have applied features such as unlimited rentals, free shipping, and no late fees to their book distribution services.

== Book rental models ==

=== Based on rental method ===
Based on the rental method the book rental companies can be categorized into two subgroups:
# Book rental companies having a subscription-based models where a monthly or periodic subscription fee is charged and members can rent a number of books based on the subscription. 
# Book rental companies taking a fraction of book cost as rent. This is the most prevalent model in textbook and college book renting.

=== Based on type of book rented ===
Based on the type of books that the book rental service rents following classification can be done:
# Physical or Printed Books. The category can further be subdivided into 
## Companies primarily renting novels, fiction and story books. 
# E-book renters. Many companies renting physical books also rent e-books. Since e-book rental distribution rights are totally different from physical books most of the smaller companies are not able to rent e-books for standard publishers like [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Prentice Hall]], [[Cengage Learning|Cengage]] etc due to high license fees that needs to be paid for rental rights.

The '''Center for Science and Culture''' ('''CSC'''), formerly known as the '''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture''' ('''CRSC'''), is part of the [[Discovery Institute]] (DI), a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] [[think tank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse - A Conversation With Barbara Forrest |date=February 2005 |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2005-church-state/featured/intelligent-design-creationism%E2%80%99s-trojan-horse-a |journal=Church &amp; State |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Unabridged interview |publisher=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] |issn=2163-3746 |accessdate=2014-05-16 |quote=Patricia O'Connell Killen, a religion professor at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma whose work centers around the regional religious identity of the Pacific Northwest, recently wrote that 'religiously inspired think tanks such as the conservative evangelical Discovery Institute' are part of the 'religious landscape' of that area.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]]. The CSC lobbies for the inclusion of [[creationism]] in the form of [[intelligent design]] (ID) in [[State school#United States|public school]] science curricula as an explanation for the origins of [[life]] and the [[universe]] while casting doubt on the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="ForrestMay2007Paper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf |title=Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals |last=Forrest |first=Barbara |authorlink=Barbara Forrest |date=May 2007 |website=[[Center for Inquiry]] |publisher=Center for Inquiry |location=Washington, D.C. |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These positions have been rejected by the [[scientific community]], which identifies intelligent design as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[neo-creationism]], whereas the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of [[scientific consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |date=July 28, 2006 |title=Finding the Evolution in Medicine |url=http://nihrecord.nih.gov/pdfs/2006/07282006Record.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[NIH Record]] |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |volume=58 |issue=15 |page=8 |issn=1057-5871 |accessdate=2014-05-16 |quote=...99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Science and Culture serves as the hub of the [[intelligent design movement]]. Nearly all of prominent proponents of intelligent design are either CSC advisors, officers, or fellows. [[Stephen C. Meyer]], a former vice president of the Discovery Institute and founder of the CSC, serves as a Senior Fellow, and [[Phillip E. Johnson]] is the Program Advisor. Johnson is commonly presented as the movement's "father" and architect of the Center's [[Wedge strategy]] and "[[Teach the Controversy]]" campaign, as well as the [[Santorum Amendment]].

== History ==
{{Intelligent Design}}
In 1987, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' against ''[[creation science]]'' being taught in United States public school science classes. In reaction, the term ''intelligent design'' was coined as a substitute in drafts of the textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', which was published in 1989, beginning the campaigning of the intelligent design movement under the leadership of ''Pandas'' editor [[Charles Thaxton]].&lt;ref name="DarkSyde"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Forrest |first=Barbara C. |interviewer=Andrew Stephen |title=Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/03/11/193288/-Know-Your-Creationists-Know-Your-Allies |work=[[Daily Kos]] |publisher=Kos Media, LLC |location=Berkeley, CA |date=March 11, 2006 |oclc=59226519 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' ruling also inspired Phillip E. Johnson to begin anti-evolution campaigning. He met Stephen C. Meyer, and through him was introduced to others who were developing what became the Wedge strategy, including [[Michael Denton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratzsch |first=Del |date=January 2005 |title=How Not to Critique Intelligent Design Theory |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=1177 |format=PDF |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |type=Book review of ''God, The Devil, and Darwin'' by [[Niall Shanks]] |location=Utrecht, Netherlands |publisher=Igitur Publishing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=52–69 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Behe]] and [[William A. Dembski]], with Johnson becoming the de facto leader of the group. By 1995, Johnson was opposing the [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|methodological naturalism]] of [[science]] in which "The Creator belongs to the realm of religion, not scientific investigation," and promoting "[[Theistic science#Johnson|theistic realism]]" which "assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God" and expects "this 'fact' of creation to have empirical, observable consequences."&lt;ref name="waw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forrest |first=Barbara |editor-last=Pennock |editor-first=Robert T |editor-link=Robert T.

In December 1993, [[Bruce Chapman]], president and founder of the Discovery Institute, noticed an essay in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' by Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer [[Dean H. Kenyon]] taught intelligent design creationism in introductory classes.&lt;ref name="wilgoren"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilgoren |first=Jodi |date=August 21, 2005 |title=Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-05-06 |ref=Wilgoren 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer_Insight"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Stephen C. |authorlink=Stephen C.

Meyer was an old friend of Discovery Institute co-founder [[George Gilder]], and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to [[materialism]]. In the summer of 1995, Chapman and Meyer met a representative of [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]] Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science, recalls being asked "What could you do if you had some financial backing?"&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

The '''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture''', as it was originally named, grew out of a conference called "The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture" that the Discovery Institute organised in the summer of 1995. It was founded in 1996  by the Discovery Institute with funding provided by Fieldstead &amp; Company, the Stewardship Foundation, Howard Ahmanson, Jr. and the Maclellan Foundation.&lt;ref name="waw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Major grants help establish Center for Renewal of Science and Culture |url=http://www.discovery.org/center.html |location=Seattle, WA |publisher=Discovery Institute |date=August 10, 1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961103063611/http://www.discovery.org/center.html |archivedate=1996-11-03 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the Center's name in 2002 reflects its attempt to present itself as less religiously motivated in the public's eye.&lt;ref name="acadme"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=January–February 2005 |title=Wedging Creationism into the Academy |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JF/Feat/forr.htm |journal=Academe |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors]] |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729032153/http://aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/JF/Feat/forr.htm |archivedate=2007-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolving banners on the CRSC/CSC's website pictorially parallel these verbal efforts to disassociate the site from its overtly religious origins.&lt;ref name=banners&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/evolving-banners-at-discovery-institute |title=Evolving Banners at the Discovery Institute |date=August 28, 2002 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |type=Blog |accessdate=2018-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929041353/https://ncse.com/creationism/general/evolving-banners-at-discovery-institute |archivedate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "renewal" in its name referred to its stated goal of "renewing" American culture by grounding society's major institutions, especially education, in religion as outlined in the [[Wedge strategy#Wedge Document|Wedge Document]].

==CSC's Wedge strategy==
{{Main|Wedge strategy}}
An internal CSC report dating from 1998 which outlined a five-year plan for fostering broader acceptance of ID was leaked to the public in 1999. This plan became known as the Wedge strategy. The Wedge Document explained the CSC's key aims are "To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies"  and to "replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God."

The document sets as "Five-Year Goals" "To see intelligent design theory as an accepted ''alternative'' in the sciences and scientific research being done from the perspective of design theory" and notably "To see major new debates in education, life issues, legal and personal responsibility pushed to the front of the national agenda." This was seen in the following years, with public debates over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms taking place in many states as part of the Teach the Controversy campaign.

If the CSC's strategy is successful, within twenty years the goals are "To see intelligent design theory as the ''dominant'' perspective in science." and "To see design theory permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life." The CSC has responded to controversy regarding the Wedge Document, saying "Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the 'Wedge' document..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2101 |title=The "Wedge Document": So What? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 3, 2006 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/f/349 |title=The 'Wedge Document': 'So What?' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2003 |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CSC campaigns==

===Teach the Controversy===
{{Main|Teach the Controversy}}
The CSC's Teach the Controversy campaign seeks to promote the teaching of "the full range of scientific views" on evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2112 |title=Key Resources for Parents and School Board Members |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 7, 2014 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; on "unresolved issues" and the "scientific weaknesses of evolutionary theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutScienceEducationPolicy |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=CSC - Top Questions: Questions About Science Education Policy |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the CSC's campaign say that they have manufactured the controversy and that they promote the false perception that evolution is "in crisis" and is a "dying theory."&lt;ref name="ForrestMay2007Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg89"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

"ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the ''controversy'', but not ID itself, should be taught in science class.

Others insist that teachers have absolute freedom within their classrooms and cannot be disciplined for teaching non-scientific 'alternatives' to evolution. A number of bills require that students be taught to 'critically analyze' evolution or to understand 'the controversy.' But there is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of the theory of evolution. The current controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution is not a scientific one. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221125539/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy has been to move from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, all the while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. The CSC is the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign. Examples of Teach the Controversy in action were the [[Kansas evolution hearings]], the Santorum Amendment, [[Intelligent design in politics#2002 Ohio Board of Education|2002 Ohio Board of Education intelligent design controversy]], and the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover Area School District intelligent design controversy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The CSC believe that the program and curricula they advocate presents evidence both for and against evolution and then encourages students to evaluate the arguments themselves. Casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as an academic and scholarly controversy was proposed by Phillip E. Johnson of the Discovery Institute in his book ''The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism'' (2000). In his book, he writes of the 1999–2000 Kansas evolution hearings controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms: "What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to 'teach the controversy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E.

In its early years, the CSC (then called the CRSC) offered science curriculum that assured teachers that its "Web curriculum can be appropriated without textbook adoption wars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/crsc/scied/present/topics/political.htm |title=Web Curriculum Lowers Political Hurdles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010123141300/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/scied/present/topics/political.htm |archivedate=2001-01-23 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had the net effect of encouraging ID sympathetic teachers to side-step standard textbook adoption procedures. Anticipating a test case, Discovery Institute director Stephen C. Meyer along with David K. DeWolf and Mark Edward DeForrest published in the ''[[S.J. Quinney College of Law#Scholarly publications|Utah Law Review]]'' a legal strategy for winning judicial sanction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/1109 |title=Santorum Language on Evolution |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ULR_2000-1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeWolf |first1=David K |last2=Meyer |first2=Stephen C. |last3=DeForrest |first3=Mark Edward |date=Winter 2000 |title=Teaching the Origins Controversy: Science, Or Religion, Or Speech? |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/utlawrev/id/450/rec/167 |format=PDF |journal=[[S.J.

According to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute spends more than $1 million [[United States dollar|USD]] a year for research, polls, lobbying and media pieces that support intelligent design and their Teach the Controversy strategy.&lt;ref name="wp_slevin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Slevin |first=Peter |date=March 14, 2005 |title=Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A01 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that since 2004 there have been 78 campaigns in 31 states to either Teach the Controversy or include intelligent design in science curricula, twice the number seen in 2002–2003.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

===Intelligent design in higher education===
The cultivation of support for ID and its social and political agenda in higher education is a very active part of CSC's strategy. The CSC has claimed that established scholars in the scientific community support intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign |title=CSC - Top Questions: Questions About Intelligent Design |website=Center for Science and Culture |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSC-recommended curricula benefits from special status at number of religious schools. [[Biola University]] and [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] are listed on the [[Access Research Network]] website as "ID Colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arn.org/college.htm |title=ID Colleges |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Access Research Network]] |location=Colorado Springs, CO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010224032/http://www.arn.org/college.htm |archivedate=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center]] (IDEA), which began as a student organization at the [[University of California, San Diego]], helps establish student IDEA clubs on university and high school campuses. The Intelligent Design and Undergraduate Research Center, ARN's student division, also recruits and supports followers at universities. Campus youth ministries play an active role in bringing ID to university campuses through lectures by ID leaders Phillip E. Johnson, William A. Dembski, [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], Michael Behe and others. This activity takes place outside university science departments.

Several public universities, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[University of New Mexico]] have had intelligent design often as freshman seminars, honors courses and other courses outside required curricula in which instructors have wider latitude regarding course content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McMurtrie |first=Beth |date=December 21, 2001 |title=Darwinism Under Attack |url=http://www.arn.org/docs2/news/darwinismunderattack012502.htm |newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education Inc. |issn=0009-5982 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research fellowships===
The CSC offers fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for "support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields."&lt;ref name="fellowship_info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellowshipInfo.php |title=Information about Center Fellows and the Research Fellowship Program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412164216/http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellowshipInfo.php# |archive-date=2014-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published reports state that the CSC has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since its founding in 1996.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

Among the Center's publications are 50 books on intelligent design, such as those by William A. Dembski, and two documentary films, ''[[Unlocking the Mystery of Life]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Privileged Planet#Film|The Privileged Planet]]'' (2004), the later based on the book of the same name written by senior fellows [[Jay Richards|Jay W. Richards]] and [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]].

Since its founding in 1996, the CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million &lt;!-- explain where the money comes from--&gt;on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can ponder intelligent design. Over those nine years, $792,585 was spent to finance laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology or biophysics, while $93,828 was spent to help graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history and philosophy.&lt;ref name="wilgoren" /&gt;

The results of this are found in Discovery Institute-authored science class curricula, "model lesson plans," that are at the center of many of the [[Intelligent design movement#Intelligent design movement in the political arena|current debates]] about including intelligent design in public school science classes. These are promoted by the CSC which urges states and school boards to include criticism of evolution science lessons, to "[[Teach the Controversy]]," rather than actually teach intelligent design which is susceptible to legal challenges on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.

==Controversies==
In May 2005, the Discovery Institute donated $16,000 to the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]], and by museum policy, this minimum donation allowed them to celebrate their donation inside the museum in a gathering. The Discovery Institute decided to screen ''The Privileged Planet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2170 |title=Privileged Planet--New Science Documentary Explores Earth's Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 20, 2004 |website=Discovery Institute |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the video was also a production of Illustra Media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprivilegedplanet.com/ |title=Illustra Media - The Privileged Planet |publisher=Illustra Media |location=La Mirada, CA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been identified as a [[front organization|front]] for a creationist production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmsr.org/smkg-gun.htm |title=The C-Files: The Smoking Gun |last=Thomas |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Thomas (physicist) |website=New Mexicans for Science and Reason |publisher=Dave Thomas |location=Peralta, NM |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/unlocking-mystery-illustra-media |title=Unlocking the Mystery of Illustra Media |last=Evans |first=Skip |date=June 30, 2003 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |type=Blog |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon further review, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History determined that the content of the video was inconsistent with the scientific research of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/06/smithsonian-ins.html |title=Smithsonian Institution Statement |last=Humburg |first=Burt |date=June 1, 2005 |website=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |type=Blog |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore refunded the $16,000, clearly denied any endorsement of the content of the video or of the Discovery Institute, and allowed the film to be shown in the museum as per the original agreement. Editorials have decried as naïve and negligent the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's failure to identify the Discovery Institute as a creationist organization, exclude the video with its review process in the first place, and identify the entire incident as an example of Wedge strategy in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 3, 2005 |title=Dissing Darwin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201659.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |type=Editorial |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center also funded research for the controversial book ''[[From Darwin to Hitler]]'' (2004) by Center fellow [[Richard Weikart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwintohitler.com/ |title=CSC - From Darwin to Hitler |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weikart claims that [[Darwinism]]'s impact on ethics and morality played a key role not only in the rise of [[eugenics]], but also in [[euthanasia]], [[infanticide]], [[abortion]], and racial extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis.

On September 6, 2006, on the Center's ''Evolution News &amp; Views'' blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled "Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries." In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that  [[English Wikipedia]]'s coverage of ID to be "one sided" and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published an English Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers "to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/wikipedia_youre_on_notice002574.html |title=Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries |last=Luskin |first=Casey |date=September 6, 2006 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2010}}
Most criticism of the CSC and the Discovery Institute is that the Institute intentionally misrepresents many facts in the promoting of its agenda. A wide spectrum of critics level this charge; from educators, scientists and the Smithsonian Institution to individuals who oppose the teaching of creationism alongside science on ideological grounds. The following are most common areas in which the Institute is accused of being intentionally misleading:

*'''Teach the Controversy''' Mainstream scientific organizations maintain that there is no controversy to teach, in the sense that the theory of evolution is fully accepted by the scientific community. Such controversies that do exist concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution, and the controversy alleged by the Discovery Institute is manufactured.
*'''Santorum Amendment''' Despite the amendment lacking the weight of law, consistent with the Discovery Institute's Wedge strategy, the amendment's inclusion in the conference report of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] is constantly cited by the Discovery Institute as evidence  that "federal education policy" calls for a "teach the controversy approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Controversy-over-life-s-origins-Students-should-2665488.php |last1=Meyer |first1=Stephen C. |last2=Campbell |first2=John Angus |authorlink2=John Angus Campbell |title=Controversy over life's origins / Students should learn to assess competing theories |date=December 10, 2004 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Wedge strategy and the Discovery Institute agenda''' A common allegation often leveled at the CSC by critics is that it is conducting a campaign, the ultimate goal of which is to reshape American culture by influencing public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. The Wedge Document bolsters this claim. They claim that the Center's dismissal of the document and strategy is disingenuous, as when the Center's actions in the political sphere, such as its Teach the Controversy campaign, are taken into account it becomes apparent that the Wedge strategy is indeed being followed.
*'''Peer review''' Though the CSC often claims that articles and books asserting intelligent design are published in the peer-reviewed scientific press, no pro-ID article has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/issues/peerreview.shtml |title=Intelligent Design and Peer Review |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Washington, D.C. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312080527/http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/issues/peerreview.shtml |archivedate=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzruling_pg87"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |volume=04 |reporter=cv |opinion=2688 |date=December 20, 2005}} [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 87 of 139|Whether ID is Science, p. 87]]&lt;/ref&gt; The one article that had been was quickly retracted by the publisher. The article, titled "The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories," was by the institute's Stephen C. Meyer and was published in ''Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington'' in 2004. One month after its publication, the journal's publisher issued a statement repudiating the article as not meeting its scientific standards and as having sidestepped peer review (see [[Sternberg peer review controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2004/09/bsw-repudiates-meyer-00552 |title=BSW repudiates Meyer |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 7, 2004 |website=[[National Center for Science Education]] |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intellectual dishonesty]], in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence and a lack of [[rigour]] is one of the most common criticisms of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenhouse |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Rosenhouse |date=January 2003 |title=Leaders and Followers in the Intelligent-Design Movement |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/6.full |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0006:LAFITI]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |quote=ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Its critics, such as [[Eugenie Scott]], [[Robert T. Pennock|Robert Pennock]] and [[Barbara Forrest]], claim that the CSC knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through [[ellipsis]], and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials.

[[Barbara Forrest]], author of ''[[Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design]]'' and [[Glenn Branch]] say that the CSC uses academic credentials and affiliations opportunistically.&lt;ref name="acadme" /&gt; In 2001 the Discovery Institute purchased advertisements in three national publications (the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' and the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'') to proclaim the adherence of approximately 100 scientists to the following statement: "We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."

Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: Probe Ministries for Bohlin, the Reasons to Believe ministry for Rana, and the CSC for Wells. During controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas, similar lists of local scientists were circulated.

In another instance, the CSC frequently mentions the Nobel Prize in connection with [[Henry F. Schaefer]], a CSC fellow, and chemist at the [[University of Georgia]]. Critics{{who|date=March 2013}} allege that CSC is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a "five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize" since Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.

Alongside the allegation that the Center intentionally misrepresents facts, [[Eugenie Scott]] and other critics say there is a noticeable conflict between what the CSC tells the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences. They contend that this is a studied and deliberate attempt at the obfuscation advocated by Wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 2002|Johnson 2002]]. "So the question is: 'How to win?' That's when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing'—the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do."&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking to a mainstream audience and to the media, the institute portrays ID as a secular, scientific theory, that the teaching the controversy campaign does not promote ID, and that their agenda is not religiously motivated. But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their "natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians," the institute's officers express themselves in unambiguously religious language that contradicts these statements. This in the belief that they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as Howard Ahmanson, Jr.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Critics can also be found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] has voiced [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] concerns over Discovery Institute's activities. He described the approach of the teach the controversy movement's proponents as "a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry":

{{quotation|"The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution," said  Lynn. "It is all based on their religious ideology. Even the people who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God."&lt;ref name="wp_slevin" /&gt;}}

In 2004 [[Barbara Forrest]] and [[Paul R. Gross]] published ''[[Creationism's Trojan Horse|Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design]]'' documenting the history of the intelligent design movement and the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture as well as critiquing ID research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |authorlink1=Barbara Forrest |last2=Gross |first2=Paul R. |authorlink2=Paul R. Gross |year=2004 |title=[[Creationism's Trojan Horse|Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design]] |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-515742-7 |oclc=50913078 |lccn=2002192677 |ref=Forrest &amp; Gross 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest and Gross referred to the group as an outgrowth of Johnson's religious mission and explored its plans for "a rigorously God-centered view of creation, including a new 'science' based solidly on theism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], pp. 19, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Center is funded through the Discovery Institute, which is largely underwritten by grants and gifts from wealthy [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] conservative individuals and groups, such as Howard Ahmanson Jr., [[Philip F. Anschutz]], [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], and the Maclellan Foundation.&lt;ref name="wp_slevin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=147 |title=Discovery Institute emerging as force in creation, public policy |last=Willoughby |first=Karen L. |date=May 15, 2001 |website=Baptist2Baptist |publisher=[[Baptist Press]]; [[Southern Baptist Convention#Organization|Executive Committee Southern Baptist Convention]] |location=Nashville, TN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927223709/http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=147 |archivedate=2003-09-27 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/deception.cfm |title=Deception by Design: The Intelligent Design Movement in America |last=Flank |first=Lenny |date=August 20, 2006 |website=Talk Reason |accessdate=2014-05-19 |quote=Nearly all of the Discovery Institute's money for the Intelligent Design project comes in the form of grants from wealthy fundamentalists and from Christian political groups. In 2003, the Discovery Institute received some $4.1 million in donations and grants. At least twenty-two different foundations give money to the Intelligent Design project; two-thirds of these are religious institutions with explicitly Christian aims and goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilgoren 2005|Wilgoren 2005]]. "Financed by some of the same Christian conservatives who helped Mr. Bush win the White House, the organization's intellectual core is a scattered group of scholars who for nearly a decade have explored the unorthodox explanation of life's origins known as intelligent design." ... "The records show financial support from 22 foundations, at least two-thirds of them with explicitly religious missions."&lt;/ref&gt;

Published reports place the Discovery Institute's budget for ID-related programs at over $4 million per year. The Center's expenditures can be assumed to be substantial based on the scope and quality of the Center's extensive public relations campaigns, materials and contributions to local and regional ID and Teach the Controversy efforts.

CSC director, [[Stephen C. Meyer]], admits most of the Center's money comes from wealthy donors from the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="wp_slevin"/&gt; Howard Ahmanson Jr., who provided $1.5 million in funding that established the Center, has said his goal is "the total integration of biblical law into our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/01/06/ahmanson/ |title=Avenging angel of the religious right |last=Blumenthal |first=Max |authorlink=Max Blumenthal |date=January 6, 2004 |website=Salon |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maclellan Foundation commits itself to "the infallibility of the Scripture."&lt;ref name="wp_slevin" /&gt; Most Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush campaign]]. Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian reconstructionist [[Chalcedon Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarkson |first=Frederick |authorlink=Frederick Clarkson |date=March–June 1994 |title=Christian Reconstructionism: Part 3: No Longer Without Sheep |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre3.html |journal=[[Public Eye Magazine|The Public Eye]] |location=Somerville, MA |publisher=[[Political Research Associates]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |issn=0275-9322 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funds many causes important to the Christian right, including [[Christian Reconstructionism]].

The '''Cognitive Neuroscience Society''' ('''CNS''') is an international [[academic society]] interested in multi-disciplinary approaches to cognitive brain function. Drawing primarily from the biological and [[psychological]] sciences, society members are involved in [[cognitive neuroscience]] research that attempts to integrate our understanding of the [[brain]] and [[mind]].

Founded in 1994 by six scientists, [[Michael S. Gazzaniga]] ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]]), [[George R. Mangun]] ([[University of California, Davis]]), [[Steve Pinker]] ([[Harvard University]]), Patti Reuter-Lorenz ([[University of Michigan]]), Daniel Schacter ([[Harvard University]]), and Art Shimamura ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), the society brings together scientists from many different fields in its annual meeting held each spring, featuring a program of [[plenary session|plenary speakers]], [[Academic conference|symposia]], [[posters]], and special events, covering all aspects of cognitive neuroscience research.  It also publishes the [[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Confidence weighting (CW)''' is concerned with measuring two variables: (1) what a respondent believes is a correct answer to a question and (2) what degree of certainty the respondent has toward the correctness of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebel|first=R. L.|title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|year=1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Confidence weighting'' when applied to a specific answer selection for a particular test or exam question is referred to in the literature from [[cognitive psychology]] as item-specific confidence, a term typically used by researchers who investigate metamemory or [[metacognition]], comprehension monitoring, or feeling-of-knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundeberg|first=M.|author2=Fox, P.

J.|title=Handbook of Metacognition in Education|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on self-confidence and metacognition during test taking (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Ecological and Person-Oriented Aspects of Metacognitive Processes in Test-Taking|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=15|issue=3|pages=321–341|doi=10.1002/acp.705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Self-confidence and metacognitive processes|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=17|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have used item-specific confidence as a way to assess the accuracy and confidence underlying knowledge judgments.

Researchers outside of the field of cognitive psychology have used confidence weighting as applied to item-specific judgments in assessing alternative conceptions of difficult concepts in high school biology and physics (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odom|first=A. L.|author2=Barrow, L. H.|title=High School Biology Students' Knowledge and Certainty about Diffusion and Osmosis Concepts|journal=School Science and Mathematics|year=2007|volume=107|issue=3|pages=94–101|doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.2007.tb17775.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Planinic|first=M.|author2=Boone, W.

'''Costas Lapavitsas''' ({{lang-el|Kώστας Λαπαβίτσας}}) is a professor of [[economics]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]], University of London, and was elected as a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] for the left-wing [[Syriza]] party in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Helena Smith|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/greece-election-u-turn-antonis-samaras-syriza|title = Greek PM Samaras forced into U-turn as Syriza closes in on election victory|publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date = 10 January 2015|accessdate = 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently defected to the [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]] in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hellenic Parliament|0bbc7499-970d-4593-ab3e-a43400ec6e18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he obtained a master's degree at the [[London School of Economics]], followed in 1986 by a PhD at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], University of London. Since 1999 he has taught Economics at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]], first as a lecturer, and since 2008 as a professor.

Costas Lapavitsas is known for his criticism of the modern Western financial system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=9689 |title= LIBOR Scandal More Than Fraud - Whole Game is Rigged |last1= Lapavitsas|first1= Costas|last2= |first2= |date= 3 October 2014 |website= |publisher= therealnews.com|accessdate= December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], the [[European debt crisis]] and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/07/left-progressive-euroscepticism-eu-ills|title= The left needs a progressive Euroscepticism to counter the EU's ills|last1= Lapavitsas|first1= Costas|last2= |first2= |date= 7 May 2014|website= |publisher= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a columnist for the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''. In 2007 he founded ''Research on Money and Finance'' (RMF) an 
international  network  of  political  economists  focusing  on  money,  finance  and  the evolution of contemporary capitalism.

As early as 2011, Lapavitsas, as well as some other Greek economists, has been highly eurosceptic, advocating for Greece abandoning the [[euro]] and returning to its former national currency, the [[drachma]], as a response to the Greek government-debt crisis.&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{Cite news|author=Landon Thomas Jr.|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/45128577|title=Whispers of Return to Drachma Grow Louder in Greek Crisis|publisher = CNBC |agency=New York Times |date =  2 Nov 2011|accessdate = 31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 2 March 2015 Lapavitsas wrote in ''[[the Guardian]]'' that releasing Greek people from [[austerity]] and simultaneously avoiding a major falling-out with the [[eurozone]] is an impossible task for the new government of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/02/austerity-greece-euro-currency-syriza

title=To beat austerity, Greece must break free from the euro| 
last=Lapavitsas|first=Costas|access-date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Lapavitsas endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]]. He said: "If he succeeds - and I hope he does - he's exactly what Britain could do with, what the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] could do with. I think that would be a very important move for the rest of Europe and for Greece. It would give a boost to the kind of thinking that would be necessary in the rest of Europe that is so sadly lacking at the moment. It would be the best thing to come out of Britain for Europe in a long time."&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chan|first=Szu Ping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11760606/Jeremy-Corbyn-is-the-best-thing-to-come-out-of-Britain-says-Greeces-hard-left-Syriza-party.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn 'is the best thing to come out of Britain' says Greece's hard left Syriza party|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6950">'''Deane Galloway Keller''' (August 1, 1940 &amp;ndash; January 4, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[academic]] and [[author]].&lt;ref name="nyt2007"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEED91139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63  "Deaths: Keller, Deane G.,"] ''New York Times.''  July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keller was a [[technical drawing|draftsman]], [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], and [[teacher]] who instructed students in the [[visual arts]] for forty years, most notably in [[figure drawing]] and the artistic application of [[human anatomy]].  He is credited with explaining that "drawing offers a unique record of an encounter with a culture, of experience transformed from fleeting moment to lasting resonance."&lt;ref&gt;The Painter's Keys: [http://quote.robertgenn.com/auth_search.php?authid=5591  Deane G.

==Early life==
He was the son of [[Deane Keller|Deane]] and Katherine Hall Keller.&lt;ref name="19Y62obit"&gt;[http://www.alumninet.yale.edu/classes/yc1962/obituaries/dkeller.html  Obituary: Dean G. Keller,] [http://www.alumninet.yale.edu/classes/yc1962/index.html Yale College Class of 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Art History from [[Yale University]], where he studied under his father, and a [[Master of Arts]] in Education from [[Saint Joseph College (Connecticut)|St. Joseph College]] in [[West Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. Additionally, Keller  studied in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], with [[Nera Simi]], and anatomy under [[David Rubins]] at the [[Herron School of Art]] in Indianapolis, Indiana.&lt;ref name="lacfa_2007"&gt;[http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/dealers_galleries/InfoAll/press_releases/dg_id/15053 Press release for Lyme Academy exhibition at Saatchi website]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 25 years Keller served as a professor at the [[Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts]]. The head of the drawing department, in 2001 he was honored with the endowed Deane G. Keller Chair of Classical Drawing and Figurative Art, a position which he held until his death. Keller was also a member of the faculty of the [[New York Academy of Art]], the [[Art Students League of New York]], the [[Hartford Art School]] at the [[University of Hartford]], and the [[Woodstock School of Art]]. He lectured on [[drawing]] and [[draftsmanship]] at the [[Yale Center for British Art]], the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]], and the [[Graduate School of Design]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="lacfa_2007"/&gt;

A [[portrait painter|portrait]], [[landscape art|landscape]] and [[still life]] painter, Keller was in his later years engaged in a series of large charcoal drawings of draped figures inspired by his travels to the [[Middle East]].

==Artists influenced by Keller==
Keller believed that "for some years the fine art of draftsmanship has suffered some eclipse because learning the craft of figure drawing has been only casually addressed and even discredited by some."&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Eleanor.

==History==

In 1989, Pete Wallingford, an Educational Technologist from Seattle, Washington with a background in multi-store dive operations management, scuba diving instruction and commercial diving, initially started a marine conservation organization called "The Friends of the Reef Foundation" in response to customers of his dive stores complaining about the declining state of the coral reefs.&lt;ref name="dive training"/&gt; For the international diving community he created a portable underwater obstacle course and adjunct curriculum for trim, proper weighting and buoyancy-control training, which was made of [[PVC pipe]] hoops shaped like [[Diamonds (suit)|diamonds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Diving World Japan|title=The Diamond Reef Challenge|date=October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divernet.com/training/p298496-the-diver-buoyancy-challenge.html|title=The DIVER buoyancy challenge|publisher=DIVER|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently named Hover Stations. The program was adopted by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in 1989.&lt;ref name="global stamp news" /&gt; By 1991, the Diamond Reef System had developed into an instructional, marketing and dive industry promotional program under the company, Buoyancy Training Systems, Inc.&lt;ref name="dive training"&gt;{{cite news|work=Dive Training|title=The Diamond Reef System|date=December 1992|author=Alex Brylske}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Buoyancy Training Systems, Inc eventually was renamed Buoyancy Training Systems International, Inc. and presently Diamond Reef Systems. The Diamond Reef System was adopted into the [[Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency's]] diving education program in 1991.&lt;ref name="global stamp news" /&gt; It also received recognition from the ROLEX Corporation, Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association, University of Washington educational technology department and dive training program, Glen Egstrom Ph.D at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] diving program, [[University of North Carolina]] diving program, Alex Brylske Ph.D a Professional Association of Dive Instructors' Course Director and Hillary Viders Ph.D at the [[National Association of Underwater Instructors]].&lt;ref name="dive training"/&gt; Permission was subsequently given by all diver certification agencies worldwide (to include PADI, NAUI, BSAC, CMAS, YMCA, SSI and GUE) to permit participating licensed and insured instructors and their respective Divemasters / Divecons to include the Diamond Reef Hover Stations and Challenge Courses in pool and open water training. This was due to the effectiveness of the training aids and the 'diver release' safety feature that was built into each Hover Station.

==Equipment==
The US patents for the ''underwater buoyancy training obstacle course target hoop'' and the ''underwater buoyancy training obstacle course target set'' were issued to Peter A. Wallingford on August 25, 1992, patent numbers: 5141441, and 5141440 respectively.&lt;ref name="Justia patents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/peter-a-wallingford|title=Patents by Inventor Peter A. Wallingford|last=Staff|year=2015|work=Justia patents website|publisher=Justia|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual validity of a US patent is 20 years from date of filing.

===Description===
[[File:Diamond Reef hoop.svg|thumb|Diamond Reef hoop shape and construction]]
The underwater obstacle course kit for buoyancy training includes a detailed retailer/resort/charter boat operator and dive instructor manual, a set of seven collapsible, buoyant Hover Stations, each with a cord for tethering to a weight on the bottom, and a line holder to store the cord and adjust its operating length. Several alternative hoop geometries are covered in the patents (circular, triangular, octagonal and rectangular are mentioned),&lt;ref name="Patent 5141441" /&gt; but the one recommended and generally used is a square in a diamond-shaped orientation, threaded with marine shock cord, tethered by a corner, allowing the open corner to float upwards as well as providing a 'safety release' or flexible opening to reduce the chance of diver entanglement. This is considered by the designer to be the most responsible and efficient shape considering the diver and equipment passing through or hovering within the Hover Station. It also minimizes the amount of material and work required for an effective target, and the diamond configuration has better underwater stability than the other configurations.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141440"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/5141440|title=Underwater buoyancy training obstacle course target set|last=Staff|year=2015|work=Justia patents|publisher=Justia|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard sized Diamond Reef Hover Stations include 5 each measuring {{convert|39|inch|m|1}} sides and 2 each, size large measuring {{convert|48|inch|m|1}} pipe lengths. These 'hoops' can be made from any suitable material, but {{convert|1|inch|mm}} diameter, schedule 40 (US) PVC pipe, elbows and end caps have been found the most effective.

The Diamond shaped target is assembled from straight tubular sections with open ends connected by right angle elbows and the unconnected ends sealed by plugs or caps. The lower two legs of each Hover Station feature two sets of 4, 1/4" diameter through-holes to permit ease of descending with the buoyant Hover Stations. The assembly can be glued together (if student divers are closely supervised as the release feature is not as forgiving) or held together by internal shock cord for safety and convenience reasons; allowing dislocation of the joints for compact storage.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141441"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/5141441|title=Underwater buoyancy training obstacle course target hoop|last=Staff|year=2015|work=Justia patents|publisher=Justia|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unconnected corner is generally deployed as the high point of the Hover Station and it allows a diver to escape upwards if unable to pass through the 'hoop'.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141441" /&gt;

In the open water environment for ease of the complete or partial course set-up, an octagonal shaped 54 foot diameter 'Base Station' consisting of 8 separate environmentally safe 'concrete' anchors, connected with stainless cable can be situated at the appropriate depth depending on visibility, tidal flow and boat traffic. One anchor can be used for determining the proper weight requirements for each diver by practicing the simulated empty tank (SET) weighting procedure. Proper weighting and focused breathing are the foundations of demonstrating proper control at depth.

===Setup===
As little as one, two or as many Hover Stations that are available may be set up to include Slalom, escalator and rollercoaster obstacle course layouts using the kit components. These courses are intended to be set up for buoyancy training, mid-watermanship skill development and evaluation in relatively 'quiet' (slack tide), safe water with little or no current and more than fifteen feet of visibility. The recommended minimum depth of the water is {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}, allowing for a 15 foot stop as the shallowest part of the obstacle course. A standard set comprises seven Hover Stations (5 standard size, 2 large, to be anchored at the beginning and end of the official Diamond Reef Challenge Course.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141440" /&gt; Note, and not shown in the below diagrams, that the two large 48" Hover Stations are positioned at the 15' depth to promote buddy teamwork at the beginning of the dive prior to descending to the bottom and the 3 minute 15' safety stop at the end of the no-decompression dive.
*The slalom course can include direction changes between sequential hoops which are set up in a row with the cords adjusted to keep the hoops at the same depth, preferably about 15–20 feet apart and three feet from the bottom. This is intended to train divers' ability to remain {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} above a coral reef.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141440" /&gt;
*The escalator course includes an increase or decrease in depth between sequential hoops. Preferably, the hoops are stationed about 15-20 apart and {{convert|3|ft|m|1}}, {{convert|7|ft|m|1}}, {{convert|11|ft|m|1}}, {{convert|15|ft|m|1}} and {{convert|19|ft|m|1}} feet above the bottom. This layout is for practicing gradual ascents and descents.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141440" /&gt;
*The rollercoaster course includes both increases and decreases of depth between sequential hoops. Preferably the hoops are set up by arranging with the depths used in the escalator course aligning them in a row such that the successive hoops are deeper and shallower from one to the next (for example: 3 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 5). This layout is for practicing controlled alternating ascents and descents.&lt;ref name="Patent 5141440" /&gt;
&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=240px &gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Procedures==
The system can be used for training and assessing trim and diver buoyancy control, non-destructive maneuvering (fin-tip awareness), dive buddy teamwork, dive manufactured equipment testing and slow motion hovering skills (namely Horizontal Hover-Stall maneuvers). The 15 minute Diamond Reef Challenge Course is staged utilizing all seven Hover Stations.

==History==
In the 1980s, Wint-O-Green [[Life Savers]] were used to create soda geysers. The tubes of candies were threaded onto a pipe cleaner and dropped into the soft drink to create a geyser. At the end of the 1990s, the manufacturer of Wintergreen Lifesavers increased the size of the mints and they no longer fit in the mouth of soda bottles. Science teachers found that Mint Mentos candies had the same effect when dropped into a bottle of any carbonated soft drink.&lt;ref name=nakedeggs /&gt;

Lee Marek and "Marek's Kid Scientists" performed the Diet Coke and Mentos experiment on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref name=thetartan /&gt;&lt;ref name=napervillesun /&gt;&lt;ref name="planck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planck.lal.in2p3.fr/wiki/uploads/Photos/Activit%E9esClandestines/Coffey08_diet_coke_and_mentos.pdf|title=Diet Coke and Mentos: What is really behind this physical reaction?|author=Tonya Shea Coffey|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002, [[Steve Spangler]], a science educator, did the demonstration on KUSA-TV, an NBC affiliate, in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVQFLth4yIQ|title=The Original Mentos Geyser Video|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet Coke and Mentos geyser experiment became an internet sensation in September 2005.

==Cause==
The eruption is caused by a physical reaction, rather than any chemical reaction. The addition of the Mentos leads to the rapid [[nucleation]] of [[carbon dioxide]] gas bubbles [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] out of solution:&lt;ref name="Kuntzleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2(aq) -&gt; CO2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

[[File:SEM image of the surface of a Mentos candy.jpg|alt=SEM image of the surface of a Mentos candy.|thumb|SEM image of the surface of a Mentos candy.]]
The conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents out of the container. Gasses, in general, are more [[Solubility#Solubility of gases|soluble]] in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. 

Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the [[activation energy]] for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface ([[Nucleation#Heterogeneous nucleation|heterogeneous nucleation]]). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form on the sides of the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. 

The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sims|first=Trevor P.

It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights.&lt;ref name="Kuntzleman" /&gt; In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights.&lt;ref name="Kuntzleman" /&gt; These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence.

'''Digistar Users Group''' (DUG) is an international association of facilities that own [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] (E&amp;S) Digistar systems.

== History ==
The Digistar Users Group began in the mid-1980s as an informal gathering of [[Planetarium|planetarian]]s.  The first gathering took place in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (USA).  At the time, there were only five Digistar systems worldwide.  Today, there are more than 250 Digistar-equipped planetaria on six continents. The current Digistar product line includes [[Digistar II]], [[Digistar 3]], Digistar 4 and Digistar 5, in various configurations appropriate for domes of nearly any size.

==Membership==
Membership in the Digistar Users Group is voluntary; membership is restricted to facilities (such as science centers, planetariums, schools, universities and other organizations) that own or have a signed contract to purchase a Digistar system.

'''Dolf Rieser''' (1898–1983) was a [[South Africa]] painter, printmaker, and teacher.

==Early life and education==
Dolf Rieser was born in [[King William's Town]], South Africa, and educated in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. In 1917, he studied at [[ETH Zurich|École Polytechnique]], [[Zürich]], obtaining a diploma in [[agricultural engineering]], then from 1918-22 obtained a doctorate in biological science at the [[University of Lausanne]]. In 1923, he researched science at [[Munich University]], while studying art with [[Hans Hofmann|Hans Hoffman]]. Rieser studied at "[[Atelier Method|Atelier]] 17" in Paris with British [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[Printmaking|printmaker]] [[Stanley William Hayter]] (1901–88) and [[Poland|Polish]] [[Engraving|engraver]] [[Józef Hecht]] (1891–1951). In 1926, Hayter had settled in Paris, where he enrolled at the [[Académie Julian]] and studied [[Burin (engraving)|burin engraving]] privately with Hecht, who also taught [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1222&amp;page=1 Anthony Gross].

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:fraternite.jpg]] The  Atelier 17 group Album for Spanish Republicans “Fraternite” including work by Rieser, Kandinsky and Miro is in the Indianapolis Museum of Arts collection--&gt;

==Career==
Dolf Rieser joined Hayter in 1928 after he began to take his own pupils and worked through 1940 at Atelier 17 (named in 1933, after the street number of Hayter’s studio in the Rue Campagne-Première). The signature of the workshop was its democratic structure, breaking with the traditional hierarchic French engraving studios by insisting on a cooperative approach to labour and technical discoveries. In 1929 Hayter was introduced to Surrealism by [[Yves Tanguy]] and [[André Masson]], together with other Surrealists (including Picasso, [[Joan Miró|Miró]], Arp, Tanguy, Giacometti, Ernst, [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2065&amp;page=1 Trevelyan], Peterdi and Rieser), associated with Atelier 17. He organized portfolios of prints to raise funds for the Spanish cause, (including Solidarité (Paris, 1938), a portfolio of seven prints, one of them by Picasso), and [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] contributed to the Steven Spender and Atelier 17 Album “Fraternité” to raise money for unfortunate children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War. [[Stephen Spender|Stephen Spender's]] poem was both in English and with a French translation by [[Louis Aragon]], was accompanied by a group of etchings by Kandinsky, Miro, Hayter, Hecht, [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090121092845/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/html/artist/artist.aspx?id%3D17600 Buckland-Wright], [https://web.archive.org/web/20071102112554/http://www.galleries.bc.ca/vernon/permcol/bios/gdhbio.asp Husband], Mead, Rieser and Varas.

He moved to England to join the war effort in 1940, and in 1945, newly married, he settled back to civilian life, lecturing in biology, liberal studies and art, while also giving private lessons in printmaking. In 1960, he was invited to Cape Town and Johannesburg Universities to lecture on that subject. During the 1960s, Rieser pioneered printing on translucent fibre-glass panels and laminates. He also worked on a range of applied prints on scarves for [http://www.liberty.co.uk/ Liberty]. A member of the [[Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers|Royal Society of Painter-Etchers]], he introduced colour intaglio to post-war Britain. He took part in group shows widely throughout Europe and America, including [[Peggy Guggenheim|Peggy Guggenheim's]] Gallery, 1939; Atelier 17 in New York and San Francisco, 1954. His solo shows were international, including Galerie Bonjean, Paris, 1936; Zwemmer Gallery, 1956; ICA 1966, Lumley Cazalet, 1968; and David Paul Gallery, Chichester 1979. The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Imperial War Museum, the Arts Council UK, National Gallery of Canada and New York Public Library hold his work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16436">The term '''emotional literacy''' has often been used in parallel to, and sometimes interchangeably with, the term [[emotional intelligence]]. However, there are important differences between the two. Emotional literacy was noted as part of a project advocating humanistic education in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lotecka, L. (1974) A project advocating humanistic education: An evaluation of its effect on public school teachers. Journal of Drug Education, 4(2), 141-149.  Available at http://elguides.cc/AProject.pdf (accessed April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==

The term was used extensively by [[Claude Steiner]] (1997)&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;Steiner, C. with Perry, P. (1997) Achieving Emotional Literacy. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt; who says:

Emotional literacy is made up of 'the ability to understand your [[emotions]], the ability to listen to others and [[empathise]] with their emotions, and the ability to express emotions productively. To be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you. Emotional literacy improves relationships, creates loving possibilities between people, makes co-operative work possible, and facilitates the feeling of community.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Steiner breaks emotional literacy into 5 parts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Knowing your feelings.
#Having a sense of [[empathy]].
#Learning to manage our emotions.
#Repairing [[emotional problem]]s.
#Putting it all together: emotional interactivity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having its roots in [[counseling]], it is a social definition that has interactions between people at its heart.  According to Steiner emotional literacy is about understanding your feelings and those of others to facilitate relationships, including using dialogue and self-control to avoid negative arguments.  The ability to be aware and read other people's feelings enables one to interact with them effectively so that powerful emotional situations can be handled in a skillful way.  Steiner calls this "emotional interactivity". Steiner's model of emotional literacy is therefore primarily about dealing constructively with the emotional difficulties we experience to build a sound future. He believes that personal power can be increased and relationships transformed. The emphasis is on the individual, and as such encourages one to look inward rather than to the social setting in which an individual operates.

==British context==

In Britain, the term 'emotional literacy' is often used and has developed, building on the work of Steiner and Goleman&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than [[IQ]]. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt;  as a social construction – as opposed to the more individualistic 'emotional intelligence' with the attempts to measure it as if emotions were measurable in a relatively rational way.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"&gt;Boler, M. (1999) Feeling power: emotions and education. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"&gt;Matthews, G., Zeidner, M. and Roberts, R. D. (2004) Emotional intelligence: science and myth. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"&gt;Burman, E. (2009) Beyond 'emotional literacy' in [[Women's studies|feminist]] and [[educational research]], [[British Educational Research Association|British Educational Research Journal]], 35(1): 137-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators did not like the way that 'emotional intelligence' focused so much on the individual and there were clear attempts to avoid the narrow EQ tests that were in use for two reasons:
#The idea of an EQ test had resonance with discredited{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=December 2015}} [[psychometric measure]]s of intelligence such as [[IQ test]]s.
#People were also concerned with the way that pupils could be subject to even more control through the introduction of emotional intelligence into the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] in England and Wales emphasized a range of cognitive skills that were controlled through exams. Educators saw the need to expand the range of skills that pupils required and were also concerned with [[social inclusion]]. The Labour  Government provided an overarching rationale for this with its promotion of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2007) The Children's Plan: Building brighter futures. London: Department for Children, Schools and Families.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2008) Indicators of a school's contribution to well-being. London: Ofsted&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the [[Department of Children, Schools and Families]] developed a scheme for schools – called the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) – it was  based on Goleman's definition of [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than IQ. London: Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"&gt;Department for Education and Skills (2007) Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning for secondary schools (SEAL) Introductory Guide. Ref: 00043-2007DWO-EN-04  London: HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence any distinctions between the terms emotional intelligence and emotional literacy were blurred. Even so, key educators in Britain continued to use the term emotional literacy. Emotional literacy took on an aspect that was concern with personal growth. For example, the importance of developing relationships is, to a degree, in Weare's definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ability to understand ourselves and other people, and in particular to be aware of, understand, and use information about the emotional states of ourselves and others with competence. It includes the ability to understand, express and manage our own emotions, and respond to the emotions of others, in ways that are helpful to ourselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;Weare, K. (2003) Developing the emotionally literate school. London: Paul Chapman. p2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, the organization Antidote&lt;ref&gt;Antidote (2010) Definition of Emotional Literacy. Available at http://www.antidote.org.uk/learning/about.php (accessed April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; defined emotional literacy as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the practice of interacting with others in ways that build understanding of our own and others' emotions, then using this understanding to inform our actions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions acknowledge both the individual and other people and so [[inter-personal relationships]] and the need for dialogue are included. Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, P. (2001) Nurturing Emotional Literacy. London: David Fulton.&lt;/ref&gt; has taken a broad approach to emotional literacy in a Local Education Authority (LEA) where he considers its development is important for teachers as well as pupils.

However, there was still an underlying assumption about the individual and how they develop as if they were culturally isolated and separate from factors such as religion and gender.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt; Also, the development of emotional literacy was justified by arguing that its introduction would help to improve other factors such as behavior, [[attendance]] and [[academic achievement]]. Boler&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;  researched four of the emotional programs in America. She pointed out that the programs tended to view pupils as individuals who are in need of development through enabling them to control their impulses. This can mean that pupils are to become responsible for their own control and that other social factors can be ignored. It is possible that these programs can open the way for greater control of pupils with even their emotions being assessed.
On the one hand the development of emotional literacy programs can be seen as progressive, but on the other the focus seems quite inward, as there is little reference leading to any broader concept of social and political reform.&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;

In the same way that Goleman&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"/&gt; discusses emotional intelligence educational programs, emotional literacy programs can also be more about coping with the social and political status quo in a caring, interactive and emotionally supportive environment than with any systematic attempt to move beyond it to social improvement.

==Culturally situated==

Matthews (2006)&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt; argues against the concept of 'emotional intelligence' and for a developed definition of 'emotional literacy'.  His starting point is that all social and emotional interactions take place in a cultural context and that generally all emotions are felt because of interactions with other people.
He argues that a group may, for example, contain men and women and people from a range of ethnicities. One could judge a person's emotional literacy by observing what they brought to the situation, the way they interacted and the degree to which they showed empathy, and, the recognition of "self" and "others". The way that one can reliably gauge the emotional literacy of a person is to see them interacting in a group and see how they behave towards other people of different genders, sexuality and social class.  Hence, it makes little sense to talk about emotional literacy of a person as if it were separate from such factors – someone may be able to empathize with people of their own sex, but not different sexualities or religions. Also, one may think that they can empathize with the other sex, or another religion, but the other person may not agree with them. Indeed, the views of other people are essential in deciding upon such factors.  There is always a social context and in any context power differentials operate.  Any form of paper and pen test will only give access to what a person thinks, not to the important view of how others think.  For example, many men (and women) would say that they were not sexist, yet a person from the opposite sex may not agree. A person cannot tell how well they, say, empathize, only other people tell them if they are. A manager may think they are self-confident, open and friendly, but others find him or her aggressive and [[bullying]].

Hence, according to Matthews, emotional literacy is a social process that takes place in a social setting, is something that is never really achieved, and has to be seen in conjunction with others. This indicates that key components of emotional literacy, which is a continual process, that includes dialogue, [[Ambiguity tolerance|acceptance of ambiguity]] and the ability to reflect. Judgments are made on a person's individual-in-group emotional literacy.  He argues:

{{quote|text=Emotional literacy involves factors such as people understanding their own and others' emotional states; learning to manage their emotions and to empathize with others. It also includes the recognition that emotional literacy is both an individual development and a collective activity and is both about self-development and the building of community so that ones own sense of emotional well-being grows along with that of others, and not at their expense. Emotional literacy involves connections between people and working with their differences and similarities while being able to handle ambiguity and contradiction. It is a dynamic process through which the individual develops emotionally and involves culture and empowerment. For example, it includes understanding how the nature of social class, 'race' and gender (sexism and homophobia) impinge on peoples' emotional states to lead to an understanding of how society could change. Hence it incorporates an understanding of power exchanges between people and a challenging of power differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press. pp178&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On this view emotional literacy is developed to help people understand themselves, others and the power connections between them. Matthews links emotional literacy to equality and social justice. Emotional literacy is not just to be "nice", but also to know when to stand up for viewpoints and fight for a case. It is not about more control over people, but less. As McIntosh and Style&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, P. and Style, E. (1999) Social, Emotional and Political Learning, in Cohen, J. (ed.) Educating Minds and Hearts. Social and Emotional Learning and the Passage into Adolescence. New York: Teachers College. p137&lt;/ref&gt; argue schools are always involved in social, emotional and power relations, yet "power relations are a taboo subject in K-12 schooling and in the majority culture of the United States. Power relations are therefore little understood systemically. Students, however, learn about power by watching, by imitating, by avoidance of what they fear".

==In education==

In general, most of the criticisms of courses to promote pupils' emotional development have been directed at those that develop emotional intelligence. For example, there are the courses developed in the USA and Britain.&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casel (2003) Safe and Sound. An educational leader's guide to evidence-based social and emotional learning programs. Chicago: University of Chicago Press  (Available at: www.casel.org/downloads/Safe%20and%20Sound/1A_Safe_&amp;_Sound.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elias, M., Zins, J., Weissberg, R. and Frey, K. (1997) Promoting Social and Emotional Learning. Virginia USA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt; The critiques of these courses include that:
# Emotional intelligence/literacy courses can lead to more control over pupils with them being more defined in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"/&gt;
# The assessment of emotional intelligence/literacy can lead to pupils being labeled as inadequate.
# Emotional intelligence courses can locate problems in the individual that are also a function of how society is organised.
# When courses are taught it is often assumed that pupils are emotionally ready to deal with what is on the curriculum, whereas they may not be.
# The whole agenda of teaching emotional development can lead to pupils being seen as deficit in emotional control and so can depress their  potential to have faith in future goals&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Emotional intelligence courses have moral and ethical aspects that are not made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Rietti, S. (2009) Emotional intelligence and moral agency: Some worries and a suggestion, Philosophical Psychology, 22(2): 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews has tried to avoid some of the difficulties.  For example, his strategies for the classroom mean that pupils only develop when, and in what areas, they are able.  Emotional development between the genders has been the focus of research&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2004) Promoting emotional literacy, equity and interest in KS3 science lessons for 11- to 14-year-olds; the 'Improving Science and Emotional Development' project, International Journal of Science Education, 26(3): 281-308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B., Kilbey, T., Doneghan, C. and Harrison, S. (2002) Improving attitudes to science and citizenship through developing emotional literacy, School Science Review, 84(307): 103-114.&lt;/ref&gt; with a small reference to 'race'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. and Sweeney, J. (1997) Collaboration in the science classroom to tackle racism and sexism, Multi-cultural Teaching, 15(3): 33-36.&lt;/ref&gt; But these are limited in strategies and do not tackle fully the critiques.

'''''Encino Man''''' (known as '''''California Man''''' in Europe and New Zealand)&lt;ref&gt;http://bostonirish.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/donald-clarke-irish-times-film-critic.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1992 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Les Mayfield]] and starring [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Sean Astin]] and [[Pauly Shore]].&lt;ref name="latimes-inside" /&gt; The plot revolves around two geeky teenagers from [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, Los Angeles, California]], played by Astin and Shore, who discover a [[caveman]] in Astin's backyard frozen in a block of ice. 

The caveman, played by Fraser, has to learn to live in the 20th century. Along the way, he teaches them about life.

==Plot==
During the first [[ice age]], a [[caveman]] attempts to make fire with his girlfriend. An earthquake causes a [[cave-in]] that buries the two of them.

This segues into a present day [[Los Angeles]] earthquake that awakens average teenager Dave Morgan. He, along with his best friend Stoney, strives to attain popularity in [[high school]], but comes off more as a reject and an outcast. Dave is in love with Robyn Sweeney, a sweet and attractive girl who has been his best friend since grade school, and, until she reached adolescence, had been rejected by Dave on several occasions. 

Her boyfriend, Matt Wilson, is a stereotypical jock and school bully, who is constantly responsible for making both Dave and Stoney the objects of ridicule by humiliating them in various ways, usually directly due to Dave's growing affections toward Robyn.

One day, as Dave is digging a pool in his backyard, he comes across a chunk of ice that has the body of a man in it following an earthquake. They leave the ice block unattended in the garage and space heaters left on cause the ice to melt, releasing the caveman from the opening of the film. The caveman then encounters a garbage truck, which he misinterprets as a mammoth from his time, and television, which he discovers upon entering Dave's house. 

When the boys return home, they find hand paint covering the walls and the house is in disarray. Investigating a beeping smoke alarm, they discover the caveman in Dave's bedroom, attempting to start a fire "Indian-style" by rotating a stick in the center of a pile of kindling. At first, the caveman panics at the sight of them, but then Stoney quickly calms him by using the flame of a lighter to mesmerize him after he panics from the phone ringing. After bathing him and trimming him to look like an average teenager, Dave names him "Link" as in the [[Transitional fossil|missing link]].

They manage to fool Dave's family into thinking he is actually an [[Estonian people|Estonian]] exchange student sent to live with them, and enroll him in school where Link's bizarre behavior and supreme athletic skills shoot Dave and Stoney to popularity by association, allowing Dave to get closer to Robyn, to Matt's chagrin. 

It soon becomes apparent that Stoney's bizarre attitude is having an effect on Link's actions and speech, which causes a rift between Dave and Stoney and after a fight with Matt at a skating rink, as well as an attraction developing between Robyn and Link. During a school field trip to a [[natural history]] museum, Link gets upset realizing that the cavepeople he knew are all dead and the gravity of his situation, but Stoney and Dave console Link that he is not without friends in this time, causing the trio to make a pact. Dave tries to send Link away, but a fight between him and Stoney cause Link to come running back. Stoney and Dave then make up. 

On [[Prom|prom night]], Link is a hit at the party with Robyn as his date while Dave stays in for the evening. Matt breaks into Dave's bedroom and steals photographic evidence that Link is a caveman. As Dave and Stoney go after Matt and his friends, another earthquake happens. At the prom, Matt's plan to uncover the "freak" backfires as the information instead makes Link even more popular. Dave and Robyn make up, and the three boys lead the entire prom in an impromptu caveman-like dance.

After the prom, the students attend Dave's house for a pool party where Dave and Robyn kiss. Meanwhile, Stoney and Link follow clues similar to when they found him ranging from breast prints on the slider and paint covering the walls. They follow the muddy footprints to the bathroom and discover a beautiful cavewoman in the bathtub who turns out to be Link's girlfriend from the beginning of the film. He joins her in the bathtub as Stoney cheers them on and embraces her happily as she is also made to look like a modern human.

==Cast==
* [[Sean Astin]] as David "Dave" Morgan, a good-natured, tense, and almost neurotic teenager who is in love with Robyn, despite losing his chance with her in grade school, because he thought she was not attractive yet. He dreams of popularity more than his friends and is the most worried about being labeled as a freak if Link's secret ever got out. He is already labeled as a geek in the school.
* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Linkovich "Link" Chomovsky, a caveman found in the 20th century when Dave and Stoney dig up a block of ice in which he is frozen. He is very friendly, despite also being very fierce and aggressive in his mannerisms. He is friends with Dave and Stoney.  
* [[Pauly Shore]] as Stanley "Stoney" Brown, a loud, obnoxious hippie/new wave teenager who is a fan of the game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. His outlook on life is profound and deeper than his thoughts seem to go. He is compassionate and quick-thinking, able to soothe Link's primal instincts by showing him how to harness fire. He becomes Link's best friend and role model, eventually causing Link to imitate him.
* [[Megan Ward]] as Robyn Sweeney, a kind, compassionate girl going out with the jock bully Matt Wilson. She attempts to maintain friendships with Dave and Stoney, but is often put off by their childish mannerisms. She is already showing signs of growing tired of Matt's snobby and egotistical ways. She eventually realizes the depth of her friendship with Dave and breaks up with Matt after he starts bullying him.
* [[Robin Tunney]] as Ella, a vain, self centered girl and Robyn's best friend. She attempts to gain Link's attention by flaunting her [[breasts]] at him. She is rebuffed, and learns that Link had a former love, and he has no interest in anyone else.
* [[Michael DeLuise]] as Matthew "Matt" Wilson, a popular jock and notorious school bully who has made it his passion in life to torment, bully, and humiliate Dave. He tends to keep his distance from Stoney, who merely shrugs off his intimidation attempts. He is very stuck-up and the thought of Dave becoming more popular than he is causes a great deal of conflict, eventually causing him to lose the one thing Dave wants that he has: Robyn.

==Production==
''Encino Man'' is directed by [[Les Mayfield]], a veteran of behind the scenes promotional documentaries, making his feature film debut. The film was shot in just thirty three days in the end of 1991, which was considered a short schedule for a comedy.

Pauly Shore was known for his show ''Totally Pauly'' on MTV and Disney expected this would bring an existing audience to the film. The film tested well with teen audiences, and Mayfield thanked ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' which came out a while before ''Encino Man'' for showing a comedy aimed at this demographic could do well.&lt;ref name="latimes-inside"&gt;{{cite news|title= A look inside Hollywood and the movies : SUMMERTIME BRUISE : Who Dares Intrude During the Season of the Giants?

{{Anchor|Costumes}}
Costume designer Marie France decided not to buy clothes; she instead custom made the wardrobe for Stoney's and Link's characters. For Shore, she took his own unusual style and gave it a younger look. For Fraser, who stands at a height of 6' 3", it was a matter of practicality, easier than trying to find the sizes needed, and she dressed him in baggy knee length shorts and oversized T shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-05/news/vw-653_1_pauly-shore | title = Clothes Make the Caveman | work = Los Angeles Times | date = June 5, 1992 | author = Robert Burns }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

'''Eugene Pandala''' is an [[India]]n architect, known for building with values of [[environmental sustainability]].

==Education and career==
Pandala studied for a Masters in Urban Design at the [[School of Planning and Architecture]], New Delhi. He had his Fellowship in Heritage Conservation at [[University of York]] and at [[Fort Brockhurst]] [[English Heritage]] Training Centre in the U.K. He was the founding head of the second school of Architecture in Kerala (1985) located at kollam where he spent educating and researching on traditional building technologies of India.

Pandala while studying at Delhi [[School of Planning and Architecture]] met the legendary architect [[Hassan Fathy]], and was inspired to build with mud. As a nature lover, and cultural heritage conservation activist, he designs buildings with natural materials, landscapes with biodiversity conservation, and native vegetation, preferring interesting organic forms.&lt;ref name="Magic of mud 2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=The magic of mud|url=http://www.hindu.com/pp/2005/06/04/stories/2005060400680100.htm|accessdate=2013-01-02|newspaper=The Hindu: Property Plus Kochi|date=4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandala built his first mud house in [[Kollam]] in 1996,&lt;ref name="Magic of mud 2005" /&gt; comprising 2,500 sq. ft. of building, bringing him to the public's attention.

His unique Architecture style paved way to many awards, and recognition. In 2011, [http://lalitkala.gov.in/ Lalith Kala Academy] awarded him the first Laurie Baker award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/first-laurie-baker-award-announced/article1139557.ece |title=Kerala News : First Laurie Baker Award |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-01-30 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Hindu The Sunday, 30 January 2011).

His heritage Conservation project in [[East Fort|East Fort Trivandrum]] was chosen for a commendation award by [http://www.insideoutside.in/inside-outside/issue-magazine/10437/thiruvananthapuram-fort Inside Outside magazine in 2004].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2004/12/03/stories/2004120300160400.htm |title=Business Line : Features / Life News |publisher=Thehindubusinessline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 for one of his residential building built with mud "Bodhi", Pandala was given, a Commendation award, by J.K.

[[Fort Cochin]] Heritage conservation project, Trivandrum East Fort Conservation projects, is often cited as good examples of [[Kerala]] [[heritage conservation]] initiatives. This was led by Eugene Pandala’s conservation team enabling the State Government to win the [[List of people from Kerala|PATA award]].
[[Sustainable architecture]]/[[Green buildings]] is a field where Pandala has excelled. His [[Tsunami]] rehabilitation project for [[Malayala Manorama]] and buildings for hospitality industries receives wide acclaim due to its interwoven complicity with nature.

He was a keynote speaker at the 361 degree conference 2016 held at Nehru centre in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Pandala profile |url=http://www.361degrees.net.in/eugene_pandala_2016.html |publisher=361° conference 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, British council hosted Pandala for their Great Talk Series in Mumbay and at Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Council Hosts The Great Talk in Mumbai |url=http://www.scholarshipsinindia.com/BRITISH-COUNCIL-HOSTS-THE-GREAT-TALK-IN-MUMBAI.html |publisher=Scholarshipsinindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must a be defined distinction between foreign and second language. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however, and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate. 

Some children learn more than one language from birth or from a very young age: they are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]]. These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to him. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults. However, there are studies which have shown adult students are better at foreign language learning than child students. It is because adults have pre-existing knowledge of how grammar works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt, Anne. "Are Children Really Better at Foreign Language Learning?"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|accessdate=2016-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511000800/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a superior ability of memorizing vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Elisabet, et al.

==Foreign language education and ability==
:''See main article: [[Language education]]''
{{globalise/Europe|date=November 2010}}

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation.  By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being [[Ireland]], where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in [[Flemish Community|Flanders]] at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm#2.6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112090730/http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm |date=2007-01-12 }} Children in the [[Flemish Community|Flemish Community of Belgium]] start learning [[French language|French]] at age 10, [[English language|English]] at 12 or 13 and, if chosen so, mostly [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at age 15 or 16, but with only the first two being obligatory. In the [[Brussels Capital Region]], however, French is taught starting at age 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wales]], all children are taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal [[GCSE]] qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial [[language immersion|immersion]] to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the [[European Commission]]'s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The [[Lisbon Summit]] of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language and less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the American population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Amelia (2015). America's Lacking Language Skills. 'The Atlantic'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruments for foreign language learning===
{{Main|Language education}}

In recent years, [[computer-assisted language learning]] has been integrated into foreign language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmberg, R. (1989). Integrating CALL into Foreign-Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; Language learning aids such as [[foreign language writing aid]] and [[foreign language reading aid]], targeted at the specific language skills of foreign language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign language learners.

==Research into foreign language learning==
{{Main|Second language acquisition}}

In 2004, a report by the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the [[United Kingdom]] suggested that speaking a second language could increase an average worker's salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.

Also in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.&lt;/ref&gt; helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==
{{underlinked|section|date=November 2012}}

There are no major differences in different definitions that different writers have provided about foreign language and second language, although not many of them differentiate these two terms. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and [[TEFL]] (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows some attention of different researchers to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide this information about second language:

"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfils many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home)."

They also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).

Crystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.
Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).

A 'second language' usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to USA, then English becomes a second language for him or her. Thus British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. In Kermanshah or Kurdistan, we can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.

Second language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.

There is often a distinction between acquisition and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

The distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.

Nevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, immigrants to the US can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.

'''Helena Mathilda Munktell''' (24 November 1852 – 10 September 1919) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] composer. She was born in [[Grycksbo]], [[Dalarna]], into a wealthy family, the youngest of nine children of Henry and Augusta Munktell. Her mother lived separately in [[Stockholm]] and after her father died, the family moved there.

Munktell studied music at the Stockholm Conservatory with [[:sv:Conrad Nordqvist|Conrad Nordqvist]], [[:sv:Johan Lindegren|Johan Lindegren]], [[Ludwig Norman]] and [[:sv:Joseph Dente|Joseph Dente]], and then in [[Vienna]] with [[Julius Epstein (pianist)|Julius Epstein]]. She studied both piano and voice, and continued her education in composition in [[Paris]] with [[Benjamin Godard]] and [[Vincent d'Indy]]. Her debut as a composer took place in Sweden in 1885. She suffered from eye disease and died at the age of 67 in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=Helena+Munktell+(1852%E2%80%931919)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3FQmTZz1B8P88AbS7tmbAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Helena%20Munktell%20(1852%E2%80%931919)&amp;f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The new Grove dictionary of music and musicians: Volume 17|first=Stanley|last=Sadie|first2=John|last2=Tyrrell|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indrani Rahman''' (19 September 1930, [[Chennai]] – 5 February 1999, New York) was an [[Indian classical dance]]r, of [[Bharata Natyam]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathakali]] and [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], which she popularised in the west, and later settled in New York in 1976.

In 1952, she won the Miss India pageant. Later, she joined her mother Ragini Devi's company. She popularised the Indian classical dance form, Odissi during her international tours. Indrani had received the [[Padma Shri]] in 1969 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in the performing arts and also the Taraknath Das Award.

==Background and family==
Indrani Rahman was born in [[Chennai]] (then Madras), the daughter of Ramalal Balram Bajpai (1880–1962), sometime president of the Indo-American League, by his wife Ragini Devi (nee Esther Luella Sherman). Her father, Ramalal Bajpai, was of [[North India|north Indian]] background, a chemist who went to the USA for higher education. Her he met and married Esther Luella Sherman, an American by birth. Born in [[Petoskey, Michigan]] in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=Indrani+Rahman&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UG21ibydVs&amp;sig=Ux8Bp1Lkdv_6Dksce8KAtbaZo-A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA172,M1 Ragini Devi Biography] ''Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century'', by Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

''Page 172-173''.&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1982),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sawf.org/newedit/edit03042002/bookreview.asp Book Review] South Asian Women Forum&lt;/ref&gt; Esther embraced Hinduism upon her wedding and took the name 'Ragini Devi.'&lt;ref name=inde&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990218/ai_n14213909 Obituary: Indrani Rehman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915160047/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990218/ai_n14213909 |date=15 September 2008 }} by Kuldip Singh, '' [[The Independent]] ''  (London), 18 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple moved to India in the 1920s. Ramalal then took a job as Assistant Editor of ''[[Young India]],'' the magazine founded by [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]. After [[Independence of India|Independence]], he became the [[Consulate General|Consul General]] of India at New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.authorsguild.net/sukanya/imagelib/Nagpur-final-ve.jpg Ramalal Balram Bajpai – Biography]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and president of the Indo-American League. Meanwhile, Ragini became a passionate proponent of [[Indian classical dance]] and devoted her life to their revival and nurture. This happened after a fateful meeting with the great ''rajadasi,'' (royal courtesan) Jetti Tayamma of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], from whom she started learning [[Bharata Natyam]]. She then honed her dancing talents under the tutelage of Gauri Amma, a courtesan of Chennai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2001/10/28/stories/2001102800130501.htm Rhythm of the new millennium] Leela Venkatraman, ''[[The Hindu]]'', 28 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2002/09/22/stories/2002092200110400.htm Dancing through their lives] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 22 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1944/12/09/archives/hindu-dances-presented-ragini-devi-seen-in-theatre-of-all-nations.html?sq=Indrani%2520Rehman&amp;scp=8&amp;st=cse HINDU DANCES PRESENTED; Ragini Devi Seen in Theatre of All Nations Performance] ''[[New York Times]]'', 9 December 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Ragini then became a celebrated dancer herself, and was among the most feted performers of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Ragini also championed the revival of [[Kathakali]] during the same period.

Indrani was born in Chennai to this couple and grew up in a mixed-race household. She was brought up to be uninhibited and independent by her American mother, who encouraged her to participate in beauty pageants. As one of very few participants from across the country who could be persuaded to contest the pageant, Indrani was crowned 'Miss India' in the year 1952. When she was a schoolgirl only fifteen years old, and still underage according to Indian law, she eloped with Habib Rahman, a world renowned architect, who, at thirty, was exactly twice her age.

==Career==
Indrani started learning dance in her mother's company, at age nine, and accompanied her as she travelled through, Americas, and Europe. Professionally, she first started with [[Bharata Natyam]], having learnt the [[Pandanallur style]] of [[Bharata Natyam]] from Guru Chokkalingam Pillai (1893–1968) in the 1940s. Soon she was in [[Vijaywada]], learning [[Kuchipudi]] from [[Korada Narsimha Rao]] with whom she later toured many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ibPELNiEhKwC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Indrani+Rahman&amp;sig=ACfU3U37jMUE-q2vVVAG4dnbpiSq2OOlzA Indrani Rahman] ''Kuchipudi: Kūcipūdi : Indian Classical Dance Art'', by Sunil Kothari, Avinash Pasricha.

In 1947, Indrani attracted the attention of India's leading dance and art critic Dr. Charles Fabri, who later encouraged her to go to Orissa and learn the little-known classical dance form of [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], making her the first professional dancer to learn Odissi. After learning Odissi for three years, from Guru Sri Deba Prasad Das, she went on to popularise it, through performance in various parts of India and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lif-Ct05aVgC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22Indrani+Rehman%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U2kSGXepvkS4-PBpry0OquzGPMXVA Indrani Rahman] ''India's Dances: Their History, Technique, and Repertoire'', by Reginald Massey.

The '''Kohl McCormick Early Childhood Teaching Awards''' honors five outstanding [[Chicago area]] early childhood educators each year. The selection process begins each fall with an open call for nominees. Each nominee must be a full-time Chicago early childhood teacher with at least five years experience with students eight years old or younger. They may work in preschools, home day care centers, childcare centers, Head Start programs, State Prekindergartens, and kindergarten through third-grade classrooms in public, private, and parochial schools. The awards have been restricted to teachers in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] in [[Illinois]], but beginning in 2008, the honor will be extended to [[DuPage County]] as well. 

A committee of leaders in the field of early childhood education reviews all nominees and then conducts site visits to a select group of the nominees. From their observations, the committee members select a group of finalists. Five of those finalists are then chosen to represent the best of the field, following a final application process that includes additional site visits and interviews by fellows from the [[Kohl McCormick Academy of Outstanding Educators]]. The five award winners are honored at a June luncheon ceremony.

Each winner receives:

* A $5,000 cash prize;
* A $1,000 cash prize for his or her school or center;
* A visit and workshop from the [[Kohl McCormick StoryBus]] providing hands-on learning for early literacy;
* A field trip and workshop at the [[Kohl Children's Museum]];
* A graduate-level course at Chicago's renowned [[Erikson Institute]];
* Induction into the Kohl McCormick Academy of Outstanding Educators.

The awards program seeks to raise public awareness of the importance of quality early childhood education and to raise the self-esteem of early childhood educators. As a result, the program also hopes to encourage better funding for early childhood education; encourage qualified candidates to enter the field; help in the retention of highly qualified teachers; and help parents to support their children’s learning. 

Begun in 1996, the awards are a joint project of the [[Dolores Kohl Education Foundation]] and the McCormick Tribune Foundation. All winners are admitted into membership in the Kohl McCormick Academy of Outstanding Educators. The academy also includes recipients of the [[Kohl International Teaching Awards]], which were given from 1985 to 1994.

Krakow UNESCO City of Literature hosts two large literary festivals, i.e. the [[Conrad Festival]] (the greatest Polish event of its type), and the Milosz Festival. Both festivals were in 2017 granted the EFFE Label which is awarded by the [[European Festivals Association]] to events of international rank and distinctive artistic quality that are characterized by high involvement of the local community.

=== Debut support ===
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature is involved in supporting young talents and literary debutants. Each year, during the Conrad Festival, the Conrad Award is awarded for the best literary debut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raport.miastoliteratury.pl/en/2015-calendar/the-conrad-award/|title=The Conrad Award - Raport - Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|date=15 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The “Promoters of Debuts”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raport.miastoliteratury.pl/en/2015-calendar/october/promoters-of-debuts/|title=Promoters of Debuts - Raport - Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|date=10 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; program has been developed in order to ensure funds for publishing houses to cover the cost of publication of debutant works. In addition, there is a UNESCO City of Literature Creative Writing Course which unites and educates young talents supervised by renowned and experienced writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raport.miastoliteratury.pl/en/2015-calendar/september/creative-writing-course/|title=Creative Writing Course - Raport - Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|date=9 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Read PL! ===
Read PL! is a project created in cooperation with the Woblink.com e-book platform to promote reading through permitting free access to electronic versions of new book arrivals and bestsellers. In public places (mostly at bus/tram stops and in schools) the organisers post posters with QR codes which can be scanned with the Woblink application to offer free access to selected books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raport.miastoliteratury.pl/en/2015-calendar/october/nationwide-readpl-campaign/|title=Nationwide ReadPL! campaign - Raport - Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== City Codes ===
Within the City Codes project, the benches in the [[Planty Park|Krakow Planty Park]] have been marked with special tablets with the names of writers who have been important for the city of Krakow, together with QR codes that refer to websites with fragments of texts by specific authors, as well as their Polish and English audio versions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/city-codes/|title=City Codes : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Multipoetry. Poems on the walls ===
During each first week of month, poems written by authors connected with other Cities of Literature – Dublin, Edinburg, Iowa City, [[Melbourne City of Literature|Melbourne]], Norwich and Reykjavik – were displayed on the wall of the Potocki Family Tenement House at 20 Main Market Square in 2014 and 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/multipoetry/|title=Multipoetry : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Literary walks ===
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature organises cyclic literary walks whereby readers led by their guides have an opportunity to see buildings and places that used to be or that are important for the most outstanding  writers living in Krakow. Several literary routes have been delineated so far within the project, including those dedicated to [[Wisława Szymborska]], [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] or [[Joseph Conrad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/literary-walks-in-krakow/|title=Literary walks in Krakow : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Champion Bookstores in Krakow ===
The project focuses on the cooperation with stationary bookstores in Krakow. It has been developed for the sake of readers, book lovers, and booksellers. Its task is to support the Krakow book market through the integration, coordination and implementation of the rich program of cultural events in Krakow stationary bookstores. The project is to equip booksellers with additional tools and promotion methods, to enrich their cultural offer, and build permanent relationships with readers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/champion-bookstores-of-krakow/|title=Champion Bookstores of Krakow  : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Krakow Book Fair ===
The Krakow Book Fair is a cyclic event that promotes the idea of second-hand book circulation. It is held once in every several weeks at the St. Mary Magdalene Square in Krakow, where a dozen or so of Krakow antiquarians and second-hand booksellers put up their stands and present their offer. The fair is always accompanied by discussions, literary meetings, and open-air shows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/the-krakow-book-fair/|title=The Krakow Book Fair : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Independent Bookstore Festival ===
Independent Bookstore Festival is a project implemented in bookstores by the [[Copernicus Foundation]] under the patronage of Krakow UNESCO City of Literature. The Festival is a year-round series of events organised by booksellers for all readers who want to talk with one another about books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/independent-bookstore-festival-2016/|title=Independent Bookstore Festival 2016 : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Read locally ===
The project aims at promoting bookstores as cultural centres and places where social ties begin. Read locally promotes most unique bookstores that carry out unique, proprietary and bottom-up cultural activity. The project includes a series of interviews with the staff and with famous frequent visitors of most interesting bookstores in Krakow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raport.miastoliteratury.pl/en/2015-calendar/november/read-local/|title=Read Local - Raport - Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=Raport 2015 Miasta Literatury|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== The Second Life of a Book ===
The action facilitates free book exchange. It is held cyclically at most interesting places that are connected with literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/the-second-life-of-a-book/|title=The Second Life of a Book : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== International Cooperation ==

=== ICORN (International Cities of Refuge Network) ===
[[ICORN]] is an independent network of cities that offer a shelter to writers and artists persecuted for their creative work. It acts in defence of the freedom of expression and of democratic values. It also acts for international solidarity. The network’s member cities offer refuge to those who cannot freely live and create in their own homelands due to persecutions. ICORN’s main objective is to ensure asylum to as many persecuted writers and artists as possible, and to establish a permanent global network to defend the freedom of expression together with its sister organisations. Within the ICORN program in 2011-2017, Krakow hosted seven writers: [[Maria Amelie]] (born Madina Salamowa – North Ossetia, today in Norway), [[Kareem Amer]] (Egypt/today in Norway), [[Mostafa Zamaninij]] (Iran), [[Lawon Barszczewski]] (Belarus), [[Asli Erdogan]] (Turkey), [[Felix Kaputu]] (Congo), and [[Monem Mahjoub]] (Libya). While implementing the ICORN program, Krakow City of Literature cooperates with the [[Villa Decius Association]] that coordinates the residents’ stay and offers them space for their creative work.

=== Drop the Mic. Nordic-Baltic Slam Poetry Network ===
Drop the Mic is a project that aims at creating an international space for poets, writers, authors of texts, and organisers of festivals and poetry slams that support performative literature. The project is to popularize the idea of poetry slams and to integrate poets and other authors at international level through their joint participation in projects. So far, events within the Drop the Mic (meetings, workshops, poetry slams) have been held in Reykjavik (Iceland), Tartu (Estonia), Copenhagen (Dania), Heidelberg (Germany), and Krakow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bokmenntaborgin.is/en/drop-mic-nordic-baltic-poetry-slam-network|title=Drop the Mic: Nordic-Baltic Poetry Slam Network|date=12 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engage! Young Producers ===
Engage! Young Producers is an international educational project aimed at promoting young people’s committed participation in literary and cultural life interpreted as a means to develop their critical thinking skills and better comprehension of multicultural reality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeeuropeuk.eu/funded-projects/engage-young-producers-building-bridges-freer-world|title=ENGAGE. Young producers. Building bridges to a freer world - Creative Europe Desk UK|website=www.creativeeuropeuk.eu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The project is addressed mainly to secondary school students (between 16 and 19 years of age), especially those with little access to culture, and to all local organisations and cultural institutions whose activity involves literature. Engage! is held simultaneously in several European cities (Barcelona, Norwich, Vaxjo, Krakow), and always with the support of secondary schools, libraries and cultural institutions that develop their own customized programs so as to best apply the general objectives of the complete Engage! project. Within the Engage! Young Producers project the Krakow Festival Office implements a yearly education program for secondary school students – Word for Word. Poetry is my language.

=== Krakow UNESCO City of Literature Residency Program ===
The residency program is addressed to writers and authors from the other UNESCO Cities of Literature. During their stipend stay in Krakow, residents have an opportunity to experience Krakow literary life, establish contacts with the local literary industry and writers. So far, Krakow has hosted [[Brynjar Jóhannesson]] from Reykjavik, [[Sarah Stewart (Scottish writer)|Sarah Stewart]] from Edinburgh, and [[Sarah Herman]] from Norwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakowcityofliterature.com/programme/krakow-city-of-literature-residency-programme/|title=Krakow City of Literature Residency Programme : Kraków Miasto Literatury UNESCO|website=krakowcityofliterature.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

'''Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology''' ('''KNUST''') is a university in [[Kumasi]], [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]], [[Ghana]]. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology is the [[public university]] established in the country, as well as the largest university in [[Kumasi|Kumasi Metropolis]] and Ashanti. KNUST has its roots in the plans of the [[Prempeh I|King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh I]] to establish a university in Kumasi as part of his drive towards modernization of his [[Ashanti Kingdom|Ashanti kingdom]]. This plan never came to fruition due to the clash between British empire expansion and the desire for King Prempeh I to preserve his Ashanti kingdom's independence.

However, his younger brother and successor, [[Osei Tutu Agyeman Prempeh II|King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh II]], upon ascending to the [[Golden Stool]] in 1935, continued with this vision. Events in the [[Gold Coast]] in the 1940s played into his hands. First there was the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast. Second there were the 1948 riots and the consequent Watson Commission report which recommended that a university of sciences be established in Kumasi. Thus, in 1949, the dream of the Prempehs became a reality when building started on what was to be called the Kumasi College of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eaumf.org/ejm-blog/2018/1/23/january-22-1952-kumasi-college-of-technology-is-established|title=January 22, 1952: Kumasi College of Technology is established|work=Edward A. Ulzen Memorial Foundation|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kumasi College of Technology offered admission to its first students to the engineering faculty in 1951 (they entered in 1952), and an Act of Parliament gave the university its legal basis as the [[Kumasi College of Technology]] in 1952. The nucleus of the college was formed from 200 teacher training students transferred from [[Achimota]] in the [[Greater Accra Region]]. The college was affiliated to the [[University of London]]. In 1961, the college was granted full university status.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~univghana/ghanahed.htm |title=THE UNIVERSITIES IN GHANA |accessdate=10 March 2007 |author=G.

The main university campus, which is about seven square miles in area, is about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} to the east of Kumasi, the [[Ashanti Region]]al capital.&lt;ref name="UGOO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanauniversities.com/university_detail.php?id=5 |title=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science &amp; Technology, KUMASI |accessdate=11 March 2007 |work=Universities |publisher=Universities of Ghana Overseas Office}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Kwame nkrumah.jpg|thumb|right|Osagyefo Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first President of the Republic of Ghana]]
The Kumasi College of Technology opened officially on 22 January 1952 with 200 teacher training students transferred from [[Achimota]], to form the nucleus of the new college. In October 1952, the School of Engineering and the Department of Commerce were established and the first students were admitted. A Pharmacy Department was established in January 1953, with the transfer of the former School of Pharmacy from [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]], [[Accra]], to the college. The department ran a two-year comprehensive course in Pharmacy leading to the award of the Pharmacy Board Certificate. A Department of Agriculture was opened in the same year to provide ad hoc courses of varying duration, from a few terms to three years, for the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of General Studies was instituted to prepare students for the Higher School Certificate Examinations in Science and Arts subjects and to give instruction in subjects as requested by the other departments.

From 1952 to 1955, the School of Engineering prepared students for professional qualifications only. In 1955, the school embarked on courses leading to the [[University of London]] Bachelor of Engineering External Degree Examinations.

In 1957, the School of Architecture, Town Planning and Building was inaugurated. Its first students were admitted in January 1958, for professional courses. As the college expanded, it was decided to make the Kumasi College of Technology a purely science and technology institution. In pursuit of this policy, the Teacher Training College, with the exception of the Art School, was transferred in January 1958, to the Winneba Training College; in 1959 the Commerce Department was transferred to Achimota to form the nucleus of the present School of Administration of the [[University of Ghana]], Legon.

In December 1960, the [[Government of Ghana]] appointed a University Commission to advise it on the development of university education, in connection with the proposal to transform the University College of Ghana and the Kumasi College of Technology into an independent University of Ghana. Following the report of the commission which came out early 1961, the government decided to establish two independent universities in Kumasi and [[Legon]], Accra. The Kumasi College of Technology was thus transformed, under the supervision of [[R. P. Baffour]], into a full-fledged University Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology by an Act of [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]] on 22 August 1961. The name honors [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first prime minister and later [[president of Ghana]].

The name was changed to University of Science and Technology after the Revolution of 24 February 1966. The University of Science and Technology was officially inaugurated on Wednesday, 20 November 1961. However, another act of Parliament (Act 559 of 1998) changed the name back to its original version, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi.&lt;ref name="KNUST_History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knust.edu.gh/hospital/pages/sections.php?siteid=knust&amp;mid=14&amp;sid=94&amp;id=115|title=Our History|author=|work=Official Website|publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|date=|accessdate=29 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164113/http://knust.edu.gh/hospital/pages/sections.php?siteid=knust&amp;mid=14&amp;sid=94&amp;id=115|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and administration ==

=== Principal officers ===
[[File:KNUST main entrance with Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of the KNUST, Kumasi and the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park with a statue of the first [[President of Ghana|president]] of the [[Ghana|Republic of Ghana]] and the founder of the university with five smaller figures in national attire playing drums]]
The principal officers of the university are the chancellor, chairman of the University Council and vice-chancellor. As of 2018, the position of chancellor was held by the Asantehene [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II|Otumfuo Osei Tutu II]].

=== Governing body ===
Governance is carried out by the [[University Council]], primarily through the Academic Board, which is responsible for:
* formulating and carrying out the academic policy of the university
* devising and regulating the courses of instruction and study, and supervising research
* regulating the conduct of examinations and the award of degrees, diplomas and certificates
* advising the University Council on the admission of students and the award of scholarships
* reporting on such matters as may be referred to it by the University Council

=== Student participation in university administration ===
Students participate in the administration of the university through their representatives serving on the University Council, Academic Board, the Welfare Services Board, Faculty and Departmental Boards, Residence Committee, Library Committee and on the Hall Councils.&lt;ref name="KNUST_SRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://src.knust.edu.gh/ |title=KNUST Students' Representative Council |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827124806/http://src.knust.edu.gh/ |archivedate=27 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collegiate system ===
[[File:College of Engineering, KNUST Auditorium.JPG|thumb|College of Engineering, KNUST [[auditorium]]]]
KNUST has, since January 2005, transformed from its previous centralized system of administration into a decentralized [[collegiate university]]. Under this system, the faculties have been condensed into six colleges.

The university had been administered on the faculty-based system. This led to administrative difficulties as new faculties and institutes were created to meet the ever-growing academic pursuits of students. To solve this problem, a collegiate system was officially adopted on 29 November 2004. On 5 April 2005, the pioneering provosts were inducted and invested into office at the Great Hall of the KNUST.

The colleges are semi-autonomous, which means that they are given the power to largely run on their own without much dependence on the central administration for financial support. A college registrar, finance officer and librarian assist the provosts. Under them are the faculties, centres and institutes, headed by deans and directors. As heads of the colleges, the provosts provide academic and administrative leadership for the colleges and oversee their overall running.&lt;ref name="KNUST_VCs_Report_2009"&gt;{{Citation |title = The Vice-Chancellor's Report |publisher=University Press - KNUST |location=Kumasi |date=June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing and Accommodation ==
There are numerous KNUST approved hostels mostly within close proximity to main campus. Students of all financial backgrounds have their accommodation needs catered for. There are six halls of residence at the Kumasi campus, each administered by a hall council consisting of senior and junior members. The executive head is the hall master, who is assisted by a senior tutor. There is a hall bursar and other supporting staff.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/halls |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618221801/http://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/halls |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 June 2013 |title=Halls of Residence |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Scienhostel tice and Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halls of residence ===
* '''Africa Hall''' is the only all-female hall in the university. It was first occupied by students on 14 October 1967. Members of the hall are known as ''Domites''. A majority of the female senior members are assigned to Africa Hall as Fellows. ''Dome'' has 192 inhabitable rooms, with a student population of about 786.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;
* '''Independence Hall''' was officially opened in February 1959 to commemorate the attainment of Ghana's independence on 6 March 1957, and was the first permanent hall of residence. Women were admitted to the hall for the first time in 1991. Members are known as ''Spartans''.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;
* '''Queen's Hall''' was named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and was officially opened in November 1959 by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen visited the hall in 1961 during her state visit to Ghana. Queen's Hall is co-educational and houses a student population of 840, with 294 rooms. Members are usually known as ''Royals''.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;
* '''Republic Hall''', nicknamed ''Akukɔ Repo'', is a mixed hall with about 850 local and international students. It was named to commemorate Ghana's attainment of republic status in 1960, and was officially opened in 1961. Women were admitted to the hall for the first time in 1991. The main hall has 198 rooms, and there are 96 rooms in the annex block. Residents of Republic Hall are known as ''Moguls''.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;
* '''Unity Hall''' is the largest hall in West Africa with an original accommodation capacity of 432 rooms and presently with 48 extra flats housed in the building. It is an all-male hall with facilities nicknamed ''The Twin Towers''. Members are known as ''Continentals''. The student population is more than 1880. The hall welcomed its first residents on 16 October 1968.It is the only traditional hall on campus with a study room equipped with a wireless internet connection. It is popularly known as ''Conti''. It is currently the largest male hall in Ghana and west Africa.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;
* '''University Hall''' is the real name of the first all-male hall in KNUST which is popularly known as Katanga.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls" /&gt;

==== Hostels ====
About 60% of the student population is non-resident. There are private hostels around the campus and in Kumasi for students who, as a result of the limited facilities/rooms, could not be admitted as resident students.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Hostel Tips for Students"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/housing-tips |title=Hostel Tips for students |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618221644/http://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/housing-tips |archivedate=18 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are facilities on campus where non-resident students can rest between lectures and study before they leave for their homes and hostels.

In January 2014, the top floor of the Crystal Rose Hostel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigations begin into KNUST hostel fire|url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/15543-investigations-begin-into-knust-hostel-fire.html|author=Felix A. Baidoo|work=Daily Graphic|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; caught fire while most students were on vacation. The cause of the fire is still not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire engulfs KNUST hostel |url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2014/January-9th/fire-engulfs-knust-hostel.php|publisher=www.myjoyonline.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International students ===
There is a large multinational international community at KNUST as a result of the high standards of education. There is an international student association that sees to the interests of foreign students such as accommodation, orientation and campus tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knust.edu.gh/students/international|title=International Students - Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|author=|date=|website=www.knust.edu.gh|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
[[File:Peace Pole, Kumasi, Ghana.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace Pole]] was erected on the campus of the university on 21 September 2006 on the [[International Day of Peace]]. The pole is made of a 105-year-old [[sapele]] tree that used to stand in the university's botanical garden. The pole is {{convert|16.7|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall. Indigenous symbols have been carved in bas-relief on it in five languages ([[Akan language|Twi]]—a local language in Ghana, [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). The peace prayer on the pole says: "May peace be upon Earth"]]

| October 12, 1992
| [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], United States
| A 43-year-old graduate student, Arthur McElroy, walked into an actuarial science class at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] and attempted to open fire on about 20 students with a [[.30 carbine|.30-caliber]] [[M-1 carbine]]. As students reacted by hitting the floor and pulling desks over their heads in anticipation, the gun jammed, and McElroy was apprehended. A court later found McElroy insane. He was taken to the Lincoln Regional Center's Forensic Mental Services unit in December 1992. In May 2015, a Lancaster Country district judge announced plans for McElroy's release to a local nursing home after declaring McElroy to no longer be a threat to himself or others.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalstar.com/news/local/mcelroy-to-be-released-from-regional-center/article_f3e18b2f-805d-5395-8a48-c379d991ee37.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Police were notified the previous week of the impending plot and met the Sunday before to plan the arrests. None of the guns were confiscated from the student's parents. Two of the students were held on prior convictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://journaltimes.com/news/burlington-teens-arrested-in-high-school-murder-plot/article_2a70b9ca-e5bd-5214-b255-1fec77c1e142.html&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Port Huron, Michigan]], United States
| A 12-year-old, 13-year-old and two 14-year-olds, all boys, planned to hold up a gun store and then attack the school. Once there, they planned to rape some of the girls and shoot as many as 154 targets which they had drawn up on a list. They had stolen a building plan from the custodian's office but they were all caught within a day of a classmate's report to an assistant principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/05/24/school.shooting.html |title=Just a routine school shooting |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| 17-year-old Joshua Magee was arrested in the parking lot of Malcolm High School after a school staff member, who saw the youth drinking liquor and putting on a black overcoat, called the police. A search of Magee's car produced a bolt-action rifle, 20 bombs and a note stating that he wanted to injure everyone at the school except for three friends. Magee, to whom the school paid close attention after it was reported to faculty that he was experimenting with explosives at home, was charged with attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-03-18-school-nebraska_x.htm |title=Nebraska teen's bomb plot foiled |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-03-18 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], United States
| Two 17-year-old boys were arrested the morning of Sept. 14 at [[Green Bay East High School]] for allegedly planning an armed attack on their school. Authorities said they found suicide notes at the homes of both Shawn Ryan Sturtz and William Charles Cornell. The following items were also found at Cornell's home: handmade explosives; bbs; gunpowder; toilet paper tubes and firecrackers; six one-quart jars of napalm; nine long guns, including rifles and shotguns; one handgun; walkie-talkies; numerous pellet guns; hundreds of rounds of ammunition; and mannequin heads that may have been used for target practice.

| October 11, 2007
| [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania]], United States
|14-year-old Dillon Cossey was arrested at his home in Plymouth Meeting after a friend told police about his plan to carry out a Columbine-style attack on [[Plymouth Whitemarsh High School]]. After a police-conducted search of the Cossey residence, officers found a 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[Hi-Point Carbine]], which he named "Reb" in honor of Eric Harris, over 30 airsoft guns, a dozen knives and swords, seven homemade explosives, four which were live, a copy of ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]'', and several movies about the [[Columbine High School Massacre]], all which were in the boy's bedroom. A .22 rifle and a .22 pistol, which were lent to another acquaintance for safe-keeping, were also recovered by authorities. However, no ammunition turned up in the search, so investigators have concluded that the threat of an attack was not imminent. Even on Cossey's [[MySpace]] page, he discussed his admiration for the bank robbers of the [[North Hollywood shootout]] as well as for [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the Columbine gunmen. In his trial, Cossey confessed that he was going to carry out his shooting to kill the people who had relentlessly bullied him in elementary and middle school. Bullying led his parents to pull him out of public school at the end of his 7th grade year and home-school him. It was later found that he also had contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the perpetrator of the [[Jokela school shooting]], though Cossey apparently had no knowledge of Auvinen's plans. Cossey is currently serving time in juvenile detention and could possibly stay until the age of 21. His mother, Michelle Cossey, faced charges for purchasing the weapons and other charges regarding the welfare of her son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc10.com/news/14317753/detail.html Police: Teen Planning 'Columbine-Like' Attack Had Weapons Cache, ''NBC''] (October 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3782761 |title=U.S. News &amp;#124; National News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/school-killer-in-touch-with-us-boy/2007/11/13/1194766673685.html |title=School killer in touch with US boy planning massacre - World |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301379,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], United States
|An eighth grade student who attended St. Andrew School in Drexel Hill was arrested after a fellow pupil he attempted to recruit for an attack tipped off authorities. The suspect was then pulled from class and later arrested. Shortly after, two Airsoft pistols were found in his backpack, one of them looking very much like a real gun. The plan of the 13-year-old student was to force the school in lock down and shoot anybody who tried to escape. He is charged with terroristic threats and reckless endangerment and is currently held in juvenile detention. He is also charged with burglary for stealing $370 from another school in Drexel Hill on the previous weekend. It is noted that the suspect has a history of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6703373 6abc.com and Action News: Police: Student tried to recruit for attack|6abc.com].

| [[Beauvais]], France
| A 13-year-old boy, who was said to have had difficulties at his school, was arrested in [[Beauvais]], accused of having planned to shoot his teachers. His parents had called police after they found their son acting strangely and a gun missing. When the boy, armed with a hunting rifle and 25 cartridges, arrived at the school, it was already surrounded by police, so he dropped his plans, left the rifle in a field and went to an Internet café in the city. That day, a parent-teacher meeting was scheduled to discuss his future at the school, and it was suspected that he wanted to prevent this meeting from taking place. He apparently also wrote in a blog the evening before that this was the last day in his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/119/article_5890.asp Police foil teenager's plan to shoot teachers], ''[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]'' (November 18, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6592610/French-boy-leaves-home-for-school-intending-to-shoot-teachers.html French boy leaves home for school 'intending to shoot teachers'], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' (November 18, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Marie Luise Meyer was born in [[Aachen]] where her father, Friedrich August Meyer, worked as a theatre inspector.   He had recently married her mother, born  Anna Maria Absenger, who was a stage singer.&lt;ref name=LDElautAE/&gt;   Luise had a younger sister, [[:de:Marie Meyer|Marie Meyer]] (1840-1908) who went on to become a stage actress.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Binder: Gustav Meyrink. Ein Leben im Bann der Magie. Vitalis Verlag, Prag 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-89919-078-6}}, p. 16f.&lt;/ref&gt;

She received her first musical education from her mother, who by this time was working as a [[soubrette]] in [[Wrocław|Breslau (as Wrocław was known at that time)]].   When she was 17 she moved to [[Vienna]] to receive further lessons in singing and stagecraft.&lt;ref name=LDElautAE/&gt;   Here, according to a biographical article in the [[:de:Illustrirte Zeitung|Illustrirte Zeitung (newpaper)]], she had to "battle with many difficulties during the [brief but bloody] [[Vienna Uprising|October uprising]] of 1848".   Tantalisingly, the writer does not elaborate.&lt;ref name=LMDlautBLKOe/&gt;

She made her stage debut in the 1848/49 season at the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]] under the direction of the multi-talented [[Kapellmeister]] [[Albert Lortzing]].   After a time she left Vienna and joined her parents who were still working in Breslau.   Here she took work at the City Theatre (''"Städtische Bühne"'').   She was engaged during 1850 and 1851 as a stage singer at the [[Staatstheater Kassel|Court Theatre]] in [[Kassel]] where she enjoyed great success as the company's lead soprano under the musical direction of [[Louis Spohr]].   Her reputation established, she was now able to broaden her horizons, touring theatres in various principal north German cities giving a succession of well applauded guest performances, notably in [[Braunschweig]] and [[Hamburg]].   In 1852 Luise Meyer switched to the [[:de:Königliches Hoftheater Dresden|Royal Court Theatre]] in [[Dresden]], remaining under contract there till 1854.   However, she was not well accepted by the theatre community in Dresden, and was happy to accept an invitation to move to [[Prague]] where she quickly became a favourite with audiences.&lt;ref name=LMDlautBLKOe/&gt;

From Prague she was able to travel and make a number pf guest appearances elsewhere, notably in [[Stuttgart]], [[Strasbourg]] and back in [[Vienna]] itself.   During July 1856 she undertook a succession of guest performances at Vienna.   She featured there in the first Vienna performances of [[Les Huguenots]].   Positive press reviews and public reactions adumbrated her future as the leading soprano of Vienna's Imperial Court Opera-Theatre (''"K. K. Hof-Operntheater"'').&lt;ref name=LMDlautBLKOe/&gt;   During this time she came to the notice of [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria|the Archduke Franz Karl]] who instructed that she should be invited to join the Court Opera.   She was enrolled into the company in 1 January 1857.

In 1858 she married Adalbert Dustmann, a [[Vienna]] book seller.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Dürrer, Isabel Kraft (ed) Richard Wagner, Sämtliche Briefe, Band 9 – Briefe August 1857 bis August 1858, 2003, Leipzig, Breitkopf und Härtel, {{ISBN|978-3-7651-0413-8}}, p. 678: „Dustmann, Adalbert, Buchhändler in Wien, Ehemann von Luise Dustmann-Meyer.“&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1860 she became an imperial [[Kammersänger|"Hofkammersängerin" (''literally, "court chamber singer"'')]], an important but largely honorific appointment.   Her voice had developed into a powerful precise soprano one, with a good range and a particular pleasing euphony in the middle register.   Her intonation was accurate and confident.   Her natural gifts, backed by diligent and intense study, matched with a deep sensitivity to the true artistic potential of her various stage roles, made her well suited to portray leading characters, including [[Norma (opera)|Norma]], [[Jessonda]], Amalie in [[Un ballo in maschera|Ballo in maschera]], Valentine in [[Les Huguenots]], Mathilde in [[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]].&lt;ref name=LMDlautBLKOe/&gt;    By 1875 she had been seen and heard by an appreciative Viennese audience in almost all the important lead soprano roles of the time.   That year she ended her full-time stage career in the role of Elsa von Brabant in [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]].&lt;ref name=StaatsoperW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiv.wiener-staatsoper.at/search/person/5953|publisher= Wiener Staatsoper GmbH|title=Vorstellungen mit Luise Dustmann-Mayer |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There were, however, further guest appearances as Amalie in [[Un ballo in maschera|Ballo in maschera]] in Court Opera productions in 1877 and 1881.

Alongside the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], Meyer-Dustmann returned again and again to the operas of [[Richard Wagner]].   She conducted a lengthy correspondence with Wagner who always described her as "''his'' soprano".   There was evidently great mutual respect.   When he was considering her for the Isolde role in the debut [[Karlsruhe]] production of [[Tristan and Isolde]], the composer told [[Minna Planer|his wife, Minna]] that Meyer-Dustmann had a "beautiful soulful voice, capable of anything [as well as] an excellent dramatic delivery", and a great range of nuance.&lt;ref name="Newman2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Newman|title=Between Paris and Vienna |work=The Life of Richard Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AByTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|date=20 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00771-9|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time she retired from the stage Meyer-Dustmann had also built up a parallel career as a [[Lied|Lieder singer]], with a particular focus on the songs of [[Mendelssohn]] and [[Schubert]].&lt;ref name=LMDlautBLKOe/&gt;   On 5 January 1870, together with Rosa Girzick, [[Gustav Walter]] and Emil Krauss, she gave the first public performance of the [[Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms)|Liebeslieder Walzer]].   The piano duet accompaniment was provided by [[Johannes Brahms|the composer]] and [[Clara Schumann]].&lt;ref name="Clive2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Clive|title=Girzick, Rosa|work=Brahms and His World: A Biographical Dictionary| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CcQAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|date=2 October 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press| isbn=978-1-4617-2280-9| pages=169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1875 she took a teaching position with the conservatory at the city's [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde|Society of Friends of Music]].   Notable pupils included [[Lola Beeth]], [[:de:Hedwig Hübsch|Hedwig Hübsch]] and [[:de:Ida Krzyzanowski-Doxat|Ida Krzyzanowski-Doxat]].   She gave up her teaching role in Vienna in 1880 when, with her husband, she relocated to [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. Here she lived out the rest of her life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54366">The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), a private [[research university]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in the United States, has been referenced by many works of cinema, television and the written word. MIT's overall reputation has greater influence on its role in popular culture than does any particular aspect of its history or student lifestyle. Because MIT is well known as a breeding ground for technology and technologists, the makers of modern media are able to use it to establish character in a way that mainstream audiences can understand. A smaller number of works use MIT directly as their scene of action.

==MIT as metaphor==
The use of "MIT as metaphor" is relatively widespread, so much so that in popular culture, ''"the MIT of"'' is an idiom for "top science and engineering university," or "elite technical institution," like ''"[[Cadillac]] of"'' for "most luxurious," or ''"an [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]"'' for "intelligent person." Similarly, any regionally prominent science or engineering school is likely to be called ''"the MIT of"'' that region. For example, U.S. Senator [[Richard Shelby]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Alabama]]) touted the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] as a possible ''"MIT of the South."''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Kesner, "Could [[University of Alabama in Huntsville|UAH]] become the MIT of the South?" ''Huntsville Times'' 2003-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- in brief, the answer he gets is "not likely" --&gt; The [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] has also been called ''"the MIT of the South"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-01-18/opinions/5 Georgia Tech] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517184957/http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-01-18/opinions/5 |date=May 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples,&lt;ref&gt;See also the proposed "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/311/5765/1227a European MIT].

==Films and television==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Frequently, when a character in Hollywood cinema is required to have a science or engineering background, or in general possess an extremely high level of intelligence, the film establishes that he or she is an MIT graduate or associate. (MIT can also be a comparative or a [[metaphor]] for intellect in general: "Would they think of ''that'' at MIT?"). Numerous films and television series indulge in this technique, including:

In ''Iron Man,'' several close-ups of Terrence Howard clearly show his character ("Jim Rhodes") to be wearing a [[MIT class ring|brass rat]]; Robert Downey, Jr.'s character ("Tony Stark") appears to wear one as well in the movie.

[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]'s television series ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985) employs the same technique for a more academic purpose. In the episode "Point of View," which describes the discovery of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective geometry]] and its ramifications, Burke spends a little time in the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Padua]]. This city, which hosted the second-oldest Italian [[university]] after [[Bologna]], boasted a large concentration of intellectuals. In Burke's phrase, Padua was "the MIT of the fifteenth century." An episode of his later series ''[[Connections 2]]'' (1994) uses a similar shorthand to characterize the seventeenth-century [[Royal Society]].

The television series ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' has several different connections to MIT. The [[pilot episode]] was shot in Boston. Co-creator and Executive Producer Cheryl Heuton says, "We originally tried to choose MIT for the show. We originally set the show in Boston, and Charlie [Eppes, one of the main characters,] was going to be a professor at MIT. We contacted MIT, and their answer was they're not in the film and TV business..."&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Berry, "[http://tech.mit.edu/V126/N40/40Numbers.html TV Interview: ...Numb3rs... Continues to Make Math Chic]," ''The Tech'' 2006-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple episodes of the show mention that Charlie studied at MIT. [[Dylan Bruno]], the actor who plays [[Colby Granger]], has earned a bachelor's degree in [[environmental engineering]] from MIT.

Films set at MIT are less common than those that use the MIT name as metaphor. Nevertheless, MIT has been part of movie settings, in such films as ''[[Blown Away (1994 film)|Blown Away]]'' ([[1994 in film|1994]]), ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' ([[1997 in film|1997]]), ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), ''21'' ([[2008 in film|2008]]),&lt;ref&gt;JiHye Kim, "[http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N21/blackjack.html MIT Alumni Inspire New Movie Hollywood Movie to Depict Blackjack Team's Las Vegas Escapades]," ''The Tech'' 2007-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Photos of the filming of "21" near the MIT campus: [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-0.html bridge 1], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-1.html bridge 2], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-2.html bridge 3], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-3.html bridge 4], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-4.html bridge 5], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N20/graphics/21bridge-5.html bridge 6], [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N13/graphics/blackjack-1.html blackjack7]. and [http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N13/graphics/blackjack-2.html blackjack 8]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Knowing'' (which also features exteriors of the [[Haystack Observatory]]). Most of the scenes for these movies, especially indoor scenes, are in fact filmed elsewhere due to MIT's reluctance to give permission to film on campus. Although portions of ''Blown Away'' were shot on the Institute campus,&lt;ref&gt;Eva Moy, "[http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N31/movie.31n.txt.html Movie Filmed in Killian Court]," ''The Tech'' 1993-08-26&lt;/ref&gt; the film still makes several geographical errors about MIT and Boston in general.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109303/goofs Goofs] for ''[[Blown Away (1994 film)|Blown Away]]'' at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; An incidental scene in ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]) was shot on location outside of MIT Baker House. A scene in ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) was shot in [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Walker Memorial|Walker Memorial]], an MIT cafeteria and gymnasium. The movie setting portrays [[Harvard University]], but Harvard declined to allow the filming on their campus.

Some cinematic references to MIT betray a mild [[anti-intellectualism]], or at least a lack of respect for "book learning". For example, ''Space Cowboys'' features the seasoned hero ([[Clint Eastwood]]) trying to explain a piece of antiquated spacecraft technology to a rather whippersnapping youngster. When the young astronaut fails to comprehend Eastwood's explanation, he snaps that "I have two master's degrees from MIT", to which Eastwood replies, "Maybe you should get your money back". Similarly, [[Gus Van Sant]]'s introduction to the published ''Good Will Hunting'' screenplay suggests that the lead character's animosity towards official MIT [[academia]] reflects a class struggle with ethnic undertones, in particular Will Hunting's Irish background versus the "English aristocracy" of the MIT faculty. ''Help!'', [[The Beatles]]' second film, ties MIT to the [[mad scientist]] [[stereotype]] when Professor Foot ([[Victor Spinetti]]) declares, "MIT was after me, you know. Wanted me to rule the world for them!"

[[HBO]]'s television miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' (1998) contains segments set at MIT, most notably in the episode covering [[Apollo 14]]. The series portrays the Institute's denizens as very slightly eccentric engineers who do their part to keep the [[Apollo program]] running successfully.

"Inside" MIT references also appear in film without attribution. In ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), the opening close-up shot of Grossberger, played by Erland Van Lidth De Jeude (MIT Class of 1976, SB in Computer Science &amp; Engineering), clearly reveals his actual "Brass Rat" class ring. In ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]), a background image of Whassamatta U. is recognizable as a main MIT building.

MIT is referenced in some Japanese anime: the sci-fi series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' mentions MIT as the location of one of the replica [[MAGI]] supercomputers; the comedy series ''[[Pani Poni Dash!]]'' revolves around an 11-year-old student who graduated from MIT and travels to Japan to become a high school teacher. The CIA character "Ed Hoffman" in the film ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' can be seen wearing an MIT shirt in multiple shots.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/media/rm4235891712/ch0028885&lt;/ref&gt;

In the television series ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' (2003), Mike Cannon (played by [[James Lesure]]), one of the main characters, is a highly intelligent, and technically very gifted engineer and MIT graduate.  The character [[Eli Wallace]] in the television series [[Stargate Universe|SGU Stargate Universe]] (2009-2011) is a genius MIT dropout.&lt;ref name=MITLibraries/&gt;

Individual characters in single episodes of television series are often announced as MIT graduates. For example, in the 1992 episode "The Corporate Veil" of the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', both mother and son protagonists are said to be electrical engineering graduates of MIT.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629454/&lt;/ref&gt;  MIT was also mentioned in the pilot episode of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''.

On separate episodes of ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' (2003-2004), [[Ali G]] (played by [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]) interviewed two MIT professors:  [[Jerome Isaac Friedman|Jerome Friedman]], [[List of Institute Professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Institute Professor]] and Professor of Physics Emeritus, and [[Noam Chomsky]], Institute Professor Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Farndale | first=Nigel | date=July 6, 2010 | title=Noam Chomsky Interview | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7865508/Noam-Chomsky-interview.html | access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randal Pinkett]], the winner of [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 4)|season 4 of ''The Apprentice'']], is an MIT alum, with an SM in Electrical Engineering (1998), an MBA from Sloan School of Management (1998), and a PhD in Media Arts &amp; Sciences from the Media Lab (2001).

Two lead characters in the television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' have MIT backgrounds:  Walter Bishop earned a Ph.D. at MIT, and his son Peter Bishop falsified an MIT degree.&lt;ref name=MITLibraries&gt;{{cite web | last=Baildon | first=Michelle | title=MIT in Popular Culture: TV Shows | url=http://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=176093&amp;p=1159191 | publisher=MIT Libraries | location=Cambridge, Mass. | access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the television series ''[[Timeless (TV Series)|Timeless]]'' (2016), a protagonist named Rufus Carlin ([[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]]) often mentions on the show that he is an alumnus of MIT.

==Radio==
[[Tom Magliozzi]] and his younger brother [[Ray Magliozzi|Ray]] were "Click and Clack, The Tappet Brothers", the hosts of [[National Public Radio]]'s comedy car advice show ''[[Car Talk]]''. Both were MIT alumni — Tom earned a degree in chemical engineering (1958), and Ray earned a degree in humanities and general science (1972) —  and they regularly used that fact in their [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] attempts to establish their credibility on technical matters. After campaigning on-air for years, they were finally invited to speak at MIT's 1999 [[graduation|commencement exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Commencement/ |title=1999 commencement exercise |publisher=Cartalk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tom Magliozzi died in 2014, and their radio show had stopped new programming in 2012, past episodes continue to be aired nationally as ''The Best of Car Talk''.

Nonfiction works have examined MIT, its history, and its various subcultures. In addition to books like ''Nightwork,'' which recount the Institute's [[Roof and tunnel hacking|hacking]] tradition, Benson Snyder's ''[[The Hidden Curriculum]]'' (1970) describes the state of MIT student and faculty psychology in the late 1960s.  Noted physicist and raconteur [[Richard Feynman]] built up a collection of anecdotes about his MIT undergraduate years, several of which are retold in his loose memoir ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'' Some of this material was incorporated into [[Matthew Broderick]]'s film ''[[Infinity (film)|Infinity]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), in addition to Feynman stories from [[Rockaway, New York|Far Rockaway]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].

In fiction, the novel ''[[The Gadget Maker]]'' (1955, by Maxwell Griffith) traces the life of aeronautical engineer Stanley Brack, who performs his undergraduate studies at MIT. [[Ben Bova]]'s novel ''The Weathermakers'' (1966) about scientists developing methods to prevent [[hurricane]]s from reaching land, is also set in part at MIT. Patricia Vasquez visits (or comes from) MIT in [[Greg Bear]]'s ''[[Eon (novel)|Eon]]'' (1985). [[Neal Stephenson]] hints at MIT in ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]'' (2004), and other books of ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'', by having Daniel Waterhouse found the "Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of the Technologickal Arts" in the 18th century.

[[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' begins with architecture student Howard Roark being expelled from the fictional "Stanton Institute of Technology". As that institute is depicted as being located in a seashore suburb of Boston, it seems that MIT - specifically, its [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|School of Architecture]] - was meant. 

[[Jhumpa Lahiri]]'s ''[[The Namesake]]'' features a character, Ashoke, who received his PhD in Fiber Optics from MIT.

When the novel ''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'' by [[Lev Grossman]] was first published in 2009, the principal review of the book in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the story's academic location, Brakebills College, as "kind of like the M.I.T. [sic] for magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Agger | first=Michael | date=September 8, 2009 | work=''[[The New York Times]]'' | title=Abracadabra Angst | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/books/review/Agger-t.html | access-date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 [[historical fiction]] novel ''The Technologists'', by [[Matthew Pearl]], is set in the MIT of 1868, during its first decade of  existence. The protagonists are some of the first students to enroll in the fledgling college, and include both fictional composite characters and real-life historical figures, such as [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] and [[Daniel Chester French]]. In response to a high-tech terrorist attack on the City of Boston, the students form a secret research laboratory to discover the perpetrator and to forestall further attacks. They interact closely with prominent historical figures, such as [[William Barton Rogers]] (the founder of MIT), Harvard professor [[Louis Agassiz]] (pioneer of modern [[geology]] and [[paleontology]]), and [[Charles William Eliot]] (then an MIT professor, and soon to become the longest-serving president of Harvard University).  The author spent many hours doing background research in the MIT Archives while writing the novel, and weaves many historical details into his narrative of mystery and adventure.&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Matthew|title=The technologists : a novel|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9781400066575|url=http://www.matthewpearl.com|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=James|title=Science Will Save Us; ‘The Technologists,’ Matthew Pearl’s New Thriller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/books/review/the-technologists-matthew-pearls-new-thriller.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaValle|first=Victor|title=‘The Technologists,’ by Matthew Pearl|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-03-01/entertainment/35449635_1_mit-students-historical-mystery-poe-shadow|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Winstein&gt;{{cite web|last=Winstein|first=Keith J.|title=BOOK REVIEW: Mystery at the Institute; Matthew Pearl’s latest historical thriller explores the early years of MIT|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N6/technologists.html|work=The Tech|publisher=The Tech|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maslin&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Underwater Underdog Fights Ignorance and Harvard; ‘The Technologists,’ by Matthew Pearl, Is Set in 1868|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/books/the-technologists-by-matthew-pearl-is-set-in-1868.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Geeks &amp;amp; Greeks]]'' (2016) is a semi-autobiographical graphic novel by [[Steve Altes]] and [[Andy Fish]], set at MIT.

In Thornton Wilder's play "[[Our Town]]", the Stage Manager mentions the gravestone of Joe Crowell, whom he describes as "awful bright – graduated from high school here, head of his class. So he got a scholarship to Massachusetts Tech. Graduated head of his class there, too. It was all wrote up in the Boston paper at the time. Goin’ to be a great engineer, Joe was. But the war broke out and he died in France. – All that education for nothing."

===Kurt Vonnegut===
MIT is a recurring motif in the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], much like the planet [[Tralfamadore]] or the [[Vietnam War]]. In part, this recurrence may stem from Vonnegut family history: both his grandfather Bernard and his father Kurt, Sr. studied at MIT and received bachelor's degrees in architecture. His older brother, another [[Bernard Vonnegut|Bernard]], earned a bachelor's and a PhD in chemistry, also at MIT. Since so many of Vonnegut's stories are ambivalent or outright pessimistic with regard to technology's impact on humankind, it is hardly surprising that his references to the Institute express a mixed attitude.

In ''[[Hocus Pocus (novel)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1990), the Vietnam-veteran narrator Eugene Debs Hartke applies for graduate study in MIT's physics program, but his plans go awry when he tangles with a hippie at a Harvard Square Chinese restaurant. Hartke observes that men in uniform had become a ridiculous sight around colleges, even though both Harvard and MIT obtained much of their income from weapons [[research and development]]. ("I would have been dead if it weren't for that great gift to civilization from the Chemistry Department of Harvard, which was [[napalm]], or sticky jellied gasoline.") ''[[Jailbird (novel)|Jailbird]]'' notes drily that MIT's eighth president was one of the three-man committee who upheld the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] ruling, condemning the two men to death. As reported in ''The Tech'', June 7, 1927:&lt;ref name="TheTech1927-0607"&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_047/TECH_V047_S0196_P001.txt ''The Tech'' Vol. XLVII No. 47], 1927-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

:President Samuel W. Stratton has recently been appointed a member of a committee that will advise Governor [[Alvan T. Fuller]] in his course of action in the Sacco-Vanzetti case, it was announced a few days ago by the metropolitan press. The President is one of a committee of three appointed, the others being President [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell|A. Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard and Judge Robert Grant. It was stated at Dr. Stratton's office that this appointment was very reluctantly accepted, for not only has the President not had experience with criminal law procedure, but he has not been following the case at all in the newspapers. It is thought by some that this very fact may result in an entirely unbiased review of the case, which might not be possible had he followed the case closely.&lt;ref name="TheTech1927-0607"/&gt;

''[[Palm Sunday (book)|Palm Sunday]]'' (1981), a loose collage of essays and other material, contains a markedly [[skepticism|skeptical]] and [[humanism|humanist]] commencement address Vonnegut gave to [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in [[Geneva, New York]]. Speaking of the role religion plays in modern society, Vonnegut notes:

:We no longer believe that [[God]] causes earthquakes and crop failures and plagues when He gets mad at us. We no longer imagine that He can be cooled off by sacrifices and festivals and gifts. I am so glad we don't have to think up presents for Him anymore. What's the perfect gift for someone who has everything?

:The perfect gift for somebody who has everything, of course, is nothing. Any gifts we have should be given to creatures right on the surface of the planet, it seems to me. If God gets angry about that, we can call in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There's a very good chance they can calm Him down.

===Isaac Asimov===
Kurt Vonnegut was friends with fellow humanist and writer [[Isaac Asimov]], who resided for many years in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. During much of this time, Asimov chose the date for the [[MIT Science Fiction Society]]'s annual picnic, citing a superstition that he always picked a day with good weather. In his copious autobiographical writings, Asimov reveals a mild predilection for the Institute's architecture, and an awareness of its aesthetic possibilities. For example, ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'' (1980) describes a 1957 meeting with Catherine de Camp, who was checking out colleges for her teenage son. Asimov recalls:

:I hadn't seen her for five years and she was forty-nine now, and I felt I would be distressed at seeing her beauty fade.

:How wrong I was! I saw her coming down the [[Infinite Corridor|long corridor]] at MIT and she looked almost as though it were still 1941, when I had first met her.

Asimov's work, too, trades on MIT's reputation for narrative effect, even touching upon an anti-academic theme. In the short story "[[The Dead Past]]" (1956), the scientist-hero Foster must overcome the attitudes his Institute physics training has entrenched in his mind, before he can make his critical breakthrough. Several jokes in ''Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor'' and its sequel ''Asimov Laughs Again'' hinge upon MIT, its reputation for scientific prowess, and the technocentric focus of its students. In a similar vein, the [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article entitled "Corpse-Reanimation Technology Still 10 Years Off, Say MIT Mad Scientists," among many others in the same general tradition.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theonion.com/content/node/38877 Corpse-Reanimation Technology Still 10 Years Off, Say MIT Mad Scientists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223091257/http://www.theonion.com/content/node/38877 |date=2010-02-23 }}," ''[[The Onion]]'' (2001-01-17).

===Joe Haldeman===
Since 1983, science fiction writer [[Joe Haldeman]] has been an Adjunct Professor teaching writing at MIT,&lt;ref name=WHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty|url=http://writing.mit.edu/people/faculty|work=Writing and Humanistic Studies|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JHweb&gt;{{cite web|last=Haldeman|first=Joe|title=[homepage]|url=http://www.joehaldeman.com|work=Joe Haldeman [website]|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knows the institution well. This is very evident in ''[[The Accidental Time Machine]]'' where MIT at various past and future times in its history plays a central role. The institution is described with considerable affection and much "insider" knowledge of the hidden corners in the MIT campus (as well as conspicuous parts of its geography such as the [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] and the [[Infinite Corridor]]), of the relations between students and lecturers, and of various wild and rather illicit student practices.

The book begins with MIT student Matt Fuller accidentally discovering the time machine of the title. He jumps a decade forward to find that his professor has taken credit for his discovery and gotten a [[Nobel Prize]] for it; jumps centuries ahead and finds a [[theocracy]] where MIT is the Massachusetts Institute of ''Theology''; and after more adventures winds up in the past, in the late 19th century when MIT was still in its [[History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#BostonTech|original location]] on [[Boylston Street]]. In all time periods, under vastly differing circumstances, the protagonist becomes an MIT full professor.

==Comic strips==
Several [[comic strip]]s make use of MIT. In ''[[Doonesbury]],'' Kim Rosenthal almost earned her PhD in [[computer science]], dropping out because it was "too easy." In the fall of 2006, Kim and Mike Doonesbury's daughter Alex entered MIT as a freshman. (The 3 October 2006 ''Doonesbury'' strip satirizes the "MIT of" [[snowclone]]; Zipper Harris declares the fictional Walden College to be "the MIT of southern [[Connecticut]].") [[Dilbert]] received a degree from [[electrical engineering|Course VI-1]]. [[Bill Amend]]'s ''[[FoxTrot]]'' has also made MIT allusions, in keeping with the strip's genial satire of [[nerd]] subcultures. On Christmas Day 2005, the comic strip ''[[Baby Blues]]'' featured a character reading the instruction manual accompanying a gadget that he has given to his child as a Christmas present. The first volume of instructions begins, "''Assembly Instructions'' &amp;mdash; ''Step 1:'' Obtain a master's degree in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. ''Step 2:'' ..."

==Computer and video games==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Some genres of computer and video games have characterization requirements like those of movies. For example, a game involving a team of commandos might require a member who can break into computers, crack security systems, or work with explosives. This character's background would typically have to be established very quickly and efficiently, perhaps within one screen of introductory text. Stating that a commando or top-secret operative "graduated from MIT" is one way to accomplish this.

MIT is mentioned in the computer games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' (1995), ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998), ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' (2005), ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998), and in the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series (1997–2015).

In the case of the ''Half-Life'' series, the main protagonist, [[Gordon Freeman]], is an MIT graduate and has a PhD in Theoretical Physics.

The [[Infocom]] game ''[[The Lurking Horror]]'' (1987), written by MIT alumnus and [[interactive fiction]] pioneer [[Dave Lebling]], is set on the campus of the George Underwood Edwards Institute of Technology, which strongly resembles MIT. Its fictional culture also parodies the MIT culture. For instance, G.U.E. Tech's [[class ring]] is known as the "brass [[hyrax]]", parodying MIT's [[Brass Rat]].

In the ''Fallout'' games, MIT is known as the "Commonwealth Institute of Technology." As nuclear war began, researchers from the university hid below the main building and continued with their research without making contact with other survivors. Eventually after many years, they took on the title of simply "The Institute," and became well known as a shady organization with extraordinary technology and the ability to create androids. The Institute is featured as a major faction in the 2015 title, ''[[Fallout 4]]''.
In [[Fallout: New Vegas]], one of the main characters in the story is Edwin Robert House, also called Mr. House is a graduate of The Institute, as stated in his obituary.

==Music==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
In the Broadway musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996–2008), a major character, Tom Collins, is expelled from teaching at MIT, "for [his] theory of actual reality."

The song "Etoh" by the [[electronic music]] group [[The Avalanches]] describes MIT as "the home of complicated computers, which speak a mechanical language all their own." This lyric can be taken literally, or it can be read metaphorically as a description of MIT student culture. [[Allan Sherman]]'s paean to initialisms, "[[Harvey and Sheila]]," notes that Harvey "works for IBM; he went to MIT, got his PhD."&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Kantor | first2=Laurence | last2=Maslon | date=December 2, 2008 | title=Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America | page=121 | publisher=Twelve ([[Hachette Book Group]]) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&amp;pg=PT121 | isbn=0446505315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhythm and blues]] group [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]] mentions MIT in the song "[[Born Not To Know]]," from their 1988 debut album ''Who?'' In the song, a pretentious individual rattles off a long list of his impressive academic credentials&amp;mdash;culminating with a "Ph. D from MIT"&amp;mdash;only to then ask, "so, can I get a job?" Tony! Toni! Toné! responds with a resounding "No!"

"[[Nerdcore]]" rap artist [[MC Hawking]]'s song "All My Shootin's Be Drive-bys" (1997) takes tropes associated with [[gangsta rap]] and plays them out in a more academic setting. He speaks of taking revenge for the death of a friend, part of his [[Cambridge]], UK crew:

:I saw Little Pookie just the other day.
:Pookie was my boy we shared [[Kool-Aid]] in the park,
:now some punks took his life in the dark.

:I ask Doomsday who the [[motherfucker]]s be,
:"some punk ass bitches from MIT."

When the narrator learns the identity of Pookie's killers, he decides to "give a [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] demonstration, of a bullet its [[mass]] and its [[acceleration]]," leaving six MIT students dead in the street.&lt;ref&gt;[[MC Hawking]] [http://www.mchawking.com/multimedia.php?page_function=mp3z MP3 and lyrics page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]" (2006) riffs upon MIT, along with a plenitude of other [[geek culture]] references &amp;mdash; ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]],'' [[pocket protector]]s and editing [[Wikipedia]], to name a few. Yankovic claims that he graduated "first in [his] class here at MIT"; however, the Institute does not assign class rankings or confer traditional Latin honors upon its graduates.

The students and faculty of MIT have produced their own share of musical material. For example, the mathematician and satirist [[Tom Lehrer]] taught for a time in MIT's [[political science]] department, lecturing on quantitative methods and [[statistics]]. This experience led him to write a song called "Sociology," played to the tune of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "Choreography." The lyrics conclude,

:They consult, sounding occult,
:Talking like a mathematics [[Ph.D.]]
:They can snow all their clients,
:By calling it "science"&amp;mdash;
:Although it's only [[sociology]]!&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Tom Lehrer]] performing five math-related songs for [[Irving Kaplansky]]'s birthday celebration, [https://archive.org/details/lehrer available] via the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have also written their own songs during their tenures at the Institute. This tradition, &lt;!-- isn't there a song about that? --&gt; which goes back at least to The Doormat Singers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpbsmith.com/doormat/ The Doormat Singers].&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1960s, continues with several present-day groups.

'''National Translation Mission''' ([[Hindi]]: राष्ट्रीय अनुवाद मिशन; [[IAST]]: ''Rāṣṭrīya Anuvāda Miśana'') is a [[Government of India]] initiative to make knowledge texts accessible, in all [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] listed in the [[Languages with official status in India|VIII schedule of the Constitution]], through [[translation]]. NTM was set up on the recommendation of the [[National Knowledge Commission| National Knowledge Commission]]. The [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] has designated Central Institute of Indian Languages as the nodal organization for the operationalization of NTM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntm.org.in&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[English language|English]], the primary medium of higher education in India, remains inaccessible to even the literate majority of the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need to translate material in all fields like literary, technical, scientific and business etc. so that such material is accessible to a wide range of different language speaking population across the country. Translation, thus, is seen not just as an instrument of democratizing and secularizing knowledge, but also of empowering languages and speech communities.

NTM intends to establish translation as an industry in the country. Its main objectives include generation of translation tools such as [[dictionaries]] and [[thesaurus|thesauri]]; development of software for translation, memory, etc.; promotion of [[machine translation]] and machine aided translation; translator education through orientation programs &amp; courses; fellowships &amp; grants for research projects, etc. Bringing visibility to translators and translation activities by organizing book launches for translations; instituting prizes and fellowships; organizing Regional Festivals of Translation; book exhibitions, etc. also are part of the activities of NTM.

Project Advisory Committee (NTM-PAC) of NTM is the highest decision making body of NTM. It is a committee of 25 members representing various sections of the academic community, ministerial bodies and publishing houses related to translation. NTM-PAC is supported by four sub-committees in matters related to [[copyrights]] and legal matters; selecting knowledge texts; fixing rates for translators, copy editors etc.; and Grant in Aid schemes of NTM.

==NTM Website in 23 languages==

NTM is in the process of establishing itself as the clearing house of all translation related activities in the country. Interaction with the public is a requisite and NTM has developed its website (www.ntm.org.in) in 23 languages for the purpose. NTM website introduces the Mission, its objectives, beneficiaries, and structure etc. Updates on list of books selected for translation, experts consulted, announcement of translation assignments etc. are available for the public here. The Discussion Forum facilitates the users to discuss various topics like the books selected for translation in a subject, an existing translation, and terminology issues in Indian languages etc.''''

==Translation &amp; Publication of Pedagogic Material==

105 titles have been approved for translations in 21 disciplines (Botany, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, History, Law, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Medical Science, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology and Zoology) so far.

To know more about the books taken up for translation, visit - www.ntm.org.in

==NTM Databases==

NTM also maintains National Register of Translators(NRT) through its website. NRT is a databank wherein [[translators]] register themselves online. NRT is a searchable directory of translators, evaluators and discipline experts with classified information on profession, experience, languages known and expertise in translation, etc.

Lists of the most prescribed texts in Indian universities in various disciplines are generated out of the Knowledge Text Module, another major facet of NTM-databases. Two searchable database components have been created under it: Indian Universities Database and Knowledge Text Database. Indian Universities Database furnishes information on courses, syllabi and textbooks etc. of over 350 Union Grants Commission (UGC) accredited universities and institutions. Knowledge Text [[Database]] provides complete details of the prescribed books. When made public, this would become one of the first [[Sovereign state|state]] initiatives to provide information about all the universities/institutions and courses which can be accessed through a single window. It would help scholars and academicians from various regions to access the latest information on courses and syllabi of any university/institution of the country. [[University]] Boards can review the course details and syllabi structure of other universities before revising their curriculum. This may help in creating parity among universities of rural and urban regions.

NTM-databases, created in [[Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL 2005]], can contain a maximum of 2^31 objects and span multiple Operating System-level files with a maximum file size of 220 [[Terabyte]]. Control mechanisms have been incorporated to the database for concurrent access to shared data, for ensuring data integrity. NTM aims to increase the usability of the databases by making them both as web and standalone applications.

==Translation Tools==

===Basic Bilingual Dictionaries===

The [[bilingual]] dictionaries are modelled after the hugely popular Longman Corpus Network - based Basic English-English dictionary. Six bilingual dictionaries developed by the NTM in collaboration Pearson Education, India were launched on 10 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://overseasindian.in/2012/mar/news/20121203-133959.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictionaries are the first publications from the NTM stable. In fact, the project had begun before the coming of NTM. Dorling Kindersley India Pvt Ltd (publishing as Pearson Education) and the [[Central Institute of Indian Languages]] (CIIL) had agreed to develop bilingual dictionaries in 11 languages. The work started in 2006. Later when NTM was launched in the year 2008, the lexical build activities were merged with NTM. The dictionaries are modeled on the British National Corpus based hugely popular Longman Basic English Dictionary. Following are the dictionaries that were launched:(listed alphabetically)

* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Bangla Dictionary
* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Hindi Dictionary
* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Kannada Dictionary
* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Malayalam Dictionary
* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Oriya Dictionary
* Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Tamil Dictionary

The dictionaries can be bought from popular online retailers like www.flipkart.com, www.homeshop18.com, www.pearson.vrvbookshop.com etc. or book sellers across the country.

Work is under progress in other Indian languages - [[Assamese language|Assamese]], Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Meitei language|Meitei]], Marathi, [[Nepali language|Nepali]], Punjabi, [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], Telugu, and [[Urdu]].

===Bilingual e-dictionaries===

e-dictionaries of NTM are based on ‘Longman Advanced Bilingual Framework’(LABF). LABF Dataset will be used through the Dictionary Production System(DPS), originally developed by Longman and marketed by Ingenierie Diffusion Multimedia(IDM), France. The NTM-Longman e-dictionary deals with 338,000 words, phrases and meanings; 78,000 head entries, 5,400 encyclopaedic entries, 54,000 phrases, over 515,000 examples and 26,000 synonyms, antonyms and related words.

===Machine Translation===

An English-Kannada Machine Translation(MT) package which bids to break new ground on the MT scene in India is being developed under NTM. The main aim of this project is to automate the translation of a given English sentence into Kannada. This Package is divided into 3 main modules– Parallel Aligned Corpora, Digitization of Source Language(SL) resources and Architecture. The Architecture is divided into 8 modules and implemented using Java with Netbeans Integrated Development Environment(IDE). The front end is designed using Swings and back-end SQL. The dictionary is put into action using random access file. Since Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance, this technique is used to accomplish searching. Collection classes are used as data storage structures.
NTM has been interacting with several teams (like C-DAC, Pune, Noida, Mumbai; LTRC, ILMT, EILMT, Anusaaraka, Shakti—all at IIIT, Hyderabad) engaged in developing Machine Translation software to explore the extent to which the MT research and NTM can interface for mutual benefit.

===Dictionary of Translation Studies===

Dictionary of Translation Studies being prepared by NTM intends to serve as a companion to students and scholars interested in and associated with the discipline of Translation Studies. It is a compilation of the technically charged terms used in the discipline. It endeavours to be a comprehensive dictionary, exhausting the technical terms used in Indian as well as western discourse of translation and also the terms used in the sub-domains of Translation Studies like Interpreting, Machine Translation, etc.

==Training and Certification of Translators==

With an aim to train and orient translators, NTM has been organising 3 weeks Intensive Training Programme – ‘Introduction to Translation’. Translation theoreticians &amp; academicians, eminent translators, linguists and language scholars from across the country have been delivering talks on various theoretical and practical aspects of translation. All the details are available in [http://www.ntm.org.in NTM website]

NTM has also started piloting the methods and means of its nationwide Certification of Translators Programme. The certification module is being developed in collaboration with the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) of the Quality Council of India (QCI) along the lines of the international standards set for Personnel Certification. Training of evaluators will be a major component of the Certification of Translators Programme as a new system of grading translators will be introduced.

==NTM Surveys==

&lt;big&gt;Knowledge Text Scenario Survey&lt;/big&gt;

NTM conducted a survey with the following objectives:
* To find out the availability of original and translated knowledge texts
* To find whether the books suggested by discipline experts are already available in the regional languages or not, so as to avoid duplicity.
* To find out whether original books written in regional languages are prescribed in the syllabi or not
* To analyze the general publication scenario in regional languages, in order to formulate strategies for productive interventions by NTM
* To assess the need and demand of translation of knowledge texts in regional languages

17 languages are covered in the survey and they are Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Maithili, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. All the finding of the survey are compiled in a report titled ''Regional Language Knowledge Text Scenario – An Assessment''.

&lt;big&gt;Royalty: Industry Practice across India&lt;/big&gt;

NTM conducted a nationwide survey so as to find out the prevalent practice among some of the major as well as regional publishers towards the payment of royalty to authors/copyright holders, translators etc.  In all, NTM has gathered information from over 100 publishers, which is essential in framing NTM-policies, especially in case of turnkey projects. A detailed report titled ''Royalty: Industry Practice Across India'' has been prepared.

&lt;big&gt;Royalty: Lexicography in India&lt;/big&gt;

NTM conducted a survey to study the past and present scenario of lexicographic activities in 16 Indian Languages. The languages are - Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Sanskrit, Santhali, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. A detailed report titled Lexicography in Indian Languages: a brief report has been prepared explaining the finding.

&lt;big&gt;Medium of Instruction &amp; Medium of Examination (MoI &amp; MoE) in Higher Education in India&lt;/big&gt;

NTM has collected data from 239 Universities/Colleges etc., then categorized, analyzed and a detailed report has been prepared and compared with survey report prepared by UPSC. Data provided by UGC on MoI/MoE are also categorized, analyzed and prepared a report.

==Workshops and Seminars==

NTM has organised workshops in regional languages in different parts of the country involving discipline experts and translators to chalk out strategies for NTM translation assignments. A few seminal knowledge texts formed the focus of discussions in these workshops. NTM has been conducting workshops to assess the existing knowledge text translations in regional languages. These assessment workshops also aim to bring about collaboration between NTM and eminent scholars, writers, translators and publishers in different fields which will help in forming expert panels for its translations. NTM has also been organizing seminars on various aspects of translation with special reference to regional languages in different parts of the country. Apart from these, Translator Orientation Programmes; Publishers, Media and Translators Meet; Book Festivals; Workshops on Literary and Linguistic Terms; programmes on Classical Text and Literary Text Translation have been organized across the country by NTM. These workshops help NTM to popularize its initiatives among beneficiaries.

'''Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University''' ('''PNU'''; {{lang-ar|جامعة الأميرة نورة بنت عبد الرحمن}})
is a public women’s [[university]] located in [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is the largest [[women's university]] in the world and the largest one in Saudi Arabia.

Designed by [[Perkins and Will|Perkins &amp; Wills Architects]], part of Dar Group, it has innovative design and technology, all while keeping in mind the complex characteristics of the Saudi culture.

The university offers [[diploma]]s, [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[postgraduate degree]]s. It has over 60,000 [[students]] in 34 colleges in the city of Riyadh and in the neighbouring cities, a preparatory year program for all first year undergraduate students, an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Language [[Institute]] (for non-speakers of Arabic), a Deanship of Community Service and Continuous Education, and a Community College. It has more than 5,000 academic and administrative staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article410814.ece "Self-learning projects by PNU students on display"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527041651/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article410814.ece |date=27 May 2011 }} ''Arab News,'' 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Name ==

The university was founded in 1970 as the first College of Education for women in the Kingdom. Within the following 25 years, there were 102 similar colleges in 72 cities around the country, accommodating 60,000 students. There were 6 colleges in the city of [[Riyadh]] alone, primarily in the fields of [[education]], [[social service]], [[science]], [[arts]], and [[home economics]]. In 2004, the decision was made to unify all of the women's colleges in Riyadh, thus creating the first all-female university in the Kingdom. Other colleges around the Kingdom were unified and expanded in their respected regions into independent universities.

In 2008, the [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]], [[King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] inaugurated the campus and changed the university’s name to “Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University” after [[Noura bint Abdul Rahman Al Saud|Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman]], the sister of the country’s first king and leader, [[King Abdulaziz]].&lt;ref name=Rasheed2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Madawi Al-Rasheed|title=A Most Masculine State: Gender, Politics and Religion in Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmafWmVNJAAC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=30 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76104-8|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sgaz08/&gt; ''Nourah'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] means "light."&lt;ref name=sgaz08&gt;{{cite news|last=Al Ghamdi|first=Mohamed|title=Light dawns on girls’ education|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2008103020589|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=Saudi Gazette|date=30 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526155927/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2008103020589|archivedate=26 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this launch was the building of the world's largest and most modern women's institution of higher education in a self-contained higher education city.

On 12 June 2011, the new [[campus]] was opened in an official ceremony by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, during which he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Women carry a responsibility that is more than a duty, to maintain the stability of society and contribute to building the economy of the nation, and to represent the community and the nation to the highest standards, outside and inside the country. To be the caring mother, exemplary citizen and productive employee. Outside the nation, to be the ambassador of her country and community, and to represent well her religion, faith and our values."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2017, the University was the host of the first-ever opera in Saudi Arabia. The show, "Antar and Alba", was produced by Opera Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdnonline.com/Details/319182/First-opera-in-Saudi-Arabia-held-at-Riyadh-university|title=First opera in Saudi Arabia held at Riyadh university|website=Gdnonline.com|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Myoelectric Control of Ankle Exoskeleton.JPG|thumb|right|Depiction of myoelectric control of an ankle exoskeleton]]

'''Proportional [[electromyography|myoelectric]] control''' can be used to (among other purposes) activate robotic lower limb [[exoskeleton]]s. A proportional myoelectric control system utilizes a [[microcontroller]] or computer that inputs [[electromyography]] (EMG) signals from sensors on the leg muscle(s) and then activates the corresponding joint [[actuator]](s) proportionally to the EMG signal.

== Background ==

A robotic exoskeleton is a type of [[orthosis]] that uses [[actuators]] to either assist or resist the movement of a joint of an intact limb; this is not to be confused with a powered [[prosthesis]], which replaces a missing limb.  There are four purposes that robotic lower limb exoskeletons can accomplish:&lt;ref name="FerrisandLewis"&gt; Ferris, D.P. and Lewis, C.L.: “Robotic Lower Limb Exoskeletons Using Proportional Myoelectric Control”, ''31st Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS'', pp 2119–2124, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enhancement of human performance, which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance (see [[Powered exoskeleton]]s)
* Long-term assistance, which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by themselves while wearing an exoskeleton
* Study of human locomotion, which utilizes robotic exoskeletons to better understand human neuromuscular control, energetics, and/or kinematics of [[Walking|locomotion]]
* Post-injury rehabilitation, which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury (such as a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disabilities) by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform better later without the use of the exoskeleton

Robotic lower-limb exoskeletons can be controlled by several methods, including a footswitch (a pressure sensor attached to the bottom of the foot), gait-phase estimation (using joint angles to determine the current phase of walking), and myoelectric control (using [[electromyography]]).&lt;ref name="FerrisandLewis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, J, Jang, I, Riener, R and Park, H:"Walking Intent Detection Algorithm for Paraplegic Patients Using a Robotic Exoskeleton Walking Assistant with Crutches", ''International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems'', 10(5), pp 954–962, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This article focuses on myoelectric control.

== Control methods ==

Sensors on the skin detect [[electromyography]] (EMG) signals from the muscles of the wearer's leg(s).  EMG signals can be measured from just one muscle or many, depending on the type of the exoskeleton and how many joints are actuated.  Each signal measured is then sent to a controller, which is either an onboard [[microcontroller]] (mounted to the exoskeleton) or to a nearby computer.  Onboard microcontrollers are used for long-term assistive devices since the wearer must be able to walk in different locations while wearing the exoskeleton, whereas computers not carried by the exoskeleton can be used for therapeutic or research purposes since the wearer does not have to walk very far in a clinical or lab environment.  

The controller filters out [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] from the EMG signals and then [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizes]] them so as to better analyze the muscle activation pattern.  The normalized EMG value of a muscle represents its activation percentage, since the EMG signal is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible EMG reading for the muscle it came from.  The maximum EMG reading is generated when a muscle is fully contracted.  An alternative method to normalization is to proportionally match the actuator power to the EMG signal between a minimum activation threshold and an upper [[Saturation arithmetic|saturation]] level.

=== Direct proportional myoelectric control ===

With a proportional myoelectric controller, the power sent to an actuator is proportional to the amplitude of the normalized EMG signal from a muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, D.P, Czerniecki, J.M. and Hannaford, B.: "An ankle-foot orthosis powered by artificial pneumatic muscles", '’Journal of Applied Biomechanics'’, 21,pp 189–97, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; When the muscle is inactive, the actuator receives no power from the controller, and when the muscle is fully contracted, the actuator produces maximum torque about the joint it controls.  For example, an powered ankle-foot orthosis ([[Orthotics#Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO)|AFO]]) could employ a pneumatic [[artificial muscle]] to provide [[plantar flexion]] torque proportional to the activation level of the [[soleus]] (one of the calf muscles).  This control method enables the exoskeleton to be controlled by the same neural pathways as the wearer's biological muscles and has been shown to allow individuals to walk with a more normal gait than other control methods, such as using a footswitch.&lt;ref name="Cain et al"&gt;Cain, S.M., Gordon, K.E. and Ferris, D.P.: "Locomotor adaptation to a powered ankle-foot orthosis depends on control method", ''Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation'', 4, pp 48, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over other control methods, such as: 
* Its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeleton&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, D.P, Sawicki, G.S. and Daley, M.A.: "A physiologist's perspective on robotic exoskeletons for human locomotion", ''International Journal of Humanoid Robotics'', 4, pp 507–28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* It results in reduced biological muscle recruitment versus [[kinematic]] based control methods&lt;ref name="Cain et al" /&gt; 
* It allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control for new motor tasks&lt;ref name="KAFO"&gt;Sawicki, G.S. and Ferris, D.P.: "A pneumatically powered knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) with myoelectric activation and inhibition", ''Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation'', p. in press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
However, proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to other control methods, including:
* The surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in obtaining a reliable EMG signal&lt;ref&gt;Parker, P, Englehart, K and Hudgins, B: "Myoelectric signal processing for control of powered limb prostheses", ''J Electromyogr Kinesiol.'', 16(6), pp 541–48, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* The system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds and gains&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, K.E. and Ferris, D.P.: "Learning to walk with a robotic ankle exoskeleton", ''Journal of Biomechanics, 40, pp 2636–44, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[musculoskeletal system]] has many [[Motor control#Synergies|synergistic muscles]] that are not easily accessible via surface EMG electrodes&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaird, C.R. and Ferris, D.P.: "Medial Gastrocnemius Myoelectric Control of a Robotic Ankle Exoskeleton", ''IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng.'', 17(1), pp 31–37, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control, some individuals may not have sufficient neural control to allow them to use an exoskeleton with myoelectric control

=== Proportional myoelectric control with flexor inhibition ===

Direct proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direction (uni-directional actuation), such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee, but is less effective when two joint actuators work in opposition (bi-directional actuation).  An example of this would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for [[dorsiflexion]] based on [[tibialis anterior]] (shin muscle) EMG and another pneumatic artificial muscle for [[plantar flexion]] based on [[soleus]] (calf muscle) EMG.  This could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuators and make walking more difficult.&lt;ref name = "Ferris Gait and Posture"&gt;Ferris, D.P., Gordon, K.E., Sawicki, G.S. and Peethambaran, A.: "An improved powered ankle-foot orthosis using proportional myoelectric control", ''Gait and Posture'', 23, pp 425–428, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To correct for this unwanted co-activation, a rule can be added to the control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus EMG is above a set threshold.  Proportional control with flexor inhibition allows for a more natural gait than with direct proportional control; flexor inhibition also allows subjects to walk much more easily with combined knee and ankle exoskeletons with bi-directional actuators at each joint.&lt;ref name="KAFO" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Performance enhancement ===

Performance enhancement deals with increasing typical human capabilities, such as strength or endurance.  Many full-body robotic exoskeletons currently in development use controllers based on joint torques and angles instead of electromyography.  See [[Powered exoskeleton]]s.

=== Long-term assistance ===

One application of a robot lower limb exoskeleton is to assist in the movement of a disabled individual in order to walk.  Individuals with spinal cord injury, weakened leg muscles, poor [[neuromuscular]] control, or who have suffered a stroke could benefit from wearing such a device. The exoskeleton provides [[torque]] about a joint in the same direction that EMG data indicate the joint is rotating.  For example, high EMG signals in the [[vastus medialis]] (a quadriceps muscle) and low EMG signals in the [[biceps femoris]] (a hamstring muscle) would indicate that the user is extending his/her leg, therefore the exoskeleton would provide torque on the knee to help straighten the leg.

=== Study of human locomotion ===

Proportional myoelectric control and robotic exoskeletons have been used in upper limb devices for decades, but engineers have only recently begun using them for lower-limb devices to better understand human [[biomechanics]] and neural control of locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R.N.: "Myoelectric control of prostheses", ''Archives of Physical medicine and Rehabilitation'', 47, pp 174–81, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinkensmeyer, D.J., Emken, J.L. and Cramer, S.C.: "Robotics, motor learning, and neurologic recovery", ''Annu Rev Biomed Eng'', 6, pp 497–525, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By using an exoskeleton with a proportional myoelectric controller, scientists can use a non-invasive means of studying the [[neural plasticity]] associated with modifying a muscle's force (biological +/- artificial force), as well as how motor memories for locomotor control are formed.&lt;ref name="Ferris Gait and Posture" /&gt;

=== Rehabilitation ===

Robotic lower limb exoskeletons have the potential to help an individual recover from an injury such as a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disabilities.  Neurological motor disorders often result in reduced volitional muscle activation amplitude, impaired [[proprioception]], and disordered muscle coordination; a robotic exoskeleton with proportional myoelectric control can improve all three of these by amplifying the relationship between muscle activation and proprioceptive feedback.  By increasing the consequences of muscle activation, an exoskeleton can improve sensory feedback in a physiological way, which in turn can improve motor control&lt;ref name="FerrisandLewis" /&gt; Individuals with spinal cord injury or who have had a stroke can improve their motor capabilities through intense gait rehabilitation,&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, V, Wirz, M, Colombo, G and Curt, A: "Locomotor capacity and recovery of spinal cord function in paraplegic patients: a clinical and electrophysiological evaluation", ''Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol'', 109, pg 140–53, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Behrman, A.L. and Harkema S.J.: "Locomotor training after human spinal cord injury: a series of case studies", ''Phys Ther'', 80, pp 688–700, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Robotic lower limb exoskeletons could help in both of these areas.

== Physiological response ==

The [[neuromuscular]] system has targeted joint [[torques]] it tries to generate while walking.  Assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move one or more leg joints while walking, which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torque in those joints and use less metabolic energy.  The muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the net torque about each joint approximately the same as when walking without an exoskeleton.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.L. and Ferris, D.P.: "Invariant hip moment pattern while walking with a robotic hip exoskeleton", ''Journal of Biomechanics'', 44, pp 789–93, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actuator torque.  Disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease, if any, in muscular torque while walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait, or at all; the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk.

'''S³ Asia MBA''' (also written as '''S3 Asia MBA''' or simply '''Asia MBA''') is a selective dual degree, tri-city, tri-university global MBA program. Students enrolled in this program study one semester each at three business schools - School of Management of [[Fudan University]], [[Korea University Business School]] of [[Korea University]] and [[NUS Business School]] of [[National University of Singapore]]. The name of the program, '''S³''', is derived from the first letter of the three cities where the business schools are located: [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]] and [[Singapore]]. It is claimed that presently, the program is the only one of its type in the world.

==Background==
[[File:Participating business schools in S3 Asia MBA.png|thumb|S³ Asia MBA - partner business schools]]
The program was formally launched on the 28 February, 2008 at Korea University Business School. However, the idea had originally germinated when officials from the three universities met at a centennial celebration of the three universities. The tri-university colloquium between Fudan, KU and NUS first began in 2005. The universities founded the S³ University Alliance (S³UA) and sealed it with the Seoul Declaration for Collaboration at the Tri-University Colloquium in Seoul on 19 May, 2006.

==Overview==
The program consists of three semesters conducted across three leading Asian business schools: School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Korea University Business School, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; and NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore. The three business schools are, respectively, #89, #86 and #36 on the 2013 list of world's top 100 business schools by the Financial Times.

===Fudan University (1st Semester - September to December)===
The program starts at School of Management, Fudan University (Shanghai) with a mandatory three-day orientation program. The orientation is a collaborative exercise which teaches team spirit, knowledge sharing, strategic decision making and cultural values to the participants. Upon the completion of the orientation program, students are awarded a certificate.

The first semester curriculum is articulate and provides an understanding of the major management sciences subjects.

'''First semester courses (listed alphabetically):''' Asian Business Insights I (Field Trip); Basic Chinese (non-credit, optional); Business in China; Data, Models, and Decisions (DMD); Financial Accounting (FA); Managerial Communication (MC); Managerial Economics (ME); Organizational Behavior (OB); Politics (mandatory for Chinese nationals). In addition, there is an optional, certificate course on banking named "Citi-Fudan University Banking Course", delivered by senior executives of Citi.

The Business in China course is divided into four equal parts, with each part delivered by a different professor. Each part focuses on a different dimension of doing business inside China.

====Accommodation====
Foreign students may get a room booked in Fudan's International Student Dormitory or in the Tonghe International Student Village, which is a private dormitory with hotel-like services. A majority of foreign students prefer staying at Tonghe.

===Korea University (2nd Semester - February to June)===
The second semester starts during peak winter at Seoul. After the initial registration and an orientation trip, students are given a break of about a week to explore the city and to settle down.

This semester is divided into two modules (sub-semesters) with Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip) sandwiched between the two modules. The primary teaching method used during this semester for all courses is the '''[[case method]]'''. In addition to the regular classes, there are some special guest lectures held jointly with the Global MBA class of KUBS.

'''Second semester courses (listed alphabetically):''' Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip); Basic Korean or Business English (non-credit, optional); Business Ethics in Asian Companies; Business in Korea and Japan; Corporate Finance; Management Information Systems (MIS); Managerial Accounting; Marketing Management; Operations and Process Management (OPM).

===National University of Singapore (3rd Semester - August to December)===
The third semester at NUS Business School starts with several activities - a multi-day Orientation and a two-day team-building session at [[Outward Bound Singapore]], as well as the NUS Orientation Graduation Dinner. In this semester students are able to select elective courses, allowing them to specialize (although both degrees given under S³ Asia MBA are General Management degrees).

In addition to the core courses, students can typically choose three electives (although it is also possible to choose four electives). It is at NUS Business School that the S³ Asia MBA class mingles with the NUS MBA cohort, exchange students from foreign schools, and also the part-time MBA students. In addition, students can also take up cross-faculty courses, allowing them to, for example, work with engineering students.

'''Third semester courses (listed alphabetically):''' Advanced Business English (mandatory for Fudan students and optional for KU/NUS students); Asia Pacific Business; Asian Business Insights III (Field Trip); Corporate Strategy; Elective 1; Elective 2; Elective 3 (it is possible to choose four electives by taking up two half-modules).

==Double Degree and a Certificate==
[[File:Map showing schools and cities for S3 Asia MBA.jpg|thumb|Map of cities and schools in S³ Asia MBA]]
Upon the successful completion of the program, students are awarded two MBA degrees: a degree from a student's "home university" and a degree from a second university of choice. Candidates are awarded S³ Asia MBA program certificate signed by the three deans from FDSM, KUBS and NUS Business School.

For students with their home university as FDSM and KUBS, GMAT is a requirement if a student seeks NUS for his/her second degree. For students with KUBS or NUS as the home university, a second degree from Fudan requires defending a thesis (in the 4th semester at Fudan). For FDSM or NUS students, there is no special requirement to have a second degree from KUBS.

'''Tawjihi''' or '''Al-Tawjihi''' (امتحان شهادة الدراسة الثانوية العامة) is the General Secondary Education Certificate Examination in [[Jordan]]. It is the last stage of school education. To sit for the exam, students are required to finish 2 years of pre-school education, 10 years of basic education, and 2 years of secondary academic or vocational education. Subjects in the exam include Arabic, English, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Civil Studies and Islamic studies (unless Christian). 

Only those who pass the exam with a good mark may apply to proceed to university. For example, to be accepted to study medicine you must take the scientific stream in the last 3 years of the secondary education and get a mark not less than 95 degree out of 100 in Tawjihi exam. 

== Jordanian Tawjihi Equivalency ==
Foreign secondary education programs such as GCE/IGCSE/GCSE, [[SAT]]s, and [[International Baccalaureate]] require to have Tawjihi-equivalency, so that the student could later work in Jordan or proceed to a higher education in Jordan.

Upon graduation, the ministry of Higher Education transforms the Grades/Marks of these foreign educational programs, into the same marks used in grading Tawjihi students. However, even after the equivalency transformation, non-Tawjihi graduates are not allowed to compete with Tawjihi graduates for public university places. For non-Tawjihi graduates, there is a set quota of 5% of places. Most graduates of foreign programs end up paying international fees to get a place in their desired faculty. 

Regarding the system used to transform exam results of foreign education programs into the Tawjihi scale, which is a percentage out of 100, some see the system is fair and in fact over lenient with non-Tawjihi graduates, while others see it as unfair. Below is a summary of the requirements of the Ministry of education to receive an equivalency to the Jordanian Tawjihi.  

=== GCE/IGCSE/GCSE equivalency ===
General conditions:
*You should provide the Ministry with a proof that you have completed 12 years of schooling.
*You must pass six [[O-levels]] and or IGCSE/GCSE subjects and two [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] subjects. Passing grades are as follows:
**O-level/IGCSE/GCSE :  A, B, C and D.
**A-level/AS : A, B,C,D, and E
*For Arab students one of the eight subjects should be [[Arabic language]] at either the O or A level. The following Arabic subjects are accepted for the equivalency:
**Modern Arabic. 
**Classical Arabic.
**First Language Arabic.
**Arabic 9164.
:The Ministry of Education will not accept the subject of Arabic as a Second Language for the equivalency purposes. It will consider acceptance if the student was enrolled in an English language medium school outside Jordan for the majority of his/her scholastic years. The Ministry will consider case by case to grant the equivalency.
*In order to gain a Science Stream Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed
**six subjects at the  IGCSE or "O" level exams including:
***two science subjects 
***One subject Arabic language
**two subjects at the A-level including:
***Obligatory subject:
****one full A-level [[Math]], OR 
****2 AS's  mathematics, OR
****A-level in [[physics]]
***Optional subject:
****a full A- level in any science,OR
****2 AS's in two Sciences
*Literary stream: to gain Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed:
**six passes in IGCSE or “O” level exams including:
***one subject in Mathematics
***one subject  in [[Computer Studies]]/[[Information Technology]]
**two subjects at the A-level including:
***Obligatory subject:
****one full  A-level must be in Arabic
***Optional subject:
****A full A-level in any literary subject or
****two AS’s in any two literary subjects or
****one AS in a literary subject and one AS in a scientific subject.
*At the advanced level Computing is considered a science subject. At the ordinary level Computer Studies and Information Technology are considered as science subjects.
*Co-ordinated Science: for Tawjihi equivalency purposes the Ministry of Education has agreed to equate the Co-ordinated Science as two subjects.  
*AS levels:  The Ministry of Education has agreed that two AS subjects are equivalent to one A level for Tawjihi Equivalency purposes.  To receive an equivalency for a science subject the two AS subjects should be science subjects (i.e. AS Biology + AS Chemistry).  If one AS is a science subject and the other is a literary subject (i.e. AS Math. + AS  Arabic) then it equals one A level towards the literary stream. The student should check with the university they are applying to whether they require a full A level or not.
*The Ministry of Education will consider the same subject in two levels as two separate subjects (O level Biology and A level Biology). 
*The candidate may re-sit the exam as many times as he/she needs before obtaining the equivalency. If the student wants to re-sit a subject after obtaining the equivalency in order to improve his/her grade point average then the student has to re-sit all eight subjects.
The final percentage of a score is calculated as follows:

A* = 98    C = 75

A = 95    D = 65

B = 85    E = 55

8 subject percentages(6GCSEs/IGCSEs, 2 A'level subjects) are added up and then the total is divided by 8.

=== International Baccalaureate Equivalency ===
*You should provide the Ministry with a proof that you have completed 12 years of schooling.
*You should pass in 6 subjects. Passing grades are as follows:
**Standard Level Subjects: 3-7
**Higher Level Subjects: 4-7
*Arab students do not have a special requirement.
*In order to gain a Science Stream Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed:
**2 Language subjects in either [[IB Group 1 subjects|Group 1]] or [[IB Group 2 subjects|Group 2]]
**1 Subject in either [[IB Group 3 subjects|Group 3]] or [[IB Group 6 subjects|Group 6]]
**2 Subjects from [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4]]
**1 Subject from [[IB Group 5 subjects|Group 5]]
**At least 2 of these subjects should be at Higher Level
*In order to gain a Literary Stream Tawjihi equivalency the following is needed:
**2 Language subjects in either [[IB Group 1 subjects|Group 1]] or [[IB Group 2 subjects|Group 2]]
**2 Subject in either [[IB Group 3 subjects|Group 3]] or [[IB Group 6 subjects|Group 6]]
**1 Subjects from [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4]]
**1 Subject from [[IB Group 5 subjects|Group 5]]
**At least 2 of these subjects should be at Higher Level
For The international baccalaureate the equivalency goes as follows:
Each subject is calculated individually then they are summed up and divided by 6, then a 0.3% is added for each point scored from the [[IB Diploma Programme|diploma program]]
*A 7 is awarded a 98%,
*A 6 is awarded a 90%,
*A 5 is awarded an 80%,
*A 4 is awarded a 70%,
*A 3 is awarded a 60%
*A 2 is awarded a 50%,
:Keep in mind that a 2 is considered a fail and a 3 is considered a fail if it is in higher level.

An example of equivalency for a science stream student:
He obtained a score of 35. A 7 (98%) in Chemistry HL, a 6 (90%) in Physics SL, a 4 (70%) in ITGS SL, a 5 (80%) in Mathematics SL, a 5 (80%) in Arabic A1 SL, a 6 (90%) in English B SL and 2 marks from ToK and EE (0.3%×2=0.6%).
Here is the calculation:
# 98+90+70+80+80+90=508,
# 508 is then divided over 6=84.667,
# then 0.6 is added,
# the result is 85.27%.

'''UCAS Teacher Training''', formerly the '''Graduate Teacher Training Registry (GTTR)''', is the subsidiary of [[UCAS]] responsible for student applications from graduates (and those about to graduate) to providers of Initial Teacher Training in the United Kingdom. Applications are filled out online via the UCAS website.

The Registry was founded in 1960 and was run in close association with the [[Central Register and Clearing House]].  Although the number of students on relevant courses did not exceed a few hundred at the time, rapid expansion was envisaged in view of both the likely increase in graduate numbers in general and the expectation that training would soon be made compulsory for graduates entering teaching.&lt;ref name=JDB&gt;Browne, Joan D., "Teachers of Teachers", Hodder and Stoughton, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials at the Ministry of Education feared that the need to spend time training would deter graduates in shortage subjects and age ranges from entering teaching, while teachers' organisations argued that training was required more urgently than ever, and, further, that the rate of graduates leaving teaching was in fact higher among the untrained than the trained.&lt;ref name=JDB/&gt;  The National Advisory Council on the Training and Supply of Teachers unanimously advised the Secretary of State in 1963 that compulsory professional training should be introduced.  Finally, in 1969 the decision was made that training would be required for those graduating after 31 December 1969 who wished to teach in state primary schools, and for those graduating after 31 December 1973 who wished to teach in state secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Colleges and Departments of Education, ATCDE and Lund Humphries, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the GTTR as the application route had already appeared in careers material, for example in an article in "The Times" advising aspiring Drama teachers to apply to the Registry at 151 Gower Street, London WC1.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times", 17 April 1968, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  The GTTR was a valuable statistical source, and Parliament was informed that in 1968-9 5269 graduate applications were processed, resulting in 4239 acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) Official Report, Vol.772, cols. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTTR moved to 3 Crawford Place, London W1 and again was closely integrated with the CRCH.  The latter admissions body was wound up and merged with [[UCAS]] in 1992.  The GTTR came under the umbrella of this new body, and moved to its premises in Cheltenham.  Annual statistics are published on its website.

The '''University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, School of Medicine''' is located in the [[University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]. It's the only [[medical school]] in the [[University of Puerto Rico|University of Puerto Rico System]].  It is accredited by the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME). Its students are predominantly [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] residents. It is also considered the best bilingual medical school in the world due to its requirement for each admitted student to fully master both English and Spanish.

==History==

===Institute of Tropical Medicine===
In the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912.

===School of Tropical Medicine===
A consolidation of the former Institute of Tropical Medicine and other entities led in 1926 to the formation of the School of Tropical Medicine. Funds from [[Columbia University]] were used for the training of different health professionals in the island. At the same time, the school's professors conducted studies in collaboration with Columbia University physicians on tropical diseases hitherto of unknown etiology, or of high prevalence morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. In 1946 following the end of World War II, Columbia University canceled the money sent to the Medical School, which led to its closure. The legislature authorized a School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico, into which the School of Tropical Medicine was integrated.

===UPR School of Medicine===
The need for a State Medical School led in 1950 to the creation of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine as part of the  [[University of Puerto Rico|University of Puerto Rico System]], thanks to efforts made by the lawyer and first president of the University, [[Jaime Benitez]]. It began with an enrollment of 52 students. The school received its accreditation on 20 April 1954. In 1960, the University established a graduate program,{{Which|date=February 2010}} unique{{Why|date=February 2010}} in Puerto Rico, along with other{{Which|date=February 2010}} medical services and research.
