The '''2003 ricin letters''' refer to two [[ricin]]-laden letters found on two separate occasions between October and November 2003. One letter was mailed to the [[White House]] and intercepted at a processing facility; another was discovered with no address in South Carolina. A February 2004 ricin incident at the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]] was initially connected to the 2003 letters as well.

The letters were sent by an individual calling him- or herself "Fallen Angel". The sender, who claimed to own a trucking company, expressed anger over changes in federal trucking regulations. As of 2008, no connection between the Fallen Angel letters and the Dirksen building incident has been established. A $100,000 reward was offered in 2004 by the federal law enforcement agencies investigating the case, but to date the reward remains unclaimed.

==Background==

===Ricin===
{{main article|Ricin}}
Ricin is a white powder that can be produced as a liquid or a crystal.&lt;ref name=ershd/&gt; Ricin is an extremely toxic plant protein that can cause severe allergic reactions, and exposure to small quantities can be fatal.&lt;ref name=ershd&gt;Ricin: Biotoxin. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750002.html Emergency Response Safety and Health Database]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The toxin inhibits the formation of proteins within cells of exposed individuals.&lt;ref name=ershd/&gt; The [[US Centers for Disease Control|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] states that 500 micrograms is the minimum [[lethal dose]] of ricin in humans provided that exposure is from [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or [[inhalation]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/ricin/facts.asp Facts About Ricin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505234632/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/ricin/facts.asp |date=2009-05-05 }}, ''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, March 5, 2008, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ricin is easily purified from [[Castor oil|castor-oil]] manufacturing [[waste]].&lt;ref name=facts/&gt; It has been utilized by various states and organizations as a weapon, being most effective as an assassination weapon,&lt;ref name=johnston/&gt; notably in the case of the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]].

===Trucking regulations===
On January 4, 2004 new federal transportation rules took effect which directly affected the over-the-road trucking industry in the United States. The rules took effect with a 60-day [[grace period]] and were aimed at reducing fatigue related accidents and fatalities. Called the most far-reaching rule changes in 65 years, the regulations reduced daily allowed driving time from 11 hours to 10. The most controversial measures involved the way that workdays were calculated. The calculations were not allowed to factor in such delays as food and fuel stops and other time spent waiting at, for instance, a factory for a load. The new provisions allowed drivers to stay on duty for only 14 hours, thus the time spent waiting could eat into the time a driver spent on duty. These rule changes were what the self-proclaimed "Fallen Angel" took aim at in the ricin-laden letters.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;Jacobs, Andrew. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/05/us/truckers-look-in-their-ranks-for-fallen-angel-writer.html Truckers Look in Their Ranks for 'Fallen Angel' Writer]", ''The New York Times'', '''entire paragraph reference''', February 5, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters==

===October 2003 letter===
[[File:Oct 15 2003 ricin vial.JPG|thumb|right|upright|This metal vial was found in South Carolina; it contained the poison ricin]]
On October 15, 2003&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;"[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel04/ricin022304.htm Ricin Letter]", ([[Press release]]), ''[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'', February 23, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a package was discovered at a mail-sorting center in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], near the [[Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;[[Lemonick, Michael D.]] "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040216-588396,00.html Homegrown Terror]", ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine, February 16, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The package contained a letter and a small metal vial containing ricin powder.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; A label on the outside of the envelope containing the vial displayed the typed message: "Caution ricin poison enclosed in sealed container. Do not open without proper protection".&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The presence of ricin was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 21.&lt;ref name=cdcrept&gt;Drociuk, Daniel. "[http://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/epr/planning/prepconf2005/presentations/cross_cutting_goals/surveillance/DanielDrociuk.pdf Epidemiological Investigation of a Ricin-Containing Envelope at a Postal Facility - South Carolina 2003]", ''[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'', 2005 Preparedness Conference, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter inside the envelope was typewritten to the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]], and stated:&lt;ref name=cnnreward/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;To the department of transportation: I'm a fleet owner of a tanker company. I have easy access to castor pulp. If my demand is dismissed I'm capable of making Ricin. My demand is simple, January 4, 2004 starts the new hours of service for trucks which include a ridiculous ten hours in the sleeper berth. Keep at eight or I will start dumping.You have been warned this is the only letter that will be sent by me.&lt;br&gt;Fallen Angel&lt;ref name=cdcrept/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the potentially deadly nature of the poison, no one was exposed to, injured by, or killed by the ricin.&lt;ref name=cnnreward&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/US/01/08/fbi.ricin.letter/index.html FBI offers $100,000 reward in ricin case]", ''[[CNN.com]]'', January 9, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenville facility where the letter was found was also declared ricin-free in the ensuing weeks.&lt;ref name=cidrap2&gt;"[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/chem/news/nov2003ricin.html CDC warns of potential for ricin poisoning]", ''Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy'', University of Minnesota, November 20, 2003, accessed May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the letter had no delivery address and no postmark.&lt;ref name=redorbit&gt;"[http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/43036/fallen_angel_focus_of_ricin_probe/index.html Fallen Angel Focus of Ricin Probe]", ''redorbit.com'', February 5, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 2003 letter===
[[File:Nov 6, 2003 ricin letter.jpg|thumb|left|This typewritten letter was sent to the White House with a vial of ricin powder]]
On November 6, 2003, another letter, described as "nearly identical" to the October letter, was discovered. This time, the letter was addressed to [[The White House]] and it was discovered at a White House mail-processing facility in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;Hancock, David. "[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/06/terror/main598441.shtml Ricin Letters Still a Mystery]", ''[[CBS News]]'', February 5, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter contained a small vial of a white powdery substance that was initially tested negative for ricin.&lt;ref name=usatoday1/&gt; After subsequent testing at the mail facility resulted in positives for [[ricin]] contamination on mail equipment, the [[U.S. Secret Service]] ordered a retest that showed by November 10 the letter was "probable for ricin".&lt;ref name=usatoday1&gt;Locy, Toni, and Johnson, Kevin. "[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-04-feds-ricin_x.htm Feds didn't report ricin for five days]", ''[[USA Today]]'', February 4, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was postmarked on October 17 in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; Though addressed to the White House, the threatening language contained in the letter was again directed at the U.S. Department of Transportation and written by an individual calling him/herself "Fallen Angel", as with previous letter.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; The text of the letter stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Department of transportation&lt;br&gt;If you change the hours of service on&lt;br&gt;January 4, 2004 I will turn D.C into a ghost town&lt;br&gt;The powder on the letter is RICIN&lt;br&gt;have a nice day&lt;br&gt;Fallen Angel&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Secret Service did not alert the White House, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and other key agencies, including the CDC, of the discovery and positive tests until November 12.&lt;ref name=usatoday1/&gt; In the November 21, 2003 issue of ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' the CDC recommended that until Fallen Angel was captured, "healthcare providers and public health officials must consider ricin to be a potential public health threat and be vigilant about recognizing illness consistent with ricin exposure".&lt;ref name=cidrap2/&gt; The CDC's November warning mentioned only the first Fallen Angel letter.&lt;ref name=cidrap/&gt; The discovery of the ricin letter at the White House facility was not disclosed to the public until early February 2004.&lt;ref name=usatoday2&gt;Benedetto, Richard. "[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-04-secretservice-ricin_x.htm Secret Service investigated ricin quietly]", ''USA Today'', February 4, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The public disclosure of the second ricin letter from Fallen Angel coincided with the discovery of ricin in the mail room of a senate office building.&lt;ref name=usatoday2/&gt;

===February 2004 mail room contamination===
On February 2, 2004 in a mail room serving Senator [[Bill Frist]] in the [[Dirksen Senate Office Building]], a white powdery substance was found on a sorting machine.&lt;ref name=cnnsenate&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/03/senate.hazardous/ Frist: Ricin confirmed but no illness reported]", ''CNN.com'', February 4, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tests on February 3 confirmed that the substance was ricin.&lt;ref name=cnnsenate/&gt; The positive test results were indicated by six of eight preliminary tests on the substance.&lt;ref name=cidrap/&gt; The discovery resulted in more than a dozen staffers undergoing decontamination as well as the closure of the Dirksen, Hart, and Russell Senate Office Buildings.&lt;ref name=cidrap&gt;"[http://www.cidrapbusiness.biz/cidrap/content/other/chem/news/feb0304ricin.html Ricin in Frist's office closes 3 senate buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519053917/http://www.cidrapbusiness.biz/cidrap/content/other/chem/news/feb0304ricin.html |date=2009-05-19 }}", ''Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy'', University of Minnesota, February 3, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnsenate/&gt; The incident was treated as a criminal probe with investigators looking carefully for any connection between the ricin found at Dirksen and the "Fallen Angel" cases.&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;Johnston, David, and Hulse, Carl. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/04/us/ricin-capitol-hill-overview-finding-deadly-poison-office-disrupts-senate.html?scp=1&amp;sq=ricin%20frist&amp;st=cse Ricin on Capitol Hill: The Overview; Finding of Deadly Poison in Office Disrupts the Senate]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 4, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

===Fallen Angel===
The focus of the probe by the FBI, [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] (USPIS) and the [[Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General]] fell instantly upon the individual calling him/herself Fallen Angel in the two letters. The FBI was the lead agency in the Fallen Angel investigation.&lt;ref name=kaleo&gt;Borenstein, Seth, and Chatterjee, Sumana. "[http://media.www.kaleo.org/media/storage/paper872/news/2004/02/05/News/Source.Of.Ricin.May.Come.From.Within.U.s-2800767.shtml Source of ricin may come from within the U.S.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518130934/http://media.www.kaleo.org/media/storage/paper872/news/2004/02/05/News/Source.Of.Ricin.May.Come.From.Within.U.s-2800767.shtml |date=2009-05-18 }}", ''Knight-Ridder Newspapers'', via kaleo.org - ''Ka Leo'', February 5, 2004, accessed May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Agents questioned various individuals during their probe, such as one vocal former trucker in Florida.&lt;ref name=jacksonville&gt;Appelbaum, Binyamin. "[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021504/met_14825748.shtml Ricin probe targets man on Southside]", ''[[Florida Times Union]]'', February 15, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal officials, most notably at the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), remarked that the letters did not have the hallmarks of international terrorism and were more likely produced by a homegrown criminal.&lt;ref name=kaleo/&gt;

On January 4, 2004 the FBI, along with the USPIS and the DOT, offered a $100,000 reward in connection with the October 2003 case from Greenville, South Carolina.&lt;ref name=reward&gt;"[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/pr040108.pdf $100,000 Reward] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923052702/http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=%2Fdata%2Fpdfdocs%2Fpr040108.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }}", (Press release), ''Federal Bureau of Investigation'', January 4, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004 the amount of the reward was increased to $120,000.&lt;ref name=washtimes&gt;Staff. "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/22/20041222-113121-9881r/ Reward in ricin inquiry increased]", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', December 23, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal has not been captured to date.&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;[[Emsley, John]].

===Dirksen Building contamination===
Immediately following the incident in Frist's office, both the FBI and the [[United States Capitol Police]] were tasked to the investigation;&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; like in the Fallen Angel investigation, the FBI was the lead agency.&lt;ref name=kaleo/&gt; Detectives and agents focused on the possibility that the individual responsible for the 2003 letters was also responsible for the contamination at the Dirksen building.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Within two weeks of the incident, investigators were questioning the validity of the positive ricin tests at the Senate building. The results raised suspicion because no source (e.g. a letter) was ever found for the ricin. It was possible that the "contamination" was from paper by-products and not ricin.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4143594/ NBC: Investigators question ricin test results]", ''[[MSNBC.com]]'', February 18, 2004, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later tests confirmed that the initial tests did not indicate a [[false positive]] and the substance was indeed ricin.&lt;ref name=wtop/&gt; By the end of March 2005, there were no suspects and no confirmed source for the ricin found in Senator Frist's office.&lt;ref name=wtop/&gt; Investigators also found no connection to the Fallen Angel case as of the same date.&lt;ref name=wtop&gt;"[http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?sid=177780&amp;nid=25 Still No Suspects in Ricin Case on Capitol Hill]", ''[[WTOP-FM|WTOP]].com'', March 31, 2005, accessed May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite those developments, investigators were not yet ready to declare a dead end to the investigation.&lt;ref name=wtop/&gt; As of 2008, no direct connection has yet been found between the First case and the Fallen Angel case and no explanation found for the origin of the ricin in Frist's office.&lt;ref name=ryan&gt;Ryan, Jeffrey R. and Glarum, Jan F.

Critics say that administrative subpoena authority is a violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], while proponents say that it provides a valuable investigative tool.&lt;ref name="fas20050415"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32880.pdf | title=Administrative Subpoenas and National Security Letters in Criminal and Foreign Intelligence Investigations: Background and Proposed Adjustments | publisher=Congressional Research Service | work=CRS Report for Congress | date=2005-04-15 | accessdate=August 29, 2012 | author=Doyle, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired20120828"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/08/administrative-subpoenas/ | title=We Don’t Need No Stinking Warrant: The Disturbing, Unchecked Rise of the Administrative Subpoena | publisher=Condé Nast | work=wired.com | date=2012-08-28 | accessdate=August 29, 2012|author=Kravets, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
Administrative subpoenas have most commonly been issued by the [[Offices of the Inspector General]] of various federal agencies.&lt;ref name="sklaire"/&gt;  The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] was granted administrative subpoena authority under the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]].&lt;ref name="wired20120828"/&gt;  In 1996 Congress expanded the authority to issue the subpoenas to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] when investigating [[health care fraud]] cases under the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].  More recently, Public law 106-544 December 19, 2000 the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] has attempted to expand administrative subpoena authority to terrorism investigations through amendments to the [[Patriot Act]].&lt;ref name="sklaire"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://wlf.org/upload/120205LOLSklaire.pdf | title=Administrative Subpoenas Blur the Line between Civil and Criminal Enforcement | author=Sklaire, Michael R. | journal=Legal Opinion Letter |date=December 2005 | volume=15 | issue=23| publisher=[[Washington Legal Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USJUSTIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Report to Congress on the Use of Administrative Subpoena Authorities by Executive Branch Agencies and Entities|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/olp/rpt_to_congress.htm#1|website=US Department of Justice|publisher=US Justice department|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also frequently utilizes administrative subpoenas to initiate civil investigations of U.S. economic sanctions violations. OFAC subpoenas are typically to be responded to in 30 days and require the subpoenaed party to turn over full and complete information, as well as, supporting documentation to verify the information provided in the response.

==Boulle's Life==
in 1677, on his marriage certificate, André-Charles Boulle gave his birth date, for posterity, as being 11 November 1642. No other document corroborates this birth in Paris. The historians M. Charles Read, H.-L. Lacordaire and Paulin Richard have determined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6572564m/f18.item.r=Read|title=André-Charles Boulle |publisher= "André Boulle, Ebeniste de Louis XIV" M. CHARLES ASSELINEAU 1872 P 11| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his father was the Protestant Jan (or Jean/Johann) Bolt (or Bolte/Boul/ Bolle&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Samoyault 1979, pp. 39"&gt;Jean-Pierre Samoyault, "André-Charles Boulle et sa famille: nouvelles recherches, nouveaux documents" ''Haute Etudes Medievales et Modernes'', Nr 40, 1979, pp. 39 Para 2, Librairie Droz, Genève.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Samoyault 1979, pp. 5"&gt;Jean-Pierre Samoyault, "André-Charles Boulle et sa famille: nouvelles recherches, nouveaux documents" ''Haute Etudes Medievales et Modernes'', Nr 40, 1979, pp. 5, Librairie Droz, Genève.&lt;/ref&gt; but at his own (Catholic) marriage, André-Charles Boulle named his father as "Jean Boulle". 
André-Charles Boulle's marriage at Saint Sulpice and burial in 1732 at Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k63480935/f148.image.r=Boulle?rk=128756;0|title=Burial of André-Charles Boulle in Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois|publisher= Mercure de France| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are but two of many lifetime inconsistencies with his Protestant 'provenance', most easily explained by the ongoing persecution of Protestants.  His parentage with the Protestant Boulles from [[Marseille]], the [[Sun King]]'s Historian&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6572564m/f23.item.r=jean%20boulle|title=André-Charles Boulle and Marseilles |publisher= "André Boulle, Ebeniste de Louis XIV" M. CHARLES ASSELINEAU 1872 P 13,14| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; needs clarification and Coliès, in his ''Bibliotheque Choisies''  confirms a Marseillais relative as being the author of a History of Protestantism, called ''Essay de l'histoire des Protestants Distingués Par Nation'' (1646). 
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Lully.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of Jean Baptiste Lully around the 1670s|[[File:Jean Baptiste Lully signature.svg|169px]]Jean-Baptiste Lully c. 1670]]
[[File:Commode MET DP108734.jpg|369px|thumb|Commode by André-Charles Boulle, son of Jean Boulle - Detail]]

In the absence of a birth document, three factors play a critical part in the mystery surrounding Boulle's parentage.

The first is that foreign artists flocking to the [[Sun King]]'s Court were keen to be naturalised French subjects to 'fit in' and would, like [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] the Royal Musician  (28 November 1632 – 22 March 1687), have changed their names. Jean-Baptiste Lully, c.1670]]For Lully, it was from "Giovanni Battista Lulli" to "[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]") but at his marriage, he falsely declared his father's name to be Laurent de Lully, gentilhomme Florentin [Florentine gentleman]".&lt;ref&gt;La Gorce, pp. 28–29, 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; This historical background makes it difficult for the historian to identify which of the many Jean Boulles, Jean Bolles,&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Samoyault 1979, pp. 39"/&gt; Johann Bolts or even 'Jean Boulds' on record was André-Charles Boulle's true father. Some of these are of Catholic French origin, some are French Protestants and some are from [[Gelderland]] in Holland&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Samoyault 1979, pp. 5"/&gt;
[[File:Getty Museum Wall Clock André-Charles Boulle.jpg|369px|thumb|[[J. Paul Getty Museum]]: Wall Clock; Attributed to André-Charles Boulle (French, 1642 - 1732, master before 1666); Paris, France; about 1710; Gilt bronze; blue-painted horn; enameled metal.]]
The second factor is that André-Charles Boulle's birth date is almost certainly inacurrate. Despite his genius (or perhaps because of it) André-Charles Boulle was a demonstrably poor administrator and poor with dates and specifically in respect of his age. His children were no different, declaring him to be 90 Years old when he died. This is highly unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Jal, Auguste (1795-1873), "Dictionnaire critique de biographie et d'histoire : errata et supplément pour tous les dictionnaires historiques d'après des documents authentiques inédits",1867 pp 265, H. Plon (Paris).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Clock with pedestal MET DP340881.jpg|369px|thumb|Clock with pedestal by André-Charles Boulle - Detail]]
The third and perhaps most telling factor adding to the overall confusion about Boulle's parentage was that in October 1685 (a mere 8 years after his marriage), [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] renounced the [[Edict of Nantes]] and declared Protestantism illegal with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]. All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism.[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] ordered the destruction of [[Huguenot]] [[Religion in France|churches]], as well as the closure of [[Protestant]] [[Education in France|school]]s. This made official the persecution of Protestants already enforced since 1681 and it led to around 400,000 fleeing the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1685revocation.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =220 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] demonstrates, by his documented actions, that marriage was a propitious time to tidy up provenance. Within the context of the times, it is natural to expect that as well as ensuring his father's Catholic name was recorded for posterity, André-Charles Boulle  'tidied' up his own place and date of birth. This made him older, for motives we do not yet comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6539474q/f279.image.r=andre%20charles%20boulle%20protestant?rk=64378;0|title= Marriage d'André-Charles Boulle|publisher= Gallica.bnf "Livre Dictionnaire critique de biographie et d'histoire errata et supplément pour tous" PP 265| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the definite possibility, as yet unexplored by historians, that André-Charles Boulle was born in Holland. It would explain a lot of the confusion around his parentage. The salient fact is that we only have André-Charles Boulle's word that he was born in Paris in 1642.

André-Charles Boulle's Protestant family environment was a rich and artistic milieu totally consistent with the genius of the Art he was to produce in later years. His father, Jean Boulle (ca 1616-?),&lt;ref name="gw.geneanet.org"&gt;Alain Garric, "Essai de Genealogie sur André-Charles Boulle par Alain Garric" [https://gw.geneanet.org/garric]&lt;/ref&gt; was cabinetmaker to the King, had been naturalised French in 1676 and lived in the [[Louvre]], by Royal Decree. His grandfather, Pierre Boulle (ca 1595-1649),&lt;ref name="gw.geneanet.org"/&gt; was naturalised French in 1675, had been cabinetmaker to Louis XIII and had also lived in the [[Louvre]]. André-Charles was thus exposed to two generations of illustrious artists, master craftsmen, engravers, cabinetmakers and, indeed, family all directly contracted by the King. As pointed out by the historians M. De Montaiglon and Charles Asselineau, this entourage included his aunt Marguerite Bahusche (on his mother's side) who was a famous painter in her own right, married to another very famous artist, Jacques Bunel de Blois, Henri IV's favourite painter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew PILKINGTON (Vicar of Donabate, Dublin.), Henry Fuseli, "The Gentleman's and Connosseur's Dictionary of Painters",1760 pp 644, T. Cadell (London).&lt;/ref&gt; Others who were appointed by the King and worked with the two preceding generations of Boulles from their ateliers in the [[Louvre]] included the painter Louis Du Guernier (1614-1659),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/louis-du-guernier-1614-1659-2/|title=Louis Du Guernier (1614-1659)|publisher= Musée virtuel du Protestantisme| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the embroiderers Nicolas Boulle and Caillard and the goldsmith Pierre de la Barre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6572564m/f24.item.r=jean%20boulle|title= Entourage of André-Charles Boulle|publisher= Gallica.bnf "André Boulle, ébéniste de Louis XIV" PP 14| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Clock with pedestal MET DP214853.jpg|369px|thumb| [[Boulle Work]] on Boulle Clock  - Detail]]

There is virtually nothing on André-Charles Boulle's youth, upbringing or training apart from a solitary Notarial Act dated 19 July 1666  (when he was supposedly 24 years old) agreeing a 5-year apprentice's contract for a 17-year-old nephew, François Delaleau, Master Carpenter from L'Abbaye des Celestins de Marcoussis in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Samoyault, "André-Charles Boulle et sa famille: nouvelles recherches, nouveaux documents" ''Haute Etudes Medievales et Modernes'', Nr 40, 1979, pp. 36, Librairie Droz, Genève.&lt;/ref&gt; André-Charles Boulle's own apprenticeship was therefore most likely to have occurred within the focused confines of his father's atelier at the [[Louvre]]. Here, in any event,  he was closest to the [[Sun King.]] and to [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] who discovered him.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nérée Ronfort, "André-Charles Boulle (1642–1732).

In 1672, by the age of 30, Boulle had already been granted lodgings in the galleries of the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]] which [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had set apart for the use of the most favoured among the artists employed by the Crown. To be admitted to these galleries signified a mark of special Royal favour and also freed him from the restrictions imposed by the [[trade guild]]s. Boulle received the deceased Jean Macé's lodgings on the recommendation of the Minister of Arts, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], who described Boulle as ''le plus habile [[ébéniste]] de Paris''. The Royal Decree conferring this privilege describes Boulle variously as a [[chasing|chaser]], [[gilding|gilder]] and maker of marquetry.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Boulle, André Charles |volume=4 |pages=321-323 |first=James |last=Penderel-Brodhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulle received the post of ''Premier ébéniste du Roi''.&lt;ref name="Dell 1992:187"&gt;Dell 1992:187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulle initially had aspirations to be a painter but according to one of his close friends, [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]] (7 May 1694 – 10 September 1774),  he was forced by his cabinetmaker father, Jean Boulle, to develop other skills. This may explain a sense of 'missed vocation' and resultant 'passion' and utter dedication to the collection of prints and paintings, which nearly ruined him...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-et-antiques.com/andre-charles-boulle-article-5-13.html|title= Mariette and André-Charles Boulle|publisher= Art &amp; Antiques| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first payment on record to him by the crown (1669) specifies ''ouvrages de peinture'' and Boulle was employed for years on end at the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], where the mirrored walls, floors of wood mosaic,  inlaid paneling and marquetry in the Cabinet du Dauphin (1682–1686) came to be regarded by such as [[Jean-Aimar Piganiol de La Force]] ( 21 September 1669 - 10 January 1753 )&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nérée Ronfort, "André-Charles Boulle. Commandes pour le Grand Dauphin à Versailles" ''Dossier de l'Art'', Nr 124, November 2005, pp. 38-63, Editions Faton, Dijon.&lt;/ref&gt; as his most remarkable work. The rooms were dismantled in the Late 18th century and their unfashionable art broken up,.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; More recently, a partial inventory of the Grand Dauphin's decorations at the Palace of [[Versailles]] has come to light at the National Archives in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nérée Ronfort, "Inventaire d'un des magasins de la Direction Générale des Bâtiments du Roy à Versailles (c.1744-1746)", ''Dossier de l'Art'', Nr 124, November 2005, pp. 64-65, Editions Faton, Dijon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulle carried out numerous royal commissions for the "[[Sun King]]", as can be seen from the records of the [[Bâtiments du Roi]] and correspondence of the [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|marquis de Louvois]]. Foreign Princes, French Nobility, government ministers and French financiers flocked to him offering him work, and the famous words of the [[Michel de Marolles|abbé de Marolles]], ''Boulle y tourne en ovale'' became a well established saying in the literature associated with French cabinetmaking.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''
Professor C.R. Williams writes, ''There was no limit to the prices a reckless and profligate court was willing to pay for luxurious beauty during the sumptuous, extravagant reign of Louis the Magnificent of France. For much that was most splendid and beautiful in furniture making at this period stands the name of Charles André Boulle. His imagination and skill were given full play, and he proved equal to the demands made upon him.Boulle was a remarkable man. In a court whose only thought was of pleasure and display, he realized that his furniture must not only excel all others in richness, beauty, and cost; it must also be both comfortable and useful. He was appointed cabinet maker to the Dauphin, the heir to the throne of France. This distinction, together with his own tastes, led him to copy some of the manners and bearing of his rich customers.'''
He was an aristocrat among furniture makers. ''He spent the greater part of his large fortune in filling his workshop with works of art. His warehouses were packed with precious woods and finished and unfinished pieces of magnificent furniture. In his own rooms were priceless works of art, the collection of a lifetime—gems, medals, drawings, and paintings, which included forty-eight drawings by Raphael''''.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Williams, "The Mentor:Furniture and its Makers Vol.1, No. 30, Serial Number 30, September 7, 2015, [EBook #49904]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulle's output from, at one time, three workshops included commodes, bureaux, armoires, pedestals, clockcases and lighting-fixtures, richly mounted with gilt-bronze that he modelled himself. Despite his skills, his exquisite craftsmen and the high prices he commanded, Boulle was always running out of money. This was mostly as a direct result of his lifelong obsession as a collector and hoarder of works of art. Although he undoubtedly drew inspiration for his own works from these purchases, it meant he did not always pay his workmen regularly. In addition, clients who had made considerable advances failed to obtain the pieces they had ordered and, on more than one occasion. These dissatisfied clients made formal attempts to get Royal permission to arrest him for his debts, despite the Royal protection afforded by his post at the [[Louvre]]. In 1704, the king granted him six months' protection from his creditors on condition that Boulle use the time to regulate his affairs or ''ce sera la dernière grace que sa majesté lui fera là-dessus''. Living beyond his means seems to have been a family trait as history repeated itself, twenty years later, when one of his sons was arrested at [[Fontainebleau]] and actually imprisoned until King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] had him released.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1720, Boulle's shaky finances were dealt a further blow by a fire which began in an adjoining atelier and spread to his workshop in the Place du [[Louvre]] (one of three he maintained&lt;ref name="Dell 1992:187"/&gt;), completely destroying twenty workbenches and the various tools of eighteen ébénistes, two menuisiers as well as most of the precious seasoned wood, appliances, models, and finished works of art. What could be salvaged was sold and a petition for financial assistance made to the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Regent]], the success of this appeal is unknown. According to Boulle's friend, [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], many of his pecuniary problems were indeed as a direct result of his obsession for collecting and hoarding pictures, engravings, and other art objects. The inventory of his losses in this fire exceeded 40,000 [[French livre|''livres'']], included many old Masters, not to mention 48 drawings by [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael]], wax models by [[Michelangelo]] and the manuscript journal kept by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in Italy.

The compulsive Boulle attended literally every sale of drawings and engravings he could.&lt;ref&gt;Th. H. Lunsingh-Scheurleer, "Parmigianino and Boulle", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''68''' No. 399 (June 1936), pp. 286-288.&lt;/ref&gt; He borrowed at high interest rates to pay for his purchases until the next auction when he devised other means to gain more cash. His friend [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]] informs that it was a compulsion that was impossible to cure. André-Charles Boulle died on 29 February 1732 in the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k63480935/f148.image.r=Boulle?rk=128756;0|title=Death of André-Charles Boulle in the Louvre|publisher= Mercure de France| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving many debts for his four sons to deal with and, to whom he had transferred ownership of his business and tenure in the [[Louvre]] some seventeen years earlier.&lt;ref name="Dell 1992:187"/&gt;

Boulle left four sons: Jean-Philippe(1678-1744),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O185910/design-for-a-boulle-jean-philippe/|title=Jean Philippe Boulle, Son of André-Charles Boulle|publisher= V&amp;A| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre-Benoît (c.1683-1741), André-Charles II (1685–1749) and Charles-Joseph (1688–1754). They were handed over the contents and technology of his workshops as early as 1715.&lt;ref name="Dell 1992:187"/&gt; Despite all four sons being granted the very prestigious Royal title ''ébéniste du roi'', their financial affairs were as badly managed as those of their father's. Three of the four brothers are known to have died in debt.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Sargentson, "Markets for Boulle furniture in early eighteenth-century Paris" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''134''' No. 1071 (June 1992), pp. 363–367; Peter Fuhring, "Designs for and after Boulle Furniture", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''134''' No. 1071 (June 1992), pp. 350-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boulle Work==
[[File:Example of boulle work.jpg|500px|thumb|center|Example of [[Boulle Work]] with [[tortoiseshell]] in mottled red, [[brass]] and [[pewter]]]]
'''Boulle’s inlay materials included [[tortoiseshell]], [[brass]], pewter and even animal horn. For contrasting woods, he often used rosewood, ebony, kingwood, and other dense, dark-toned tropical species. Boulle’s marquetry technique was to make two contrasting sheets of intricate inlay that were cut from a single sandwich of materials. If the sandwich, or packet, contained two layers that were light and dark, the two finalproducts would be a sheet with a light pattern on a dark background, and a reversed sheet, with a dark pattern on a light background. One sheet would have been considered the primary pattern, in French the 'première partie'. The opposite pattern was called the counterpart, or 'contrapartie'. By sawing both patterns out of one packet and reassembling them on two trays, the background of the 'première partie' becomes the motif of the 'contrapartie'. Boulle made cabinets with both patterns in a single piece, or pairs of contrasting cabinets''.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popularwoodworking.com/projects/aw-extra-1214-beautiful-boulle-work|title=Beautiful Boulle Work|publisher= www.popularwoodworking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tortoiseshell===
[[File:Boulle work example showing depth given by tortoiseshell.jpg|819px|thumb|center|[[Boulle Work]] showing the use of [[pewter]]  (center) and the 'depth' given by [[tortoiseshell]] in the background. Brass Inlay is on the right and left]].
[[Tortoiseshell]] was used in thin sliced inlays onto wood and is today an important reference with regard to [[Boulle Work]]. Despite tortoiseshell's rarity and cost,  its durability, organic warmth and mottled-red aesthetics made it particularly apt for exotic wood such as ebony. This is because it gives a sense of depth to [[Boulle Work]]. The initial processing of tortoiseshell involves separating the layers of the scutes from the animal's [[carapace]] by heating, and softening the plates by boiling them, in salt water, and thereafter flattening them under a press. Although two pieces could be fused together by use of a hot iron, great care had to be taken not to lose the colour. Finishing and polishing was done by various techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions, 344-346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peola"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lupano |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Peola |first2=Paolo |date=1915 |title=Corso di Scienze Naturali a uso delle Scuole Complementari |trans-title=A Course of Natural Sciences for the Complementary Institutes |language=Italian |publisher=G.B.

===Brass (Gilt Bronze)===
[[File:Example of Brass - André-Charles Boulle.jpg|139px|thumb|Brass work by Boulle]]
'''Henry IV established the privileged status for the artists in 1608 in a lettre patente (royal decree) in which he stated his express purpose of encouraging the flourishing of the arts in France through a sort of cross-pollenisation and co-operation. The inhabitants enjoyed the status for life which freed then from the strict laws of the guild system and granted other legal and fiscal benefits.  The system was very important to André Charles Boulle who was granted the prestige of a workshop in 1672, the same year he was named ébéniste, ciseleur, doreur du roi (cabinet maker, chaser, gilder to the King) by Marie-Thérèse d’Autriche (1638-1683), Louis XIV’s wife and Queen. The space was too small for a furniture production workshop of any scale, so basically served as a calling card or prestigious address for Boulle who still possessed his family workshop on Rue de Reims on the left bank, and was eventually granted a large space of over 500 square meters in an abandoned theatre in the Louvre. (Jean Nérée Ronfort, exhibition catalogue)  In addition, the lack of guild control allowed Boulle, who was also trained as a sculptor, to create and cast his own gilt bronze mounts for his furniture.  From 1685, he possessed his own foundry, a critical aspect to the originality of his work.  Boulle also created objects purely in gilt-bronze such as chandeliers, clocks, firedogs, wall lights among others, which contributed greatly to his fame.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betharnold.com/1/2010/01/paris-art-market-buzz-a-boullienne-fantasy.html|title=André-Charles Boulle's Foundry|publisher=betharnold.com 25 January 2010 Edition| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Pewter or brass inlay on tortoiseshell was known as premier-partie, while tortoiseshell inlay on brass or pewter was contre-partie.

André-Charles Boulle kept no accurate records of his prodigious output. The identification of furniture produced by Boulle's workshop is greatly hampered by a lack of documentation of the pieces he created. Unhappily it is by no means easy, even for the expert, to declare the authenticity of a commode, a bureau, or a table in the manner of Boulle and to all appearance from his workshops. His sons unquestionably carried on the traditions for some years after his death but his imitators were many and capable. A few of the more magnificent pedigree-pieces are among the worlds mobiliary treasures. Rather than having his own internal system of identification or poinçon or mark on each piece, he depended on the records kept by the ''[[Bâtiments du Roi]]''. These, did not identify new works with specific entry numbers as they were being produced nor did they keep a detailed daily journal of output. Had Boulle used the royal wardrobe, the ''Garde-Meuble de la Couronne'' to identify and record his output, things might have turned out differently.&lt;ref&gt;Dell 1992:194/&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his many Royal commissions, only a pair of commodes delivered in 1708 and 1709 to the King at the [[Grand Trianon]] can be securely linked to any sort of documentation to confirm provenance.&lt;ref&gt;Dell 1992:233-46 catalogues a very fine pair of 19th-century English copies in the [[Frick Collection]].&lt;/ref&gt; A series of grand ''[[armoire]]s'' in the [[Louvre Museum]] and the [[Wallace Collection]] are also securely attributed to his workshop.  Identification of some of Boulle's works based on the tell-tale refinements of the marquetry and the re-use of marquetry templates and characteristic boldly sculptured gilt-bronze mounts can at times be provenanced from three sets of images of furniture designs engraved by Boulle and published by his friend [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]] around 1720;&lt;ref&gt;''Nouveaux Deisseins&lt;!--Deisseins in original--&gt; de Meubles et Ouvrages de Bronze et de Marqueterie Inventés et gravés par André Charles Boulle'', n.d..&lt;/ref&gt; pieces depicted in a series of workshop drawings traditionally ascribed to Boulle in the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]], Paris and private collections; and the descriptions in the inventory of works in progress made when Boulle transferred legal ownership of the workshops to his sons in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;Sources note by Dell 1992:196 notes 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the more magnificent pedigree-pieces are among the worlds mobiliary treasures. There are, for instance, two famous [[armoire]]s, which fetched 12,075 at the Hamilton Palace sale; the marquetry commodes, enriched with bronze mounts, formerly in the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]]; various cabinets and commodes and tables in the [[Louvre]], the [[Musée de Cluny]] and the [[Mobilier National]]; the marriage coffers of the dauphin which were in the San Donato collection. There are several fine authenticated pieces in the Wallace Collection at [[Hertford House]], together with others consummately imitated, probably in the [[Louis Seize]] period. On the rare occasions when a pedigree example comes into the auction room, it invariably commands a high price; but there can be little doubt that the most splendid and sumptuous specimens of Boulle are diminishing in number, while the second and third classes of his work are perhaps becoming more numerous. The truth is that this wonderful work, with its engraved or inlaid designs; its myriads of tiny pieces of ivory and copper, ebony and tortoiseshell, all kept together with glue and tiny chased nails, and applied very often to a rather soft, white wood, is not meet to withstand the ravages of time and the variations of the atmosphere. Alternate heat and humidity are even greater enemies of inlaid furniture than time and wear. Such delicate objects were rarely used, and the most talented of the artists were employed by the crown.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

===Grand Trianon===

[[File:André-Charles Boulle, Commode Mazarin (Mazarin Cabinet), 1708, Grand Trianon.jpg|thumb|[[André-Charles Boulle]], Commode [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] ([[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] Cabinet), 1708, made for the [[Grand Trianon]]]]
In 1708, the prototypes for the [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] Commode, then called ''bureaux'', were delivered to the [[Grand Trianon]] by [[André-Charles Boulle]]. The 1st [[Duke of Antin]], [[Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin]] Director of the King's buildings, wrote to Louis XIV: "''I was at the Trianon inspecting the second writing desk by Boulle; it is as beautiful as the other and suits the room perfectly."'&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990|title=André-Charles Boulle, Metropolitan Museum of Arts| publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''From the beginning, the design proved to be immensely popular, although it has also been criticized for an "awkward treatment of forms," meaning, in particular, the four extra spiral legs that were required to support the weight of the bronze mounts and marble top.[3] Nevertheless, the Boulle workshop made at least five other examples of this expensive model, including the Metropolitan's. Traditionally, they have been dated between 1710 and 1732, the year of Boulle's death; by 1730, however, the decorative style of the Sun King's long reign had been supplanted by the lighter forms of the Régence and early Rococo, and a date of 1710–20 is probably more accurate.'&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990|title=André-Charles Boulle, Metropolitan Museum of Arts |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems strange that the [[Duke of Antin]] and probably Boulle himself should have called this new type of chest a bureau, yet they may have seen it in connection with the bureau plat, a flat-topped desk with a large writing surface that was currently being developed. A very fine example of the celebrated Boulle bureau plat is the one made for Louis-Henri de Bourbon (1692–1740), prince de Condé, for the [[Château de Chantilly]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art| title=André-Charles Boulle in the Metropolitan Museum| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The design of the commode reflects the view of the late Louis Quatorze period that court art should be characterized by opulence and swagger. John Morley has pointed out that "the extraordinary way in which its body is, as it were, slung between the eccentric legs is somewhat reminiscent of carriage construction."[5] Indeed, if the tapering spiral supports behind the paw feet could be removed, the resemblance would be even more striking. Like one of the splendid carriages that rolled down the road to Versailles––a moving "billboard" for the glorification of its owner[6]––this commode was intended to impress.'&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;

A look at some details reveals the unsurpassed skill and artistic imagination of the Boulle workshop. The three-dimensional acanthus-leaf scroll mount on the upper drawer was a signature ornament of Boulle's, one that he employed on many pieces.[7] Its design is echoed in the light-catching two-dimensional brass-and-tortoiseshell marquetry on both drawer fronts. This refinement extends the movement along the surface of the piece and heightens the bulging appearance of the body, as if some power within was pressing the surface outward. This effect of surface tension is one of the reasons why Boulle's pieces dominate the space around them, becoming the focal point of any interior. Extraordinary are the female figures with paw-and-acanthus feet that support the sarcophagus-shaped body.[8] The sensitive finishing of the bronze surface of these sculptures is especially noticeable in the matted, feathery look of the wings, which is achieved by chiseling, and in the sheen of the burnished areas.'&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art"/&gt;

[[André-Charles Boulle]], who was named King's Cabinetmaker, Chaser, Gilder, and Engraver in 1672,[9] headed an important workshop at the Louvre. He did not invent the metal-and-tortoiseshell marquetry technique named for him called "[[Boulle Work]]", but he perfected it, and it bestows upon his creations a unique look, raising them to a level of artistry where furniture becomes sculpture. Through his etchings Boulle publicized his exquisitely fashionable line of products, both stimulating and reflecting a new taste for luxurious furnishings.Every collector of grand French furniture has acquired a "[[Boulle]]," either an original workshop example or one of the countless copies that were made during the late-eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990|title=André-Charles Boulle, Metropolitan Museum of Arts|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Most of the furniture in the [[Royal Collection]] made by, or attributed to, Boulle was acquired by George IV (1762–1830). A Francophile, the king furnished the royal palaces with large quantities of fashionable French furniture from the 1780s until his death in 1830. The lavish style and use of exotic materials accorded well with his extravagant taste. However, due to the volume of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century imitations, as well as the fact that Boulle did not sign his work, it can be difficult to definitively credit pieces to the maker. For this reason, many of the Boulle-marquetry pieces in the Royal Collection are recorded as ‘attributed to André-Charles Boulle’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/trails/boulle-in-the-royal-collection/armoire/|publisher=Royal Collection|title=Andre-Charles Boulle in the Royal Collection|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 13 works of art by André-Charles Boulle in the Royal Collection, including (i)Armoire, c. 1700 (The Grand Corridor, Windsor Castle) (ii) Cabinet (en première-partie), c. 1700 (The Grand Corridor, Windsor Castle) (iii) Cabinet (en contre-partie), c. 1700 (The Grand Corridor, Windsor Castle) (iv)Cabinet, (without stand, similar to ones in the State Hermitage Museum and the collections of the Duke of Buccleuch) (v) Paire de bas d'armoire, (The Grand Corridor, Windsor Castle) (vi) Writing table, possibly delivered to Louis, the Grand Dauphin (1661–1711), c. 1680 (vii) Paire de torchère, c. 1700 (viii) Bureau Plat, c. 1710 (The Rubens Room, Windsor Castle) (ix) Petit gaines, attributed to., early 18th century.

The '''Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre''' was a British [[Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre]] in the town of [[Bad Nenndorf]], [[Germany]], which operated from June 1945 to July 1947. Allegations of mistreatment of detainees by British troops resulted in a police investigation, a public controversy in both Britain and Germany and the camp's eventual closure. Four of the camp's officers were brought before [[courts-martial]] in 1948 and one of the four was convicted on charges of [[neglect]].

==Background==

The British authorities opened No. 74 [[Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre]] (CSDIC) in June 1945. The camp was based in the Schlammbad (mud bath) complex in Bad Nenndorf, with the former bathing chambers being converted into prison cells. It was the successor to an earlier camp at [[Diest]] in [[Belgium]] and was run by a combination of military and intelligence officers under [[War Office]] authority. Several other CSDIC camps had existed during the war, in the UK at [[Ham, London|Ham in London]] and [[Huntercombe, Slough|Huntercombe]] near [[Henley-on-Thames]] and in the Mediterranean [CMF]:Rome at [[Cinecittà]], Middle East [MEF] Camp [[Maadi|Ma'adi]] near Cairo, and South Asia, but these had closed by the time No. 74 CSDIC had opened.

The camp was originally intended to hold former [[Nazi]]s for interrogation, but its remit was expanded to include a number of people suspected of carrying out espionage for the [[Soviet Union]]. As well as Germans, these included Russians, Czechs and Hungarians.&lt;ref name="guardian171205"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/17/secondworldwar.topstories3 |title=The interrogation camp that turned prisoners into living skeletons |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 December 2005 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Cobain |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the camp's two years of operation, a total of 372 men and 44 women were held there.&lt;ref name="Zeit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeus.zeit.de/text/online/2006/14/bad_nenndorf |title=Tommies als Täter |trans-title=Tommies as the culprit |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |date=4 April 2006 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of abuse==
{{See also|Abuse|Prisoner abuse}}
From the outset, the camp appears to have had organisational problems. The commanding officer, Lt Col [[Robin Stephens]], noted that its staffing "was generous, but in practice was never filled. Later there was a reduction to the bone. That was inevitable owing to Treasury requirements. Then trouble began. Work was on the increase, demobilisation took [a] heavy toll and replacements were inexperienced."&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lt. Col. R. G. W. |last=Stephens |title=Camp 020: MI5 and the Nazi Spies : the Official History of MI5's Wartime Interrogation Centre |editor-first=Oliver |editor-last=Hoare |publisher=Public Records Office |year=2000 |isbn=1-903365-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January and February 1947, a number of prisoners from No. 74 CSDIC were taken to a civilian hospital in [[Rotenburg an der Wümme|Rotenburg]], near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], suffering from [[frostbite]], [[malnutrition]] and a variety of physical injuries. Two of the prisoners subsequently died. British medical and military personnel at the hospital were shocked at the poor condition of the prisoners and complained to their superiors, prompting senior Army officers to commission an investigation by Inspector Thomas Hayward of the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref name="guardian171205" /&gt;

In March 1947, the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament [[Richard Stokes]] visited the camp to perform an apparently ''ad hoc'' inspection as part of a long-running effort on his part to promote the welfare of prisoners of war and other post-war detainees. He told the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that "in cross-examining some of these [prisoners] it may be necessary to indulge in forms of verbal persecution which we do not like, but there is no physical torture, starvation or ill-treatment of that kind." However, he criticised the poor conditions at the camp. The 65 men and four women being held there were mostly in solitary confinement, in unheated cells at temperatures of -10°C; the camp had no coal for heating, so the prisoners had instead been given seven blankets each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=German Prisoners of War |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/mar/24/german-prisoners-of-war |house=House of Commons |date=24 March 1947 |column_start=1026 |column_end=1027 |speaker=Richard Stokes |position=MP for Ipswich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspector Hayward's investigation, which appears to have been concluded after Richard Stokes' visit to No. 74 CSDIC, produced a list of serious allegations of abuse. These were later summarised in a [[Foreign Office]] memo:

{{quotation
 |1=(1) insufficient clothing; (2) intimidation by the guards; (3) mental and physical torture during the interrogations; (4) they were kept in solitary confinement for long periods with no exercise; (5) they were confined to punishment cells, not for any offence, but simply because the interrogator was not satisfied with their answers; (6) in the punishment cells, during the bitter winter, they were deprived of certain articles of clothing, had buckets of cold water thrown into the cell and were forced to scrub the cell floor for long periods, and were assaulted and man-handled; (7) medical attention was grossly inadequate; (8) food was insufficient; (9) discharge of prisoners was unnecessarily delayed; (10) personal property of the prisoners were stolen
 |2=''Camp 020''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
}}

The report caused dismay among British government officials, who recognised the serious damage that the case could do to Britain's international image. The [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank Pakenham]], noted that "we are alleged to have treated internees in a manner reminiscent of the German concentration camps." The junior Foreign Office minister, [[Hector McNeil]], told Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]]: "I doubt if I can put too strongly the parliamentary consequences of publicity. Whenever we have any allegations to make about the political police methods in Eastern European states it will be enough to call out in the House 'Bad Nenndorf', and no reply is left to us."&lt;ref name="guardian171205" /&gt;

The camp's highly secret nature was another complicating factor. The Army cautioned against allowing the Soviets to discover "how we apprehended and treated their agents", not least because it might deter future defectors.&lt;ref name="guardian171205" /&gt; However, the affair was still brought before Army courts-martial, though some of the evidence was heard behind closed doors to ensure that security was safeguarded. The camp was closed down in July 1947.

==Courts-martial==

Four Army officers were indicted for a number of offences against the Army Act. Charges were brought against Lieutenant Colonel [[Robin Stephens]], the commandant of No. 74 CSDIC; Lieutenant [[Richard Oliver Langham]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]]; Captain [[John Stuart Smith]], [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and Captain [[Frank Edmunds]], [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. Stephens was charged on four counts: [[Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline|conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline]], failure in his duty as supervisor of the facility, and two counts of disgraceful conduct of a cruel kind.&lt;ref name="times080648"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court-Martial Of Colonel |date=9 June 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langham and Edmunds were charged with two counts of disgraceful conduct of a cruel kind, though Edmunds' case was abandoned on a technicality before his court-martial began.&lt;ref name="times030348"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Alleged Cruelty To Germans - British Officer Charged |date=3 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, the camp doctor, faced the most serious charges - two counts of [[manslaughter]] and fourteen of professional neglect.&lt;ref name="times090648"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Charges Against R.A.M.C. Officer Conditions In German Camp |date=8 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens, Langham and Smith were court-martialed in three separate proceedings held in Britain and [[Hamburg]] between March and July 1948. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty.

===Langham===

Lt Langham - who was originally a German citizen - was a member of an interrogation team which included Edmunds. He was accused of having mistreated two former members of the SS, [[Horst Mahnke]] and [[Rudolf Oebser-Roeder]], who were suspected of helping to organise acts of terrorism. 
The two prisoners claimed to have been beaten up, tortured with lighted cigarettes, doused in cold water and subjected to threats. Langham denied the claims and cited medical records that showed that Roeder had not made any mention of his alleged mistreatment to the German doctor at the camp. For his part, Roeder claimed that he had not complained because he had thought the doctor was too "timid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Hanover Court-Martial |date=6 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Company Sergeant-Major Samuel Mathers testified that there had been no torture, though he admitted to having "pushed [the prisoners] around for a few minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Trial Of British Officer - Former C.S.M.'s Evidence |date=12 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Edmund Sore told the court-martial that he had been given orders by Mathers to "drive [Roeder] round the cell for about two hours" and Lance-Corporal A.R.S. Hunt testified that the reason given for the treatment was that the two Germans were "part of an organisation which was to start a rising on Hitler's birthday."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Treatment Of Germans Court-Martial Transferred To England |date=23 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langham's defence complained that the prosecution had failed to prove that Langham had anything to do with the "curious things" that had admittedly occurred at Bad Nenndorf. According to his lawyer, there were numerous inconsistencies between the two prisoners' claims and there was no evidence at all of the more extreme "tortures" ever having been carried out. Langham was said to have had no part at all "in the brutality of April 17, 1946, whether he was duty officer at that time or not."

The court-martial accepted Langham's arguments and on 31 March 1948 he was acquitted on both counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lieut. R. O. Langham Acquitted - Not Guilty Of Cruelty To S.S. Men |date=1 April 1948}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Smith===

Capt Smith's court-martial opened on 7 April 1948 in Hamburg. He was accused of having abused nine German detainees during the exceptionally harsh winter of 1946-47, allowing prisoners to be subjected to cruel treatment, including having cold water thrown over them, depriving them of boots and making them continually scrub the cell floors. Two of the nine detainees were said to have died from this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Charges Against R.A.M.C. Officer - Conditions In German Camp |date=8 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 40 witnesses were called by the prosecution and defence. The court-martial heard accounts of physical abuse from a number of prisoners, some of whom sustained serious physical injuries such as frostbite. One of the former interrogators at Bad Nenndorf testified that some of the Army warders at the camp were themselves ex-convicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Bad Nenndorf Court Martial |date=14 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Smith denied any responsibility for the abuse and described the camp as a "bestial hole" which was "full of people who, unknown to him, were being brutally treated.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Army Doctor's Defence |date=29 May 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; He testified that he had been sent one prisoner who was suffering from [[meningitis]] but had been unable to obtain an ambulance to transport him to hospital.

The court-martial dismissed three of the charges of professional neglect against Capt Smith before the conclusion of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Officer Cleared On Three Charges |date=28 May 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found him not guilty of the two counts of manslaughter or six of the eleven counts of professional neglect. However, it found him guilty of five of the neglect charges, and he was sentenced to be dismissed from the service.&lt;!-- note - this is the correct terminology, please don't change it! --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court-Martial Findings |date=17 June 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephens===

The final court-martial was that of Lt Col Stephens, which opened in June 1948. On the first day of proceedings, both counts of disgraceful conduct of a cruel kind were withdrawn, leaving only the counts of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline and failure in his duty as commandant.&lt;ref name="times090648" /&gt;

Stephens was uncompromisingly blunt about the prisoners who had made accusations, declaring that "their motives are invariably foul, most of them are degenerates, most of them come diseased from V.D., many are chronic medical cases ... they are pathological liars and the value of their Christian oath is therefore doubtful." He told the court-martial that he had instituted the same basic regime as had operated at [[Camp 020]], a CSDIC facility in London which he had previously commanded with great success during the war. Prisoners were to be treated firmly: "No chivalry. No gossip. No cigarettes ... Figuratively, a spy in war should be at the point of a bayonet." However, physical coercion was forbidden under any circumstances, as it was seen as ineffective: "Violence is taboo, for not only does it produce answers to please, but it lowers the standard of information."&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (2000), pp.9, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the case was heard behind closed doors due to security concerns. The court-martial concluded on 20 July 1948 with Stephens being found not guilty on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Colonel Cleared At Court-Martial |date=21 July 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure of the camp==

Three months after the closure of the camp at Bad Nenndorf, a new custom-built interrogation centre with cells for 30 men and 10 women was opened at [[Gütersloh]]. Most of the interrogators were said to have served at Bad Nenndorf, causing disquiet in the Government. Foreign Office Minister Frank Pakenham demanded that "drastic methods" should not be employed. However, the Army insisted that the standards applied in British prisons should not be applied to Army interrogation centres in Germany.&lt;ref name="guardian171205" /&gt; According to the German newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]'', the failings exposed at Bad Nenndorf resulted in the conditions of prisoners elsewhere in Germany being improved to the point that they were better treated than the civilian population.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;

==Recent information==

On 17 December 17, 2005, the [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an account of the Bad Nenndorf case, based on recently declassified files.&lt;ref name="guardian171205" /&gt; The report was followed up on January 30, 2006 by the German broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]], based on 800 pages of declassified documents that they received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Kommunistenjagd nach Kriegsende – Briten folterten deutsche Gefangene |trans-title=Communist hunt after the end of the war - British tortured German prisoners |series=Panorama |network=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] |date=20 April 2006 |number=667 |transcript=Transcript |transcript-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030426/http://daserste.ndr.de/container/file/t_cid-2827890_.pdf |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.ndr.de/ndrtv_pages_std/0,3147,OID2247368,00.html |title=Das Verhörlager Bad Nenndorf 1945-47 |trans-title=The interrogation camp at Bad Nenndorf 1945-47 |website=NDR |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094801/http://www3.ndr.de/ndrtv_pages_std/0,3147,OID2247368,00.html |archive-date=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its April 3, 2006 issue, the ''Guardian'' published pictures of the emaciated German prisoners held in Bad Nenndorf, calling it a "cold war torture camp."&lt;ref name="guardian030506"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/03/uk.freedomofinformation |title=The postwar photographs that British authorities tried to keep hidden |first=Ian |last=Cobain |date=3 April 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=3 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guradianalso&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/03/germany.topstories3 |title=Revealed: Victims of UK's cold war torture camp |first=Ian |last=Cobain |date=3 April 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=2 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports caused a brief political controversy in both Britain and Germany, with some commentators drawing explicit parallels with the mistreatment of prisoners in the [[Iraq conflict]] and the [[war on terror]].&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;

On 29 July 2006, [[neo-Nazi]]s held a rally at the site of the former camp. A coalition of opponents organised a rally in protest, among them the [[German Trade Union Confederation|DGB]]'s local chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.region-niedersachsen-mitte.dgb.de/pressemeldungen/pmdb/pressemeldung_single?pmid=127 |title=Naziaufmarsch am 29.07.2006 in Bad Nenndorf - DGB ruft zur Teilnahme an Gegendemonstration auf! |trans-title=Nazi march on 29.07.2006 in Bad Nenndorf - DGB calls to participate in counter-demonstration! |date=21 July 2006 |website=[[German Trade Union Confederation|DGB]] [[Niedersachsen]]-Mitte |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015012/http://www.region-niedersachsen-mitte.dgb.de/pressemeldungen/pmdb/pressemeldung_single?pmid=127 |archive-date=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 July 2006 |title=Rechten die kalte Schulter gezeigt |trans-title=The Right are given the cold shoulder |url=http://www.szlz.de/startseite_artikel,-rechten-die-kalte-schulter-gezeigt-_arid,139286.html |newspaper=Schaumburger Zeitung |location=[[Rinteln]] |language=de |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DGB leaflet objects the attempt to "''revise history''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heisenhof.info/fileadmin/Medien/Downloads/bad_nenndorf_29_7_06.pdf |title=Bad Nenndorf ist bunt |trans-title=Bad Nenndorf is multi-coloured |date=11 July 2006 |website=DGB Niedersachsen-Mitte |language=de |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cahiers du Cinéma''''' ({{IPA-fr|kaje dy sinema}}, ''Notebooks on Cinema'') is a French [[film magazine]] founded in 1951 by [[André Bazin]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]], and [[Joseph-Marie Lo Duca]].&lt;ref name="NYT Itzkoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Macnab"&gt;Macnab, Geoffrey (7 April 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/07/books.guardianreview ''Pretentious, nous?''] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; It developed from the earlier magazine ''Revue du Cinéma'' (''Review of the Cinema'' established in 1928) involving members of two [[Paris]] film clubs—''Objectif 49'' (''Objective 49'') ([[Robert Bresson]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Alexandre Astruc]], among others) and ''Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin'' (''Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter'').

Initially edited by Doniol-Valcroze and, after 1957, by [[Éric Rohmer]] (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its writers [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]], and [[François Truffaut]].&lt;ref name="NYT Itzkoff"/&gt; It is the oldest French-language film magazine in publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ismaël Houdassine|title=Le magazine Séquences célèbre 60 ans de cinéma|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/12/06/magazine-sequences-60-ans-cinema-_n_8735672.html|accessdate=23 October 2016|work=Huffington Post|date=6 December 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The first issue of ''Cahiers'' appeared in April 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Wolfreys|title=Modern European Criticism and Theory: A Critical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BOlBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=5 May 2016|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2449-2|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its head staff, including Bazin, Doniol-Valcroze, Lo Duca, and the various members of what would become the Young Turks, had met and shared their beliefs about film through their involvement in the publication of ''Revue du Cinéma'' from 1946 until its final issue in 1948; ''Cahiers'' was created as a successor to this earlier magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emilie Bickerton|title=A Short History of Cahiers Du Cinéma|year=2009|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-232-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early issues of ''Cahiers'' were small journals of thirty pages which bore minimalist covers, distinctive for their lack of headlines in favor of film stills on a trademark bright yellow background. Each issue contained four or five articles (with at least one piece by Bazin in most issues published while he was still alive),&lt;ref name="bickerton21"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; most of which were reviews of specific films or appreciations of specific directors, supplemented on occasion by longer theoretical essays.&lt;ref name="bickerton15"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first few years of the magazine's publication were dominated by Bazin, who was the ''de facto'' head of the editorial board.&lt;ref name="bickerton15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kehr"&gt;Kehr, David (1 September 2001) [https://www.filmcomment.com/article/cahiers-back-in-the-day ''Cahiers Back In The Day''] Film Comment&lt;/ref&gt; Bazin intended ''Cahiers'' to be a continuation of the intellectual form of criticism that ''Revue'' had printed, which prominently featured his articles advocating for realism as the most valuable quality of cinema. As more issues of ''Cahiers'' were published, however, Bazin found that the Young Turks, a group of young proteges and critics serving as editors underneath him, were beginning to disagree with him in the pages of the magazine.&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt; Godard would voice his disagreement with Bazin as early as 1952, when he challenged Bazin's views on editing in an article for the September issue of ''Cahiers.''&lt;ref name="Godard"&gt;Godard, Jean-Luc (September 1952) ''Defense And Illustration of Classical Construction'' Cahiers du Cinéma &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bordwell|title=On the History of Film Style|year=1997|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0674634299|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the tastes of the Young Turks drifted away from those of Bazin, as members of the group began to write critical appreciations of more commercial American filmmakers such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Howard Hawks]] rather than the canonized French and Italian filmmakers that interested Bazin.&lt;ref name="bickerton21"/&gt;

The Young Turks broke completely with Bazin by 1954, when an article in the January issue by Truffaut attacked what he called ''La qualité française'' ("the French Quality," usually translated as "The Tradition of Quality"), denouncing many critically popular French films of the time as being unimaginative, oversimplified, and even immoral adaptations of literary works.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;Truffaut, François (January 1954) ''A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema'' Cahiers du Cinéma &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt; The article was the manifesto for the ''politique des Auteurs'', the Young Turks' emphasis on the importance of the director in the creation of a film, which [[Andrew Sarris]] later termed the [[auteur theory]], resulting in the re-evaluation of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and directors such as Hitchcock, Hawks, [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Nicholas Ray]], and [[Fritz Lang]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Macnab"/&gt; After the publication of Truffaut's article, Doniol-Valcroze and most of the ''Cahiers'' editors besides Bazin and Lo Duca rallied behind the Young Turks; Lo Duca left ''Cahiers'' a year later,&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt; while Bazin, in failing health, gave editorial control of the magazine to Rohmer and largely left Paris, though he continued to write for the magazine.&lt;ref name="bickerton21"/&gt; Now with control over the magazine's ideological approaches to film, the Young Turks (minus Godard, who had left Paris in 1952, not to return until 1956)&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brody, pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; changed the format of ''Cahiers'' somewhat, frequently conducting interviews with directors deemed "auteurs" and voting on films in a "Council" of ten core critics.&lt;ref name="bickerton22"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Turks came to champion non-American directors as well, writing on the ''[[mise en scène]]'' (the "dominant object of study" at the magazine)&lt;ref name="bickerton28"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; of such filmmakers as [[Jean Renoir]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], many of which Bazin had introduced them to.&lt;ref name="bickerton22"/&gt; 

By the end of the 1950s, many of the remaining editors of ''Cahiers'', however, were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the mere act of writing film criticism. Spurred on by the return of Godard to Paris in 1956 (who in the interim had made [[Une femme coquette|a short film]] himself), many of the Young Turks became interested in making films themselves. Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Doniol-Valcroze, and even Rohmer, who had officially succeeded Doniol-Valcroze as head editor in 1958, began to divide their time between making films and writing about them.&lt;ref name="bickerton32"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The films that these critics made were experimental explorations of various theoretical, artistic, and ideological aspects of the film form, and would, along with the films of young French filmmakers outside the ''Cahiers'' circle, form the basis for the cinematic movement known as the [[French New Wave]].&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrodyNY"&gt;Brody, Richard (20 June 2017) [https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/notes-on-cahiers ''Notes on Cahiers''] The New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Cahiers'' underwent staff changes, as Rohmer hired new editors such as Jean Douchet to fill the roles of those editors who were now making films, while other existing editors, particularly Jacques Rivette, began to write even more for the magazine.&lt;ref name="bickerton38"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the newer critical voices (except for Rivette) largely ignored the films of the New Wave for Hollywood when they were not outright criticizing them, creating friction between much of the directorial side of the Young Turks and the head editor Rohmer. A group of five ''Cahiers'' editors, including Godard and Doniol-Valcroze and led by Rivette, urged Rohmer to refocus the magazine's content on newer films such as their own. When he refused, the "gang of five" forced Rohmer out and installed Rivette as his replacement. &lt;ref name="bickerton41"&gt;Bickerton 2009, p. 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Rivette, through his replacement of Rohmer as editor in 1963, shifted political and social concerns farther to the left, and began a trend in the magazine of paying more attention to non-Hollywood films. The style of the journal moved through literary modernism in the early 1960s to radicalism and [[dialectical materialism]] by 1970. Moreover, during the mid-1970s the magazine was run by a [[Maoist]] editorial collective. In the mid-1970s, a review of the American film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' marked the magazine's return to more commercial perspectives, and an editorial turnover: ([[Serge Daney]], Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, and Charles Tesson). It led to the rehabilitation of some of the old ''Cahiers'' favourites, as well as some new film makers like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Raoul Ruiz]], [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], [[Youssef Chahine]], and [[Maurice Pialat]]. Recent writers have included Daney, [[André Téchiné]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Olivier Assayas]], Danièle Dubroux, and Serge Le Péron.

In 1998, the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing ''Cahiers'') was acquired by the press group ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Ben (10 February 2009) [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/10/le-monde-sells-cahiers-du-cinema "''Le Monde'' sells influential cinema magazine ''Cahiers du Cinéma''"] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally losing money, the magazine attempted a make-over in 1999 to gain new readers, leading to a first split among writers and resulting in a magazine addressing all visual arts in a [[post-modernism|post-modernist]] approach. This version of the magazine printed ill-received opinion pieces on [[reality TV]] or [[video game]]s that confused the traditional readership of the magazine.&lt;ref name="NYT Itzkoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Macnab" /&gt;

''Le Monde'' took full editorial control of the magazine in 2003, appointing [[Jean-Michel Frodon]] as editor-in-chief. In February 2009, ''Cahiers'' was acquired from ''Le Monde'' by Richard Schlagman, also owner of [[Phaidon Press]], a worldwide publishing group which specialises in books on the visual arts.&lt;ref name="NYT Itzkoff"/&gt; In July 2009, Stéphane Delorme and Jean-Philippe Tessé were promoted respectively to the positions of editor-in-chief and deputy chief editor.

This is a comparison of binary [[executable]] [[file format]]s which, once loaded by a suitable executable [[Loader (computing)|loader]], can be directly executed by the CPU rather than become interpreted by software. In addition to the binary application code, the executables may contain headers and tables with relocation and fixup information as well as various kinds of meta data. Among those formats listed, the ones in most common use are [[Portable Executable|PE]] (on [[Microsoft Windows]]), [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] (on [[Linux]] and most other versions of [[Unix]]), [[Mach-O]] (on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]]) and [[DOS MZ executable|MZ]] (on [[DOS]]).

== Notes ==
{{notelist|refs=
&lt;ref name=metadata&gt;
:Metadata is casually used to describe the controlling data used in software architectures that are more abstract or configurable. Most executable file formats include what may be termed "metadata" that specifies certain, usually configurable, behavioral [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] characteristics. However, it is difficult if not impossible to precisely distinguish program "metadata" from general aspects of [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program computing architecture]]; if the machine reads it and acts upon it, it is a computational [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]], and the prefix "meta" has little significance.
:In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the [[Class (file format)|class file format]] contains metadata used by the [[Java compiler]] and the [[Java virtual machine]] to [[dynamic linking|dynamically link]] [[class (computer science)|classes]] and to support [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]]. The [[Java Platform, Standard Edition]] since J2SE 5.0 has included a [[metadata facility for Java|metadata facility]] to allow additional annotations that are used by [[development tool]]s.
:In [[MS-DOS]], the [[COM file]] format does ''not'' normally include metadata, while the [[EXE]] file and Windows [[Portable Executable|PE]] formats do. These metadata can include the company that published the program, the date the program was created, the version number and more.
:In the [[.NET Framework]] executable format, extra metadata is included to allow [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] at runtime.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:History of Cambria 1811 cover.jpg|thumb|David Powel's 1584 ''Historie of Cambria'' (reprint edition 1811) contained material derived from Humphrey Llwyd's then-unpublished 1559 manuscript, ''Cronica Walliae''.]]

''''' Cronica Walliae ''''' (full title: ''Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad annum 1294'') is a manuscript of chronological history by [[Humphrey Llwyd]] written in 1559. Llwyd translated versions of a medieval text about [[Wales]]' history, ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'', from [[Middle Welsh|Welsh]] and [[Medieval Latin]] into [[Early Modern English|English]]. He also added historical material from [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Nicholas Trivet]], as well as from other well known historians.{{sfn|Stephens|1986|p=143}} It is the first history of Wales written in English and contains material about ancient rulers, with some material based on legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | author=Garrett A. Sullivan, Jr. and Alan Stewart , (eds.) | year=2012 | isbn=9781405194495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llwyd's work gives a history description of Wales that was originally written in the early part of the sixteenth century by [[John Prise|Sir John Prise]] of [[Brecknockshire]], Wales.{{sfn|Stephens|1986|p=143}}

== History ==

This manuscript is Llwyd's earliest and largest work.{{sfn|Marx|2008|page=23}}{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|page=3}} It is his only surviving work, and describes in detail the lives of Welsh nobility from [[Cadwaladr Fendigaid]] to [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] and covers from the mid 7th century to the 14th century.{{sfn|Marx|2008|page=23}}&lt;ref name=WBC&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.gwales.com/goto/biblio/en/9780708316382/ |title= Bibliographical Information – Cronica Walliae by Humphrey Llwyd |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2009 |website= gwales.com |publisher=  Welsh Books Council |accessdate=2014-12-01}} &lt;/ref&gt; Llwyd says his main source was 'the Welsh Cronicle' implicating [[Caradoc of Llancarfan]] of the 12th century.{{sfn|Cull|2014|p=34}}{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=16}} His work is based on three{{sfn|Stephens|1986|p=143}} (possibly four{{sfn|Thornton|2003|page=10}}) different versions of the Chronicle of Caradoc{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=17}} that generally became known as ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' or "The Brut of the Princes"{{sfn|Llwyd  |Schwyzer|Caradoc|2011|pages=15–16}}(also known as "The Chronicle of the Princes").{{sfn|Lewis|2008|p=4}}{{sfn|Rigby|2008|p=310}}{{sfn|Williams|1860}} Llwyd relied heavily on material from the writings of [[Matthew Paris]] as he is talked about more than any other historian that he used for reference.{{efn-ua|However, the many references already made to Matthew Paris are a reminder that he is the chronicler mentioned most frequently by Llwyd, and a close reading of the 'Cronica Walliae' confirms its many similarities to the work of that widely influential writer.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|page=46}}}} Lywyd used much historical material from Matthew Paris's ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' and ''Historia Anglorum''.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pages=52–55}} According to C.P. Lewis, Llwyd's aim was to show the Welsh had their own history and were an ancient people descended from the [[Troy|Trojans]] (an idea put forth in the works of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]).{{sfn|Lewis|2008|page=4}} He summed up his work as the ''perfecte discription of the Countrey as his was in olde tyme and as his is at these dayes'' to give the idea that it was a historical work.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|page=3}} 

In 1573, [[David Powel]] took over the task of preparing Llwyd's manuscript for publication, upon which [[John Dee]] had been working before leaving England.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Powel expanded Llwyd's work in its scope and detail, with the help of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] providing access to some further documents, making his own contributions clear by typographical distinctions.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; The resulting publication in 1584, ''The Historie of Cambria, now called Wales'', was the first printed history of Wales.{{sfn|Lewis|2008|p=4}}&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22643 | title=Powel, David (1549x52–1598) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (online edition, subscription access) | date=May 2007 | last=Fritze | first=Ronald H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PowelBio&gt; {{cite web |url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-POWE-DAV-1540.html |title= POWEL, DAVID (1552? – 1598) |last1=Jenkins |first1= Robert Thomas |last2= |first2= |date=2009 |publisher=[[The National Library of Wales]] |work=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]] |accessdate=2014-12-01}} &lt;/ref&gt; The work remained an important source for medieval Welsh history for several centuries thereafter.

For centuries, Llwyd's original work had been known to scholars only from five surviving manuscripts. In 2002, [[University of Wales Press]] published a version of the original manuscript with the title ''Cronica Walliae''. It was prepared mainly by Professor Ieuan M. Williams, and established from the surviving manuscripts.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=vii}} The book ''Cronica Walliae'' (2002) by the University of Wales was published by their History and Law Committee consisting of several scholars.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=i–ix}}

== Description ==
The 2002 commentary book ''Cronica Walliae'' by the University of Wales says the full Latin title of ''Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad annum 1294'' in English translates approximately as Chronicle of Wales as a sequential chronological history record of events of Wales from [[Cadwaladr|Prince Cadwalader]] to the year 1294.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|page=18}} It says there are five known manuscript copies of Llwyd's work, none in his personal handwriting. 

*''MS 1 BL, Cotton Caligula MS Avi''
:To historians that wrote on Llwyd this was the best known text. It is preceded by a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] done by [[Robert Cotton (died 1559)|Sir Robert Cotton]], ''Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad(num) 1294 Humfredo Floid authore'' with gave the title "Cronica Walliae" that Llwd's text is known by.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=4}}

It has a treatise called "Kyfrinach y Beirdd" and the note "John ap D'd ap R'c toke possetion upon theyrsdaye being the XXjth of Majj the XV yere of the Raying of our queen Elizabeth 1573 in the hande of Ieuan ap Dav' ap Jankyn thys being wyttenessed Gryffythe mechen, John ap Owen, Gryffyth ap holl, Robert ap John Rondell, Thomas Hirllard." The manuscript is complete except for a small part related to Alfred.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=5}}
*''MS 5 NLW 23202 B'' 
:This manuscript was purchased from the [[Thomas Fairfax]] Collection by the [[National Library of Wales]] in 1993. It is preceded by a colophon text later than the manuscript itself. It has an intricate signature with text ''by Powell the original Autograph.'' The signature says "Tho. Powell." There are parts missing, deliberately left out by the copyist, that especially relate to events outside Wales. There are also parts left out related to the church and the papacy. Missing too are sections related to [[Polydore Vergil]] and other Welsh links. Because of the missing parts it is not relied on for a Llwyd reference source.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=6}}

== Commentary ==
The commentary book shows Llwyd starting his chronology of sequential records of Wales with [[Cadwaladr|Prince Cadwaladr]] of the seventh century. The first thing he explains is that he is the last British king to rule Wales, descending from the ''noble race'' of [[Troy|Trojans]]. He explains the devastating plagues that happened during his reign. He explains that the Britons had been ruled by different kings and princes for 1817 years up to Cadwaladr. Llwyd says Cadwaladr went to Rome for 5 years to study different philosophers and that he died in 688 A.D.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=63}} He then explains in "Yvor the sonne of Alan, Ina de Stirpe regia filius Kenredi sorori regis Cadwaladri" the next sequence of events that while he was in Rome ''according to the comanndement received by the angell'', he left his son [[Idwal Iwrch]], his sister and his people with ''Alan, Kinge of litle Bryttayn.''{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=82–83}} Llwyd then explains that the son of Idwal Iwrch [[Rhodri Molwynog]] became the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. {{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} He explains in "Rodryke the sonne of Idwall the sonne of Cadwalader" that Rhodri began his reign in the year 720.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} Also in this section he details the [[Battle of Pencon]] and the [[Battle of Hehil]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} Llwyd also talks about the [[Battle of Carno Mountain]] in 728 – see [[List of Anglo-Welsh Wars#Eighth Century|eighth-century wars]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} In this section he also talks about the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' being finished in 731 that was written by ''a great clercke that wroote manye woorkes'' named [[Bede]] from [[Monkwearmouth]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} He says the priest Bede died in 733 A.D.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} He then talks about [[Swæfberht of Essex]] and [[Saelred of Essex]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=84}} He also describes [[Battle Edge]] where [[Æthelbald of Mercia|King Æthelbald]] of [[Mercia]] was defeated by [[Cuthred of Wessex|King Cuthred]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=84–5}} Llwyd then talks about King [[Rhodri Molwynog]] and that he died in 754 and left his son [[Cynan Dindaethwy]] to rule afterwards.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=84–5}} 

Llwyd then goes into the next section "Kynan Tindaethwy sonne to Rodryck" beginning with the year 755. He details the [[Battle of Cenn Fabrat]] (near Seefin Mountain, Co. Limerick) where ''Dyfynwal the sonne of Teudwr'' was slain – see [[Cathussach mac Eterscélai]]. Llwyd records that [[Æthelbald of Mercia]] died in the year 757. He explains then that [[Beornred of Mercia]] succeed him. He then shows the next important event in 758 when [[Elfodd]], a Welsh bishop ''both godly and learned'' induced the standard for determining the date of [[Easter]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=85}} Llwyd then details in his ''historie'' the events of the year 763. He begins with [[Offa of Mercia]] becoming king and [[Heaberht of Kent]] made king of West Saxons. He later explains the [[Battle of Otford (776)|Battle of Otford]] that took place in 776. Llwyd then gives specifics for [[Offa's Dyke|the well known ditch]] Offa had built. He describes it as ''a great dyche large and deepe'' made between [[Mercia]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] from sea to sea. In the sixteenth century it was referred to as ''Clawdh Offa'' and ''Offas Diche''. The reason he built the ditch was for protection to defend ''his country frome the incoursions of the Welshemen.''{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} 

Llwyd then spells out the next important event as being ''in the year of our Lord 800'' when [[Egbert of Wessex]] (''Egbrutus'') was made king and the following year [[Coenwulf of Mercia]] (''Kenewlf'') was made king.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} He says the next important event of history was when [[Cadell ap Brochfael]], the king of Powys, died in 808 and his son [[Cyngen ap Cadell]] became the new king.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} Llwyd notes the next interesting event was a [[solar eclipse]] on Christmas Day in 810 and at the same time there was an unusually large death rate of cattle in Wales.{{efn-ua|The next yearc after died Elbodius Archbishop of Northwales, before whose 810 death, the sunne was sore eclipsed. In the yeare 810 was the moone eclipsed upon Christmas daie. The same yeare, S. Dauids was burnt by the West Saxons. There was also a generall morreine and death of cattell throughout all Wales. The next yeare {{Not a typo|in|suing}} died Owen the sonne of Meredyth, the sonne of Tewdos.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}}}} He notes also that this was the year that [[St David's Cathedral]] was ''bernt by the West Saxons.''{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} Llwyd then records the death of [[Owain ap Maredudd (Dyfed)]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} He then shows as the next dramatic event in 812 when [[Deganwy Castle]] was struck by lightning and destroyed.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=86}} 

Llwyd records as events under the section "Blethyn ap Kynvyn and Meredith ap Owen" that in 1073 [[Bleddyn ap Cynfyn#Reign|Bleddyn ap Cynfyn]] was '' traytorouselye'' and ''cowardely'' murdered by [[Rhys ab Owain]] after he reigned Wales for 13 years.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=122}} Under the section "Griffith the sonne of Kynan" Llwyd records as historical events how peacefully after the death of [[Trahaearn ap Caradog]] in 1081 [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] ruled Northwales and [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]] ruled Southwales.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=124}} He records the history that led up to this time. One of the events he describes is the murder of [[William Walcher]] in 1080.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=124}} He describes in detail how the Northumbrians [[William Walcher#Career|killed him and his 100 men]] that accompanied him.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=124}} Later in this section Llwyd records the historical event of 1125 when [[Cadwallon ap Gruffydd]] killed his maternal uncles [[Cadwallon ap Gruffydd#Mid life|to capture]] the district [[Dyffryn Clwyd]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=125}}

Under the section "Owen Gwyneth sonne to Griffith ap Kynan" Llwyd records as sequential historical events how the sons of [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] divided up the kingdoms of Wales according to custom after his death in 1137 A.D.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=151}} Llwyd explains here how [[Owain Gwynedd]] is the first to be styled [[Prince of Wales]]" starting in 1137 and that the name "king" is no longer used in British records when referring to the ruler of Wales.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=151}}

Llwyd then describes in his recordings that in the year 1146 [[Cadwallon ap Madog#Prince of Maelienydd|Cadwallon ap Madog]] captured his younger brother Einion Clud and turned him over to King [[Owain Gwynedd]], who in turn handed him over to Henry II to be imprisoned at [[Winchester]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=162}} He then explains how Madog soon escapes and goes back to Wales.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=162}} Llwyd reports also in this section the information that in 1160 [[Madog ap Maredudd]] died.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=161}} 

Llwyd then chronicles that in 1165 [[Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd]] destroyed [[Tegeingl]], which at the time belonged to King Henry, and he took all the people and their possessions to the [[Vale of Clwyd|Valley of Clwyd]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=164}} He then describes the 1169 death of [[Owain Gwynedd]] after controlling north Wales for 32 years.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=167}} The next sequence of events he details gives an accounting of the turmoil this caused among his many children over the inheritance.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=167}} He follows this up in the next section of the events that happened in the 1170s.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=167–172}}

In the section "David the sonne of Owen Gwynedh" Llwyd wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;After the death of Owen his sonnes fill at debade who shulde enherite after him. For the eldest sonne borne in matrimonye Edward or Erwerth Drwyndwn was counted unmeete for his maime upon his face. And Howell who toke upon him all the rulle was a base sonne begoten upon an Irishwoman. Therefore David gathered all the power he coulde, and came against Howell, and fought with him and slewe him, and afterward enjoyed quietly the whole lande of Northwales, {{Not a typo|unt|ill}} his brother Iewerth or Edwards sonne came to age as shall hereafter appeare. And at this tyme an other of Owen Gwynedhs sonnes, named Madocke, lefte the lande in contention betwixt his bretherne, and prepared certaine shippes, with men [and] munition, and sought adventures by the seas. And sayled west levinge the cost of Irelande [so far] north that he came to a lande unknownen, where he sawe many strange things. And this lande most needes bee some parte of that lande the which the Hispaniardes affirme them selves to be the first finders, sith Hannos tyme. For by reason and order of cosmographie this lande to which Madoc came to, most needs bee somme part of Nova Hispania, or Florida. And so hit was by Britons longe afore discovered before eyther Colonus or Americus lead any Hispaniardes thyther.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pp=167–8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peter Roberts noted that according to Dr John Dee "the Tudors had inherited a historic claim to the newfound lands in the west, first through King Arthur and then through Prince Madoc. It was Humphrey Lhuyd who, in his ‘Cronica Walliae’ (c. 1559), first publicised the legend that the Welsh prince Madog ab Owain Gwynedd (fl. 1170) had sailed across the Atlantic and discovered America."{{sfn|Bradshaw|Roberts|2003|page=29}} A return trip to Wales by Madoc and a second trip with a number of ships are additionally detailed by Llwyd.{{efn-ua|And after he had returned home and declared the pleasant and frutefull countreys that he had seene without inhabitants, and upon the countrarye parte what barreyne and wilde grounde his bretherne nevewes did murther one an other for, he prepared a number of shippes, and gote with him suche men and women as were desirouse to lyve in quietness. And taking his leave of his frendes, toke his journey thytherwarde againe wherefore hit is to be presupposed that he and his people enhabited parte of those countreys. And hit appeareth by Francys Loues that in Acujarniland yucutan, and other places, the people honoured the crosse, and that Christians had bene there before the comminge of the Hispaniardes, and because his people were not manye they followed the maners of the lande they came unto, and used the language they founde there.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=168}}}}{{sfn|Owen|1885|pp=546–560}} 

Llwyd describes historical events for the year 1170 saying, ''But to my hystorie, about the same time''{{efn-ua|But to my hystorie, about the same time,{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|page=168}}}} {{mdash}}''e.g.'', the prearranged marriage of [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile#Queenship|Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile]], to King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile#Marriage and Foreign Relations|Alfonso VIII of Castile]]; [[Owain Cyfeiliog]]'s land grant for the founding of the abbey of [[Strata Marcella]]; [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke#The invasion of Leinster|Richard Strongbow]]'s taking of the towns of [[Dublin]] and [[History of Waterford#Anglo Norman invasion and medieval Waterford|Waterford]] with the [[Diarmait Mac Murchada#Exile and return|King of Leinster]] (and promised marriage to [[Aoife MacMurrough#Marriage and rights|his daughter]]); and Prince [[Rhys ap Gruffydd#Welsh uprising (1164–1170)|Rhys ap Gruffydd]]'s payments to [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] of 300 horses and 4,000 cattle and the 7 October 1170 meeting with King Henry.{{efn-ua|Elynor the Kings doughter was maryed to Alfonce, Kinge of Castell.

And at the end of this yere was [[Thomas Becket]] (Archebishop of Canterburye) slayne. And the yere ensuing, Rhesrince of Southwales came with a great power to Powis, and subdued Owen Keveliog the lorde therof, and toke pledges of him and returned home with muche honor. And the Kinge called his nobles to consulte aboute the enterprise of Ireland, which had bene before determined to bee taken in hand, and to his consultaciouns came messingers from Richard Strangbowe, and Earle of Strigill, and marshall of Englande, to delyver to the Kinges hands the citie of Develyn and the towne of Waterforde, with such other townes as he had by the right of his wife. Wherupon the Kinge restored to him againe his lands in England and Normandy, and made him Steewarde of Irelande, and so conclusion was taken for the Kinges viage to Ireland. And thereupon the Lord Rhes came to the Kinge, and the Kinge received him to his peace, and confirmed him all that he had and therefore Rhes paid the Kinge 300 horses and 4000 oxen, and gave him 14 pledges.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|pages=168–9}}}} Llwyd then explains the November 1170 conspiracy to kill Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]] which happened then right after Christmas of the same year.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=169}} He names [[William de Tracy]], [[Richard le Breton]], and  [[Reginald Fitzurse#Assassination of Becket|Reginald Fitzurse]] as three of the four knights that did the murder.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=170}}

Llwyd then gives the chronological historical events going from 1171 and going into 1172. He records the events of King Henry II visiting [[Laugharne#History|Laugharne]] in 1172 on his return from Ireland and made peace with Prince Rhys.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=170}} He then describes the [[Laugharne#Laugharne Charter|Laugharne Charter]] that was made between them at this time.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=170}} Llwyd then records the ''traytorousely'' and ''cowardly'' 1174 murder of [[Iorwerth Drwyndwn]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=170}} 
He then gives as a summary how Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd in the same year imprisons his brother Rhodri and puts him in shackles to take away his inherited lands.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=172}} Llwyd then states as the next sequence of events how in 1175 Howell, son of Iorwerth, takes Owen Penkarn (his maternal uncle) prisoner, pokes out his eyes and castrates him.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=171}} He references this back to the history records of Matthew Paris.{{sfn|Lhwyd|Powell|1811|page=170}} Llwyd then explains that in 1176 [[William II of Sicily]] married [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan the daughter of King Henry II]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=174}} 

Llwyd then notes the records that in 1179 [[King Henry II of England]] bought the [[County of La Marche]] in France for ''6000 of silver'' and put [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent]] in charge of it.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=174}} Llwyd's manuscript contains a report regarding an alleged 1179 discovery at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] at the [[Avalon#Connection to Glastonbury|island of Avalon]] (a/k/a Island of Apples) of the burial place of [[King Arthur]] and his wife. He describes it as located fifteen feet down in the ground in an elder [[treetrunk coffin]] with a cross of lead. It is referenced to Matthew Paris as being recorded about 10 years after the discovery. The inscription on the cross was recorded to be

:::Here lies buried the renowned King Arthur on the island of Avalon – English translation from the Latin. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

Llwyd details the bones found as '' mervelouse biggenesse '' and the probable cause of Arthur's death (a hard blow to the head).{{efn-ua|The bones were of a mervelouse biggenesse, and in the scule were 10 wounds, of which one was great and seamed to bee his deathes wounde.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=174}}}} He further describes the queen's hair as being blonde. He records that clues to King Arthur's burial location were found because of a poem of a [[bard]] that [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] heard at [[Pembroke Castle]].{{efn-ua|This yeare the bones of noble king Arthur and Gwenhouar his wife were found in the He of Avalon (Matt.Paris), without the Abbie of Glastenburie, fifteene foote within the earth, in a hollow elder tree, and ouer the bones was a stone and a crosse of lead, with a Ran. Cest. writing turned towards the stone, wherein were ingrauen these words: "Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia." The bones were of maruelous bignes, and in the scull were ten wounds, of which ten yeares, after this one was great, and seemed to be his deaths wound: the Queenes haire was to the time, sight faire and yellowe, but assoone as it was touched it fell to ashes. This graue was found by meanes of a Bardh or Poet, whom the king heard at Penbrooke declare in a song the worthie actes of that noble prince, and the place of his buriall. {{sfn|Lhwyd|Powell|1811|page=173}}}} 

Llwyd then in a chronological sequence shows the year 1182 as that when [[Henry the Lion|Henry duke of Saxony]] was exiled from Germany and stayed with [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]], his father-in-law, in [[Normandy]]. In 1184 is born a son, later to be called [[William of Winchester, Lord of Luneburg]]. He also lists 1183 as the year [[Henry the Young King|Henry the young King]] died.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} Llwyd then tells of the murder of [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath#Death, aftermath and legacy|Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath]] in 1186 and [[John, King of England|Prince John]] is sent over to Ireland to take possession of his lands and returns at Christmas.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} The year 1186 is also the time Llwyd lists as when [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]] dies, leaving behind a daughter and a wife pregnant with the future [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} He references these 1180s events back to the historian Matthew Paris.{{sfn|Lhwyd|Powell|1811|page=174}}

Llwyd then talks about the year 1187 as being the time when [[Owain Brogyntyn]] was murdered at [[Carreg Cennen Castle]]. This same year Llwyd shows of when [[Maelgwn ap Rhys]] for the first time appears in the historical record bringing his power against [[Tenby#History|Tenby]] and by brute force took the town burning it down.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} He then shows the next important time as 1189, being the time when [[Henry II of England]] died.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} He explains then his son [[Richard I of England|Richard]] becomes King of England.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=175}} This same year Llwyd explains as being when [[The Lord Rhys#Final campaigns (1189–1196)|Rhys ap Gruffydd]] captured the castles of St. Clear's, [[Laugharne Castle|Laugharne]], and [[Llansteffan Castle|Llansteffan]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=176}} He further explains that this is when Lord Rhys' [[Maelgwn ap Rhys|son Maelgwn]] is taken prisoner.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=176}}
Llwyd goes on to say this is when [[Richard I of England#King and Crusader|Richard I of England]] was officially made Bishop of Durham and [[Duke of Normandy]].{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=176}} Llwyd then points out that Richard was captured in 1192 near [[Vienna]] by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], who turns him over to [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry the Emperor]] that asked for a 20,000 mark ransom.{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=177}}

Llwyd then writes about what historian [[Nicholas Trivet]] recorded for the year 1270. He talks about [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] and Gruffudd ap Madog (1236–70) Lord of Bromfield. He then ends his manuscript in 1295 with the history of [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] and the [[Battle of Maes Moydog]]. He claims then that there was nothing worthy done in Wales after this that otherwise could not "bee redde in the Englishe Cronicle".{{sfn|Llwyd|2002|p=7}}

'''David Mirvish''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|OOnt}} (born August 29, 1944) is a Canadian art collector, art dealer, theatre producer, real estate developer and son of the late [[Toronto]] discount department store owner "Honest" [[Ed Mirvish]] and artist Anne Lazar Macklin.

==Life and career==
Mirvish was born in Toronto, [[Ontario]]. He owns and operates the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]], the [[Princess of Wales Theatre]], the [[Ed Mirvish Theatre]] and the [[Panasonic Theatre]], all in Toronto. From 2002 to 2005, he was on the Board of Trustees of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].

From 1963 through 1975, Mirvish operated a contemporary art gallery—the [[David Mirvish Gallery]]—specialising in the American [[abstract art|abstract]] painters of the 1960s and 1970s known as the [[Color Field]] school.&lt;ref name=york&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/accolade/about/bios/davidmirvish.htm David Mirvish biography]"York University", accessed December 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He closed the gallery in 1975, but continues to buy and sell privately and to lend works to museums for exhibition.

==Mirvish Productions==

===Canadian theatre===
In 1987, he took over direction of his father's 1497-seat Toronto theatre, the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]]. For most of the theatre's history, it had functioned as a road house—a temporary venue for touring productions. In 1987, Mirvish founded the company [[Mirvish Productions]] for the purpose of producing and staging original works for the Royal Alexandra and, later, his new [[Princess of Wales Theatre]] (opened in 1993).&lt;ref name=york/&gt;

Mirvish and Mirvish Productions enjoyed notable successes in this new venture as with the Canadian stagings of such musicals as ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1989–1990), ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1993–1995), ''[[Crazy For You (musical)|Crazy for You]]'' (1994–1995), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1997–1998), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (2000–2004), ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (musical)|The Sound of Music]]'' (opened October 2008). They also, however, endured losses with their sit-down productions of the large-scale musicals ''[[Tommy (rock opera)#1993 stage version|Tommy]]'' (1995), ''[[Jane Eyre (musical)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1996–1997),  ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' (2003–2004), ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' (2004).

In 2005, he also joined in partnership with British theatre producer [[Kevin Wallace]], American film producer [[Saul Zaentz]] and Canadian concert promoter [[Michael Cohl]] to produce a stage musical adaptation of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings]]. This production opened at the Princess of Wales Theatre in March 2006. Because of poor reviews and slow sales the show closed early. On June 28, 2006, Mirvish announced that Sept. 3, 2006 would mark the show's closing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_1591.aspx "Lord Of The Rings Stage Production To Close in September",]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''City News'', June 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would be unable to fully repay its investors. With an estimated capitalisation of $28&amp;nbsp;million, ''The Lord of the Rings'' had been advertised as the most expensive stage production in North American history.

===The Old Vic===
{{main|The Old Vic}}
Mirvish also operated the [[London, England]], theatre the [[Old Vic]] (purchased and renovated by his father in 1982) from 1987 through 1998. In 1987, he installed [[Jonathan Miller]] as artistic director of The Old Vic and enjoyed a string of outstanding critical successes—including an [[Olivier Award]] for a production of the musical ''Candide'', but, unfortunately, three straight years of financial loss. In 1990,  Mirvish terminated  Miller's contract over budget issues, earning much negative criticism in the British press.

In 1997, Mirvish appointed [[Peter Hall (director)|Sir Peter Hall]] as artistic director of the Old Vic and, again, enjoyed critical acclaim with such productions as ''[[The Master Builder]]'' with [[Alan Bates]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' with [[Ben Kingsley]], but continuing financial loss. Within a year of the appointment, Mirvish terminated Hall's contract—again to much negative comment in the press—and put the Old Vic up for sale. The theatre was subsequently (1998) purchased by a theatres trust, ''The Old Vic Theatre Trust''.&lt;ref&gt;McGillivray, Peter.[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4586289-1.html "London's 180- Year -Old Vic Saved by Trust",]''AllBusiness'', July 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate==
In 2000, Mirvish began a new business venture as a real estate developer and began construction of a large [[condominium]] complex in downtown Toronto, known as ''One King West''. The building opened for occupancy in 2005.

In March 2008 Mirvish announced the acquisition of the Panasonic and Canon Theatres in Toronto from Key Brand Entertainment, which had itself purchased the theatres from Live Nation in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Brieger, Peter.[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2008/05/07/mirvish-to-buy-two-downtown-theatres.aspx "Mirvish to buy two downtown theatres"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Toronto ''National Post'', May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirvish had been operating the Canon Theatre under a 15-year lease signed in 2001 with Live Nation which gave him control over all bookings and management of the Canon. Mirvish acquired the theatre pursuant to a right of first offer contained in the same lease agreement. The purchase and sale triggered a lawsuit from rival Canadian presenter, [[Aubrey Dan]], who had invested in Key Brand on the alleged promise that he would become manager of the Canon theatre. Dan sued both Mirvish and his own company, Key Brand, in an action which is still pending as of December 2008. The Canon was renamed The Ed Mirvish Theatre in honour of David Mirvish's late father on December 6, 2011.

In August 2010, Mirvish announced that he would provide a 9,765 square foot space to [[Theatre Museum Canada]], thus providing the largely online museum with its first permanent space for exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Martin|title=Mirvish Offers Home to Theatre Museum|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/854662--mirvish-offers-a-home-to-theatre-museum|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=August 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902201902/http://www.thestar.com/article/854662--mirvish-offers-a-home-to-theatre-museum|archive-date=2010-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2012, David Mirvish announced [[Mirvish+Gehry|a partnership]] with renowned architect [[Frank Gehry]] to redevelop his family's considerable real estate holdings on [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] West in Toronto. The proposed project includes three distinct tall buildings, called by Mirvish as "sculptures that people would live in," and a pedestal that would also house a new gallery devoted to Mirvish's extensive collection of abstract expressionist art and a new campus for the [[OCAD University]]. Should the project receive municipal zoning approval, it would be that the buildings currently on the site (four low-rise industrial and warehouse buildings and the Princess of Wales Theatre) would be demolished. The estimated time until completion is 10 years.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/10/06/mirvish_and_gehry_partnership_will_transform_toronto_hume.html]''Toronto Star'', Oct. 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial technology ==
In 2018, David became the largest equity investor in the [[Series A round|Series A]] financing of Toronto-based [[financial technology]] company, [https://www.fundthrough.com/ FundThrough].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/small-business/growth/article-arts-impresario-david-mirvish-jumps-into-fintech-with-investment-in/|title=Arts impresario David Mirvish jumps into fintech with investment in small-business lender FundThrough|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirvish contributed $3.2 million of the total $34 million that was raised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This investment was a departure from Mirvish's usual investments in art, theatre, and real estate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he cited a familiarity with FundThrough's business model, which provides businesses a cash advance on the value of their [[Invoice|invoices]], as being the impetus for his decision to invest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Mirvish was made a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1995, and in 2001, the [[Order of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&amp;TypeID=orc&amp;id=3415 "Order of Canada"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Governor General of Canada, accessed December 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he received an honorary degree from the [[University of Toronto]].

On February 13, 2012, David Mirvish was named Chancellor of the [[University of Guelph]].

'''''Fumifugium''', or, The inconveniencie of the aer and smoak of London dissipated together with some remedies humbly proposed by J.E. esq. to His Sacred Majestie, and to the Parliament now assembled'' is a pamphlet published in [[London]], 1661 (see [[1661 in literature]]), by [[John Evelyn]]. It is one of the earliest known works on [[air pollution]] and is broken down into three parts which explain the problem, a proposed solution, and a way of improvement upon the air in London. The letter was specifically addressed to King [[Charles II of England]] and discussed problems with the capital's air pollution dating back to medieval times.&lt;ref name=Perspectives&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarah|first=Staniforth|title=Historical Perspectives on Preventive Conservation|date=2013|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|isbn=9781606061428|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=t35yp4G8E2gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=fumifugium&amp;ots=QjRAw6kYrg&amp;sig=SeDGRQDZXvK9m8SbyzLbMnbhK-c#v=onepage&amp;q=fumifugium&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evelyn refers to Greek philosophers, who once believed that air was the principle of the earth and primary substance of the soul up until the time that air pollution began to cause ill health.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt;

[[File:John Evelyn's Fumifugium, Title Page.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of John Evelyn's ''Fumifugium'']]

Evelyn was appointed to the newly formed [[Royal Society]], and both Society and pamphlet are celebrated in the 1663
"[[s:Ballad of Gresham College|Ballad of Gresham College]]". Stanza 23 (given here in modern English) describes how Evelyn
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] shows that 'tis the [[coal#Etymology and folklore|sea-coal]] smoke&lt;br&gt; 
That always London does environ, &lt;br&gt;
Which does our lungs and spirits choke, &lt;br&gt;
Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron. &lt;br&gt;
Let none at ''Fumifuge'' be scoffing &lt;br&gt;
Who heard at Church our Sunday's coughing.&lt;ref name=Evelyn&gt;{{cite book|last=Evelyn|first=John|title=Fumifugium|date=1661|publisher=His Majesties' Command|location=London, England|url=https://archive.org/details/fumifugium00eveluoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sea-coal to which Evelyn referred was appropriately named because it came by sea from Newcastle. When burned, it gave off a terrible smell because of high amounts of sulfur in its composition.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt; When burned the sea coal released [[sulfur dioxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[soot]], and [[particulates]] of organic matter into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Mark|title=Air Pollution and Global Warming: History, Science, and Solutions|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=32 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY|isbn=9781107691155|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UeGlmU2F8_8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=sea+coal+burning+in+London&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MHQm8JdcXl&amp;sig=ZaJJkKLFSuUBhQC8jChIwt5Ty34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=36tOU_fcL421yASSlAE&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sea%20coal%20burning%20in%20London&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pamphlet suggests that burning wood, particularly aromatic woods, will be less harmful to the lungs and recommends relocating some of London's more polluting industries outside the capital, in particular [[limekiln|lime-burning]] and [[brewing]].

==Part One==
The first part of Evelyn's letter describes the details of the problem with the air pollution in London and its effect on human health.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt; He explains that many philosophers believed that air was the most important for the soul and the Earth for we benefit it and therefore it is necessary for survival by the respiration of clean air through the lungs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not without some considerable ''Analogy'', that sundry of the ''Philosophers'' have named the ''Aer'' the ''Vehicle of the Soul'', as well as of the Earth, and this frail Vessell of ours which contains it; since we all of us finde the benefit which we derive from it. Not onely for the necessity of common Respiration and functions of the Organs; but likewise for the use of ''Spirits'' and ''Primigene Humors'', which doe most neerly approach that Divine particle.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evelyn/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Part Two==
The second part of the letter proposes a solution to the current air pollution problem by recommending a removal of all pollution trades from the capital.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt;

==Part Three==
In the third part of Evelyn's letter, he describes ways of improving the air quality of London by way of plantations, sweet-smelling flowers and vegetation placed near the city.&lt;ref name=Perspectives/&gt;

The '''Hakluyt Society''' is a [[text publication society]], founded in 1846 and based in [[London, England]], which publishes scholarly editions of [[Primary source|primary records]] of historic voyages, travels and other geographical material. In addition to its publishing role, the Society organises and participates in meetings, symposia and conferences relating to the history of geographical exploration and cultural encounter. It is a [[registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;*{{EW charity|313168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a non-profitmaking institution administered by a voluntary team of council members and officers. Membership is open to all with an interest in its aims.

The Society is named after [[Richard Hakluyt]] (1552–1616), a collector and editor of narratives of voyages and travels and other documents relating to English interests overseas.

==Foundation==
[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow.jpg|thumb|right| [[Richard Hakluyt]], after whom the Society is named, pictured in a stained glass window of c.1905 in [[Bristol Cathedral]] ]]
The Society was created at a meeting convened in the [[London Library]], St James's Square, on 15 December 1846. Under the chairmanship of the geologist Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], it established an eight-man steering group which included the geographer and historian [[William Desborough Cooley]]; the Army medical officer Dr [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]]; the naval officer and surveyor Sir [[Charles Malcolm]]; the antiquary [[Bolton Corney]]; the British Museum Principal Librarian Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]]; the physicist and mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], FRS; and [[John Edward Gray]], Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum. Cooley had previously criticised the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for relying too heavily on contemporary materials in the solution of geographical problems, arguing that the scientific study of geography should involve a far wider analysis and appreciation of earlier sources. He took the major role during the Society's formative period, assisted by Corney and Smith, while Murchison occupied little more than a figurehead position.

Cooley had proposed that the society should be known as the "Columbus Society", but at the inaugural Council Meeting on 26 January 1847 it was decided that it be named in commemoration of [[Richard Hakluyt]]. Not only did Hakluyt's name as a recorder of voyages, rather than an explorer in his own right, better reflect the society's aims, but it also proclaimed its central ambition, which was to advance Hakluyt's work into the modern age. A resolution was adopted whereby the Society would print and circulate to its members, for a subscription of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] per annum, rare accounts of voyages, travels and geographical records dating from any period prior to [[William Dampier]]'s circumnavigation (effectively before the end of the 17th century). Meetings were initially held in a room at the London Library, but in 1849 transferred to the offices of the Society's printer in [[St Martin's Lane]], and from 1850 in [[Great Queen Street]]. From 1872 they were held at the Royal Geographical Society's premises, originally in [[Savile Row]] and subsequently in [[Kensington Gore]].

A General Meeting on 4 March 1847 agreed a constitution and a list of works to be published. The Society was to be governed by a President (Murchison), two Vice-Presidents (Charles Malcolm and Revd H. H. Milman), a Secretary (Cooley) and 17 elected council members. The first year's Council included – in addition to the members of the original steering group – [[Charles Darwin]], [[Charles Beke]], Captain [[Charles Ramsay Drinkwater Bethune]] and the scholar [[Richard Henry Major]].

The Society attracted 220 members in its first two years. Its first publication, Bethune's ''Observations of Sir Richard Hawkins'', appeared in December 1847; followed by Major's ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'' (printed 1847 but published in January 1848). Richard Hakluyt's ''Divers Voyages touching the Discovery of America'', which the Society had intended for its inaugural publication, was postponed until 1850. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Schomburgk's edition of Ralegh's voyage to Guiana had appeared (1849), together with Cooley's ''Sir Francis Drake his Voyage'' (1849), Thomas Rundall's ''Voyages towards the North-West'', and Major's ''Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia''. Early print-runs were relatively small – around 250 copies to satisfy the existing membership, with a few to spare – at a cost to the Society in the region of £50–60.

==Later development==
Murchison served as President until his death in 1871, although his position was largely honorary. He was succeeded by Sir [[David Dundas (politician)|David Dundas]] (1871–77),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dundas, David (1799-1877) (DNB00)|Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer and politician, and then by [[Sir Henry Yule]] (1877–89), an Oriental scholar and former [[East India Company]] soldier. Yule took a more direct interest in the editing of the society's publications than either Murchison or Dundas, and it was his decision that all future volumes should be indexed. R. H. Major, who had taken over as Secretary from Cooley in 1849, held the office until 1858 when his place was taken by the geographer, historian and expedition promoter [[Clements Markham]]. Markham served as Secretary 1858–87, and as President 1889–1909, and personally edited no fewer than 29 volumes. From 1893 he was assisted by [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]], the East India Company historian and India Office archivist, who served as Secretary until 1902. The first permanent Treasurer, appointed in 1908, was Edward Heawood, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian: he remained in office for thirty-eight years.

In 1908, the final year of Markham's rule, the Society broke with tradition and published its first post-1700 text, Bolton Corney's ''Voyage of Captain Don [[Felipe González de Ahedo|Felipe Gonzalez]]''.

In 1909 Markham was succeeded as President by Sir Albert Gray, an ex-member of the Ceylon Civil Service. From this time onwards the Society began to extend its activity beyond that of publication. It supported the establishment of a memorial to Richard Hakluyt in [[Bristol Cathedral]] in 1911, and in 1914 Gray represented the Society on the [[British Academy]] Committee involved in organising the [[Shakespeare]] Tercentenary. The period also saw the emergence of women as editors and translators, notably Sigfus Blondal, Bertha Philpotts, Lavinia Anstey and Zelia Nuttall. Membership increased, largely on account of institutional subscriptions which by 1911 accounted for half of the 440 members. Sir William Foster, the former Secretary, served as President 1928–1945, and then as Vice-president until his death in 1951. Foster's skill in annotating rubbed off on his editors and resulted in a period distinguished by considerable improvements in the quality of the Society's publications, together with a steady growth in membership to more than 2000. Foster was succeeded in 1945 by Edward Lynam, Superintendent of the Map Room at the [[British Museum]] (now the [[British Library]]) and the first of a line of post-war presidents whose terms of office were restricted to a period of five years. In the post-war period the Society's publication programme benefited from the labours of those of its voluntary officers who also took on editorial responsibilities, including [[Raleigh Ashlin Skelton|R. A. Skelton]], Eila Campbell, Terence Armstrong, [[Sarah Tyacke]], Michael Brennan, Robin Law and Will Ryan.

==Publications==
The main activity of the Society is the publication of scholarly editions of [[primary source]]s on the voyages and travels undertaken by individuals in many parts of the globe. These include early accounts dealing with the [[geography]], [[ethnology]] and [[natural history]] of the regions visited. The Society has to date published over 200 editions in some 350 volumes. All editions are published in English.

Although many of the Society's past editions relate to British ventures, with documentary sources in English, the majority concern non-British enterprises and are based on texts in languages other than English. Translations from Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French or Dutch have regularly appeared, and occasional translations from Russian, Greek, Latin, Amharic, Mandarin, Persian or Arabic. The translation in which the material is presented is normally a fresh version, but has sometimes been an earlier rendering, checked and corrected as necessary.

All editions contain scholarly annotation to elucidate the complexities of the text, and to place it in its wider historical context. Volumes are produced in a standard binding, and generally contain maps and contemporary illustrations. The Society's logo, which appears on the cover of all volumes, is a vignette of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ship, the ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''.

Editions have dealt with the following explorers: [[Ibn Battuta]], [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]], [[Pedro Cieza de León]], [[John Cabot]], [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], [[James Cook]], [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Semyon Dezhnev]], [[Francis Drake]], [[Humphrey Gilbert]], [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]], [[Ludwig Leichhardt]], [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], [[Ma Huan]], [[Olaus Magnus]], [[Arthur J. M. Jephson]], [[Jens Munk]], [[William of Rubruck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Journey of William of Rubruck to the Eastern Parts of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/journeywilliamr01ruysgoog|website=The Hakluyt Society|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[George Vancouver]].

The Society published 100 volumes in its First Series, from 1847 to 1899. The Second Series ran from 1899 to 1998, and accounted for 190 volumes. The Third Series, in a larger format, began in 1999, and by the end of 2016 had reached 31 volumes. These included a 3-volume journal of The [[Malaspina Expedition]], published in association with the [[Museo Naval de Madrid]].

Currently, two volumes are published on average each year.

===Extra Series===
In addition to its regular series, the Society publishes a separate Extra Series, comprising books which are too expensive in their production to be freely distributed, but which are made available to members at reduced prices. Publications of this type first appeared in 1903–07 with C. R. Beazley's annotated extracts from Hakluyt, and the multi-volume MacLehose editions of Hakluyt's ''Principal Navigations'' and Purchas's ''Pilgrimes''. These are now treated as volumes 1–33 of the Extra Series, although only a few sets of the MacLehose printings appeared in Hakluyt Society binding, and none carried the Extra Series imprint. The concept was revived and formally designated in the 1950s with the publication of the ''Journals of Captain James Cook'' (4 volumes, 1955–67, numbered as Extra Series vols 34–37), followed by other titles including the monumental ''Charts &amp; Coastal Views of Captain Cook's Voyages'' (1988–92). The Extra Series had reached 47 volumes by the end of 2012.

==Other activities==
The Society's Annual General Meeting and Annual Lecture is held at the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Its website hosts a [[discussion group]] and publishes an online ''Journal of the Hakluyt Society''.

==American Friends of the Hakluyt Society==
A sister organisation, '''The American Friends of the Hakluyt Society''', was founded in 1996 at the [[John Carter Brown Library]] located on the campus of [[Brown University]]. The American Friends was founded in conjunction with the 150th anniversary celebration of the Hakluyt Society. The [[Rhode Island]] merchant [[John Carter Brown]] (1797–1874), was the first American to join the Society as a charter member in 1846.
 
The American Friends of the Hakluyt Society exists as a non-profit corporation with objectives similar to those of the Hakluyt Society in London, but with a focus on the history of the Americas. The group promotes and helps provide financial support from the United States for the publication of scholarly editions of records of voyages, travels and other geographical material of the past.

'''Ivan Pavlovitch Pokhitonov''' (27 January (8 February) 1850, [[Znamianka Raion|Matrionovka]], [[Kherson Governorate]] - 23 December 1923, [[Brussels]]) was a Russian landscape painter and graphic artist, who spent much of his working life in France and Belgium.

== Biography ==
He was born on a large farm in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]). His father was a retired military man who had received a title of nobility, was a member of the Kherson governing committee, supervised the local [[Zemstvo]] school and was an honorary [[magistrate]]. At the age of seven, he was already making copies of the Dutch engravings that decorated his home. In 1860, he became one of the first students at a new private boy's academy in [[Yelisavetgrad]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/special-issue-ivan-pokhitonov-artist-sorcerer/chronicle-life-and-art-ivan-pokhitonov A Chronicle of the Life and Art of Ivan Pokhitonov] @ the Tretyakov Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended several other schools.

In 1868, he entered the [[Russian State Agricultural University|Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy]] in Moscow. At that time, many of the students there held revolutionary opinions and he attended speeches lamenting the plight of small farmers. He became caught up in the complicated events involving the nihilist [[Sergey Nechayev]], but escaped serious punishment. He was, however, expelled and sent home to be supervised by his father and the police.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; 
[[File:Ivan Pokhitonov - Ninie dans fauteuil Empire.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Portrait of &lt;br /&gt;Eugenia (Ninie) Wulffert]]
In 1871, he was allowed to enroll at [[Odessa University]], where he took classes in drawing and watercolors in addition to his regular course of study. These classes would be his only formal art instruction. Shortly after, he travelled to Geneva with his mother and sister, where he exhibited his watercolors. They were a success so, after a brief period of employment at the "State Bank of Odessa", he travelled to Italy, then settled in Paris and found a position working with [[Eugène Carrière]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/landscape/ivan-pokhitonov Brief biography] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited regularly at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] and several of his paintings were purchased by [[Pavel Tretyakov]]. Later, he would sign a lucrative contract with [[Georges Petit]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

===Marriage===
In 1881, he received an order from the Russian government to paint a series of panels depicting scenes from the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]. He travelled to Bulgaria to do sketches for the work, accompanied by Matilda Wulffert (1856-1927), a Swedish-Finnish medical student he had met at the Russian Artists' Club.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; They were married in [[Chernivtsi]] in 1882. She was a very outspoken feminist, and devoted to her career, so their temperaments began to clash. In 1892, he asked for a divorce, but she refused. In response, he began an affair with her younger sister Eugenia. In return, she would not allow him to visit his two daughters until they were adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/special-issue-ivan-pokhitonov-artist-sorcerer/matilda-pokhitonova-correspondence Matilda Pokhitonova's Correspondence] by Eleanora Paston @ the Tretyakov Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to become a prominent [[dermatologist]] and medical researcher.

He spent eight months painting in Italy, at a small village outside Naples then, deciding that he could no longer live in Paris, he and Eugenia moved to [[Liège]], Belgium.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; They continued to travel throughout Western Europe and Russia and, in 1895, he became an honorary member of the [[Peredvizhniki]]. In 1901, he acquired an estate in the [[Minsk Governorate]], where he lived and worked until 1906, when he returned to Belgium. He was elected to the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; During World War I, he lived in Saint Petersburg until the beginning of the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]], then fled to [[Kuban]], where he stayed for a year.

Back in Belgium, he initially lived in [[De Panne]], then moved to Brussels. His eyesight had been failing for several years and he painted little after that. In 1922, he had his last exhibition. A major retrospective was held in 1925.

[[File:Viervant, Design for the Oval Room.jpg|thumb|Leendert Viervant, ''Design for the Oval Room of [[Teylers Museum]]; 480 x 600 mm.]]
'''Leendert Viervant de Jonge''' (Leendert Viervant the Younger) ([[Arnhem]], 5 March 1752&amp;nbsp;– 4 July 1801, [[Amsterdam]]),&lt;ref name="Genealogie"&gt;[http://www.genealogieonline.nl/genealogie-van-der-veen/I17138.php Genealogieonline.nl] on Leendert Viervant.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch [[architect]] and cabinet builder.

Viervant stemmed from a family of architects,&lt;ref name="NAI"&gt;[http://schatkamer.nai.nl/en/designers/viervant Netherlands Architecture Institute] on the family Viervant.&lt;/ref&gt; cabinet builders and stonemasons. His father, [[Hendrik Viervant]], was the son of cabinet builder and stonemason [[Leendert Viervant the Elder]] and married Catharina Maria Otten, the sister of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architect [[Jacob Otten Husly]]. Also Hendrik's brother, [[Anthonie Viervant]], was a cabinet maker and Anthonie's son [[Roelof Viervant]] designed garden pavillons and [[facade]]s. All these family members have designed some buildings in 18th century Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Arneym"&gt;[http://www.arneym.nl/architecten/0000009af00a9c001/index.html Arneym], historical website about the city of Arnhem, on the family Viervant.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to his family background, Viervant had a good basis to work from. Born and raised in the provincial city of Arnhem, he studied to become an architect with his uncle Husly. In 1768 he was entered into the stonemason guild of Amsterdam,&lt;ref name="Genealogie" /&gt; where he lived and worked. He lived at the [[Amstel]] and later near [[Hoge Sluis]] (1784–1790). In 1791 he was forced to let his inventory be liquidated, because he couldn't fulfill his financial obligations any longer&amp;nbsp;– finally he was able to come to arrangements with his [[creditor]]s. According to his uncle Husly, Viervant couldn't handle money, and he lived a wild life.&lt;ref name="TeylersMuseum"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=116&amp;i_id=6247&amp;lang=nl Teylers Museum] on Leendert Viervant the Younger (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 he became one of the three directors at the ''City and Public Works Department'' of the City Amsterdam, after his predecessor had to leave because of his support of the Orange family (this was between the revolution and the inclusion in the French Empire).

== Work ==
[[File:The Board of Teylers Foundation, 1786..jpg|thumb|[[Wybrand Hendriks]], ''Group portrait of the Board of Teylers Foundation, with their secretary and the architect Leendert Viervant'', 1786, oil on canvas; 311 x 258 cm. The standing figure at the back is Leendert Viervant.]]
[[File:RM38608 Weesp - Nieuwstraat 41 (foto 1).jpg|thumb|The [[City Hall, Weesp|town hall of Weesp]], one of Leendert Viervant the Younger's designs]]
Viervant was the architect of several buildings throughout the Netherlands. He was taught by his uncle Husly, and had a for that period typical neoclassical style. Short after his entry in the stonemason guild of Amsterdam in 1768, he got an assignment by the churchmasters of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] (''Old Church'') for a '''Bardiglio Marmere schoosteenmantel met holle stijlen en ornament in het midden voor f 180'' (a [[Bardiglio]] marmer chimney mantel with hollow styles and an ornament in the middle for 180 [[guilder]]s). From 1772 to 1776 he worked on the [[town hall]] of [[Weesp]]. In 1779 he is asked by the [[Teylers Stichting]] to design the [[Oval Room (Teylers)|Oval Room]], the [[Teylers astronomical observatory]] and a significant part of the interior of the [[Teylers Museum]] (works began in 1784). Here he could also use his family background of cabinet makers, designing amongst others the cabinets in the Oval Room and the lower part of the [[Big Electrostatic generator (Teylers)|Big Electrostatic generator]]. In his works on the Teylers Museum, he based himself amongst others on work of the architects [[François de Neufforge]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Artus Quellinus II|Artus Quellinus]]. Viervant received some 9500 [[guilder]]s, and was with that amount probably one of the best paid architects in the Netherlands at the time. His uncle Husly designed several of the ceiling decorations in the Oval Room. He also works on other projects for this foundation, including the [[Teylers Hofje]], all in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="bouwtekeningen"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=bouw&amp;lang=nl Teylers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525184525/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=bouw&amp;lang=nl |date=2013-05-25 }} digital 'bouwtekeningen'&lt;/ref&gt; In the Regents' Room of [[Teylers Hofje]], there is a large group portrait by [[Wybrand Hendriks]], showing the first five Directors of [[Teylers Stichting]] sitting around a table, together with their accountant Koenraad Hovens and their architect: Leendert Viervant.

In 1787 he designed the current [[Kalverstraat 8]] for the patriottic society, but the building was stopped soon because the society was abolished. This does however show his involvement with the patriottic circles, which would later make him director of the City and Public Works Department.&lt;ref name="NAI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oud_Hoorn1993"&gt;Boezaard, A. / Zantkuyl, H., [http://www.oudhoorn.nl/kwartaalblad/?jaar=1993&amp;nr=3 Oud Hoorn '''1993''' p.80-87]: Het cultuur-historisch pand Grote Oost 22 en zijn bewoners&lt;/ref&gt; Also Viervant is believed to be the designer of the south entrance of the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.

'''The Moldenhauer Archives at the Library of Congress''' is a collection of original music, unique documents and manuscripts within the [[Library of Congress]], the [[national library]] of the United States. The Moldenhauer archives contains many thousands of unique original documents of historical significance. Part of the collection was bequeathed to '''The Moldenhauer Archives at Harvard University''', located in the Houghton Library at [[Harvard|Harvard University]].

== Significance ==
The archives were founded through a donation of documents and funds by the German collector, historian and musicologist Hans Moldenhauer, in honour of his wife Rosaleen Moldenhauer.

The original bequest, consisting of over 3,500 documents, constituted the most comprehensive collection of original musical manuscripts ever accumulated. The collection spans musical periods from the Middle Ages through the 20th century, and includes original musical manuscripts by 57 of the foremost western composers, from Bach, Bartók, Beethoven and Brahms, via Mahler, Mendelssohn and Mozart, to Schubert, Schoenberg and Webern.

Since 1987, the Moldenhauer Archives have grown to many thousands of items that are now housed in nine institutions around the world: 
in the United States, at the Library of Congress, Harvard University, Northwestern University, Washington State University, and Whitworth College; in Basel, Switzerland, at the Paul Sacher Foundation; in Zürich, Switzerland, at the Zentralbibliothek; in Munich, Germany, at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek; and in Vienna, Austria, at the Stadtarchiv und Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek.

== About the Benefactor ==

Hans Moldenhauer was born 1906 in Germany, but emigrated to the United States in 1938 to escape [[fascism]] in his native country. He lived and worked in the United States until his death in 1987.

'''NIMU''' (an acronym for the phrase "Not In My Unit"), or Nimu, is a [[pejorative]] characterization of opposition by unit members to a proposal for a new development because the customer is not assigned to their unit, often with the connotation that such members believe that the developments are needed but should be done by another unit. Opposing members themselves are sometimes called Nimus.

The NIMU concept may also apply more generally to people who advocate some proposal (for example, [[austerity]] measures like budget cuts), but oppose implementing it in a way that would require sacrifice on their part.

The man with a sword is a commissioned officer, as is the man on the ladder with the telescope. All others are ratings.]]

A '''naval rating''' or '''naval rate''' is a naval term that can have several closely related meanings depending on the context and country it is used in. In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies, both "rate" and "rating" interchangeably refer to an [[enlisted rank|enlisted member]] of the navy ranked below [[warrant officer]]s and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. In the United States, the term "rate" refers to the [[Enlisted rank|rank of an enlisted sailor]], while "rating" denotes a sailor's [[United States military occupation code|military occupation code]].

The term comes from the general nautical usage of rating – a seaman's class or grade as recorded in the ship's books,&lt;ref&gt;New English Dictionary, p. 886&lt;/ref&gt;

== British and Commonwealth navies ==
In the [[Royal Navy]] and elsewhere in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the terms "rate" and "rating" are interchangeable and refer to an enlisted member of the Navy.

The system of conferring authority on sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] evolved through the recognition of competence; [[Landman (rank)|Landsman]], [[Ordinary Rate|Ordinary seaman]] or [[Able Rate|Able seaman]] and through the appointment of authority as a [[petty officer]]. The [[Comparative military ranks|general structure]] now used in the majority of countries breaks down into four major groupings:&lt;ref name="Gray2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Debra Gray|title=BTEC First Public Services (uniformed)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAWeGSAa_fMC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-45459-3|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Able Rate]]
*[[Leading Rate]]
*[[Petty Officer]]
*[[Chief Petty Officer]]

Historically the term "rate" also applied to [[Rating system of the Royal Navy|ships]], denoting their combat strength by the number, and type, of guns, but this use of the term is now considered [[archaism|archaic]].

== United States naval rates and ratings ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[United States Coast Guard]] --&gt;
{{see also|List of United States Navy ratings|List of United States Navy enlisted rates}}
{{see also|List of United States Coast Guard ratings|List of United States Coast Guard enlisted ranks}}

In the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard]], there is a distinction between the similar-sounding terms "rate" and "rating".

In the U.S. Navy, the term "rate" refers to an enlisted sailor's [[Uniformed services pay grades of the United States|pay grade]], and is legally and functionally identical to the term "[[military rank|rank]]" as used by other armed services. However, "rate" is considered the proper term when referring to the pay grades of enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Coast Guard previously used the term "rate" as well, but now refers to the pay grades of their enlisted personnel as "ranks".

In both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, "rating" refers to a sailor's [[List of United States Navy ratings|occupational specialty]].&lt;ref name="usnavy-rating"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENLISTED RATING INSIGNIA|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=259|work=America's Navy (navy.mil)|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navy personnel in pay grades E-1 to E-3 may not have a rating and are broadly classed into one of five groups, namely, Seaman (SN), Fireman (FN), Airman (AN), Hospitalman (HN) and Constructionman (CN) until they are "rated" or given a rating. Petty Officers (E-4 to E-6) and Chief Petty Officers (E-7 to E-9) are referred to by a combination of rate and rating. For example, a Petty Officer Second Class with the rating of Gunner's Mate is addressed as "Gunner's Mate Second Class" (GM2). Similarly, a Chief Petty Officer with the rating of Quartermaster is referred to in formal occasions as "Chief Quartermaster" (QMC). On less formal occasions, however, senior enlisted personnel are referred to simply as Chief, Senior Chief, or Master Chief, as applicable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">The '''Pictish Chronicle''' is a name often given by (especially older) historians to a pseudo-historical account of the kings of the [[Picts]] beginning many thousand years before history was recorded in [[Pictavia]] and ending after Pictavia had been enveloped by [[Scotland]]. The original (albeit lost) manuscript seems to date from the early years of the reign of [[Kenneth II of Scotland]] (who ruled Scotland from 971 until 995) since he is the last king mentioned and the chronicler does not know the length of his reign. Apart from the list of kings, the chronicle survives only in the 14th century [[Poppleton Manuscript]].

There are actually several versions of the Pictish Chronicle. The so-called "A" text is probably the oldest, the fullest, and seems to have fewer errors than other versions.  It is in three parts:

# An account of the origins of the Picts, mostly from the Etymologies of [[Isidore of Seville]].
# A list of Pictish kings.
# Occasionally included is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]''.

It is evident that the latter two sections were originally written in [[Middle Irish language|Gaelic]] since a few Gaelic words have not been translated into [[Latin language|Latin]].

The '''Plan Dog memorandum''' was a 1940 American government document written by [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Harold Rainsford Stark]]. It has been called "one of the best known documents of [[World War II]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Spector]]. Eagle Against The Sun. 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-394-74101-7}}. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt; Confronting the problem of an expected [[two-front war]] against [[European Theatre of World War II|Germany and Italy in Europe]] and [[Pacific War|Japan in the Pacific]], the memo set out the main options and suggested fighting a defensive war in the Pacific and giving strategic priority to defeating Germany and Italy. The memo laid the basis for the later American policy of [[Europe first]].

==Background==
{{main|United States Color-coded War Plans}}

During the [[Interwar Period]], the Joint Planning Committee, which later became the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]), devised [[United States Color-coded War Plans|a series of contingency plans]] for dealing with the outbreak of war with various countries. The most elaborate of them, [[War Plan Orange]], dealt with the possibility of war with Japan. 

In light of the events of the late 1930s (the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], and the German conquest of Poland and Western Europe) American planners realized that the United States faced the possibility of a two-front war in both Europe and the Pacific. [[War Plan Orange]] was withdrawn, and five [[Rainbow Plans|"Rainbow" plans]] were put forward. Unlike the earlier colored plans, which had assumed a one-on-one war, the Rainbow plans contemplated both the possibility of fighting multiple enemies and the necessity of defending other western hemisphere nations and aiding Britain.

==Content==
The memorandum built upon the conditions described in the Rainbow Five war plan. It described four possible scenarios for American participation in [[World War II]], lettered A through E&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box4/a48b01.html Plan Dog Memo]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:A - War with Japan in which [the United States] would have no allies
:B - War with Japan in which [the United States] would have the British Empire... as [an] ally.
:C - War with Japan in which she is aided by Germany and Italy, and in which [the United States] is or is not aided by allies.
:D - War with Germany and Italy in which Japan would not initially be involved, and in which [the United States] would be allied with the British.
:E - [...] consider the alternative of now remaining out of the war, and devoting [...] to exclusively building up [...] defense of the [[Western Hemisphere]].

The memorandum, which was submitted to Roosevelt on November 12, 1940, recommended option D, the origin of its name ("Dog" was D in the [[Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I believe that the continued existence of the British Empire, combined with building up a strong protection in our home areas, will do most to ensure the status quo in the Western Hemisphere, and to promote our principal national interests. As I have previously stated, I also believe that Great Britain requires from us very great help in the Atlantic, and possibly even on the continents of Europe or [[Africa]], if she is to be enabled to survive. In my opinion Alternatives (A), (B), and (C) will most probably not provide the necessary degree of assistance, and, therefore, if we undertake war, that Alternative (D) is likely to be the most fruitful for the United States, particularly if we enter the war at an early date. Initially, the offensive measures adopted would, necessarily, be purely naval. Even should we intervene, final victory in Europe is not certain. I believe that the chances for success are in our favor, particularly if we insist upon full equality in the political and military direction of the war."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The memo also suggested that until hostilities broke out, the US should adopt policy A:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until such time as the United States should decide to engage its full forces in war, I recommend that we pursue a course that will most rapidly increase the military strength of both the Army and the Navy, that is to say, adopt Alternative (A) without hostilities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The strategy of Plan Dog gained the support of the army and implicitly of President Roosevelt, though he never formally endorsed it. Thus at the end of 1940 a powerful consensus for strategic focus on Germany developed at the highest levels of the American government. At a meeting on January 17, 1941, Roosevelt concluded that the primary objective must be maintenance of the supply lines to Britain and ordered the navy to prepare for the escort of convoys."&lt;ref&gt;Waldo H. Heinrichs. Threshold of War: Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Entry into World War II. Oxford University Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-19-506168-3}}. Page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A few weeks after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], at the [[Arcadia Conference]], the United States adopted the recommendations of the memo in the form of the "Europe first" policy. Although the United States did not go entirely on the defensive in the Pacific, as the memo recommended, the European Theatre was given higher priority in resource allocation throughout the war.

The memorandum was declassified in February, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box4/t46j05.html Letter from L. J. Darter (Head, Naval Archives Branch) to Herman Kahn (Director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision upheld the ruling of a lower court which prevented a provider of web development services from automatically harvesting publicly available registration data from a domain name registrar's servers for advertising purposes.

==Background==

===Register.com===

[[Register.com]] is a World Wide Web [[domain name registrar]], appointed by [[ICANN]] (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).  All registrars must abide by ICANN's Registrar Accreditation Agreement.  This agreement included several clauses that were important in this case.

====The ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement====

First, the Agreement includes a requirement that:

"At its expense, Registrar shall provide an interactive web page and a port 43 [[Whois]] service providing free public query-based access to up-to-date (i.e. updated at least daily) data concerning all active SLD ([[second-level domain]]) registrations sponsored by Registrar in the registry for the .com, .net, and .org TLDs ([[top-level domains]])."&lt;ref name=register_agreement&gt;ICANN. [http://www.icann.org/en/nsi/icann-raa-04nov99.htm Registrar Accreditation Agreement], November 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data that is typically listed in a Whois service includes name, address phone number and email address.

The Agreement also includes the following clause:

"Registrar shall not impose terms and conditions on use of the data provided except as permitted by an ICANN-adopted policy… Registrar shall permit use of data it provides in response to queries for any lawful purposes except to: (a) allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations via e-mail (spam)…"&lt;ref name=register_agreement/&gt;

Finally, the Agreement also included the following clause: "No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not be construed to create any obligation by either ICANN or Registrar to any non-party to this Agreement, including any SLD holder."&lt;ref name=register_agreement/&gt;

====Register.com's Terms of Use====

Register.com followed the rules of the Agreement and set up a WHOIS lookup service.  It affixed the following statement to each set of data it returned: "By submitting a WHOIS query, you agree that you will use this data only for lawful purposes and that under no circumstances will you use this data to…support the transmission of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitation via email."&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;

In addition to domain name registration, Register.com also provides web development services.  It only solicited its registration customers with its services if they opted to receive such solicitation.

===Verio, Inc.===

[[Verio]] is a provider of website development services such as web site design and operation.  It developed automated software that submitted port 43 WHOIS queries to various registrars on a daily basis.  Verio used this data to contact recent registrants and advertise its services to them.  These messages included references to Register.com, which led many consumers to believe the advertisements were actually from Register.com, including those who had opted not to receive solicitations.

Register.com began to receive complaints from its customers regarding the advertisements.  Register.com in turn complained to Verio, saying that the confusion was tarnishing its image with its customers.  Verio continued to solicit the customers but stopped using Register's name in the messages.  Register reacted by changing the statement affixed to the WHOIS data to prohibit the use of the data for solicitation by direct mail, email, or phone.

This new statement was in violation of the ICANN Agreement, which stated that the data should be allowed for all legal purposes except for email spam.  Under the ICANN Agreement, Register.com was not allowed to prohibit direct mail or phone solicitations.  Verio discontinued its email solicitations, but continued to contact Register's customers via direct mail and phone.

===Case===

Register.com filed suit on August 3, 2000 requesting a restraining order against Verio.  It claimed that Verio was infringing its [[trademark]] by including its name in solicitations.  With regard to the WHOIS queries, Register.com claimed Verio, was accessing its servers without authorization, which, it alleged, was a violation of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].  Register.com also claimed that Verio was committing [[trespass to chattels]], because the automated requests could be harmful to Register.com's servers.

==Decision==

===Enforcement of the ICANN Agreement===

Verio argued that Register was not allowed to forbid the use of the WHOIS data for direct mail or phone solicitation because the ICANN Agreement specifically said the data must be available for any lawful purpose other than email spam.  However, Register countered that argument by stating that the Agreement was between Register and ICANN, and Verio had no right to enforce it.  Furthermore, the Agreement specifically stated that it created no obligations to third parties.

In an [[amicus brief]] (a brief by a non-party offering to the court additional points of view), ICANN itself weighed in on the case and advocated strongly for Register.&lt;ref name=ICANN&gt;ICANN, [http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/register.com-verio/amicus-22sep00.htm Amicus Curiae Memorandum], September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  It pointed to the dispute resolution processes it had in place for similar cases of which Verio refused to make use.  It also stressed that the "no third party" clause was an essential part of its policies.  Finally, ICANN pointed out that decisions about ICANN policies were best resolved by them, rather than a court that is not familiar with the technical issues.

The court agreed with ICANN's and Register's arguments.  Because of the "no third party" clause, the Agreement could not be enforced by Verio.  Furthermore, the court agreed that technical issues can change quickly and are therefore best resolved by ICANN, which is why they included the "no third party" clause in the Agreement.

===Browsewrap License===

Verio argued that the terms of use were not enforceable because the contract terms regarding the permissible uses of the data did not appear until after the transaction was completed.  Verio relied on two previous Internet "[[browse wrap]]" cases as precedent.  In ''[[Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.]]'', the court refused to enforce a click-through license because a contract requires that both parties agree to the terms and the website did not ensure that the users had read and agreed to the terms.  In ''Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc.'', [http://eric_goldman.tripod.com/caselaw/ticketmastermarch72003.htm CV99-7654-HLH(VBKx), 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 6483, 2003 WL 21406289] (C.D. Cal. Mar. 7, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that a contract was unenforceable because the website did not have a check box to signify that the user specifically agreed to the terms.

The court rejected Verio's arguments regarding the timing of the statement.  It stated that although the terms may not have been enforceable on the first query, Verio would have been aware of the terms before making all subsequent queries and the terms were therefore enforceable.  The ''Netscape'' case was distinguishable because in that case the users only engaged in the transaction once and therefore never received proper notice of the terms.  Verio was made aware of the terms with each query, albeit it at the end of each one.  The court also gave little weight to the ''Ticketmaster'' case because that case only involved a [[preliminary injunction]].  The court went even further, stating that it did not agree with the ''Ticketmaster'' outcome.  The court argued that a check box was not necessary because the [[Restatement of Contracts]] says that even silence can be considered assent to a contract as long as the user knows about the terms, has an opportunity to refuse the service, and still took the benefit of the service.

===Trespass to Chattels===

[[Trespass to chattels]] is a [[tort]] in which one interferes with someone's personal property in a way that would cause harm.  Register invoked this law, claiming that Verio's automated queries were harming its computers.  Verio claimed that Register had not shown evidence of any damage or that the access was unauthorized.  The Court of Appeals relied on the findings of the lower court in the matter of harm.  The District Court had determined that the automated queries would inevitably lead to other companies doing the same, and hence cause Register's systems to crash.  As for the authorization, the court ruled that Register's complaints to Verio were enough to serve as notice to Verio that its access was not authorized.

===Trademark Infringement===

[[Trademark infringement]] cases require evidence of [[consumer confusion]].  The court ruled in favor of Register here as there was direct evidence that consumers had been confused by the emails that made reference to their recent transaction with Register.com.  Furthermore, the court ruled that the script of the telemarketing calls was also misleading.

This finding under s 43(a) of the Lanham Act was subsequently reversed and removed from the injunction sought by Register.com. It was stated that "because Verio's telemarketing script did not contain a misleading description or representation of fact, that constituted actionable conduct under the Lanham Act, and because Register.com did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim," the court had no option but to remove this from the injunction.

A '''rental agreement''' is a [[contract]], usually written, between the owner of a property and a renter who desires to have temporary possession of the property as distinguished from a [[lease]] which is more typically for a fixed term.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allbusiness.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-rental-agreement-and-a-lease-for-a-rental-property-4099-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As a minimum, the agreement identifies the parties, the property, the term of the rental, and the amount of rent for the term. The owner of the property may be referred to as the [[Lessor (leasing)|lessor]]  and the renter as the [[lessee]].

There is typically an implied, explicit, or written rental agreement or [[contract]] involved to specify the terms of the rental, which are regulated and managed under [[contract law]].

Examples include letting out [[real estate]] (real property) for the purpose of [[housing tenure]] (where the tenant rents a residence to live in), [[parking]] space for a vehicle(s), storage space, whole or portions of properties for business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.

==Real estate rental==

When renting real estate, the person(s) or party who lives in or occupies the real estate is often called a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], paying '''rent''' to the owner of the property, often called a [[landlord]] (or landlady). The real estate rented may be all or part of almost any real estate, such as an [[apartment]], [[house]], [[building]], business office(s) or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to park a vehicle, or store things all under [[real estate law]].

The tenancy agreement for real estate is often called a '''[[lease]]''', and usually involves specific property rights in [[real property]], as opposed to [[Personal property|chattel]]s.

A rental agreement is often called a '''lease''', especially when [[real estate]] is rented.  In addition to the basics of a rental (who, what, when, how much), a real estate rental may go into much more detail on these and other issues.  The real estate may be rented for [[Housing tenure|housing]], [[parking]] a vehicle(s), storage, business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.  
* '''Who''': The parties involved in the contract, the lessor (sometimes called the owner or [[landlord]]) and the lessee (sometimes called the renter or [[leasehold estate|tenant]]) are identified in the contract.  A housing lease may specify whether the renter is living alone, with family, children, roommate, visitors.  A rental may delineate the rights and obligations of each of these.  For example, a "sub-let" to a stranger might not be permitted without permission of the landlord.  This also applies to whether or not [[pet]]s may be kept by the renter.  On the other hand, the renter may also have specific rights against intrusions by the landlord (or other tenants), except under emergency circumstances.  A renter is in possession of the property, and a landlord would be trespassing upon the renter's rights if entry is made without proper notice and authority (e.g., 24 hours' notice, daytime, knock first, except for emergency repairs, in case of fire, flood, etc.).
* '''What''': Rented real estate may include all or part of almost any [[real property]], such as an [[apartment]], [[house]], [[building]], business office(s) or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to [[Parking|park]] a vehicle, or store things.  The premises rented may include not only specific rooms, but also access to other common areas such as off-street parking, basement or attic storage, laundry facility, pool, roof-deck, balconies, etc. The agreement may specify how and when these places may be used, and by whom.  There may be detailed description of the current condition of the premises, for comparison with the condition at the time the premises are surrendered.   
* '''When''': the term of the rental may be for a night (e.g., a hotel room), weeks, months, or years.  There may be statutory provisions requiring registration of any rental that could extend for more than a specified number of years (e.g., seven) in order to be enforceable against a new landlord.
:A typical rental is either annual or month-to-month, and the amount of rent may be different for long-term renters (because of lower turnover costs). Leaving a long-term lease before its expiration could result in penalties, or even the cost of the entire agreed period (if the landlord is unable to find a suitable replacement tenant, after diligent pursuit).  If a tenant stays beyond the end of a lease for a term of years (one or more), then the parties may agree that the lease will be automatically renewed, or it may simply convert to a tenancy at will (month-to-month) at the pro-rated monthly cost of the previous annual lease.  If a tenant at will is given notice to quit the premises, and refuses to do so, the landlord then begins eviction proceedings.  In many places it is completely illegal to change locks on doors, or remove personal belongings, let alone forcibly eject a person, without a court order of eviction.  There may be strict rules of procedure, and stiff penalties (triple damages, plus attorneys' fees) for violations.

* '''How much''': Rent may be payable monthly, annually, or in advance, or as otherwise agreed. A typical arrangement for tenancy at will is "first and last month's rent" plus a [[security deposit]]. The "last month's rent" is rent that has yet to be earned by the landlord.

===Deposit===
{{main|Security deposit}}
The security deposit is often handled as an [[escrow]] deposit, owned by the tenant, but held by the landlord until the premises are surrendered in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted).  In some states, the landlord must provide the tenant with the name and account number of the bank where the security deposit is held, and pay annual interest to the tenant.  Other regulations may require the landlord to submit a list of pre-existing damage to the property, or forfeit the security deposit immediately (because there is no way to determine whether a prior tenant was responsible).

===Insurance===
In order to rent or lease in many apartment buildings, a renter (also referred to as a “[[lessee]]") is often required to provide proof of renters [[insurance]] before signing the rental agreement. There is a special type of the [[homeowners insurance]] in the [[United States]] specifically for renters — [[homeowners insurance#Types of Homeowners Insurance|'''HO-4''']]. This is commonly referred to as renter’s [[insurance]] or renter's coverage. Similar to [[condominium]] coverage, referred to as a [[homeowners insurance#Types of Homeowners Insurance|'''HO-6''']] policy, a renter's insurance policy covers those aspects of the [[apartment]] and its contents not specifically covered in the [[blanket policy]] written for the complex. This [[policy]] can also cover liabilities arising from accidents and intentional injuries for guests as well as passers-by up to 150' of the domicile. Renter’s policies provide "named peril" coverage, meaning the policy states specifically what you are insured against. Common coverage areas are:
* [[Fire]] or [[Lightning]]
* [[Windstorm]]
* [[Smoke]]
* [[Vandalism]] or Malicious Mischief
* [[Theft]]
* Accidental Discharge of Water
Additional events including riot, aircraft, explosion, smoke, hail, falling objects, [[volcanic eruption]], snow, sleet, and weight of ice may also be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Rental of personal property==

The '''''time use of a chattel''''' or other so called "personal property" is covered under general [[contract law]], but the term ''lease'' also nowadays extends to long term ''rental contracts'' of more expensive non-Real properties such as automobiles, boats, planes, office equipment and so forth. The distinction in that case is long term versus short term rentals. Some non-real properties commonly available for rent or lease are:
*[[motion picture]]s on [[VHS]] or [[DVD]], of [[Compact Disc|audio CD]]s, of [[computer program]]s on [[CD-ROM]].
*[[transport]] equipment, such as an [[automobile]] or a [[bicycle]].
*ships and boats, in which case rental is known as [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]], and the rent is known as ''hire'' or ''freight'' (depending on the type of charter)
*aircraft, in which case rental is known as [[Air charter|chartering]], or [[Aircraft leasing|leasing]] if the rental is longer term
*specialized [[tool]]s, such as a [[chainsaw]], laptop, IT equipment or something more substantial, such as a [[forklift]].
*large equipment such as cranes, oil rigs and submarines.
*a [[deckchair]] or [[beach chair]] and [[umbrella]].
*[[furniture]]
*designer handbags, jewelry,&lt;ref name="Qureshi"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jan/04/renting-luxury-goods "If you want it, rent it ... from a 'must have' handbag to an Aston Martin"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 2009-01-04. Retrieved on 2009-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; sunglasses and watches.
*electrical items such as [[washing machine]]s&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

In various degrees, renting can involve buying services for various amounts of time, such as staying in a [[hotel]], using a [[computer]] in an [[Internet cafe]], or riding in a [[taxicab]] (some forms of English use the term "hiring" for this activity).

As seen from the examples, some rented goods are used on the spot, but usually they are taken along; to help [[guarantee]] that they are brought back, one or more of the following applies:

*one shows an [[identity document]]
*one signs a [[contract]]; any damage already present when renting may be noted down to avoid that the renter is blamed for it when the good is returned
*one pays a [[damage deposit]] (a refundable fee that may be used in part to pay for damage caused by the renter)

If the customer has a credit account with the rental company, they may rent over several months (or years) and will receive a recurring or continuation invoice each rental period until they return the equipment. In this case deposits are rarely required.

In certain types of rental (sometimes known as [[Operated Equipment Rental|operated or wet rental)]] the charge may be calculated by the rental charge + timesheets of operators or drivers supplied by the rental company to operate the equipment. This is particularly relevant for crane rental companies.

Sometimes the risk that the good is kept is reduced by it being a special model or having signs on it that cannot easily be removed, making it obvious that it is owned by the rental company; this is especially effective for goods used in public places, but even when used at home it may help due to social control.

Persons and businesses that regularly rent goods from a particular company generally have an account with that company, which reduces the administrative procedure ([[transaction costs]]) on each occasion.

Signing out [[book]]s from a [[library]] could be considered renting when there is a fee per book. However the term ''lending'' is more common.

===Car rental===
In addition to the above, a '''car rental agreement''' may include various restrictions on the way a renter can use a car, and the condition in which it must be returned.  For example, some rentals cannot be driven off-road, or out of the country, or towing a trailer, without specific permission.  In New Zealand you may have to specifically endorse a promise that the car will not be driven onto Ninety-mile Beach (because of the hazardous tides).

There will certainly be a requirement to show a [[driver's license]], and only those drivers appearing on the contract may be authorized to drive. It may include an option to purchase [[auto insurance]] (motor insurance, UK), if the renter does not already have a policy to cover rentals—another important consideration for multiple drivers.  Some agencies may even require a [[Surety bond|bond]] payable if the car is not returned in order, often held in the form of a credit-card authorization—voided if the car is returned per agreement.  A renter should be advised that he or she will be responsible for any parking or traffic violations incurred upon the vehicle during the rental period.  There should also be advice on handling thefts, accidents, break-downs, and towing.

Further terms may include added fees for late returns, drop-off at a different location, or failure to top up the petrol immediately before the return.

Finally, there may be provisions for making a non-refundable deposit with a booking, terms for payment of the initial period (with discounts, vouchers, etc.), extended periods, and any damages or other fees that accrue prior to the return.

==Specific Jurisdictions==
===India===
In India, the rental income on property is taxed under the head "income from house property". A deduction of 30% is allowed from total rent which is charged to tax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10500">In the [[Hebrew Bible]], as well as non-Jewish ancient texts from the region, the [[Northwest Semitic languages|North-West Semitic]] term '''Rephaite''' (Heb. plural רפאים, '''Rephaim'''; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: ''{{transl|sem|rpʼēm}}''&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Scott W. {{cite web |url=http://boothhouse.com/content/Booth_Using_Corpus_Linguistics.pdf |title=Using Corpus Linguistics to Address some Questions of Phoenician Grammar and Syntax found in the Kulamuwa Inscription |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093102/http://boothhouse.com/content/Booth_Using_Corpus_Linguistics.pdf |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df= }}. 2007. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;) refers either to a [[Ethnicity|people group]] of greater-than-average height and stature (possibly [[Giant (mythology)|giants]]), or to dead ancestors who are residents of the Netherworld.

== Etymology ==
There are two main groups of etymological hypotheses explaining the origins of the biblical ''rephaim''. The first group proposes that this is a native Hebrew term, which could be derived either from the root רפא or רפה. The first root, רפא, conveys the meaning of healing and is realized in the words such as Heb. &lt;i&gt;rofe&lt;/i&gt; (a physician) or ''refuah'' (medicine). The second root, רפה, means being weak, powerless.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles A. Briggs C.A., ''A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament'' (Oxford, 1907/2013) [BDB], (CD-ROM), 9242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Ludwig, and Walter Baumgartner. 2002. ''The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament''. Leiden: Brill [HALOT]. (CD-ROM), 8014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. Laird., Gleason L. Archer, and Bruce K. Waltke. 2003. ''Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament''. Chicago: Moody Press [TWOT]. (CD-ROM), 2198d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of etymological hypotheses treat the word ''rephaim'' as a loan from some other ancient Semitic language. Among the proposals is the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''rabu'', a prince, but this explanation enjoys rather limited popularity. Far more support has been gained by the hypothesis which derives the Heb. ''refaim'' from the [[Ugaritic]] ''rpum'' which denotes the semi-deified deceased ancestors who are mentioned in such sources as the so called ''Rephaim Text'' ([[Keilschrift Texte aus Ugarit|KTU]] 1:20–22).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Theodore J. 1999. “Dead.” In Dictionary of Deities and Demons, pp. 223–231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rouillard-Bonraisin, Hedwige. 1999. “Rephaim.” In Dictionary of Deities and Demons, pp. 692–700.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the clash between these hypotheses and although the modern translations clearly distinguish between Rephaites as one of the tribes (e.g. Genesis 14:5; 15:18-21; Deuteronomy 2:11-20) and ''rephaim'' as the inhabitants of the underworld (e.g. Isaiah 14:9-11; 26:13-15), the same word is used in the original text. The use of ''rephaim'' in the Hebrew Bible suggests that behind the biblical narrative were the legends of some ancient indigenous people inhabiting the valleys of the land of Canaan which was subject to the gradual Hebrew conquest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|title=The Fallen (Or) Giants?

==Canaanite people group==
In the Hebrew Bible, "Rephaites" or "Rephaim" can describe an ancient race of giants in [[Iron Age]] [[Land of Israel|Israel]], or the places where these individuals were thought to have lived. According to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:5|CEV}}, King [[Chedorlaomer]] and his allies attacked and defeated the Rephaites at [[Ashteroth-Karnaim]]. Rephaites are also mentioned at {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:20|niv}}; {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|2:10-21|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|3:11|niv}}; {{Bibleverse||Joshua|12:4|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|13:12|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:8|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|17:15|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|18:16|niv}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:18-22|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Samuel|23:13|niv}}; and {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|11:15|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|14:9|niv}} and {{bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|20:4|niv}}.

In the biblical narrative, the [[Israelites]] were instructed to exterminate the previous inhabitants of the "[[promised land]]", i.e. [[Canaan]], which include various named peoples, including some unusually tall/large individuals. Several passages in the [[Book of Joshua]], and also {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|3:11|niv}}, suggest that [[Og]], the King of Bashan, was one of the last survivors of the Rephaim, and that his bed was 9 [[cubit|cubits]] long in ordinary cubits. (An ordinary cubit is the length of a man's forearm according to the [[New American Standard Bible]], or approximately 18 inches, which differs from a royal cubit. This makes the bed over 13 feet long, even longer if the cubit was based on a giant's forearm). [[Anak]], according to {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|2:11|niv}}, was a Rephaite.

The area of [[Moab]] at [[Ar (city)|Ar]] (the region east of the [[River Jordan|Jordan]]), before the time of [[Moses]], was also considered the land of the Rephaites. {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|2:18-21|niv}} notes that the [[Ammon]]ites called the Rephaites "Zamzummim". In {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|2:11|niv}}, the Moabites referred to them as the "[[Emite|Emim]]".

==Long dead ancestors==
Rephaim have also been considered the residents of the Netherworld (''[[Sheol]]'' in the Hebrew Bible) in more recent scholarship. Possible examples of this usage appear as "shades", "spirits" or "dead" in various translations of the Bible.  See: {{Bibleverse||Isa|14:9|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isa|26:14|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isa|26:19|niv}};  {{Bibleverse||Ps|88:11|niv}};  {{Bibleverse||Prov|2:18|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Prov|9:18|niv}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Prov|21:16|niv}};  {{Bibleverse||Job|26:5|niv}}, and possibly {{Bibleverse|2|Chron|16:12|niv}}, where we may read ''Repha'im'' as “dead ancestors” or "weakeners", as opposed to ''Rophe’im'', “doctors.” The Heb. root רפא means “heal,” and thus the masculine plural nominalized form of this root may indicate that these “deceased ancestors” could be invoked for ritual purposes that would benefit the living.&lt;ref&gt;Rivka Nir, R. Mark Shipp. ''Of Dead Kings and Dirges: Myth and Meaning in Isaiah 14:4b-21.'' p121 2002 - 197 "It is also possible that the distinction here is not between the Rephaim and non-Rephaim dead kings, but rather between the rpim qdmym (Ulkn, Tr 'limn, Sdn w Rdn, Trmn; the “ancient Rephaim”) and the more recent Rephaim (Ammishtamru, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Suriano ''The Politics of Dead Kings: Dynastic Ancestors in the Book of ...'' 2010 p160 "Unlike the texts from Ras Shamra, however, Israelite literature negatively portrayed the Rephaim in order to undermine a politically potent element that was otherwise embraced in Ugaritic tradition. The equation of the Rephaim as dead ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian B. Schmidt ''Israel's beneficent dead: ancestor cult and necromancy in ancient ... '' 1994 p267 "The Ugaritic rp 'um are repeatedly invoked as confirmation for the existence of both a living and dead biblical Rephaim. De Moor's theory comprises the most compelling and thoroughgoing proposal to date. According to this author,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Various ancient [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] texts are also replete with references to terms evidently cognate with ''Rephaim'' as the dead or dead kings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften|KAI]] 13.7-8, 14.8, 177.1; [[Corpus tablettes alphabetiques|CTA]] 6.6.46-52, CTA 20-22 = [[Keilschrift Texte aus Ugarit|KTU]] 1.161.  See the article by M.S. Smith, “Rephaim,” in the ''Anchor Bible Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis (1989)&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Lewis (professor of Hebrew Bible at Johns Hopkins University), ''Cults of the Dead in Ancient Israel and Ugarit'' (Scholars Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; undertakes a detailed study of several enigmatic funerary ritual texts from the ancient coastal city of Ugarit. Lewis concludes that the ''“Ugaritic Funerary Text”''&lt;ref&gt;[[Keilschrift Texte aus Ugarit|KTU]] 1.161 = Ras Shamra 34.126&lt;/ref&gt; provides important evidence for understanding Ugarit's cult of the dead, wherein beings called ''rapi'uma'', the long dead, and ''malakuma'', recently dead kings, were invoked in a funeral liturgy, presented with food/drink offerings, and asked to provide blessings for the reign of the current king. The many references to ''repha'im'' in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in contexts involving Sheol and dead spirits strongly suggests that many ancient Israelites imagined the spirits of the dead as playing an active and important role in securing blessings, healing, or other benefits in the lives of the living.&lt;ref&gt;On the role of the dead and burial customs in ancient Israelite society and the cultures of the ancient Levant generally, see L. Bloch-Smith's ''Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs About the Dead'' (Continuum, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The link between Titan and Poltergeist may very well be adduced from the verb stem, raphah, which means to sink or relax.  In Isaiah 5:24 it is the sinking down of hay in flame, in Judges 19:9 the decline of the day, and in Nehemiah 6:9 the sinking motion is attributed to the hands, as in 'Their hands shall be weakened from the work.'  The list of usages goes on: to withdraw, to abate, to lose heart, to let drop, to abandon or forsake, to let alone.  The Repha’im-as-Giants may loom large, but only in the metaphoric sense.  They are gigantic precisely because they have withdrawn into the mythic past.  Having relaxed their grip on the real world, they’ve become, as the saying goes, mere ghosts of their former selves." (Levin, 1997, p. 17)[iv] &lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Levin, Hezekiah’s Tunnel, 1997, Jerusalem, Ibis&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Schalkse Ruiters''''', translated as "Roguish Horsemen", was a Flemish humoristic TV talk and game show, broadcast on the TV channel [[Eén]] between late 1996 and early 1998. The program was a cross between a comedy show, a talk show, a game show and a [[mockumentary]]. Hosted by [[Bart De Pauw]] and [[Tom Lenaerts]] viewers were shown three video reports about three different topics. The people in the studio and viewers at home had to vote whether they believed each individual video to be real or staged? In between these reports [[hidden camera]] segments and comedy sketches were shown. 

At the time ''Schalkse Ruiters'' was notorious for their sensational reports, unpredictable atmosphere and enjoyable comedy. The final episode of the first season, when managing director of the [[Vlaamse Radio-en Televisieomroep]] (Flemish Public Radio and Television) [[Bert De Graeve]] was their guest, was watched by 2.166 million people. A [[ratings record]] that stood for decades, until it was surpassed by ''[[De Slimste Mens ter Wereld]]'' in 2012. The second season continued the high ratings. ''Schalkse Ruiters'' made [[Bart De Pauw]], [[Tom Lenaerts]], [[Michiel Devlieger]] and the comedy character de Man van Melle (The Man from [[Melle, Belgium|Melle]]) famous to a huge audience.

==Concept==

The show also started with images of De Pauw and Lenaerts riding horses through a green field while soundtrack music from the film ''[[Flight of the Intruder]]'' by [[Basil Poledouris]] was playing. &lt;ref name="bandpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="muziekweb1"/&gt; As they enter a peasant's village they are cheered as heroes. In the second season a similar intro was used, but set at the beach.

''Schalkse Ruiters'' worked from the principle that viewers shouldn't always believe everything they see on television to be real. That's why each episode showed three reports about which their special guest, the studio audience and the viewers at home had to guess whether they were real or fake? The studio audience (named ''Klein Vlaanderen'' (''Small Flanders'') by them always received a few seconds time to vote. When the time was up the hosts instantly checked how many of them had voted "true" or "not true". The show was broadcast every Sunday evening and had a different special guest each episode. His or her identity was kept a secret until the broadcast itself. 

In between the reports De Pauw and Lenaerts made jokes and showed sketch movies starring themselves. They often poked fun at the central host by showing archiving footage or [[hidden camera]] footage. Once again real footage was mixed in with staged footage. 

Whether the reports were real or not was only announced in the second part of the show. The first part was broadcast between 20.30 h and 21.30 h. Afterwards an episode of the police TV series ''[[Heterdaad]]'' was broadcast. When this was over, usually around 22.30h, the second part followed in which the correct answers were announced and which viewer at home won the full-screen television set that episode?

Sometimes viewers at home where asked to contribute something for the next episode. Usually these actions were part of a segment called ''Red Michiel'' (''Save Michiel''), named after [[Michiel Devlieger]], the man whom De Pauw and Lenaerts usually used for these viewers' requests. The segment made its debut in the third episode of the first season.

==History==

''Schalkse Ruiters'' started in december 1996 on TV1 (nowadays [[Eén]]) and starred Bart De Pauw and Tom Lenaerts as hosts. Originally [[Mark Uytterhoeven]] was set out to be one of the co-hosts, but he backed off again at the last moment. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/vijf-dingen-die-je-nog-niet-wist-over-de-schalkse-ruiters~a5568434/&lt;/ref&gt; De Pauw was a well known media star to certain audiences as actor and scriptwriter of the comedy series ''[[Buiten De Zone]]'' (1994-1996), while Lenaerts was well known since Uytterhoeven's improvisation show ''Onvoorziene Omstandigheden'' (1994). Since both men were relatively unknown TV stars ''Schalkse Ruiters'' only reached a small number of viewers.

It wasn't until after the second episode when the show grew out to be a hype. During the third report both hosts had managed to illegally get across all security controls of the Belgian airport [[Brussels Airport|Zaventem]] by using fake uniforms, forged badges and even sat in the cockpit of a [[Boeing]] before eventually sneaking out the airport again without anyone noticing something strange. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.een.be/programmas/de-generatieshow/90-bart-en-tom-dringen-de-luchthaven-binnen Bart and Tom breaks into Zaventem.]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day this broadcast was a huge media event and even made the news. It generated a huge discussion about the safety of the national airport. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/consulteren/publicatie2&amp;BLOKNR=20&amp;COLL=B&amp;LEG=1&amp;NR=40&amp;SUF=&amp;VOLGNR=&amp;LANG=fr Sécurité à l'aéroport de Zaventem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20161207_02613729/schalkse-ruiters-20-jaar-geleden-schreven-tom-lenaerts-en-bart-de-pauw-tv-geschiedenis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deredactie1"&gt;http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2831306&lt;/ref&gt; All this publicity caused their viewership to skyrocket, never to leave them again. By the time the first season ended, in March 1997, a second season became much-requested. It eventually was broadcast between 7 December 1997 until February 1998 to the same high ratings. 

==Running gags==

The show had numerous running gags, of which the Man van Melle was the most well known. This was a character played by De Pauw who wore a curly wig, fake moustache and a raincoat. He always appeared at least once in one sketch of every episode, where he always tried to get attention and begged attractive women to write him since he was "so lonely". He always concluded by naming his address, the Koekoekstraat nr. 70 in [[Melle, Belgium|Melle]]. Melle is a real Flemish village, but there was no street of that name when the series was broadcast. At a certain point the city council decided to name one of their new streets ''Koekoekstraat'' and painted a door with house number 70 on the wall. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hln.be/regio/melle/meer-volk-bij-barbier-dan-in-kerk-waarom-geen-barbierstraat~a56ec2ca/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blabr_20110221_001&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th episode of the first season the Man van Melle interviewed [[Pamela Anderson]]. &lt;ref name="deredactie1"/&gt;

==Stunts==
* Lenaerts and De Pauw tried to convince [[Bert De Graeve]], then Vice-President of [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]], to appear as guest in their show. This was a [[running gag]] from the very first episode. In the penultimate episode of the first season they asked their viewers to hang banners, signs, logos and all kinds of other ways to get De Graeve's attention and convince him to appear in their show. Within that very week the slogan could be read anywhere, even on streetcars and buses. Eventually De Graeve did turn up in the final episode of that season, broadcast on 2 March 1997, breaking TV ratings records. &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/20-jaar-schalkse-ruiters-hoe-twee-twintigers-tv-geschiedenis-schreven/article-longread-821091.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Association football player [[Franky Van der Elst]] won the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] in 1996. But it the object was stolen from his house and in an interview he insinuated that ''Schalkse Ruiters'' may have stolen it. At first De Pauw and Lenaerts denied this, but during the seventh episode of the first season the camera zoomed behind their desk and revealed that the award was indeed stolen by them, but with Van der Elst being in on the stunt. 
* During the tenth episode of the first season De Pauw and Lenaerts alluded that they might have won the TV award ''[[Gouden Oog]]'', which had been organized on rival channel [[vtm]] the evening before, but was only broadcast one day later, during their TV show. During one of the voting rounds the camera zoomed behind their desk to reveal that both awards were indeed there. This was all minutes before this was announced during the ''Gouden Oog'' broadcast on vtm. 
* During the final episode of the first season it was revealed that De Pauw and Lenaerts had sung the lyrics to the pop song "Ogen Zo Groen" by the band B-Boys, while the artists themselves merely playbacked. This made audiences far more interested in the song than they had been before. &lt;ref name="deredactie1"/&gt;
* A few months before the second season De Pauw and Lenaerts once again made news headlines. They had been caught making a TV commercial for the Belgian beer brand ''[[Stella Artois]]'' which was broadcast on vtm. The commercial showed two Russian sailors leaving their ship and being brought to a pub where they are greeted with two pints of beer. The sailors were in fact De Pauw and Lenaerts in disguise and their "Russian" was in fact Dutch, but played in reverse. When played in normal conditions their entire dialogue was in fact a [[hidden message]] where they revealed who they really were and asked viewers to watch ''Schalkse Ruiters''. VTM had no idea of this stunt and when they found out it was a [[hoax]] the commercial was instantly pulled from the air again. De Pauw and Lenaerts had intended this commercial to be broadcast during the first episode of their next season, when the head of vtm, [[Mike Verdrengh]], would be their special guest. Months later during that episode Verdrengh was indeed their guest and they admitted that they had been caught. After showing the clip to the viewers again, De Pauw joked that they had other hidden commercials too, but this was merely a parody of a popular [[Coca-Cola]] commercial starring the Man Van Melle instead of an attractive Coca Cola delivery boy. 
* In the third episode of the second season an unknown Flemish man was invited as their co-host, instead of a famous one: Luc Vande Walle. He was selected through a broadcast of the radio show ''Hallo Hautekiet''. 

==Awards==

''Schalkse Ruiters'' won Humo's Prijs van de Kijker both in 1996 and 1997. In 1997 it was also awarded De HA! van Humo, along with ''[[Terug naar Oosterdonk]]''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.humo.be/humo-archief/316981/lofrede-van-de-redactie-de-ha-van-humo-2014-gaat-naar-de-ideale-wereld-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch remake==

In 1998 Dutch TV channel [[RTL 4]] created a Dutch TV remake starring Bas van Werven and Romel van Tiel, but was no huge success. De Pauw and Lenaerts claimed it copied their [[TV format|format]] too closely, down to the colour of their sweaters. Another remake, ''De Firma List &amp; Bedrog'', was hosted by Irene Moors a few years later. 

==Sequel==

In the spring of 2001 De Pauw and Lenaerts returned with a new comedic talk show named ''Mannen op de Rand van een Zenuwinzinking''. The show had a different concept and talked about how men could please women nowadays. Although it wasn't announced as a sequel to ''Schalkse Ruiters'' many viewers still regarded it as such, merely because it was hosted on Sunday evenings again and hosted by De Pauw and Lenaerts again in a somewhat similar TV studio with sketches and [[hidden camera]] reports. Archive footage from this show is still often confused with that from ''Schalkse Ruiters''.

'''Sex magic''' (sometimes spelled '''sex magick''') is any type of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] used in [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]], [[Theurgy|ritualistic]] or otherwise [[Magic (religion)|religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] pursuits. One practice of sex magic is using the energy of [[sexual arousal]] or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise posited by sex magicians is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]] one's normally perceived reality.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Paschal Beverly Randolph==
{{Main article|Paschal Beverly Randolph}}

[[File:Randolph-1.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Paschal Beverly Randolph]]
The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American [[occultist]] [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], under the heading of ''The Mysteries of Eulis'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man has an intelligent and loving wife, with whom he is in complete accord,  he can work out the problems [of how to achieve magical results] by her aid. They are a radical soul-sexive series of energies...The rite is a prayer in all cases, and the most powerful [that] earthly beings can employ...it is best for both man and wife to act together for the attainment of the mysterious objects sought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Success in any case requires the [[wikt:adjuvant|adjuvancy]] of a superior woman. THIS IS THE LAW! A harlot or low woman is useless for all such lofty and holy purposes, and just so is a bad, impure, passion-driven apology for a man. The woman shall not be one who accepts rewards for compliance; nor a virgin; or under eighteen years of age; or another's wife; yet must be one who hath known man and who has been and still is capable of intense mental, volitional and affectional energy, combined with perfect sexive and orgasmal ability; for it requires a double crisis to succeed...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The entire mystery can be given in very few words, and they are: An upper room; absolute personal, mental, and moral cleanliness both of the man and wife. An observance of the law just cited during the entire term of the experiment -- 49 days. Formulate the desire and keep it in mind during the whole period and especially when making the nuptive prayer, during which no word may be spoken, but the thing desired be strongly thought...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Randolph himself was greatly influenced by the work of English [[Rosicrucian]] and scholar of [[phallicism]], [[Hargrave Jennings]].

==Ida Craddock==
{{Main article|Ida Craddock|Dianism}}

In the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer [[Ida Craddock]] published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' and ''Psychic Wedlock''. [[Aleister Crowley]] reviewed ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' in the pages of his journal ''The Equinox'', stating that it was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous.

...This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sexual techniques from Craddock's ''Psychic Wedlock'' were later reproduced in ''Sex Magick'' by O.T.O. initiate [[Louis T. Culling]], a disciple of [[C.F. Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;Culling, Louis T. Sex Magick. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordo Templi Orientis==
[[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Carl Kellner]], the founder of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], (O.T.O.), claimed to have learned the techniques of sex magic from three adepts in this art.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;The Magical World of Aleister Crowley, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1904, references to these secrets, Kellner, and the O.T.O. began appearing in "an obscure German [[masonic]] periodical called [[Oriflamme]]."&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt; In 1912, the editors of ''Oriflamme'' announced:

{{quote|Our order possesses the '''key''' which opens up all Masonic and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] secrets, namely, the teachings of sexual magic, and this teaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of [[Freemasonry]] and all systems of religion.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt;}}

===Aleister Crowley===
[[File:Aleister Crowley, Golden Dawn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Crowley in [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] garb]]Aleister Crowley became involved with [[Theodor Reuss]] and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'' between 1912 and 1913.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Francis ''The Magical World of Aleister Crowley'' page 80&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX° (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him "Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains."&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;&lt;ref name=urban /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/lib333.htm |title=Book of Lies |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |year=1921 |page=6 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |quote=Shortly after publication [of the ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|Book of Lies]]''], the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the O.T.O.) came to me... He said that since I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the Order, I must be allowed the IX {degree} and obligated in regard to it. I protested that I knew no such secret. He said `But you have printed it in the plainest language'. I said that I could not have done so because I did not know it. He went to the bookshelves; taking out a copy of THE BOOK OF LIES, he pointed to a passage... It instantly flashed upon me. The entire symbolism not only of Free Masonry but of many other traditions blazed upon my spiritual vision. From that moment the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my mind. I understood that I held in my hands the key to the future progress of humanity... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]] in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;
* VIII°: [[Masturbation|masturbatory]] or autosexual magical techniques were taught, referred as the ''Lesser Work of Sol''
* IX°: [[Sexual intercourse|heterosexual]] magical techniques were taught
* XI°: [[anal intercourse]] magical techniques were taught.

Professor Hugh Urban, Professor of Comparative Religion at [[The Ohio State University]], noted Crowley's emphasis on sex as "the supreme magical power".&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;Urban, Hugh. ''[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/Unleashing_the_Beast.htm Unleashing the Beast: Aleister Crowley, [[tantra]] and sex magic in late Victorian England]. [[Ohio State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley:
{{quote|''[[The Book of the Law]]'' solves the sexual problem completely. Each individual has an absolute right to satisfy his sexual instinct as is physiologically proper for him. The one injunction is to treat all such acts as sacraments. One should not eat as the brutes, but in order to enable one to do one's will. The same applies to sex. We must use every faculty to further the one object of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister (1970). ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'', [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/chapter87.html ch. 87]. New York: Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux {{ISBN|0-8090-3591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Writings on sex magic====
{{Main article|Works of Aleister Crowley|Libri of Aleister Crowley}}
Crowley wrote extensively on the topic of sex magick. Some of these works were published and made available to the general public, others were secret and could only be obtained by initiates of ''Ordo Templi Orientis''.
* ''Liber IAO'' - IAO. Sexual Magick. Gives three methods of attainment through a willed series of thoughts. The active form of Liber CCCXLV.
* ''De Nuptis Secretis Deorum Cum Hominibus'' - Sexual magick
* ''[[Wikisource:Liber Stellae Rubeae|Liber Stellae Rubeae]]'' - According to Crowley, a secret ritual of Apep, the heart of IAO-OAI, delivered unto V.V.V.V.V. for his use in a certain matter of The Book of the Law (''Liber AL vel Legis''). Sexual Magick veiled in symbolism.
* ''Liber Agape vel C vel Azoth'' - ''The Book of the Unveiling of the [[Sangraal]]'' wherein it is spoken of the Wine of the Sabbath of the Adepts. Secret instructions of the ninth degree of the O.T.O. (Sex Magick)
* ''[[Wikisource:Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni|Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni]]'' - A perfect account of the task of the Exempt Adept considered under the symbols of a particular plane, not the intellectual. Sexual magick veiled in symbolism.
* ''[[Wikisource:Liber A'ash vel Capricorni Pneumatici|Liber A'ash vel Capricorni Pneumatici]]'' - Analyzes the nature of the creative magical force in man, explains how to awaken it, how to use it and indicates the general as well as the particular objects to be gained thereby. Sexual magick heavily veiled in symbolism.
* ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'' - includes some techniques in symbolic language, including extended mutual [[oral sex]] (Chapter 69) while intoxicated on [[hashish]].
* ''The Paris Working'' - A record of homosexual magick operations.
* ''Energized Enthusiasm'' - An essay developing the idea of creativity as a sexual phenomenon. Specially adapted to the task of attainment of control of the [[Body of Light]], development of intuition, and [[Hatha yoga]].

==Arnold Krumm-Heller==
According to [[Samael Aun Weor]], [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] taught sexual magic without [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="krumm"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Glorian Publishing |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=GIAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maria de Naglowska ==
[[Maria de Naglowska]] (1883–1936) was a Russian occultist, mystic, author and journalist who wrote and taught about sexual magical ritual practices while also being linked with the Parisian surrealist movement. She established and led an occult society known as the Confrérie de la Flèche d'or (Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow) in Paris from 1932 to 1935. In 1931, she compiled, translated and published in French a collection of published and unpublished writings by American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph on the subject of sexual magic and magic mirrors. Her translation and publication of Randolph's previously little known ideas and teachings was the source of Randolph's subsequent influence in European magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Versluis|first=Arthur|title=The Occult in Nineteenth Century America|year=2005|publisher=The Davies Group|location=Aurora, CO|isbn=1-888570-83-0|pages=29|authorlink=The Occult in Nineteenth Century America|editor=Gutierrez, Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She augmented the text with what she claimed were some of his oral teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deveney|first=John Patrick|title=Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist|year=1997|publisher=State University of New York Press|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she published a semi-autobiographical novella, ''Le Rite sacré de l'amour magique'' (The Sacred Ritual of Magical Love.)

Later that year, she also published ''La Lumière du sexe'' (The Light of Sex), a mystic treatise and guide to sexual ritual that was required reading for those seeking to be initiated into the Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow. Her later book on advanced sexual magic practices, ''Le Mystère de la pendaison'' (The Hanging Mystery) details her advanced teachings on the Third Term of the Trinity and the spiritually transformative power of sex, and the practice of [[Erotic asphyxiation|erotic ritual hanging]] and other sensory deprivation practices. Beyond occult subjects, Naglowska also influenced the [[Surrealism|surrealist art movement]]. The ''Lexique succinct de l'érotisme'' in the catalog of the 1959 International Surrealist Exhibition in Paris noted her important influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosemont|first=Penelope|title=Surrealist Women: An International Anthology|year=1998|publisher=Athlone Press|isbn=9780485300888|pages=lvi and xlii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrealist [[Sarane Alexandrian]] wrote a detailed account of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexandrian|first=Sarane|title=Les Libérateurs de l'amour|year=1977|pages=185–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Strange Brew''''' (also known as '''''The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew''''') is a 1983 Canadian [[comedy film]] starring the popular ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' characters [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]], portrayed by [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Rick Moranis]], who also served as co-directors. Co-stars include [[Max von Sydow]], [[Paul Dooley]], [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[Angus MacInnes]].

Loosely based on elements of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', most of the film was shot in [[Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Parts were also filmed in [[Prince George, British Columbia]].

==Plot==
Two unemployed brothers, [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]] ([[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]), place a live mouse in a beer bottle in an attempt to [[blackmail]] the local [[The Beer Store|beer store]] into giving them free Elsinore beer, but are told to take up the matter with management at the Elsinore brewery. The brothers are given jobs on the [[Assembly line|bottling line]] inspecting for mice in the bottles.

Meanwhile, the evil Brewmeister Smith ([[Max von Sydow]]) is perfecting a secret plan to take over the world by placing a mind-control drug in Elsinore beer which, while rendering the consumer docile, also makes him or her attack others when certain musical tones are played. Smith tests this adulterated beer on patients of the neighbouring Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane, which is connected to the brewery by underground tunnels.

Bob and Doug learn that the brewery's former owner, John Elsinore, has recently died under mysterious circumstances and his daughter Pam ([[Lynne Griffin]]) has been given full control of the Elsinore brewery. While exploring the massive brewery, they find a shuttered cafeteria containing an old Galactic Border Patrol video game, which supernaturally reveals that Brewmeister Smith murdered John Elsinore and that Pam's bumbling Uncle Claude ([[Paul Dooley]]) was deeply involved. Bob recognizes a brewery employee as one-time hockey great Jean "Rosie" LeRose ([[Angus MacInnes]]), who suffered a career-ending [[nervous breakdown]] and has fallen under Smith's control.

Eventually, Bob and Doug wander into the Brewmeister's operations room while he is away, and Doug takes a [[floppy disk]] containing a video of John Elsinore's murder (thinking it is a "[[New wave music|new wave]] [[Extended play|EP]]" and not realizing the importance of its contents). Smith and Claude tranquilize the brothers and arrange to frame them for murder, concealing Pam and her father's friend, Henry Green, in beer kegs in the back of their sabotaged van, and instruct the brothers to deliver the kegs to a party. Unable to stop, the brothers crash the van into [[Lake Ontario]]. All survive (Pam with apparent memory loss), and the brothers are arrested.

The brothers' antics at their trial cause the judge to declare them insane and put them under Brewmeister Smith's care at the asylum. Rosie soon finds them and helps them escape, and they find and rescue Pam. Having figured out Brewmeister's plan, Rosie foments an uprising among the brainwashed mental-patient test subjects. The brothers separate for the first time in their lives; Doug helps Rosie overpower Brewmeister Smith and the spirit of John Elsinore, possessing the brewery's electrical system, fatally strikes him with lightning. Meanwhile, Smith has locked Pam and Bob in a brewery tank and is filling it with beer; they escape this possible death when Bob consumes all the beer, expanding to a cartoonish size.

John Elsinore's ghost warns them that Smith has already shipped tainted beer to [[Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest|Oktoberfest]] and urges them to prevent the beer from being consumed. The police accompany the brothers back to their house to retrieve their dog, Hosehead, to invade the party. Enticed by promises of free beer and sausages, Hosehead leaps into the air and flies over the city like [[Superman]]. He crashes into the tent at the celebration and, mistaken for a skunk, frightens people away from the tainted beer. In the end, the McKenzie Brothers save the day and Pam and Rosie find true love. Bob and Doug are allowed to haul away the contaminated beer, apparently to try to drink it all. The movie ends with an over-the-credits commentary by Bob and Doug about the movie and those who worked on it.

==Production==
In 1981, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas recorded a Bob and Doug McKenzie comedy album, ''[[The Great White North (album)|The Great White North]]'', which sold a million copies.&lt;ref name="godfrey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Godfrey | first = Stephen | coauthors = | title = Hoser Brothers Hope Beer Film will Take Off, Eh? | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 26, 1983 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this success, they thought about parlaying that success into a feature film.&lt;ref name="plume"&gt;{{cite news | last = Plume | first = Kenneth | coauthors = | title = Interview with Dave Thomas | work = [[IGN]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 10, 2000 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035845p1.html | accessdate = 2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After fellow ''SCTV'' cast member [[John Candy]] got an offer from [[Universal Pictures]] to do a film called ''[[Going Berserk]]'', Moranis and Thomas started talking about writing a screenplay for a Bob and Doug film. Andrew Alexander, executive producer for ''SCTV,'' reminded them that he had exclusive contracts with the two men and that if they wrote a script, he would sue them.&lt;ref name="plume" /&gt; Moranis and Thomas soon found themselves faced with the challenge of expanding their improvisations on ''SCTV'' from "two guys talking about how hard it was to get parking spaces in donut shops to a full-length story", Thomas said in an interview.&lt;ref name="godfrey" /&gt;

Moranis and Thomas hired [[Steve De Jarnatt]] to write the first draft.&lt;ref name="plume" /&gt; Initially, Thomas told De Jarnatt that he wanted to base the film's story on ''[[Hamlet]]'', but De Jarnatt's draft was too faithful to the play and he was told be more creative with the parallels. Moranis' and Thomas' agents sent the script to various Hollywood studios, and a few days later they had a deal with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] based not on the script but on record sales, "the breakout potential, and the fact that it was being advertised on a television show", Thomas remembers.&lt;ref name="plume" /&gt; MGM was unhappy with the script because Bob and Doug were improvised characters done in their "comic voices" and they felt that nobody but themselves could write for these characters.&lt;ref name="plume" /&gt; Thomas began rewriting the script without Moranis, who was now uncertain about doing the film. After working on the first 50 pages, Moranis took a look at what Thomas had done and they then worked together rewriting it. However, they were not sure just how much they could legally change and did most of the changes in the first third of the script, including the addition of Bob and Doug's science fiction film, ''Mutants of 2051 A.D.'', which Bob and Doug were shown watching in a movie theater, causing a riot. Thomas remembers that the script was "far more bizarre and conceptual in the beginning ... if we had been able to rewrite the whole thing, we would have made the whole thing like that".&lt;ref name="plume" /&gt;

Originally, Moranis and Thomas were not going to direct or write the film but ended up doing both with the guidance of executive producer Jack Grossberg, who had produced films by [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Woody Allen]]. They were given a budget of $5 million.&lt;ref name="godfrey" /&gt; Before filming, all of the major breweries wanted the McKenzie brothers to appear in beer advertisements. The filmmakers had the promise of the [[Molson]] Brewery, but once the brewery found out that there was a joke in the film about putting a mouse in a beer bottle, they distanced themselves from the film. The filmmakers were also banned from filming in a [[The Beer Store|Brewers Retail]] store, and from using the name "Brewers Retail". The exterior shots of the store (now a [[Tim Hortons]]/[[Pizza Pizza]]) were filmed in Scarborough, Ontario, at the corner of Eglinton and Midland Avenues. The [[KFC]] and [[Petro-Canada]] gas station seen in the background still exist. The filmmakers built a replica of a Brewers Retail store at a cost of more than $45,000, calling it "The Beer Store" (Brewers Retail later changed the name of its stores to "The Beer Store", and they continue to operate under that name). Filming also took place at the Old Fort Brewing Co. in Prince George, British Columbia.&lt;ref name="godfrey" /&gt; The emergency vehicles used during filming were all real [[Metropolitan Toronto Police]] [[squad cars]]. The ambulances used briefly were on loan from [[Toronto EMS|Metropolitan Toronto Ambulance]].

==Reception==
''Strange Brew'' currently holds a 74% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_brew/ |title=Strange Brew |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "Anyone who's partial to the McKenzies' humor doubtless has a fondness for beer. The price of a ticket could buy enough beer for an experience at least as memorable as this one".&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | coauthors = | title = Men in Quest of Beer | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 8 | language = | publisher = | date = August 26, 1983 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold, in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "Neither triumph nor fiasco, ''Strange Brew'' leaves plenty of room for improvement, but I hope Thomas and Moranis get the chance to demonstrate that they've learned a lot from the mixed assortment of nuttiness in their first movie comedy".&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | coauthors = | title = Silly, Promising ''Brew'' From the Great White North | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = B4 | language = | publisher = | date = August 30, 1983 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[Jay Scott]] wrote, "What's terrific about the McKenzie Brothers is their offhand depiction of two English-Canadian working-class dimwits ... and what's terrific about the movie is its equally offhand surrealism".&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite news | last = Scott | first = Jay | coauthors = | title = Hosers brew up a batch of real big-screen fun, eh | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 27, 1983 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack album==
{{Main|Strange Brew (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack album was released in August 1983 by [[PolyGram]] and [[Anthem Records]] of Canada (ANR 1-1042). (Full title: ''The Adventures of Bob and Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew - Excerpts from the Original Soundtrack''). Most of the album consisted of comedy sketches and film dialogue, while the music sampling was usually accompanied by the characters' commentary. The main title theme was performed by Thomas' brother, [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]]. The album was produced by Marc Giacomelli, Rick Shurman and Ian Thomas. 
The soundtrack won the Canadian [[Juno Award]] for Best Comedy Album in 1984. Moranis and Thomas accepted the award in character at the awards ceremony on 5 December 1984, which was hosted by [[Joe Flaherty]] and SCTV alum [[Andrea Martin]].
The album was only available for a short time and currently remains out of print. This was the last album released by the duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Brew-Bob-Doug-McKenzie/dp/B000P87G4K/ref=sr_1_46?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343501656&amp;sr=1-46&amp;keywords=strange+brew |title=Strange Brew: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobanddoug.com/albums.html |title=Albums |publisher=BobAndDoug.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/music_strangebrew.htm |title=Strange Brew Soundtrack and Movie Music - The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion picture score==
As with the soundtrack album, the motion picture score was released for a short time and remains out of print. The album runs approximately 63 minutes and was composed and conducted by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Brew-Complete-Motion-Picture/dp/B0030MKM7Q/ref=pd_sim_sbs_m_3 |title=Strange Brew: Complete Motion Picture Score: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
To promote the film, a beer-shaped paperback book was released in 1983, ''The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie in Strange Brew: The Book About the Movie About the TV Show About the Men!''. The book featured pictures of the characters, stills from ''Strange Brew'', comics, puzzles and much of the characters' humor. The book also included a joke library card with the names of numerous Canadian celebrities who had checked it out. The book was only available for a brief period and is currently out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Adventures-Doug-McKenzie-Strange-Brew/dp/0458966207/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344699186&amp;sr=1-3 |title=Adventures of Bob + Doug McKenzie in Strange Brew: The Book About the Movie About the TV Show About the men!: 9780458966202: Books |publisher=Amazon.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soapinthebathroom.com/strange-brew-book/ |title=Pop Rewind — Strange Brew Book |publisher=Soapinthebathroom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202140514/http://www.soapinthebathroom.com/strange-brew-book/ |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
A sequel to the film, entitled ''Home Brew'', was planned for production in 1999, but financing fell through at the last minute. Co-written by Dave Thomas and Paul Flaherty, the film was to be directed by Flaherty, and [[Dan Aykroyd]] was on board to play the part of friend Rick Ripple. Principal photography was to begin on July 19, 1999 in [[Toronto]]. At one point, [[Todd McFarlane]] was to step in as executive producer to revive financing for the film, but never followed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~bobnet/news/200005170427.html |title=BobNET: Dave Thomas Interview |publisher=Execulink.com |date=2000-05-17 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot, according to a Maple Palm (Dave Thomas' production company) release, would feature Bob and Doug, now working as garbage men, being convinced by a fast-talking insurance salesman (Aykroyd) to get into the microbrewing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sctvguide.ca/episodes/as_gwn.htm |title=SCTV Guide - After SCTV - Bob and Doug McKenzie |publisher=Sctvguide.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superstition''' is a pejorative term for any belief or practice that is considered irrational: for example, if it arises from ignorance, a misunderstanding of science or [[causality]], a positive belief in fate or magic, or fear of that which is unknown. "Superstition" also refers to actions arising from [[irrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superstition&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''superstition'' is often used to refer to a religion not practiced by the majority of a given society regardless of whether the prevailing religion contains alleged superstitions.&lt;ref name="vyse21" /&gt; It is also commonly applied to beliefs and practices surrounding [[luck]], prophecy, and certain [[spiritual being]]s, particularly the belief that future events can be foretold by specific (apparently) unrelated prior events.&lt;ref name =vyse21&gt;{{cite book |last=Vyse |first=Stuart A |title=Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |isbn=978-0-1951-3634-0 |pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the pejorative implications of the term, items referred to in common parlance as ''superstition'' are commonly referred to as [[folk belief]] in [[folkloristics]].&lt;Ref name="FOLKLORISTICS"&gt;For discussion, see for example Georges, Robert A. &amp; Jones, Michael Owen. 1995.

==Etymology==
[[File:Black cat superstition.jpg|thumb|Some [[Cultural bias|cultures]] consider [[black cat]]s to signify good or bad [[luck]]]]
The word ''superstition'' is first used in English in the 15th century, modelled after an earlier French ''superstition''.
The earliest known use as an English noun occurs in ''[[Friar Daw's Reply]]'' (ca. 1420), where the ''[[Seven deadly sins|foure general synnes]]'' are enumerated as ''[[sedition|Cediciouns]], supersticions, [[gluttony|þe glotouns]], &amp; [[pride|þe proude]].''
The French word, together with its Romance cognates (Italian ''superstizione'', Spanish ''superstición'', Portuguese ''superstição'', Catalan ''superstició'') continues Latin ''superstitio''.

While the formation of the Latin word is clear, from the verb ''[[:wikt:supersto#Latin|super-stare]]'', "to stand over, stand upon; survive", its original intended sense is less clear. It can be interpreted as "‘standing over a thing in amazement or awe",&lt;ref&gt;"orig. a standing still over or by a thing; hence, amazement, wonder, dread, esp. of the divine or supernatural." Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=superstitio&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059 A Latin Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; but other possibilities have been suggested, e.g. the sense of ''excess'', i.e. over scrupulousness or over-ceremoniousness in the performing of religious rites, or else the ''survival'' of old, irrational religious habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Latin Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turcan |first=Robert |others=Nevill, Antonia (trans.) |title=The Cults of the Roman Empire |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford, England |year=1996 |pages=10–12 |isbn=978-0-631-20047-5}}. {{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |year=1989 |edition=Second |quote=The etymological meaning of L. superstitio is perhaps ‘standing over a thing in amazement or awe.’ Other interpretations of the literal meaning have been proposed, e.g., ‘excess in devotion, over-scrupulousness or over-ceremoniousness in religion’ and ‘the survival of old religious habits in the midst of a new order of things’; but such ideas are foreign to ancient Roman thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use as a Latin noun occurs in [[Plautus]], [[Ennius]] and later by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], with the meaning of ''art of divination''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giornopaganomemoria.it/superstitio.html|language=Italian|author=Manuela Simeoni|title=Uso della parola superstitio contro i pagani|date=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its use in the [[Classical Latin]] of [[Livy]] and [[Ovid]] (1st century BC), the term is used in the pejorative sense it still holds today, of an excessive fear of the gods or unreasonable religious belief, as opposed to ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', the proper, reasonable awe of the gods. [[Cicero]] derived the term from  ''superstitiosi'', lit. those who are "left over", i.e. "survivors", "descendants", connecting it with excessive anxiety of parents in hoping that their children would survive them to perform their necessary funerary rites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' '''II''', '''28''' (32), quoted in {{cite book |last=Wagenvoort |first=Hendrik |authorlink=Hendrik Wagenvoort |title=Pietas: selected studies in Roman religion |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Netherlands |year=1980 |page=236 |isbn=978-90-04-06195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Cicero]] distinguishes between ''religio'' and ''superstitio'', [[Lucretius]] uses only the term ''religio''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De rerum natura |author=Lucretius |url=http://www.latinovivo.com/Testintegrali/Lucrezindex.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (only with pejorative meaning). Throughout all of his work, he only distinguished between ''ratio'' and ''religio''.

The Latin verb ''superstare'' itself is comparatively young, being "perhaps not ante-[[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]]", first found in [[Livy]], and the meaning "to survive" is even younger, found in late or ecclesiastical Latin, for the first time in [[Ennodius]]. The use of the noun by Cicero and Horace thus predates the first attestation of the verb.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} It doesn't exclude that the verb might have been created and used after the name.

The term ''superstitio'', or ''superstitio vana'' "vain superstition", was applied in the 1st century to those religious cults in the [[Roman Empire]] which were officially outlawed. This concerned the religion of the [[druid]]s in particular, which was described as a ''superstitio vana'' by [[Tacitus]], and [[Early Christianity]], outlawed as a ''superstitio Iudaica'' in AD 80 by [[Domitian]].

==Superstition and religion==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Goddess Kaali.jpg]] --&gt;
Greek and Roman [[Polytheism|polytheists]], who modeled their relations with the gods on political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods, as a slave feared a cruel and capricious master. Such fear of the gods was what the Romans meant by "superstition" (Veyne 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;211).

Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' defines superstition as "any excess of religion in general", and links it specifically with [[paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.629 |title=Superstition |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |accessdate=1 April 2015|date=2010-10-10 |last1=Louis |first1=Chevalier de Jaucourt (Biography) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church]]'', [[Martin Luther]] (who called the papacy "that fountain and source of all superstitions") accuses the popes of superstition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For there was scarce another of the celebrated bishoprics that had so few learned pontiffs; only in violence, intrigue, and superstition has it hitherto surpassed the rest. For the men who occupied the Roman&amp;nbsp;See a thousand years ago differ so vastly from those who have since come into power, that one is compelled to refuse the name of Roman pontiff either to the former or to the latter.&lt;ref name="Steinhaeuser1915"&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3xIAAAAMAAJ |title=Works of Martin&amp;nbsp;Luther: With Instructions and Notes |date=1915 |page=291 |chapter=The Babylonian Captivity §&amp;nbsp;The Sacrament of Extreme Unction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3xIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA291 |last=Luther |first=Martin |editor1-last=Jacobs |editor1-first=Henry Eyster |editor2-last=Spaeth |editor2-first=Adolph |translator-last=Steinhaeuser |translator-first=Albert&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;W. |publisher=A.&amp;nbsp;J.

The current ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' considers superstition [[sin]]ful in the sense that it denotes "a perverse excess of religion", as a demonstrated lack of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] in [[divine providence]]&amp;nbsp;(¶ 2110), and a violation of the first of the [[Ten Commandments]].
The ''Catechism'' is a defense against the accusation that Catholic [[doctrine]] is superstitious:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Superstition is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. ''{{bibleref|Matthew|23:16–22}}''&amp;nbsp;(¶ 2111)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Superstition and psychology==
{{main|Magical thinking|Placebo|Effective theory}}

=== Origins ===
====Behaviorism perspective====
In 1948, behavioral psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] published an article in the ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', in which he described his [[pigeon]]s exhibiting what appeared to be superstitious behaviour. One pigeon was making turns in its cage, another would swing its head in a pendulum motion, while others also displayed a variety of other behaviours. Because these behaviors were all done ritualistically in an attempt to receive food from a dispenser, even though the dispenser had already been programmed to release food at set time intervals regardless of the pigeons' actions, Skinner believed that the pigeons were trying to influence their feeding schedule by performing these actions. He then extended this as a proposition regarding the nature of superstitious behavior in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B. F. |year=1948 |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/ |title='Superstition' in the Pigeon |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=168–172 |doi=10.1037/h0055873 |pmid=18913665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner's theory regarding superstition being the nature of the pigeons' behaviour has been challenged by other psychologists such as Staddon and Simmelhag, who theorised an alternative explanation for the pigeons' behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staddon |first=J. E. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Simmelhag |first2=V. L. |year=1971 |title=The 'supersitition' experiment: A reexamination of its implications for the principles of adaptive behaviour |journal=Psychological Review |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1037/h0030305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite challenges to Skinner's interpretation of the root of his pigeons' superstitious behaviour, his conception of the [[reinforcement|reinforcement schedule]] has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans. Originally, in Skinner's animal research, "some pigeons responded up to 10,000 times without reinforcement when they had originally been conditioned on an ''intermittent reinforcement'' basis."&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;Schultz &amp; Schultz (2004, 238).{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the other reinforcement schedules (e.g., fixed ratio, fixed interval), these behaviours were also the most resistant to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]].&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; This is called the ''partial reinforcement effect'', and this has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans. To be more precise, this effect means that, whenever an individual performs an action expecting a reinforcement, and none seems forthcoming, it actually creates a sense of persistence within the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carver, Charles S.  |author2=Scheier, Michael  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Perspectives on personality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEHuAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |isbn=978-0-205-37576-9 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strongly parallels superstitious behaviour in humans because the individual feels that, by continuing this action, reinforcement will happen; or that reinforcement has come at certain times in the past as a result of this action, although not all the time, but this may be one of those times.

==== Evolutionary/cognitive perspective ====
From a simpler perspective, [[natural selection]] will tend to reinforce a tendency to generate weak associations or [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] - rules of thumb - that are overgeneralized. If there is a strong survival advantage to making correct associations, then this will outweigh the negatives of making many incorrect, "superstitious" associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |author=Foster, Kevin R. and [[Hanna Kokko|Kokko, Hanna]] |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0981 |year=2009 |volume=276 |pmid=18782752 |issue=1654 |pmc=2615824 |pages=31–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that there may be connections between OCD and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;de Silva, Padmal and Rachman, Stanley (2004) ''Obsessive-compulsive Disorder'', Oxford University Press, p. 34, {{ISBN|0198520824}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be connected to [[hygiene]].

A recent theory by Jane Risen proposes that superstitions are intuitions that people acknowledge to be wrong, but acquiesce to rather than correct when they arise as the intuitive assessment of a situation. Her theory draws on [[Dual process theory|dual-process]] models of reasoning. In this view, superstitions are the output of "System 1" reasoning that are not corrected even when caught by "System 2".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risen|first=Jane L.|title=Believing what we do not believe: Acquiescence to superstitious beliefs and other powerful intuitions.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=123|issue=2|pages=182–207|doi=10.1037/rev0000017|pmid=26479707|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanisms ===
People seem to believe that superstitions influence events by changing the likelihood of currently possible outcomes rather than by creating new possible outcomes. In sporting events, for example, a lucky ritual or object is thought to increase the chance that an athlete will perform at the peak of their ability, rather than increasing their overall ability at that sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamerman|first=Eric J.|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2015-03-01|title=Reliance on Luck Identifying Which Achievement Goals Elicit Superstitious Behavior|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/3/323|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=323–335|doi=10.1177/0146167214565055|issn=0146-1672|pmid=25617118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, people whose goal is to perform well are more likely to rely on "supernatural assistance" - lucky items and rituals - than are people whose goal is to improve their skills and abilities and learn in the same context.

Psychologist Stuart Vyse has pointed out that until about 2010, "[m]ost researchers assumed superstitions were irrational and focused their attentions on discovering why people were superstitious." Vyse went on to describe studies that looked at the relationship between performance and superstitious rituals. Preliminary work has indicated that such rituals can reduce stress and thereby improve performance, but, Vyse has said, "...not because they are superstitious but because they are rituals.... So there is no real magic, but there is a bit of calming magic in performing a ritualistic sequence before attempting a high-pressure activity.... Any old ritual will do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Do Superstitious Rituals Work? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=32–34 |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/do_superstitious_rituals_work |accessdate=3 June 2018 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603133012/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/do_superstitious_rituals_work |archivedate=3 June 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occurrence ===
People tend to attribute events to supernatural causes (in psychological jargon, "external causes") most often under two circumstances. 
# People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is unlikely than if it is likely. In other words, the more surprising the event, the more likely it is to evoke a supernatural explanation. This is believed to stem from an effectance motivation - a basic desire to exert control over one's environment. When no natural cause can explain a situation, attributing an event to a superstitious cause may give people some sense of control and ability to predict what will happen in their environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waytz|first=Adam|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|last3=Epley|first3=Nicholas|last4=Monteleone|first4=George|last5=Gao|first5=Jia-Hong|last6=Cacioppo|first6=John T.|title=Making sense by making sentient: Effectance motivation increases anthropomorphism.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=99|issue=3|pages=410–435|doi=10.1037/a0020240|pmid=20649365|year=2010|citeseerx=10.1.1.206.2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is negative than positive. This is called ''negative agency bias''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|title=Negativity bias in attribution of external agency.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=138|issue=4|pages=535–545|doi=10.1037/a0016796|pmid=19883135|year=2009|citeseerx=10.1.1.212.2333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston Red Sox fans, for instance, attributed the failure of their team to win the world series for 86 years to the [[Curse of the Bambino|curse of the bambino:]] a curse placed on the team for trading Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees so that the team owner could fund a Broadway musical. When the Red Sox finally won the world series in 2004, however, the team's success was attributed to skill of the team and the rebuilding effort of the new owner and general manager. More commonly, people are more likely to perceive their computer to act according to its own intentions when it malfunctions than functions properly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Superstition and politics==
[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' uses the term ''superstition'' explaining that in [[ancient Rome]] that belief maintained the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|empire]], operating as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, Josephine M. (2007) ''The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde'', Oxford University Press, Volume IV, p. 337, {{ISBN|0191568449}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to superstition==
Opposition to superstition was first recorded in [[ancient Greece]], where philosophers such as [[Protagoras]] and the [[Epicureans]] exhibited [[agnosticism]] or aversion to religion and myths, and [[Plato]]{{spnd}}especially his [[Allegory of the Cave]]{{spnd}} and [[Aristotle]] both present their work as parts of a search for truth.

In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], the existence of gods was actively debated both among philosophers and theologians, and opposition to superstition arose consequently. The poem ''{{lang|la|[[De rerum natura]]}}'', written by the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] further developed the opposition to superstition. [[Cicero]]’s work ''{{lang|la|[[De natura deorum]]}}'' also had a great influence on the development of the modern concept of superstition as well as the word itself. Where [[Cicero]] distinguished ''{{lang|la|superstitio}}'' and ''{{lang|la|religio}}'', [[Lucretius]] used only the term ''{{lang|la|religio}}''. [[Cicero]], for whom ''{{lang|la|superstitio}}'' meant “excessive fear of the gods” wrote that “''{{lang|la|superstitio, non religio, tollenda est}}'' ”, which means that only superstition, and not religion, should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filosofico.net/lucrezioo.htm |title=Il IV libro del "De rerum natura"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Empire]] also made laws condemning those who excited excessive religious fear in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giornopaganomemoria.it/superstitio.html |title=Uso della parola superstitio contro i pagani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, the idea of God’s influence on the world’s events went mostly undisputed. [[Trial by ordeal|Trials by ordeal]] were quite frequent, even though [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (1194{{spnd}}1250{{nbsp}}{{abbr|AD|anno domini}}) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered “irrational”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore? |url=http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm |archivedate=2015-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rediscovery of lost classical works ([[The Renaissance]]) and scientific advancement led to a steadily increasing disbelief in superstition. A new, more [[rationalism|rationalistic]] lens was beginning to see use in exegesis. Opposition to superstition was central to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The first philosopher who dared to criticize superstition publicly and in a written form was [[Baruch Spinoza]], who was a key figure in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Helen Judy |last2=Reill |first2=Peter Hanns |title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-5335-3 |page=577 |quote=.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;equating all Christian beliefs except those accessible to unaided reason with superstition&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the project's three editors, Bill Lang, a professor of history at Portland State University, said one goal is to produce an online encyclopedia of Oregon's history "deep into the future."  Lang also said the Oregon Encyclopedia will be like a traditional encyclopedia based on verified facts, but with "stuff no one knows about.  Yet."  Lang contrasted the project with Wikipedia, which he suggested was not based on verified facts.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; All entries are fact-checked, peer-reviewed, and edited by the project's five editors. 

==History==
It was announced on February 14, 2008, Oregon's 149th birthday.  The project was initially launched as an online publication, with plans to eventually publish it in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Noelle | last = Crombie | title = Historians launch first-ever encyclopedia of Oregon | work = [[The Oregonian]] | date = February 13, 2008 | url = http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/02/historians_launch_firstever_en.html | accessdate = January 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214204301/http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/02/historians_launch_firstever_en.html|archive-date=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project originally aimed to produce about 3,000 articles;&lt;ref name="O-pedia" /&gt; as of March 2012, it had a total of about 1000, written by over 400 authors from around the state.

The encyclopedia's former development director, Sherry Manning, estimated the cost would be between $1 million and $2 million.&lt;ref name="O-pedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1214420110248550.xml&amp;coll=7|title=Call it Oregon-pedia|last=Muldoon|first=Katy|date=February 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130432/http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1214420110248550.xml&amp;coll=7|archive-date=2016-03-04|subscription=yes|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=January 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days before the announcement date, over $175,000 had been raised and another $500,000 was pending.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=60149&amp;sid=39&amp;fid=1|title=You could be a part of the state's online encyclopedia|date=February 10, 2008|archive-url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/registerguard/doc/377823827.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+10%2C+2008&amp;author=Mark+Baker+The+Register-Guard&amp;pub=The+Register+-+Guard&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=G.53&amp;desc=You+could+be+a+part+of+the+state%27s+online+encyclopedia|archive-date=2008|dead-url=yes|author=Mark Baker|work=[[The Register-Guard]]|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Tower of St. Olav''' is the one remaining tower of [[Vyborg Castle]]. It is a symbol and an architectural landmark of the city of [[Vyborg]].

== History ==
{{See also|Vyborg Castle}}
[[File:Vyborg Castle in 14th century.jpg|thumb|left|Vyborg Castle in 14th century]]
The fortress was conceived by [[Torkel Knutsson]], the [[Lord High Constable of Sweden]], who led in the 1290s a [[crusade]] to [[Karelia]], the [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|Third Finnish Crusade]], which was actually aimed against the Russian [[state of Novgorod]]. He chose the location of the new fortress to command the [[Bay of Vyborg]], which was a trading site already used by locals. From the bay, a river leads inland, ultimately connecting the place to several districts, lakes, and indirectly also to rivers going to [[Lake Ladoga]].

=== 1293 construction===
By request of [[Torkel Knutsson]] the main fortress tower was constructed in 1293.
According to the Russian military historians the first fortifications consisted of a rectangular [[donjon]] type [[tower]] and the closed perimeter of a [[defensive wall]], which surrounded the tower. 
Russian [[archaeological excavations]] confirm this fact.&lt;ref name="Tjulenev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tjulenev|first=V. A. |others=Sketch|trans-title=Studying of old Vyborg|script-title=ru:Изучение старого Выборга|year=1995 |volume=Building history of [[Vyborg castle]]|url=http://terijoki.spb.ru/vyborg-fortress/vf_middleages2.php|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The builders constructed the tower from huge boulders, according to traditions of the [[Watchtower|Italian fortification style]] then dominant in Europe. 
The tower was named for a legendary king of Norway, [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Sacred]], who confirmed Christianity in Scandinavia and was later canonised.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.antiq.info/archive/7285.html|title=The castle of Vyborg|date=May 2007|publisher=[http://www.antiq.info/eng/ Antiq.Info magazine]|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The foundation of the tower is made of stone laid without application of a [[building solution]]; the tower walls are composed of stones cemented with use of a strong solution and revetted by [[boulder]]s.&lt;ref name="Tjulenev" /&gt;

The tower is [[rectangular]] (size is 15.5 х 15.6 meters), with walls 4.5 meters thick.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Tjulenev" /&gt;--&gt;
The tower top has a crenelated wall on which a wooden gallery for defenders was erected. 
The castle cellar was used for [[Food storage|storage of supplies]] and a [[prison]], while the ground floor was used for living space. 
&lt;ref name="basis of Castle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/foto_t1.html|trans-title=The basis of Castle and the first decades of its existence |script-title=ru:Основание замка и первые десятилетия его существования |last=Petrova|first=Larissa|work=[http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/index_e.html Vyborg]|publisher=[http://www.nortfort.ru/  Northern Fortresses]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new fortress was repeatedly besieged by the armies of the [[Novgorod Republic]], the most serious siege occurring in 1322. 
In this siege the most advanced artillery of the age was used: [[Artillery#Middle Ages – first gunpowder artillery|stone fougasse]], including possibly the heavy [[arbalest]].&lt;ref name="Tjulenev" /&gt;

As a result of excavation, it has been discovered that wooden structures were once attached to the walls of the stone structure. 
Researchers have discovered traces burnt down in 14th century of a workshop processing [[bone]] and [[bronze|sheet bronze]]. They cannot, however, conclude with confidence whether or not a [[Foundry|foundry works]] was present.&lt;ref name="Tjulenev" /&gt;

In 1403 [[Vyborg]] received the official status of a [[city]]. 
Most likely at the beginning of 15th century the coast was connected with the lock by a [[Pontoon bridge|bateau bridge]] named [[Fortress bridge]].

[[File:Vyborg Castle in 15th century.jpg|thumb|left|Vyborg Castle in 15th century]]

Before attaining the royal throne of Sweden, [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson (Bonde)]] took residence in Vyborg in 1442 and began strengthening and expanding the castle. 
He constructed new premises and strengthened the castle with new walls and towers, arranging it on the model of the European cities of that time.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt; 
The tower of St. Olav received one more circle around it, connecting it with a group of buildings with which it was brought under a single roof in 1442–1448.&lt;ref name="Swedish fortresses"&gt;{{cite book|last=M. I. Milchik|others=from the collection "Swedes on coast of Neva"|title=The Swedish fortresses round Petersburg|publisher=Swedish Institute|location=Stockholm|year=1998|pages=26–33|url=http://terijoki.spb.ru/vyborg-fortress/vf_milchik_sved.php|accessdate=2009-08-31|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructions of later time ===
In the middle of 16th century Swedish king [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] reconstructed and strengthened a fortress for expansion of borders of the state on the east. 
In 1525 the German count Johan von Hoya, brother-in-law of Gustav Vasa, became deputy of the castle.
Instead of taking actions to strengthen the castle as a military fortress he began to arrange [[Ball (dance)|balls]] and [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] which demanded considerable expenses. 
King Gustav sent an army to conquer Vyborg and count Johan von Hoya fled to [[Lübeck]].&lt;ref name="Petrova in Northern Fortresses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/foto_t2.html|trans-title=The castle in days of board of king Gustav Vazy and his sons|script-title=ru:Замок в годы правления короля Густава Вазы и его сыновей|last=Petrova|first=Larissa|work=[http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/index_e.html Vyborg]|publisher=[http://www.nortfort.ru/  Northern Fortresses]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1555 when Gustav Vasa was preparing for his next war with Russia he visited Vyborg and spent some time living in the castle.
He noted its shabby condition and mentioned in a letter «those lacks and errors» which he has seen in Finland.&lt;ref name="Petrova in Northern Fortresses" /&gt;

[[File:Vyborg Castle in 1827.gif|thumb|left|Tower of St. Olav with a [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]] in 1827]]
The king considered it a priority to carry out an urgent reconstruction of the defensive works both in the castle and in the city. 
Between 1556 and 1560 building was directed by deputy Klas Kristersson Horn.&lt;ref name="Petrova in Northern Fortresses" /&gt;

During this reconstruction Vyborg castle took the general form that it has retained to this day, but Horn did not have time to finish the defensive works and Tower of St. Olav was finally reconstructed by his son, [[Eric XIV of Sweden|Eric XIV]]. 
In 1561–1564&lt;ref name="Swedish fortresses" /&gt; the top part of the quadrangular tower was disassembled, and three floors re-erected in the form of an [[octangle]]. 
The tower was built of [[brick]] with a roof covered in [[lead]] specially brought from [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt; 
Over an entry gate, by order of the king, were placed the arms «three crowns»; in the tower were placed [[Artillery#Early modern period – age of the smoothbores|artillery of large calibre]]; and in a cellar was installed a warehouse for [[Seed|kernels]].&lt;ref name="Petrova in Northern Fortresses" /&gt;
[[File:Vyborg Castle in 1839.gif|thumb|right|Destructions of a tower after a fire 1834. The image is dated 1839]]
During the [[Great Northern War]] Russian armies under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] took all the fortresses of [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]]: in 1703–1704 – [[Nyenschantz]], [[Kingisepp|Jama]], [[Koporye]], [[Shlisselburg|Noteburg]], and [[Ivangorod]]. 
[[Vyborg]] fell on June, 13th 1710. 
[[File:Vyborg Castle in 1880.gif|thumb|left|Destructions of a tower after a fire 1856. The image is dated 1880]]
The [[Medieval art|Medieval interiors]] of the castle remained up to the middle of 19th century, but the most part have been destroyed by fire. 
In 1834 lightning struck a [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]] of the tower, sparking a fire that burnt down the wooden [[Beam (structure)|support beams]]; the tower was restored in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/foto_t4.html|trans-title=As a part of the Russian empire|script-title=ru:В составе Российской империи|last=Petrova|first=Larissa|work=[http://www.nortfort.ru/vyborg/index_e.html Vyborg]|publisher=[http://www.nortfort.ru/  Northern Fortresses]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From {{OldStyleDate|September, 7th|1856|August, 26th}} during celebrations on the occasion of opening of [[Saimaa Canal]] [[fireworks]] were arranged.  These ignited the dome of the tower and from there the fire was thrown down on buildings standing nearby, consuming all of Vyborg Castle in flames. 
The fire consumed the wooden buildings abutting the Tower of St. Olav, and only the [[The house of the commandant with fortress gate|Commandant's house]] and buildings of the Forward courtyard escaped.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt;
Tower restoration was undertaken by the engineer corps under Colonel E. Lezedov on the orders of [[Russian Military Office]] in 1891–1894. 
The tower gate was given a granite stoop, and the internal premises were built anew, including the addition of a metal ladder mounted to the top part of the tower leading up to a viewing platform.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt; 
[[File:Vyborg Castle in 1900s (postcard).jpg|thumb|right|On [[postcard]] the beginnings 20th century]]
From May 1, 1913 through August 6, 1914 Nikolay Suhomlin supervised engineering and civil work on the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terijoki.spb.ru/vyborg-fortress/vf_people.php|trans-title=Builders and defenders of a fortress|script-title=ru:Выборгская крепость.

In the 1920s [[Finland|Finnish authorities]] again repaired the tower and partially opened it to the public, but it remained a military facility.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt;

== Current state ==
Following the [[Second World War]] the territory on which the tower is built passed under the jurisdiction of [[Soviet Union]]. 
The castle lagged behind as a military facility and after 1964 it was transferred to the [[Vyborg state museum of local lore]]. 
In the castle, work continues on the maintenance and safety of the monument, and now Vyborg Castle is seen as a unique monument of West European military architecture that was shaped by developments from the 13th through 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Antiq.Info" /&gt;
Since 2000 the museum has been known as the [[State museum «Vyborg Castle»]].

It is now due for major restoration. Artem Novikov, chairman of the [[Russian Association of restorers]], plans to begin restoration in 2010–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.47news.ru/2009/08/12/010/|trans-title=Tower of St. Olaf and courtyard in the Vyborg Castle plan to restore by 2012 |script-title=ru:Башню св.

The '''United Self-Defenders of Colombia''' (''Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia'', or '''AUC''', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was a Colombian paramilitary and drug trafficking group which was an active belligerent in the [[Colombian conflict (1964–present)|Colombian armed conflict]] during the period from 1997 to 2006. The AUC was responsible for retaliations against the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] rebel groups as well as numerous attacks against civilians beginning in 1997 with the [[Mapiripán Massacre]].&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;

The militia had its roots in the 1980s when militias were established by drug lords to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion by communist guerrillas.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/quick_guides/05/americas_the_colombian_conflict/html/2.stm Quick Guide, The Colombian conflict].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1997 the AUC was formed through a merger, orchestrated by the [[Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá|ACCU]], of local right-wing militias,&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; each intending to protect different local economic, social and political interests by fighting [[left-wing]] [[insurgent]]s in their areas.&lt;ref name="start.umd.edu"&gt;[[The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]], Terrorist Organization Profile:United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was led by [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]] until his murder in 2004 and the organization was believed to have links to some local military commanders in the [[Colombian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/31/ap/national/main20067450.shtml | work=CBS News }} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the paramilitary groups and the armed forces of Colombia share a very close connection and due to which paramilitary groups are also perceived as an extension, more commonly called sixth-division, of the Colombia's armed forces which has five official divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joanne Mariner|author2=Malcolm Smart|title=The "Sixth Division" : military-paramilitary ties and U.S. policy in Colombia|date=2001|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781564322654|page=1|edition=illustrated|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/colombia/6theng.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2017|chapter=1 I.

The AUC had about 20,000 members and was heavily financed through the drug trade&lt;ref name="start.umd.edu"/&gt; and through support from local landowners, cattle ranchers, mining or petroleum companies and politicians.&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;RIVERA, Edgar de Jesús Velásquez.

The Colombian military has been accused of delegating to AUC paramilitaries the task of murdering [[peasants]] and [[labor union]] leaders, amongst others suspected of supporting the rebel movements&lt;ref name="scielo.br"/&gt; and the AUC publicly and explicitly singled out 'political and trade union operatives of the extreme left' as legitimate targets.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; The AUC was designated as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization by many countries and organizations, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm Chapter 6 – Terrorist Organizations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711015754/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the AUC's blocs demobilized by early 2006 and its former top leadership was extradited to the U.S. in 2008. However, local successors such as the [[Black Eagles]] continue to exist and death threats have been made using its name. On May 8, 2008, employees of a community radio station (Sarare FM Stereo) received a message stating: "For the wellbeing of you and your loved ones, do not meddle in subjects that do not concern the radio station. AUC, Arauca".  A few days later the letters AUC were daubed on the front of their office. This threat was made due to their participation in a public meeting attended by members of a Congressional Human Rights Commission on the 27 September 2007.  Here, members of the public denounced [[human rights]] abuses committed in [[Arauca Department]] by different parties to the armed conflict, including the AUC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR23/023/2008/en]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The militia had its roots in the 1980s when militias were established by drug lords to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In April 1997 the AUC was formally established by merging local right-wing militias, a process which was orchestrated by the militia group, [[Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá|ACCU]].&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; Each of the AUC blocs was intent on protecting different local economic, social and political interests by fighting [[left-wing]] [[insurgent]]s in their areas.&lt;ref name="start.umd.edu"/&gt;

The AUC's main enemies were the [[leftist]] insurgency groups [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional'', ELN). The AUC was designated as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization by many countries and organizations, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm Chapter 6 – Terrorist Organizations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711015754/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department added the AUC to the list in 2001, condemning it for [[wikt:massacre|massacres]], [[torture]], and other [[human rights]] abuses against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2001/5803.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Colombian National Police]], in the first ten months of 2000 the AUC conducted 804 [[assassination]]s, 203 [[kidnapping]]s, and 75 massacres with 507 victims. The AUC claims the victims were mostly [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] or sympathizers. Combat tactics consist of conventional and guerrilla operations against main force insurgent units. AUC clashes with military and police units gradually increased, although the group has traditionally been friendly with government security forces.

A February 2005 report by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] reported that, during 2004, "the AUC was responsible for 342 cases of violations of the cessation of hostilities.  These include the presumed reincorporation of demobilized persons into its ranks, massacres, forced displacements, selective and systematic [[homicide]]s, kidnappings, [[rape]], [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]], threats, [[intimidation]] and [[looting]]s. These actions took place in 11 departments and targeted the civilian population, in many cases [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous communities]]."&lt;ref name = "unhcr1"&gt;[http://www.hchr.org.co/documentoseinformes/informes/altocomisionado/informes.php3?cod=8&amp;cat=11 Report on the situation of human rights in Colombia] UNHCR 28 February 2005 (English and Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reports allege that numerous elements within the [[Military of Colombia|Colombian military]] and [[police]] have collaborated or continue to tolerate local AUC paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/colombia/index.htm Report] from [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Salvatore Mancuso]], son of [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigrant]]s, the AUC maintained close links with the [[Calabria]]n [['Ndrangheta]] concerning [[drug traffic|cocaine trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/418741.html Tiene Italia indicios sobre presencia de cárteles mexicanos en Europa], ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', 15 April 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Doe v. Chiquita Brands International}}

In March 2007, the international fruit [[corporation]], [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]], admitted to having paid the AUC from 1997 to 2004 US$1.7 million in order to protect its workers and operations, in [[Urabá Antioquia|Urabá]] and [[Santa Marta]], of which at least US$825,000 came after the AUC was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department in 2001. These payments were often made through a group belonging to the [[Convivir]] network, a government-sponsored program of rural security cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB217/index.htm DOCUMENTS IMPLICATE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN CHIQUITA TERROR SCANDAL], [[National Security Archive]] Electronic Briefing Book No. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The payments were arranged during a 1997 meeting between [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]] with officials from [[Banadex]], a subsidiary of Chiquita.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;Michael Evans, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070416/evans 'Para-politics' Goes Bananas], ''[[The Nation]]'', 4 April 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiquita subsequently made a [[plea bargain]] with the [[United States Department of Justice]], and agreed to pay a $25 million fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/March/07_nsd_161.html Chiquita Brands International Pleads Guilty to Making Payments to a Designated Terrorist Organization And Agrees to Pay $25 Million Fine], United States Department of Justice, 19 March 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's attorney general, [[Mario Iguarán]], also opened a case on Chiquita. He stated that he will request the [[extradition]] of eight Chiquita officials connected to the case.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; He has also charged Chiquita of using one of their ships to [[Arms trafficking|smuggle weapons]] (some 3,400 [[AK-47]] rifles and 4 million rounds of [[ammunition]]) for the AUC.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; These charges were first brought ahead in a 2003 report from the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;

Later, Attorney General Iguarán contradicted himself by claiming the extraditions could not be completed since the implicated persons had not been "identified and charged." Specifically, Iguarán asserted  "there are indeed some Chiquita Brands directors, but we are not able to ask for them in extradition, rather we have to have some information contained in the agreement reached with the U.S. court that includes a confidentiality agreement." Nonetheless, specific information on the identities of the Chiquita directors, executives, and senior employees – namely Cyrus Freid Heim jr., Roderick M. Hills, Robert Olson, Morten Arzen, Jeffery D. Benjamin, Steven Stanbrook, [[Durk I. Jager]], Jaime Serra, Robert F. Kistenberger, James B. Riley, Robert W. Fisher, Carl H. Linder, Keith Linder, and Steven Warshaw – have already been presented before the  Attorney General's Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/CHIQUITA-BOARD-MEMBERS-TOTAL Chiquita Board Members: Total Identification], ''[[Jose Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]]'', July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003–2004: Initial negotiation efforts== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Álvaro Uribe]] --&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
After a [[ceasefire]] was declared (which in practice has been publicly admitted by the AUC and the government to be partial, resulting in a reduction but not the cessation of killings), the government of President [[Álvaro Uribe]] began talks with the group with the aim to eventually dismantle the organization and reintegrate its members to society. The stated deadline for completing the demobilization process was originally December 2005, but was later extended into February 2006. Between 2003 and February 2, 2006, about 17,000 of the AUC's 20,000 fighters  surrendered their weapons. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0602020195feb02,1,5857923.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} This is more than double the figure originally estimated by the government before negotiations began.

A draft law was presented to the public which offered to pardon the members of any illegal armed group (which would legally include both guerrillas and paramilitaries, (i.e. members of both left- and right-wing groups) that declared a ceasefire and entered talks with the government, in return for, mainly, their verified [[demobilization]], concentration within a specific geographic area and the symbolic [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]] of the offenses committed against the victims of their actions. After much discussion and controversy over it, a further revised draft was distributed to the media and political circles. This new project was not officially submitted for approval by  [[Colombian Congress|Congress]] and further public discussion on the matter continued.

The bill, among other details, called for the creation of a three to five member [[Truth Tribunal]] which would study each case brought before it (at the request of the president), after the groups/individuals sign an agreement to respect international humanitarian laws and accept the authority of the Tribunal, in exchange for a minimum sentence of five to ten years (part of it could possibly be served outside jail) for those guilty of the most serious crimes, the confession of the crimes which were committed in connection with the activities of the illegal armed group, and the completion of concrete acts of reparation towards the victims.

If the Tribunal were to deny the benefits to anyone, there would be no possibility of reconsideration. However, the president would be able to veto individuals who did receive a favorable sentence. This new draft version of the law would have been in effect only until 31 December 2006.

[[Human Rights Watch]] spokesman [[José Miguel Vivanco]] publicly stated, during one of the final audiences which were created to discuss aspects of the original bill (of which he remained highly critical), that the new proposition seemed to be considerably more in line with international standards, at first glance, but that more needed to be done in order to fully resolve the issue.

[[Salvatore Mancuso]], one of the AUC's main commanders, publicly expressed that he was against both any potential [[extradition]] of either himself or his "comrades in arms" to the USA and refused "spending any day in jail".

Also, there have been internal conflicts within the illegal organization, as other AUC leaders have mutually accused each other of being tainted with [[narcotrafficking]] and their troops have even met in combat. These different, regionalistic and sometimes warring factions within the AUC, make successfully concluding any peace initiative a considerably difficult task.

In mid-May 2004, the talks appeared to move forward as the government agreed to grant the AUC leaders and 400 of their bodyguards a 142 square mile (368&amp;nbsp;km²) safe haven in [[Santa Fe de Ralito]], [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba]], where, under OAS verification, further discussions will be held, for a (renewable) trial period of 6 months. As long the AUC leaders remain in this area, they will not be subject to [[arrest warrant]]s.
That condition and most of remaining legal framework invoked was previously implemented for the much larger [[San Vicente del Caguán]] area that former president [[Andrés Pastrana]] granted the FARC guerrillas as safe haven during the 1998–2002 peace process, but there are differences:
* the local, state and police authorities will not leave the zone, so [[Colombian law]]s will still be fully applicable within its limits
* the paramilitary leaders will require special permission to leave and re-enter the zone, and government prosecutors will be allowed to operate inside it in order to investigate criminal offenses.

==Disappearance and death of Carlos Castaño==
{{Update|date=August 2010}}
Paramilitary leader [[Carlos Mauricio García]] alias "Doble Cero" ("Double Zero") or "Rodrigo", who since the 1980s had been a close associate of Castaño within the AUC, was found dead on 30 May 2004. He had strongly objected to what he considered an improperly close relationship between the AUC and drug traffickers, and was also opposed to the group's talks with the government. "Double Zero" had fallen into disgrace in recent years, leading to the formation of his own independent "[[Bloque Metro]]" ("Metro Bloc"), which operated in the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] area until it was exterminated by rival paramilitary commanders from the AUC mainstream.

Separately, in events which remain clouded and confusing, former AUC supreme leader [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], who had become relatively isolated from the organization, apparently suffered an attempt on his life on 16 April 2004, presumably at the hands of either his own bodyguards, those of rival paramilitary troops, or perhaps even other entities altogether. Acting AUC commanders claim to believe that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters, but that he may still be alive and possibly in hiding.

Other independent sources within the group and among its dissident factions claim that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother [[Vicente Castaño]] and/or [[Diego Fernando Murillo]]), who have become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Castaño's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources allege that the bodies of Castaño and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive.

It has been speculated in the Colombian and international press that this could be a potential blow to the peace process, as Castaño seemed to become relatively critical of the increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and more willing to compromise with the Colombian state, and thus the remaining AUC commanders (such as Mancuso and "[[Don Berna]]") would potentially maintain a much less open negotiating position in the ongoing talks with the Uribe government.

The death of AUC co-founder Carlos Castaño remained unexplained for two years, and was subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the more exotic rumours (dating to 1 June 2004), stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] agency that Castaño had been spirited away to [[Israel]], via [[Panama]], with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced. The [[Federal government of the United States|governments of the United States]], [[Government of Colombia|Colombia]], and [[Government of Israel|Israel]] denied these allegations.

Details about Castaño's possible fate began to emerge in 2006. The [[Cali]]-based ''[[Nuevo Diario Occidente]]'' reported that an assassin hired by Vicente Castaño confessed to the police that he had killed Castaño in 2004. This assassin's confessions allowed Colombian authorities to locate Castaño's body in August 2006, and [[DNA test]]s confirmed its identity in September that year.

==Possible paramilitary activities in Venezuela==
In early May 2004, [[Venezuela]]n authorities arrested at least 100 individuals that they accused of being Colombian paramilitaries and of scheming, together with part of the Venezuelan opposition, to begin a series of scheduled attacks against heavily fortified military targets within [[Caracas]], aiming at the overthrow of President [[Hugo Chávez]].

The AUC officially denied that they had anything to do with them.  President Uribe congratulated the Venezuelan president for the capture and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, while President Chávez himself declared that, as far as he was concerned, he did not believe that Uribe had anything to with the operation, for which he blamed "elements" within "the oligarchies of [[Miami]] and [[Bogotá]]", also implicating individual high-ranking U.S. and Colombian military officers, who have denied such involvement.

[[Vice-president]] [[Francisco Santos Calderón]] added that he hoped that the Venezuelan government would pursue with equal zeal those FARC and ELN guerrillas who would also be present in Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the whole event as a "setup", claiming that Chávez intended to interfere with the potential approval of a [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|referendum]] which sought to remove him from power.

==Late 2004: Demobilizations==
[[File:MancusoDEA.jpg|thumb|Salvatore Mancuso]]
In November 2004, the [[Colombian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] approved the extradition to the United States of top paramilitary leaders [[Salvatore Mancuso]] and [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], together with that of the guerrilla commander [[Simón Trinidad]], the only one of the men to be in state custody (Castaño's extradition was approved because the court considered that the matter of his death was not yet clear).

The court ruled that the three US [[extradition]] requests, all for charges of drug trafficking and [[money laundering]], respected current Colombian legal procedures and therefore they could now proceed, once the president gave his approval.&lt;ref name = "bbc4040567"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4040567.stm BBC Court clears Colombia extradition] Thursday, 25 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated in the Colombian press that the government would possibly approve the extradition of Salvatore Mancuso, but would delay it for the duration of the peace talks that he and his organization are conducting with the state. Mancuso himself has declared that he will continue to participate in the process despite the Supreme Court's ruling. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In early December and late November, there have been new events in the peace negotiations with the AUC. First, several hundred men of the [[Bloque Bananero]] (loosely translated, the Banana Producers' Bloc) turned in their weapons and demobilized in order to be reintegrated into civilian life. This group operated in the Uraba region of northern Antioquia, where the AUC had dislodged the FARC and gained total control in the mid- to late nineties. However, the AUC remain in the area with the presence of other divisions in order to maintain the peace and prevent the FARC from returning.

A few weeks later, the [[Catatumbo Bloc]] also demobilized. This was a milestone in Colombian history, for, with its 1425 mercenaries, the Catatumbo Bloc was one of the most important AUC groups. With them Salvatore Mancuso, the AUC's military leader, turned himself in. A few days later, the government announced that it would not make Mancuso's extradition effective as long as he avoided criminal activities and fulfilled his commitments to the peace process.

Both of these massive demobilizations of AUC groups are an apparent improvement over the first one in 2003 in [[Medellín]] because on this occasion important leaders turned themselves in and the weapons presented were assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and rockets, rather than the [[improvised firearm|homemade shotgun]]s and old, malfunctioning revolvers that were turned in the first demobilization. The AUC was supposed to have demobilized completely by 2006 but successor organizations continued to operate such as the neo-paramilitary alliance BACRIM ('bandas criminales emergentes'). .

==2005: Legal framework and controversy==
Many Colombian and international observers are skeptical about the demobilization's prospects and see multiple causes for criticism. A concern shared by a high number of critics, both inside and outside the country, is that the demobilization process, if it does not provide a legal framework that contemplates the proper doses of truth, reparation and justice, could allow those who have committed human rights violations to possibly enjoy an undue degree of impunity for their crimes. A different kind of concern is held by a few of the supporters of the demobilization process, some of which believe that, without a certain degree of acceptance from the paramilitaries themselves, any unillateral attempts at reducing impunity could stay in writing and not be practically effective.

A smaller number of the critics have also expressed their fear that the current administration could integrate the AUC into its civilian defence militias or other military structures.
Military and government spokesmen have stated multiple times that there is no intention to integrate the AUC into the state's legal security apparatus. While no reports of that occurring have been put forward yet, there have been signs of some individual paramilitaries expressing an interest in wanting to join (or form) [[private security companies]] in areas that formerly were under their influence and control, in order to prevent possible guerrilla inroads.

The debate on the subject of potential [[impunity]] has had a high profile in both the international and Colombian media, with critical views being expressed in ''[[Chicago Tribune]] ''and ''[[New York Times]] ''editorials, in addition to many Colombian outlets. The main argument of several editorials has been that the international community should not help fund the demobilization process until the necessary legal framework to minimize impunity is in place. This position was also echoed by representatives of the international community in a February 2005 donors' conference in Cartagena.

After many public and private discussions through mid-to-late 2004, in early 2005, a number of  congressmen, including Senator [[Rafael Pardo]] and [[Gina Parody]] (traditionally holding pro-government positions) and [[Wilson Borja]] (a former leftwing labor leader who survived a paramilitary assassination attempt back in 2000) among others, independently presented a multiparty draft bill that, according to several observers such as Colombian and international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] (including Human Rights Watch), indicates a substantial improvement (compared to the government's previous initiatives) in meeting the necessary conditions of adequately dismantling paramilitarism and reducing impunity. Among these sectors, there is a semblance of a broad consensus in support of this bill.&lt;ref name = "cipo000031"&gt;[http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/blog/archives/000031.htm www.ciponline.org – Plan Colombia and Beyond] December 07, 2004 (English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "hrwcolomb10032"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/18/colomb10032.htm Colombia: Demobilization Scheme Ensures Injustice] hrw.org January 18, 2005 (English)&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressional discussion on the subject was set to begin on February 15, 2005, but suffered several delays. The Colombian government's own official draft had apparently gradually incorporated several of the provisions in the Pardo, Parody and Borja proposal, but a number of disagreements remained, which would be the source for further debate on the subject. Other congressmen, including supporters of the government, also begun to present their own draft projects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

On February 23, the top AUC leaders published an online document on their webpage which stated {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} that they will not submit to a legal framework that, in their own words, would force them to suffer through an undue humiliation that their leftwing guerrilla foes would not contemplate for themselves. They also declared that they are in favor of laws that will allow their fighters to return to civilian and productive lives in a fair, peaceful and equitable manner. In the absence of such conditions, they claimed that the consequence would be the end of the negotiations and their preferring to face the prospect of continuing "war and death". A government communique answered that the AUC should not put pressure on Congress, the media or the Executive on the matter of the legal framework, and that they would have five days to leave the Ralito zone if they chose to quit the talks. The AUC later  reduced the tone of its earlier remarks.&lt;ref name = "caracol"&gt;[http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/155976.asp Caracol Radio] February 23, 2005 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, an AUC spokesman repeated their claims that the current proposal for amnesty was too harsh primarily because it still allowed extradition for drug charges.&lt;ref name = "bbc4429727"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4429727.stm Colombia fighters reject amnesty] BBC April 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass extradition to the U.S.==
In the early morning of May 13, 2008, thirteen high-profile paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the government. According to Interior Minister [[Carlos Holguín]] they have been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice Law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Amongst them are Salvatore Mancuso, Don Berna, [[Jorge 40]], [[Cuco Vanoy]] and [[Diego Ruiz Arroyave]] (cousin of assassinated paramilitary leader [[Miguel Arroyave]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2008-05-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Uribe said immediately afterwards the United States has agreed to compensate the victims of extradited paramilitary warlords with any international assets they might surrender. The US State Department said the US' courts can also help the victims by sharing information on atrocities with Colombian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://colombiareports.com/2008/05/13/assets-of-paramilitaries-will-be-confiscated-to-pay-victims/ |title=Assets of paramilitaries will be confiscated to pay victims, Uribe says |date=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Colombia Reports |accessdate=2008-05-13 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Movement of State Crimes]], a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked "to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the [[Law of Justice and Peace]], since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures." &lt;ref name = "ccajar"&gt;[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1340#nb4 Extradition Cut Short] ‘’CCAJAR’’ May 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office in Colombia of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] stated that "[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‘Law of Justice and Peace’ and for the loss of the benefits established therein".&lt;ref name = "ccajar"/&gt;

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] stated that this "affects the Colombian State’s obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system’s regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders." &lt;ref name = "ccajar"/&gt;

After his extradition to the United States, paramilitary leader [[Salvatore Mancuso]] has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, ''[[Revista Semana]]'' reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 [[El Aro massacre]], in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the national military and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Van Riebeeck Society''' is a South African organisation founded in 1918, setting itself the goal of republishing historical primary sources and making these available to the average reader. With rare exceptions a new volume has been published annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanriebeecksociety.co.za/catalogue.htm VRS Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; Fees from subscribing members finance the publications. The Society's publications maintain a high academic standard and it has produced valuable [[Africana studies|Africana]].

Since its inception the Society has had close links with the [[National Library of South Africa]] (South African Library) in [[Cape Town]]. Two men who were instrumental in the Society's founding were A.C.G. Lloyd, librarian of the [[National Library of South Africa|South African Public Library]], and [[John X. Merriman]], at one time prime minister of the [[Cape Colony]] and a trustee of the library.

The discovery by Lloyd in November 1911 of a large fragment of [[Adam Tas]]'s diary of 1704, was to a large extent responsible for the Society's creation. As leader of the free burghers opposed to the [[Dutch East India Company]] and governor of the Cape, [[Willem Adriaan van der Stel]], Tas personified the struggle against colonialism. The trustees of the library raised the funds needed to publish the diary in 1914.

With surplus money from the publication fund, it was decided to publish [[Baron van Pallandt]]'s ''General Remarks on the Cape of Good Hope'', an 1803 pamphlet originally written in French, printed clandestinely and suppressed by [[Jacob Abraham Uitenhage de Mist|Uitenhage De Mist]] in 1803, and consequently a rare work. This was published in 1917 and met with the disapproval of General [[J. B. M. Hertzog]], the then prime minister, who was upset by passages describing the poor treatment meted out to the [[Khoikhoi]] by the settlers. Hertzog's denunciation of the work led to enormously increased sales.

Bolstered by this success, the trustees decided to publish certain reports on the Cape by Governor [[Maurits Pasques de Chavonnes]], and by the commissioner at the Cape, Baron [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]]. However, the library's mandate did not include publishing archival documents so that a decision was taken to found a private society to deal with the management of the project. This led on 29 August{{clarify|reason=what year?|date=October 2015}} to the first meeting of the 'Van Riebeeck Society for the Publication of Southern African Historical Documents'. The initial membership was 54, many being members of parliament, and the de Chavonnes reports made up the first publication.

'''''What's Cooking? with Jamie Oliver''''' is a [[cooking]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] narrated by [[celebrity chef]] [[Jamie Oliver]]. It was developed by German studio keen games GmbH &amp; Co. KG and published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)]] and released in North America on October 21, 2008, and in Europe on October 24.

The game features several recipes, each listing preparation times, ingredients and courses. In addition, ''What's Cooking?'' can be used as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it can act as a timer to count down from a specified time and make an audible sound when it is done.

The game was first revealed by Atari at the [[Games Convention]] 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at [[Metacritic]]. Reviewers generally agreed that presenting a cooking guide as a video game was a good idea, but they found that the game was poorly executed and mediocre as a result.

==Gameplay==
[[File:What's Cooking - screenshot.png|thumb|left|The cooking challenge portion requires that the player cook virtual meals before the timer runs out.|alt=Two screens, one above the other. Above, text instructions. Below, a virtual knife is cutting a lemon.]]

''What's Cooking?'' is an interactive [[cookbook]] and [[food preparation]] video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items on the list can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt; Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS [[touchscreen]] and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt; While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying "next" into the device's microphone will move the recipe on to the next step.&lt;ref name=eurogamer /&gt; One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via [[Wi-Fi]]. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, ''What's Cooking?'' features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=onm-interview /&gt;

The developers also wanted to make the game as interactive as possible.&lt;ref name=onm-interview&gt;{{cite journal |title=What's Cooking? with Jamie Oliver interview |journal=Official Nintendo Magazine |issue=34 |pages=8–9 |date=October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What's Cooking?'' was generally poorly received by video game critics, receiving a 49% aggregated score on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=metacritic /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Daemon Hatfield called disguising a cooking tutorial as a video game a "pretty brilliant idea", but only as long as it was done well. He stated that both the cookbook and food preparation halves of the game were not strong enough to make the game worth purchasing. Hatfield commented that the game's controls are "terribly unintuitive, and the cookbook doesn't offer anything its physical counterpart can't for cheaper".  He was also disappointed that there were no pictures to illustrate each step, and not every cooking process is explained.&lt;ref name=ign /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Ellie Gibson was satisfied with the number of recipes available, most of which were "pretty easy to follow". Gibson, however, preferred to see instructional videos to observe how a recipe was made before making it.&lt;ref name=eurogamer /&gt;

In their review of the game, ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' commented that the stylus-controlled cooking tutorials are not user-friendly, and the recipe sharing is as good as it could be since players can only use ingredients and methods from recipes that they have unlocked through playing the game. They felt that the game attempts to appeal to gamers rather than aspiring chefs, concluding, "[The game has] some great recipes but the experience is marred by some fiddly cooking games."&lt;ref name=onm-review /&gt;

'''Wiktionary''' is a [[multilingualism|multilingual]], [[World Wide Web|web]]-based project to create a [[free content]] [[dictionary]] of [[wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|all words in all languages]]. It is [[collaborative editing|collaboratively edited]] via a [[wiki]], and its name is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[wiki]]'' and ''[[dictionary]]''. It is available in 171 languages and in [[Basic English|Simple English]]&lt;!--piped like that because "Simple English" is the name of the Wiktionary in question; see [[:wikt:simple:Main Page]]--&gt;. Like its sister project [[Wikipedia]], Wiktionary is run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], and is written collaboratively by [[volunteering|volunteers]], dubbed "Wiktionarians". Its [[wiki software]], [[MediaWiki]], allows almost anyone with access to the website to create and edit entries.

Because Wiktionary is not limited by print space considerations, most of Wiktionary's [[language]] editions provide definitions and translations of words from many languages, and some editions offer additional information typically found in [[Thesaurus|thesauri]] and [[lexicon]]s. The English Wiktionary includes a [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary:Thesaurus|thesaurus]] (formerly known as Wikisaurus) of synonyms of various words.

Wiktionary data are frequently used in various [[#Wiktionary data in natural language processing|natural language processing tasks]].

== History and development ==
Wiktionary was brought online on December 12, 2002,{{efn|[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2002-December/008311.html Wikipedia mailing list archive discussion announcing the opening of the Wiktionary project] – Retrieved May 3, 2011}} following a proposal by [[Daniel Alston]] and an idea by [[Larry Sanger]], co-founder of Wikipedia.{{efn|[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-April/000076.html Wikipedia mailing list archive discussion from Larry Sanger giving the idea on Wiktionary] – Retrieved May 3, 2011}} On March 28, 2004, the first non-[[English language|English]] Wiktionaries were initiated in [[French language|French]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. Wiktionaries in numerous other languages have since been started. Wiktionary was hosted on a temporary [[domain name]] (wiktionary.wikipedia.org) until May 1, 2004, when it switched to the current domain name.{{efn|Wiktionary's current URL is [http://www.wiktionary.org/ www.wiktionary.org].}} {{As of|2016|11|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary}}, Wiktionary features over 25.9 million entries across its editions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wiktionary.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of the language editions is the English Wiktionary, with over 5.8 million entries, followed by the Malagasy Wiktionary with over 5.1 million [[Internet bot|bot]]-generated entries and the French Wiktionary with over 3.3 million. Forty-one Wiktionary language editions now contain over 100,000 entries each.{{efn|Wiktionary total article counts are [[meta:Wiktionary|here.]]  Detailed statistics by word type are available here [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Statistics#Detail].}}

[[File:Wiktionary growth.png|thumb|left|250px|The use of [[Internet bot|bot]]s to generate large numbers of articles is visible as "growth spurts" in this graph of article counts at the largest eight Wiktionary editions. (Data {{As of|2009|12|lc=on}})]]

Most of the entries and many of the definitions at the project's largest language editions were created by bots that found creative ways to generate entries or (rarely) automatically imported thousands of entries from previously published dictionaries. Seven of the 18 bots registered at the English Wiktionary{{efn|1=The [https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AListUsers&amp;username=&amp;group=bot&amp;limit=60 user list] at the English Wiktionary identifies accounts that have been given "bot status".}} created 163,000 of the entries there.&lt;ref name="Edit counter"&gt;[http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=TheDaveBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p TheDaveBot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064312/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=TheDaveBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p |date=2007-10-11 }}, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=TheCheatBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p TheCheatBot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064411/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=TheCheatBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p |date=2007-10-11 }}, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Websterbot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p Websterbot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064313/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Websterbot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p |date=2007-10-11 }}, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=PastBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p PastBot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064300/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=PastBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p |date=2007-10-11 }}, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=NanshuBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p NanshuBot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064233/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=NanshuBot&amp;dbname=enwiktionary_p |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of these bots, "ThirdPersBot," was responsible for the addition of a number of [[Grammatical person|third-person]] [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s that would not have received their own entries in standard dictionaries; for instance, it defined "smoulders" as the "third-person singular simple present form of smoulder." Of the 648,970 definitions the English Wiktionary provides for 501,171 English words, 217,850 are "form of" definitions of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Statistics/generated&amp;oldid=21321854 Detailed statistics] as of 1 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This means its coverage of English&lt;!--431,120 definitions are ''not'' "form of"--&gt; is slightly smaller than that of major monolingual print dictionaries. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', for instance, has 615,000 headwords, while ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Webster's Third New International|Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] of the English Language, Unabridged'' has 475,000 entries (with many additional embedded headwords). Detailed [[wikt:Wiktionary:Statistics#Detail|statistics]] exist to show how many entries of various kinds exist.

The English Wiktionary does not rely on bots to the extent that some other editions do. The [[French language|French]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] Wiktionaries, for example, imported large sections of the Free Vietnamese Dictionary Project (FVDP), which provides free content bilingual dictionaries to and from Vietnamese.{{efn|Hồ Ngọc Đức, [http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/Dict/ Free Vietnamese Dictionary Project]. [[:vi:wikt:Wiktionary:Nguồn gốc/FVDP|Details]] at the Vietnamese Wiktionary.}} These imported entries make up virtually all of the Vietnamese edition's contents. Almost all non-Malagasy-language entries of the Malagasy Wiktionary were copied by bot from other Wiktionaries. Like the English edition, the French Wiktionary has imported the approximately 20,000 entries from the [[Han unification|Unihan]] database of [[CJK characters|Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters]]. The French Wiktionary grew rapidly in 2006 thanks in large part to bots copying many entries from old, freely licensed dictionaries, such as the eighth edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'' (1935, around 35,000 words), and using bots to add words from other Wiktionary editions with French translations. The [[Russian language|Russian]] edition grew by nearly 80,000 entries as "LXbot" added boilerplate entries (with headings, but without definitions) for words in English and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="LXbot"&gt;[http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=LXbot&amp;dbname=ruwiktionary_p LXbot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524015303/http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=LXbot&amp;dbname=ruwiktionary_p |date=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 English part of en.wiktionary had over 500,000 gloss definitions and over 900,000 definitions (including different forms).&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Statistics Wikitionary statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logos===
Wiktionary has historically lacked a uniform logo across its numerous language editions. Some editions use logos that depict a dictionary entry about the term "Wiktionary", based on the previous English Wiktionary logo, which was designed by Brion Vibber, a [[MediaWiki]] developer.{{efn|"[[wikt:Wiktionary talk:Wiktionary Logo|Wiktionary talk:Wiktionary Logo]]", English Wiktionary, Wikimedia Foundation.}} Because a purely textual logo must vary considerably from language to language, a four-phase contest to adopt a uniform logo was held at the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki from September to October 2006.{{efn|name=Wiktionary logo|"[[m:Wiktionary/logo|Wiktionary/logo]]", Meta-Wiki, [[Wikimedia Foundation]].}} Some communities adopted the winning entry by "Smurrayinchester", a 3×3 grid of wooden tiles, each bearing a character from a different writing system. However, the poll did not see as much participation from the Wiktionary community as some community members had hoped, and a number of the larger wikis ultimately kept their textual logos.{{efn|name=Wiktionary logo}}

In April 2009, the issue was resurrected with a new contest. This time, a depiction by "AAEngelman" of an open hardbound dictionary won a head-to-head vote against the 2006 logo, but the process to refine and adopt the new logo then stalled.{{efn|"[[m:Wiktionary/logo/refresh/voting|Wiktionary/logo/refresh/voting]]", Meta-Wiki, Wikimedia Foundation.}} In the following years, some wikis replaced their textual logos with one of the two newer logos. In 2012, 55 wikis that had been using the English Wiktionary logo received localized versions of the 2006 design by "Smurrayinchester".{{efn|[[mailarchive:translators-l/2012-December/002193.html|[Translators-l] 56 Wiktionaries got a localised logo]]}} In July 2016, the English Wiktionary adopted a variant of this logo.&lt;ref&gt;[[phab:T139255]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|07|04}}, 135 wikis, representing 61% of Wiktionary's entries, use a logo based on the 2006 design by "Smurrayinchester", 33 wikis (36%) use a textual logo, and three wikis (3%) use the 2009 design by "AAEngelman".{{efn|[[m:Wiktionary/logo#Logo use statistics]].}}

== Accuracy ==
To ensure accuracy, the English Wiktionary has a policy requiring that terms be ''attested''.&lt;ref name="CFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion|title=Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|work=Wiktionary|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in major languages such as English and Chinese must be verified by:

# clearly widespread use, or
# use in permanently recorded media, conveying meaning, in at least three independent instances spanning at least a year.

For less-documented languages such as [[Muscogee language|Creek]] and extinct languages such as [[Latin]], one use in a permanently recorded medium or one mention in a reference work is sufficient verification.

== Critical reception ==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2013}}

Critical reception of Wiktionary has been mixed. In 2006 Jill Lepore wrote in the article "Noah's Ark" for ''The New Yorker,''{{efn|The full article is not available on-line.{{sfn|Lepore|2006}}}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's no show of hands at ''Wiktionary''. There's not even an editorial staff. "Be your own lexicographer!", might be ''Wiktionary's'' motto. Who needs experts? Why pay good money for a dictionary written by lexicographers when we could cobble one together ourselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

''Wiktionary'' isn't so much republican or democratic as Maoist. And it's only as good as the [[Public domain#Expiration of copyright|copyright-expired]] books from which it pilfers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Keir Graff]]'s review for ''Booklist'' was less critical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is there a place for Wiktionary? Undoubtedly. The industry and enthusiasm of its many creators are proof that there's a market. And it's wonderful to have another strong source to use when searching the odd terms that pop up in today's fast-changing world and the online environment. But as with so many Web sources (including this column), it's best used by sophisticated users in conjunction with more reputable sources.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

References in other publications are fleeting and part of larger discussions of Wikipedia, not progressing beyond a definition, although David Brooks in ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]]'' described it as "wild and woolly".{{efn|David Brooks, "Online, interactive encyclopedia not just for geeks anymore, because everyone seems to need it now, more than ever!" ''The Nashua Telegraph'' (August 4, 2004)}} One of the impediments to independent coverage of Wiktionary is the continuing confusion that it is merely an extension of Wikipedia.{{efn|In this citation, the author refers to Wiktionary as part of the Wikipedia site: {{cite news

In 2005, ''[[PC Magazine]]'' rated Wiktionary as one of the Internet's "Top 101 Web Sites",{{sfn|PC Mag|2005}} although little information was given about the site.

The measure of correctness of the inflections for a subset of the Polish words in the English Wiktionary showed that this grammatical data is very stable. Only 131 out of 4748 Polish words have had their inflection data corrected.{{sfn|Kurmas|2010}}

== Wiktionary data in natural language processing==
Wiktionary has [[semi-structured data]].{{sfn|Meyer|Gurevych|2012|p=140}} Wiktionary lexicographic data can be converted to [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable format]] in order to be used in [[natural language processing]] tasks.{{sfn|Zesch|Müller|Gurevych|2008|p=4|loc=Figure 1}}{{sfn|Meyer|Gurevych|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Krizhanovsky, Transformation|2010|p=1}}

Wiktionary data mining is a complex task. There are the following difficulties:{{sfn|Hellmann|Auer|2013|p=302|loc=p. 16 in PDF|name=HellmannAuer2013}} (1) the constant and frequent changes to data and schemata, (2) the heterogeneity in Wiktionary language edition schemata {{efn|E.g. compare the entry structure and formatting rules in [[wikt:Wiktionary:Entry layout explained|English Wiktionary]] and [[wikt:ru:Викисловарь:Правила оформления статей|Russian Wiktionary]].}} and (3) the human-centric nature of a [[wiki]].

There are several [[Parsing|parsers]] for different Wiktionary language editions:{{sfn|Hellmann|Brekle|Auer|2012|p=3|loc=Table 1}}

* DBpedia Wiktionary:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbpedia.org/Wiktionary DBpedia Wiktionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504235547/http://dbpedia.org/Wiktionary |date=2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a subproject of [[DBpedia]], the data are extracted from English, French, German and Russian wiktionaries; the data includes language, part of speech, definitions, semantic relations and translations. The declarative description of the page schema,{{sfn|Hellmann|Brekle|Auer|2012|pp=8–9}} [[regular expression]]s{{sfn|Hellmann|Brekle|Auer|2012|p=10}} and [[finite state transducer]]{{sfn|Hellmann|Brekle|Auer|2012|p=11}} are used in order to extract information.
* JWKTL (Java Wiktionary Library):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/jwktl/ JWKTL]&lt;/ref&gt; provides access to English Wiktionary and German Wiktionary dumps via a Java [[Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab#Wiktionary API|Wiktionary API]].{{sfn|Zesch|Müller|Gurevych|2008}} The data includes language, part of speech, definitions, quotations, semantic relations, etymologies and translations. JWKTL is available for non-commercial use.
* wikokit:&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/componavt/wikokit wikokit]&lt;/ref&gt; the parser of English Wiktionary and Russian Wiktionary.{{sfn|Krizhanovsky, Transformation|2010}} The parsed data includes language, part of speech, definitions, quotations,{{sfn|Smirnov|2012}}{{efn|Quotations are extracted only from Russian Wiktionary.{{sfn|Smirnov|2012}}}} semantic relations{{sfn|Krizhanovsky, Comparison|2010}} and translations. This is a [[Multi-licensing#License compatibility|multi-licensed]] open-source software.
* Etymological entries have been parsed in the Etymological [[WordNet]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~demelo/etymwn/ Etymological WordNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The various [[natural language processing]] tasks were solved with the help of Wiktionary data:

* [[Rule-based machine translation]] between [[Dutch language]] and [[Afrikaans]]; data of English Wiktionary, Dutch Wiktionary and Wikipedia were used with the [[Apertium]] machine translation platform.{{sfn|Otte|Tyers|2011}}
* Construction of [[machine-readable dictionary]] by the parser NULEX, which integrates open linguistic resources: English Wiktionary, [[WordNet]], and [[VerbNet]].{{sfn|McFate|Forbus|2011}} The parser NULEX [[Web scraping|scrapes]] English Wiktionary for tense information (verbs), plural form and part of speech (nouns).
* [[Speech recognition]] and [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], where Wiktionary was used to automatically create pronunciation dictionaries.{{sfn|Schlippe|Ochs|Schultz|2012}} Word-pronunciation pairs were retrieved from 6 Wiktionary language editions (Czech, English, French, Spanish, Polish, and German). Pronunciations are in terms of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].{{efn|If there are several IPA notations on a Wiktionary page – either for different languages or for pronunciation variants, then the first pronunciation was extracted.{{sfn|Schlippe|Ochs|Schultz|2012|p=4802}}}} The [[Speech recognition|ASR]] system based on English Wiktionary has the highest word error rate, where each third phoneme has to be changed.{{sfn|Schlippe|Ochs|Schultz|2012|p=4804}}
* [[Ontology engineering]]{{sfn|Meyer|Gurevych|2012}} and [[semantic network]] constructing.{{efn|http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu}}
* [[Ontology alignment|Ontology matching]].{{sfn|Lin|Krizhanovsky|2011}}
* [[Text simplification]]. Medero &amp; [[Mari Ostendorf|Ostendorf]]{{sfn|Medero|Ostendorf|2009}} assessed vocabulary difficulty ([[Readability|reading level]] detection) with the help of Wiktionary data. Properties of words extracted from Wiktionary entries (definition length and [[Part of speech|POS]], sense, and translation counts) were investigated. Medero &amp; Ostendorf expected that (1) very common words will be more likely to have multiple parts of speech, (2) common words to be more likely to have multiple senses, (3) common words will be more likely to have been translated into multiple languages. These features extracted from Wiktionary entries were useful in distinguishing word types that appear in [[Simple English Wikipedia]] articles from words that only appear in the Standard English comparable articles. 
* [[Part-of-speech tagging]]. Li et al. (2012){{sfn|Li|Graça|Taskar|2012}} built multilingual POS-taggers for eight resource-poor languages on the basis of English Wiktionary and [[Part-of-speech tagging#Use of Hidden Markov Models|Hidden Markov Models]].{{efn|The source code and the results of POS-tagging are available at https://code.google.com/p/wikily-supervised-pos-tagger}}

The '''Zinoviev letter''' was a fraudulent document published by the British ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper four days before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|general election in 1924]]. It purported to be a directive from [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the head of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in Moscow, to the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], ordering it to engage in seditious activities. It said the resumption of diplomatic relations (by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government) would hasten the radicalisation of the British working class. This would have constituted a significant interference in British politics, and as a result it was deeply offensive to British voters, turning them against the Labour Party. The letter seemed authentic at the time, but historians now agree it was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Madeira|title=Britannia and the Bear: The Anglo-Russian Intelligence Wars, 1917–1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNXCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|year=2014|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter aided the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], by hastening the collapse of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] vote that produced a Conservative landslide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the wars 1918–1940'' (1955) 188–94&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. J. P. Taylor]] argues that the most important impact was on the psychology of Labourites, who for years afterward blamed their defeat on foul play, thereby misunderstanding the political forces at work and postponing necessary reforms in the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In 1924, the socialist [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] formed a government for the first time. However, it was a [[minority government]] and was liable to fall if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] combined against it. In foreign policy, the government recognised the [[Soviet Union]] in February 1924, and proposed to lend it money. On 8 October 1924, the Labour government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] suffered defeat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on a [[motion of no confidence]]; this forced MacDonald to go to [[George V|King George V]] to seek a dissolution of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and a new election. The immediate cause of the parliamentary defeat had been the government's decision to drop the prosecution of communist editor [[John Ross Campbell]] under the [[Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797]], for publication of an open letter in ''[[Workers' Weekly (UK)|Workers' Weekly]]'' calling on soldiers to "let it be known that, neither in the class war nor in a military war, will you turn your guns on your fellow workers." [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|A general election]] was scheduled for 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'' (1965), pp. 218, 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Jeffery|title=The Secret History of MI6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52nYgUsVn9QC&amp;pg=PT195|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|pages=195–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letter===
Near the end of the short election campaign, there appeared in the press the text of a letter purporting to have originated from [[Grigory Zinoviev]], head of the Executive Committee of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) and Secretary of the Comintern [[Otto Wille Kuusinen]] and [[Arthur MacManus]], a British representative at a conference of the Executive Committee, and addressed to the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).

One particularly damaging section of this letter read:
{{quote|A settlement of relations between the two countries will assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising in any of the working districts of England, as the establishment of close contact between the British and Russian proletariat, the exchange of delegations and workers, etc. will make it possible for us to extend and develop the propaganda of ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives, [http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=The_Zinoviev_Letter "The Zinoviev Letter."] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090216122459/http%3A//yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title%3DThe_Zinoviev_Letter |date=16 February 2009 }}, retrieved Aug. 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Publication===
The damning document was published in the conservative British ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper four days before the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.warwick.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/russian/id/2595 Daily Mail, 25 October 1924, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The letter came at a sensitive time in relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, owing to Conservative opposition to the parliamentary ratification of the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement of 8 August.

The publication of the letter was severely embarrassing to Prime Minister MacDonald and his Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Gill Bennett, "'A Most Extraordinary and Mysterious Business': The Zinoviev Letter of 1924," Historians LRD No. 14. London: Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Jan. 1999. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his party faced the likelihood of losing office, MacDonald had not given up hope in the campaign. Following the letter's publication, any chance of an upset victory was dashed, as the spectre of internal revolution and a government oblivious to the peril dominated the public consciousness. MacDonald's attempts to cast doubt as to the authenticity of the letter were in vain, hampered by the document's widespread acceptance among government officials. He told his Cabinet that he "felt like a man sewn in a sack and thrown into the sea.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Election result===
The Conservatives decisively won the October 1924 election, ending the country's first Labour government. After the Conservatives formed a government with [[Stanley Baldwin]] as Prime Minister, a Cabinet committee investigated the letter and concluded that it was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Loch|last=Mowatt|title=Britain between the wars:1918–1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1955|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative government did not undertake any further investigation, despite continuing allegations that the letter was forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Loch|last=Mowatt|title=Britain between the wars:1918–1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1955|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 1924, the government cancelled the unratified trade agreement with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain, Soviet Russia and the collapse of the Versailles order, 1919-1939|first=Keith|last=Neilson|page=49|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[MI5]] decided at the same time that the letter was a forgery. In order to protect its reputation, it did not inform the government, which continued to believe it was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Andrew|title=Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M84O5pYh3rcC&amp;pg=PA151|year=2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial by Zinoviev===
The Comintern and the Soviet government vehemently and consistently denied the authenticity of the document.&lt;ref name="Bennett pg. 2"&gt;Bennett, "'A Most Extraordinary and Mysterious Business,'" p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Grigory Zinoviev issued a denial on 27 October 1924 (two days before the election), which was finally published in the December 1924 issue of ''[[The Communist Review]]'', the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB, well after the MacDonald government had fallen. Zinoviev declared:

{{quote|The letter of 15th September, 1924, which has been attributed to me, is from the first to the last word, a forgery. Let us take the heading. The organisation of which I am the president never describes itself officially as the "Executive Committee of the Third Communist International"; the official name is "Executive Committee of the Communist International." Equally incorrect is the signature, "The Chairman of the Presidium." The forger has shown himself to be very stupid in his choice of the date. On the 15th of September, 1924, I was taking a holiday in Kislovodsk, and, therefore, could not have signed any official letter. [...]

It is not difficult to understand why some of the leaders of the Liberal-Conservative bloc had recourse to such methods as the forging of documents. Apparently they seriously thought they would be able, at the last minute before the elections, to create confusion in the ranks of those electors who sincerely sympathise with the Treaty between England and the Soviet Union. It is much more difficult to understand why the English Foreign Office, which is still under the control of the Prime Minister, MacDonald, did not refrain from making use of such a white-guardist forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorii Zinoviev, "Declaration of Zinoviev on the Alleged 'Red Plot'", ''The Communist Review,'' vol. 5, no. 8 (Dec. 1924), pp. 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Impact===
[[File:Rakovsky letter to UK.jpg|left|thumb|[[Christian Rakovsky]] dictates the Note to the British government in response to the Zinoviev letter.]]
Historians now agree that the letter had little impact on the Labour vote—which held up. It aided the Conservatives by inducing a collapse in the Liberal vote; this led to a Conservative landslide. [[Robert Rhodes James]] says the letter provided Labour "with a magnificent excuse for failure and defeat. The inadequacies that had been exposed in the Government in its brief existence could be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Rhodes James|authorlink=Robert Rhodes James|title=The British Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeQZY8_rlLgC|year=1977|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the letter, thereby, as Taylor notes, misunderstanding the political forces at work and postponing necessary reforms in the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'', pp. 219–20, 226–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Loch Mowat|title=Britain Between the Wars, 1918–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA188|year=1955|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=188–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J Williams|title=Labour and Russia: The Attitude of the Labour Party to the USSR, 1924–1934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9D4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1989|publisher=Manchester U.P.|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of the election was not disastrous to Labour. The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats, making a total of 413 Members of Parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, retaining 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats, leaving them with only 40, and their vote count fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberals—whom Labour had displaced as the second-largest political party in 1922—were now clearly a minor party.

A 1967 British study deemed that the Labour Party was destined for defeat in October 1924 in any event, and argues that the primary effect of the purported Comintern communication was upon Anglo-Soviet relations:
{{quote|Under Baldwin, the British Government led the diplomatic retreat from Moscow. Soviet Russia became more isolated, and, of necessity, more isolationist. [...]

The Zinoviev letter hardened attitudes, and hardened them at a time when the Soviet Union was becoming more amenable to diplomatic contact with the capitalist world. The proponents of world revolution were being superseded by more pliant subscribers to the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] philosophy of "[[Socialism in One Country|Building Socialism in One Country]]". Thus, after successfully weathering all the early contradictions in Soviet Diplomacy, Britain gave up when the going was about to become much easier. And it gave up largely because the two middle-class parties suddenly perceived that their short-term electoral advantage was best served by a violent anti-Bolshevik campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Chester, Steven Fay, and Hugo Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter: A Political Intrigue.'' Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Co., 1968. Page xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current scholarship==
[[File:Robin Cook-close crop.jpg|thumb|Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] launched an official historical review of the Zinoviev letter in 1998]]
Contemporary scholarship on the Zinoviev letter dates from a 1967 [[monograph]] published by three British journalists working for ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. The authors, Lewis Chester, Steven Fay and [[Hugo Young]], asserted that two members of a Russian [[monarchist]] organisation called the [[Brotherhood of St. George]] composed the document in Berlin. Irina Bellegarde, the widow of Alexis Bellegarde, one of the two men said to have written the document, provided the authors with direct testimony that she had witnessed the forgery as it was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter,'' pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that her husband had drafted the letter after fellow-émigré Alexander Gumansky told him that a request to forge the letter had come from "a person in authority in London". Gurmansky and Bellegarde were later sentenced to death ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Soviet court.&lt;ref name=outcast/&gt; Bellegarde was later forced to work during the [[World War II|Second World War]] for the Russian section of the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence) in Berlin; there is evidence that he was the very effective British [[double agent]] known as "Outcast". He had been an important source on Soviet matters for the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS; known as MI6) before the war, raising the possibility that he already had links to British intelligence when involved with the Zinoviev letter.&lt;ref name=outcast&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/outcast-mi6-agent-zinoviev-letter-alexis-bellegarde The Observer newspaper: Revealed: the dark past of ‘Outcast’, MI6’s top wartime double agent, 11 October 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors are said to have studied Bolshevik documents and signatures extensively before creating a sensational document in an effort to undermine the Soviet regime's relations with the United Kingdom. The British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] had received the forgery on 10 October 1924, two days after the defeat of the MacDonald government on a confidence motion put forward by the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter,'' p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the dubious nature of the document, wheels were set in motion for its publication, members of the Conservative Party combining with Foreign Office officials in what Chester, Fay, and Young characterised as a "conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;Chester, Fay, and Young, ''The Zinoviev Letter,'' pp. 65–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

This book motivated the British Foreign Office to initiate a study of their own. For three years, [[Milicent Bagot]] of MI5 examined the archives and conducted interviews with surviving witnesses. She produced a long account of the affair, but the paper ultimately proved unpublishable because of its containing sensitive operational and personnel information.&lt;ref name="Bennett pg. 2"/&gt; Nevertheless, Bagot's work would prove important as a [[secondary source]] when the Foreign Office revisited the matter nearly three decades later.

Early in 1998, reports of a forthcoming book allegedly containing revelations about the origins of the Zinoviev letter, based on information from Soviet archives, led to renewed press speculation and parliamentary questions.&lt;ref&gt;The book in question was Nigel West and Oleg Tsarev's ''The Crown Jewels: The British Secrets at the Heart of the KGB Archives'', published by HarperCollins in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]] announced on 12 February 1998 that, in the interests of openness, he had commissioned the historians of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to prepare a historical memorandum on the Zinoviev letter, drawing upon archival documents.

A paper by the Chief Historian of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Gill Bennett, was published in January 1999 and contains the results of this inquiry. Bennett had free and unfettered access to the archives of the Foreign Office, as well as those of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI5. She also visited Moscow in the course of her research, working in the archives of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the Comintern archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''A Most Extraordinary and Mysterious Business,'' pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not every operational detail could be published because of British secrecy laws, Bennett's paper was a detailed account of the Zinoviev letter affair. Her report showed that the letter contained statements similar to those made by Zinoviev to other communist parties and at other times to the CPGB, but at the time of the letter (when Anglo-Soviet trade talks were taking place and a general election was impending), Zinoviev and the Soviet State were being more restrained towards the British.  Despite her extensive research, she concluded "it is impossible to say who wrote the Zinoviev Letter", though her best guess was that it was commissioned by White Russian intelligence circles from forgers in Berlin or the Baltic states, most likely in [[Riga]].

In 2006, Bennett incorporated some of her findings on the Zinoviev letter into chapter four of her biography of SIS agent [[Desmond Morton (officer)|Desmond Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Bennett, ''Churchill's Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence.'' London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--somebody needs to examine this book if they get a chance.--&gt; Another 2006 book on [[espionage|spycraft]] attributes authorship to [[Vladimir Orlov]], a former intelligence agent of [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Baron Wrangel]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Nigel West, ''At Her Majesty's Secret Service: The Chiefs of Britain's Intelligence Agency, MI6.'' London: Greenhill Books, 2006. pp. 34–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jonathan Pile published his book ''Churchill's Secret Enemy'', detailing the mysterious career of [[Sir George Joseph Ball]]. Pile accessed Ball's papers (most of which Ball had attempted to destroy) from the [[Bodleian Library]], along with other newly available sources. Pile's thesis, explained in the book, is that the Zinoviev letter was likely composed by Ball (at the time a long-serving MI5 officer) and his cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;''Churchill's Secret Enemy'', by Jonathan Pile, 2011, lulu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the British government said that they had lost a file on the Zinoviev letter scandal.&lt;ref name="Loss"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/government-admits-losing-thousands-of-papers-from-national-archives|title=Government admits 'losing' thousands of papers from National Archives|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was unable to say whether or not copies of the material had been made.&lt;ref name="Loss"/&gt;

In 2018, Bennett published her book ''The Zinoviev Letter: The Conspiracy that Never Dies''.&lt;ref&gt;Gill Bennett, ''The Zinoviev Letter: The Conspiracy that Never Dies''. Oxford University Press, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
