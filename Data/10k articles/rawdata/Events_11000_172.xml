__NOTOC__
Year '''485 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Cornelius and Vibulanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 269 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 485 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{nihongo|'''''A Blank in the Weather Map'''''|空白の天気図|Kuhaku-no Tenki-zu}} is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] author [[Kunio Yanagida (Critic)|Kunio Yanagida]], it was published in [[Japan]] in 1975.  The book is about the [[Hiroshima City Ebayama Museum of Meteorology|Hiroshima Meteorological Observatory]] in 1945. [[Hiroshima]] was fully destroyed in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic Bombing]] on August 6, 1945.

One month later, the phenomenal and powerful [[typhoon]] called [[Makurazaki Typhoon]] hit Hiroshima and 1229 dead, 1054 injured, 783 missing in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]].  This book investigated what really happened there, why the Meteorological Observatory couldn't help the people.  At that time, Hiroshima's administration systems were destroyed and was unable to inform the public about the typhoon.  The survivors lost their houses from the bomb and were living in barracks or hospitals.

'''Alexey Petrovich Maresyev''' ({{lang-ru|Алексей Петрович Маресьев}}; 20 May 1916&amp;nbsp;– 19 May 2001) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[fighter ace]] during [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

==Biography==
Maresyev was born in [[Kamyshin]] to Russian parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=353|title=Маресьев Алексей Петрович|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a skilled laborer who died shortly after he had returned from [[World War I]]. Before joining the army in 1937 Maresyev worked as a [[turning|turner]] and then participated in the construction of [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]]. In 1940 he graduated from [[Bataysk]] Military School of Aviation. He began his flights as a fighter pilot in August 1941. He had shot down four German aircraft by March 1942, but on 4 April 1942 his [[Polikarpov I-16]] was shot down near [[Staraya Russa]], almost certainly by future [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] holder and 48-kill experte ''Fw.'' Peter Siegler(3./JG-54)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aircrewremembered.com/KrackerDatabase/?q=Siegler%2C+Peter|title=Fw. Peter Siegler details|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asisbiz.com/Luftwaffe/Luftwaffe-aerial-victories-1942-A.html|title=Fw.Siegler was the only Luftwaffe pilot claiming I-16 that day(04 Apr 1942), note that JG 54 was operating in the same area as A.P.Maresyev.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nearly captured by Nazi forces.

Despite being badly injured, Alexey managed to return to the Soviet-controlled territory. During his 18-day-long journey his injuries deteriorated so badly that both of his legs had to be amputated below the knee. Desperate to return to his fighter pilot service, he subjected himself to nearly a year of exercise to master the control of his [[prosthetic]] devices, and succeeded at that, returning to flying in June 1943.

During a [[dog fight]] in August 1943, he shot down three German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] fighters. In total, he completed 86 combat flights and shot down 11 German warplanes. He was awarded the Golden Star of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (24 August 1943), the highest military decoration of the USSR. In 1944, Maresyev joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and two years later retired from the army.

In 1952, Maresyev graduated from the [[Higher Party School]]. In 1956, he obtained a Ph.D. in History and started working in the Soviet War Veterans Committee. Eventually, he became a member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR|Supreme Soviet]].

He died of a heart attack on 19 May 2001, just an hour ahead of his official 85th birthday celebration.
[[File:RU040-16.jpg|thumb|Maresyev depicted on a 2016 Russian stamp]]
His story served as a basis for the novel by [[Boris Polevoy]] ''The Story of a Real Man'' and a subsequent film (1948) directed by [[Aleksandr Stolper]] where his name was changed to Meresyev. The novel also inspired [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s last opera ''[[The Story of a Real Man]]''. In 2005 a documentary called ''Alexey Maresyev. The Fate of a Real Man'' was produced by [[Russia-1|Channel Russia]].

'''Anima Mundi''' is a competitive Brazilian video and [[film festival]] devoted exclusively to [[animation]], held every July in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]], Brazil.

==History==
The first edition of Anima Mundi happened in 1993, in Rio de Janeiro. The festival was created by a group of animators and filmmakers who wanted to raise awareness about animated productions and films in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.animamundi.com.br/a-historia-do-maior-festival-de-animacao-das-americas-em-10-minutos/ |title=A história do maior festival de animação das Américas em 10 minutos |publisher=Anima Mundi |date=2013-01-02|accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sessions==
The festival sessions consists of five different types:
* Shorts films (1 hour sessions of films that are running in the competitive session. The portfolio (films made for hire) are shown in these sessions also).
* Feature films.
* Children's short films (films made for children).
* Animation in course.
* Panorama (short films that are not in the competition).
* Future animator (films made by children).

==Open Studio==
In the main area of the festival there are several mini-workshops that teach the public how to animate in several styles. There are [[pixilation]], [[stop motion]], [[Traditional animation|hand drawn]].

==Other activities==
The Anima Mundi crew is also responsible for several other activities including Anima Escola which teaches animation in several public schools in Brasil and the Anima Mundi Itinerante that shows selected films in several other cities in Brazil.

There is also a contest of web and cellular phone animation that runs concurrently with the festival named Anima Mundi Web and Anima Mundi Cell. The participant animations are chosen by the public on the internet (a registration is required to vote) and the winner has their movie shown in the festival sessions.

Another couple, Bianca Hudson ([[Veronica Hamel]]) and her husband Cal Hudson ([[Michael Madsen]]), are having marital problems. He informs her that he has filed for divorce. Bianca had an abortion a few months earlier, for medical reasons. She believes it will save her marriage if she is pregnant again. As Cal is about to leave her, Bianca tells him that she is pregnant again. Bianca fakes the pregnancy, and when it is time for the imaginary baby to be born, she goes out to look for a baby to steal.

A disguised Bianca shows up for an interview for the position of babysitter for Karen's children. When Karen's mother Ruth steps into another room, Bianca walks out with the baby. Bianca goes home with the child and tells her husband that she had gone into labor, so she went to a local hospital, had the baby, and returned home, all in one day.

Karen realizes that Bianca is a suspect, and decides that the best way to find her daughter is to appeal to the media, and put flyers out. Cal's boss and wife make a surprise visit to the Hudson home, where they can plainly see that the baby is much older than four days, and they alert the authorities. Police arrive, arrest Bianca and Cal, and return the baby to its rightful home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/02/27/woman-allegedly-abducted-infant-to-aid-marriage/9acf092d-e8f6-4511-8cb9-216bc9ad3d20/ ''Woman allegedly abducted infant to aid in marriage'']- Retrieved 2016-12-26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balotsav''' ({{lang-en|Children's festival}}) is an annual international [[cultural festival]] for [[Telugu language|Telugu]] children.&lt;ref name="VVIT to host Balotsav 2017" /&gt; It includes competitions in various aspects such as [[painting]], [[elocution]] and [[drama]]. It was started as a town-level event in 1991. Since then the event has gained popularity among the school children, and is now a national level event with thousands of participants from several [[states of India]]. Prior to 2017, the event was conducted in [[Kothagudem]] in the second week of November. Starting in 2017, the venue has been changed to the [[Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology]], [[Guntur District]], [[Andhra Pradesh]].

==History==
In the interests of the [[Telugu language]] and to encourage talent and competitive spirit among school children, a town level inter-school festival was organized by the [[Kothagudem|Kothagudem Club]] for the first time in 1991 with competitions in four categories — [[essay|essay writing]], [[elocution]], [[quiz|general knowledge]] and [[painting]]. In 1995, it was conducted at district level with competitions in eight categories for two days. In 2000, celebrating ten years, this festival was retitled as "Balotsav" and was conducted at state level, with 3000 children from six districts of Andhra Pradesh (present day [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]).&lt;ref name="బాలోత్సవ్ అంకురార్పణ"&gt;{{cite web|title=బాలోత్సవ్ అంకురార్పణ|url=http://www.balotsav.com/html/balotsaw-ankurarpana.htm|website=Balotsav|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=te}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event and activities==
The festival is conducted in the second week of November, close to the [[Children's Day of India]].&lt;ref name="బాలోత్సవ్ అంకురార్పణ" /&gt; Competitions are held in categories such as painting, elocution, [[poetry]], essay writing, [[singing]], [[dancing]], classical performances, [[Folk dance|folk performance]]s, [[crafts]], [[monodrama]] and [[Letter_(message)|letter writing]]. Most of these competitions are held for the Telugu language, however a few of them such as the [[spelling bee]] and public speaking are conducted for the English language as well.&lt;ref name="పోటీ అంశాలు"&gt;{{cite web|title=పోటీ అంశాలు|url=https://www.balotsav.in/competitions/cultural-events|website=Balotsav|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=te}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Sliney''' (born 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/faa-manager-relives-events-of-sept-11/ |title=FAA Manager Relives Events Of Sept. 11 |last=Faber |first=Judy |publisher=Associated Press |date=April 25, 2006 |website=CBS News |access-date=October 8, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a former United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) National Operations Manager. His first day in this position was [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], and he was responsible for ordering a [[National Ground Stop]] across [[United States]] [[airspace]] in response to the [[terrorist]] attacks of 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=20603&amp;in_page_id=11 | date = October 4, 2006 | title = 60 Seconds: Ben Sliney | first = Andrew | last = Williams | work = [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro online]] | publisher = [[Associated Northcliffe Digital]] | location = London | accessdate = April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions on September 11, 2001 ==
After two planes crashed into the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], another into the Pentagon and one more in Pennsylvania, Sliney gave the order to land every plane in the air over the U.S. at the time ([[Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids|SCATANA]]), effectively shutting down U.S. airspace. There were roughly 4,200 aircraft in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-08-12-clearskies_x.htm | date = August 12, 2002 | title = Part I: Terror attacks brought drastic decision: Clear the skies | publisher = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = September 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unprecedented act, which the [[9/11 Commission]] later denoted as an important and decisive moment in that morning's chaos. While Sliney made the decision on his own initiative, he had the advice of an experienced staff of air traffic controllers and traffic managers. 
Although it was his first day in charge, Sliney had an over 25-year background in air traffic and management in the FAA. He had held various positions as an [[air traffic controller]], first line supervisor at several major facilities, and Operations Manager and Traffic Management Officer at [[New York TRACON]]. He also held positions as Traffic Management Specialist, National Operations Manager, Tactical Operations Manager at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and had Regional office experience as Manager, Airspace and Procedures Branch, Eastern Region.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Sliney later left the FAA to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Portrayals in films and television ==
Sliney was initially involved in the 2006 film ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' in an advisory role. He was then cast in a small role as an [[air traffic controller]]. Later, the film's writer and director, [[Paul Greengrass]], offered him the opportunity to play himself. Sliney also had a small role in Greengrass's 2010 film ''[[Green Zone (film)|Green Zone]]''. In 2001 he took part in the documentary ''[[Seconds from Disaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://natgeotv.com/asia/seconds-from-disaster-911/about |title=About Seconds from Disaster: 9/11 |work=[[Nat Geo TV]] |access-date=22 September 2018 |publisher=NGC Europe Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8579">[[File:FlyAmericanAirlines-by-Latuf2-modified.png|thumb|upright|Cartoon by [[Carlos Latuff]] depicting bin Laden as a pilot with [[American Airlines]]]]When authorities from the [[United States]] began scouring the globe looking for the [[location of Osama bin Laden]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, there were a number of unconfirmed sightings of Bin Laden in the United States.

Although some scholars believe that bin Laden took his new wife to visit the cities of [[Indianapolis]] and [[Los Angeles]] in 1978,&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], "The Osama bin Laden I Know', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; all later suggestions of bin Laden entering the United States were typically treated by authorities with skepticism, but were followed up at least cursorily.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;[[Quad-Cities Times]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20041221114723/http://www.qctimes.com/rednews/2002/01/03/build/national/story89.html Bin Laden seen in Utah; Elvis still at large], January 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, although many analysts believed he was hiding in [[South Asia]], there were no confirmed sightings of bin Laden from December 2001 to May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Nation]], [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/world/-/1068/660954/-/t1mp6j/-/index.html Osama remains as lethal as ever], September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lt. Charles Illsley of the [[West Valley City]] Police said that "When, day after day, media reports focus on a single person like [[Ted Bundy|Bundy]] or bin Laden, it is not too big a leap for somebody to go outside and think they see him. Images stick."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

All of these sightings were dismissed after bin Laden was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|confirmed dead]] after a U.S. raid in [[Pakistan]] on May 1, 2011.

In the immediate investigation surrounding the attacks, FBI agent Brian Rielly canvassed an [[apartment block]] to inquire about [[Osama Awadallah]], and were told by a woman that she had seen Osama bin Laden himself sharing an apartment with the 21-year-old student who was later acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Post]], [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/108925980.html?dids=108925980:108925980&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+16%2C+2002&amp;author=&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=008&amp;desc=WOMAN%3A+OSAMA+IS+MY+NEIGHBOR Woman, Osama in my neighbor], February 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/cms/uploadedFiles/FLOERSHEIMER/transcript.panel1.doc Transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611162130/http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/cms/uploadedFiles/FLOERSHEIMER/transcript.panel1.doc |date=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, a woman, sounding "very well-meaning and serious about her concern", told emergency dispatchers that she had encountered Osama bin Laden at a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store in [[Pleasant View, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Standard Examiner]], [http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=217137317&amp;page_url=%2f%2fwww.standard.net%2fstandard%2fnews%2fnews_story.html%3fsid%3d00011017232001996032%2bcat%3dnews%2btemplate%3dnews1.html%2bsubcat%3d&amp;page_last_updated=10%2f18%2f2001+6%3a25%3a49+PM&amp;firstName=Debbie&amp;lastName=Mecham Bin Laden spotted in Pleasant View?], October 18, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2001, a man in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] informed authorities that he had seen the terrorist attending a [[Rotary Club]] event earlier in the day.&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado Springs Gazette'', [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20011229/ai_n9997749/ The Buzz: No. 1 fugitive may be lost in Antlers garage], December 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, a caller phoned police in [[San Mateo, California]], to report that they had just seen Osama bin Laden hanging around the [[Caltrain]] station.&lt;ref&gt;''[[San Mateo Daily Journal]]'', [http://smdailyjournal.com/article_preview.php?type=lnews&amp;id=13894&amp;eddate= Police briefs], May 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a radio caller to [[George Noory]]'s ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' reported seeing bin Laden in [[Florida]].

Several dozen people had reported seeing bin Laden in [[Utah]]; driving a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] on [[Interstate 80|I-80]], in the mall, at [[McDonald's]], or in a [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] [[7-Eleven]] purchasing a [[Big Gulp]] by January 2002.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;''[[Lakeland Ledger]]'', "If you're looking for Osama, he's in Salt Lake City", January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Predominantly a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] state, this [[urban legend]] relies on the tenuous permittance of [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]] in Utah, and its generally [[arid]] climate, to justify why the leader of [[al-Qaeda]] would choose it as his hiding place.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Nick. "Urban Legends", 2005. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the claims, Utah authorities told media that Bin Laden's face had been one of those loaded into a [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] program for [[surveillance camera]]s at the [[E Center]] arena, expected to host the Olympic hockey tournament in 2002.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

An artist in [[Culver City, California]] phoned the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to report that she had seen Bin Laden in a local grocery store, and reassured them that she was an artist and knew how to recognize faces and was certain it was him.&lt;ref&gt;Midseason Replacements, [http://www.osamasightings.com/sightings.html America’s Next Top Model: There Is No Room For Normal in Modeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, the unemployed Thomas Potter of [[Olmsted Falls, Ohio]], wrote to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], as well as the media, requesting the $25 million reward for finding bin Laden, noting that [[WhitePages.com]] had three listings for the shadowy leader; one that suggested he worked at [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], another suggesting he worked at [[Bethesda Interactive Solutions]], and a third suggesting he lived in [[Hermitage, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ABC News]], [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/06/internet_absurd.html Internet absurdity: Bin Laden listed at FOX Headquarters], June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a woman reported to police that she had seen Osama bin Laden at the library in [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bellingham Herald]]'', [http://blogs.bellinghamherald.com/index.php?blog=13&amp;title=osama_bin_laden_sighting&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 Osama bin Laden sighting?] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, February 20, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
In December 2001, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine carried a satirical list of leads that the FBI had followed up since the attacks, noting "#6: Lady in Denver claims she saw Osama bin Laden driving off the fifth tee at her [[country club]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'', "Shouts and Murmers", December 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 [[Disassociated Press]] [[satire]] suggested that careful analysis of [[as-Sahab]] videos indicated bin Laden was hiding in [[Massachusetts]].

When a remote Alaskan fishing village, with a total population of only 2,400 residents, received more than $200,000 in federal [[Homeland Security]] funds to install [[surveillance camera]]s in 2005, it led to jokes about Osama bin Laden hiding in the village.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Larry. [[Los Angeles Times]], [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/10/local/me-risk10 Pondering the costs of terror protection], July 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, a frustrated resident of [[York, Pennsylvania]], told the local newspaper that he had seen bin Laden disappear in the tall weeds around Willis Run, and suggested [[tongue-in-cheek]] that perhaps the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] should finally come take care of the county's weed problem.&lt;ref&gt;[[York Daily Record]], [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=YK&amp;p_theme=yk&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10BEB45E58A41330&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Letters to the Editor, August 10, 2205]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', actors spoofed American politician [[Sarah Palin]] informing journalist [[Katie Couric]] that she suffered dozens of "false alarms" driving through New York, believing she had just seen Bin Laden driving a [[taxicab]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4657">[[Image:2002-KZH-W07-01.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Winning float at Bloemencorso Zundert 2002]]
'''Bloemencorso Zundert''' is the largest [[flower parade]] in the world entirely made by volunteers&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trouw.nl/home/grootste-dahliacorso-in-zundert~aad90823/&lt;/ref&gt;. The parade takes place on the first Sunday of September, in the small town of Zundert in [[The Netherlands]]. The floats are large artworks made of steel wire, cardboard, [[papier-mâché]] and flowers. In the [[Bloemencorso]] [[Zundert]], only [[dahlia]]s are used to decorate the objects and it takes thousands of them just to cover one float. Around 8 million dahlias are needed for the entire corso. Of these, around 6 million are cultivated in Zundert&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloemencommissie.nl/en/information&lt;/ref&gt;. It was founded in 1936.

The huge floats are made by twenty different hamlets and each of them consists of hundreds of builders, aged 1 to 100, who are all equally crazy about the bloemencorso. The older members of the hamlet are often responsible for planting and growing the dahlias, while the younger ones build the float in large temporary tents that are built exclusively for the event. 

The bloemencorso is also a competition. A professional and independent jury decides which float is the most beautiful and which hamlet will be crowned the winner of that year.

The Netherlands ratified the Unesco Convention for the Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage on 15 May 2012&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/08/30/startschot-uitvoering-unesco-verdrag-immaterieel-erfgoed&lt;/ref&gt;. This ratification was publicly announced during the parade on 2 September 2012 by State Secretary Halbe Zijlstra. On 13 October 2012, the first traditions were published on the national inventory. The first Dutch tradition on the national inventory is the Bloemencorso Zundert&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/08/30/startschot-uitvoering-unesco-verdrag-immaterieel-erfgoed&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Social element and hamlets==

Building a float for the corso is mainly a social event. Builders of all ages work side by side for over three months to get the float of their hamlet ready on time. It has to be as perfect as possible in order to win the competition. 
[[File:Andre-roks 1714.jpg|thumb|left|The Bloemencorso Zundert is mainly a social event. The photo shows a large group of people preparing the dahlias by putting pins through the flowers so they can be applied to the float.]]

The parade itself takes place on the first Sunday of September, but the members of the hamlets work on their floats all summer. The tents are put up in May or June and from then on the volunteers put all their effort in creating the giant artworks. The last three days before the actual parade are the most stressful. Because the flowers have to be fresh, the hamlets can only start applying the dahlias on the floats on the Thursday before the parade. If necessary, the builders will work day and night to have their float ready on Sunday.

Most people in Zundert will happily give up their days off to work on the float. For these days they use the term Corsokoorts (Corso-fever).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nu.nl/etten-leur/4902395/corsokoorts-loopt-langzaam-maar-zeker.html&lt;/ref&gt; The social cohesion that comes from building it is very important. A hamlet is like a family where everyone knows each other and everyone is welcome. After a long evening working on the float people drink a beer together and most hamlets organize all kinds of other activities like song contests and barbecues.

For years, seventeen hamlets participated in the corso. In recent years, three more decided to enter the competition.  Building a float costs a lot of money-- Around 15.000 to 20.000 euros per float, and hundreds of people are needed. Now there are twenty hamlets competing in Bloemencorso Zundert. They are:

'''CDnow, Inc.''' operated an [[online shopping]] website that sold [[compact disc]]s and music-related products. In April 1998, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company was valued at over $1 billion; however, it was acquired by [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] in July 2000 for $117 million and later shut down. At its peak, it employed over 750 people and had offices in [[Fort Washington, Pennsylvania]], [[New York City]], [[London]], and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=then/&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in February 1994 by twin brothers [[Jason Olim]] and Matthew Olim in their parents' basement in [[Ambler, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://technical.ly/philly/2012/07/31/cdnow-3-lessons-from-one-of-pioneering-dot-com-era-online-music-retailer/ | title=CDNow: 3 lessons from Fort Washington-based pioneering 1990s-era online music retailer | first=Juliana | last=Reyes | work=[[Technically Media]] | date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 5 employees, the company moved near the [[Penllyn (SEPTA station)|Penllyn train station]] in [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]] and a couple years later it moved to the [[Strawbridge and Clothier Store, Jenkintown|Strawbridge &amp; Clothier building]] in [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=then&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news/cd-then-and-now/article_824d64c9-ca38-57cc-ab24-e4c228c0f9f1.html | title=CD Then ... and Now | first=Jonathan | last=Valania | work=[[Philadelphia Weekly]] | date=February 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the company had revenues of $17 million and in February 1998, the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cdnow-goes-public-with-a-bang/ | title=CDnow goes public with a bang | work=[[CNET]] | date=February 10, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 1999, the company acquired [[N2K]], which operated [[Music Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050372/0001036050-99-000535.txt | title=FORM 8-K | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=March 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/1999/03/cdnow-now-is-the-time/ | title=CDNOW: NOW IS THE TIME | agency=[{Reuters]] | publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=March 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1999, the company announced a merger with [[Columbia House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/1999/07/cdnow-columbia-house-to-merge/ | title=CDNOW, COLUMBIA HOUSE TO MERGE | first=JOANNA | last=GLASNER | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=July 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/707177/Columbia-House-merging-with-online-retailer-CDNow.html | title=Columbia House merging with online retailer CDNow | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Deseret News]] | date=July 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2000, the deal was called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/14/business/cdnow-deal-with-sony-and-time-warner-is-called-off.html | title=CDNow Deal With Sony and Time Warner Is Called Off | first=Matt | last=Richtel | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 14, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2000, as the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' published a cover article called "Burning Up", which noted that the company was running out of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB953335580704470544 | title=Burning Up | first=Jack | last=Willoughby | work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | date=March 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000, the company closed its London office to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2000/06/19/daily3.html | title=CDNow reportedly closes office | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=June 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] acquired the company for $117 million, a price that was down over 90% from the valuation of the company at its peak in April 1998. The 2 Olin brothers got a total of $17 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/07/20/deals/bmg_cdnow/ | title=Bertelsmann buys CDNow | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=July 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Café Scientifique''' is a [[grassroots]] public science initiative currently running in more than 40 towns across the [[United Kingdom]] and cities in other countries. At least twelve cafés outside the UK are organised by the [[British Council]] alone. Similar but independent events have also sprung up in many cities using variations of the "Café Scientifique" or "'''Science Café'''" monikers. Typically, one monthly evening meeting is organised in a [[café]] or [[bar (establishment)|bar]] to which one or several scientists are invited to talk in laymen's terms about their work in a topical or even controversial area. The events are known for their informal and friendly atmosphere, and are believed to improve the image of scientists and careers in science. Cafe Scientifique aims to demystify scientific research for the general public and empower non-scientists to more comfortably and accurately assess science and technology issues, particularly those that impact on social policy making.

Many Café Scientifique organisers choose to communicate with each other by means of a centrally-managed [[mailing list]].

There also is a series of cafés run in schools. These are called Junior Café Scientifique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Junior Cafe Scientifique Scheme|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/science.outreach/outreachschemes/juniorcafescientifiquescheme/|website=Durham University Science Outreach|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Café Scientifique was first organised by Duncan Dallas in [[Leeds]] in 1998, but is based on the [[Café Philosophique]] movement which the philosopher [[Marc Sautet]] (1947-1998) started in France in 1992.

In France it was started by scientists who thought they ought to inform the public more, and in the UK it was started by members of the public who wanted to know more about science. In both countries it moved out of an academic structure into popular locations, and thereby attracted audiences.

It started at a time in the UK where COPUS, the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copusproject.org/  | title=Committee on the Public Understanding of Science Homepage | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;(organised by the [[Royal Society]] and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]), thought that the public did not understand science and needed to be better educated and lectured to. Newspapers considered it very odd that people should go to a café, drink wine and discuss science rather than just gossip.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} However the public were becoming more concerned about topics like Mad Cow Disease, GM crops, cloning, etc.

During the last decade the subject has moved from Public Understanding through Science Communication to Public Engagement and has been embraced by academic disciplines, government departments, research institutes, politicians, educators and policy makers. When it started Café Scientifique was considered weird and avant-garde, however it is now enmeshed in a huge industry.

==Philosophy==

Although Café Scientifique is an idea rather than a particular place, the location is considered important to engender informal scientific debate. The cafe setting is selected to be relaxing, in contrast with a more formal lecture hall setting and everyone attending is given equal respect. The aim of the Café Scientifique is, according to author and [[neurologist]] [[Oliver Sachs]] "to bring science back into culture."  Whereas science is often seen as boring, difficult and mathematical, the aim of the Café Scientifique is to make science relevant, powerful and important, addressing topics such as the universe, climate change, gene mapping and how our brains function. Cafes are assumed to engage and address their local culture. In Britain there is usually one speaker, in Denmark there are two (one non-scientist) and in France often four (as well as a band in the interval). In Japan more respect should be shown to old people, so questions and opinions are done by SMS onto a big screen, so that no one knows the age of the commentator. In Africa topics are down-to-earth – how to live with HIV, avoid Malaria or understand water purification. The Cafes aim to promote a cultural examination of science by local people.

==Current developments==
Individual Cafes have many different names and often don’t require funding – they only pay the speaker’s travelling expenses by asking for donations from the audience. So Cafes provide the opportunity for individuals and groups to initiate many different forms – street science, comedy, music, theatrical readings, dancing, demonstration, etc.

Internet technology has provided the basis for the expansion of Cafes. The main website [http://www.cafescientifique.org] has provided support for cafes to start up in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But now individual Cafes are using their websites to expand their audience and prolong the discussion.

Cafes have been set up in schools in France, Italy, Britain and now in Africa. Pupils are asked what subjects they would like to discuss, and are then asked to organise, advertise and chair the meeting, which should not take place in a classroom. Usually a speaker (younger rather than older) comes from a local university to talk at the school. Subjects can vary from Flying, Mobile Phones, and The Science of Love to Climate Change.

Finally, efforts are being made to take Cafes to areas which are problematic – to the countryside, Montana in the USA and Cockermouth in the Lake District, UK – to islands, Corfu in Greece and Orkney in Scotland – dangerous areas, Palestine – and immigrants or gypsies in Hungary and the UK. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In Melbourne, a recent development is 'Campfires and Science' - built on the same principles, but gathering people around the familiar setting of a campfire to learn, share ideas and get involved in doing science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610133611/https://about.hindawi.com/opinion/campfires-and-science/|title=Citizen Science: Campfires and Science {{!}} About Hindawi|date=2018-06-10|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mailchi.mp/greatforestnationalpark/great-forest-national-park-update-autumn|title=Great Forest National Park Update - Autumn|date=2017-05-15|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-05-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170515023231/http://mailchi.mp/greatforestnationalpark/great-forest-national-park-update-autumn|archivedate=2017-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By organising trips into the forest and other wilderness area, the movement hopes to bridge the gap between metropolitan areas and rural areas by encouraging the public to get involved in doing science themselves, such as surveying species and mapping using drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/campfiresandscience/|title=(1) Campfires and Science|date=2017-05-15|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-05-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170515023452/https://www.facebook.com/groups/campfiresandscience/|archivedate=2017-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global '''Carnival Against Capital''' took place on Friday, 18 June 1999. It was an international day of protest timed to coincide with the [[25th G8 summit]] in [[Cologne]], Germany. The [[carnival]] was inspired by the 1980s [[Stop the City]] [[protest]]s and the Global Street Party, which happened at the same time as the 24th [[G8]] Summit in [[Birmingham]], England in 1998. The rallying slogan was ''Our Resistance is as Transnational as Capital''

==Before the day==

===Organization===
Preparations took many months. The day became known as simply '''J18'''. In London, the open organising group met every month. The day was also discussed in the open weekly meetings of London [[Reclaim the Streets]]. There were between 10 and 100 people at these discussions. An international email discussion list was set up. Fund-raising was carried out by collecting anonymous donations and running a series of benefit gigs.

''There is only so much that can be learned from how J18 was organised. J18 and the many other successful anti-capitalist events in recent history were produced by a free flowing convergence of events and political currents combined with sheer luck.''
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301100633/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm |archivedate=2007-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Image:FlyerJ18.jpg|thumbnail|RTS flyer for J18]]

In London, a concerted publicity campaign was carried out, using colourful stickers and 10,000 posters. Workers were encouraged to phone in sick. An eighteen-minute promotional video was made and distributed globally. ''Squaring up to the Square Mile'' was a 32-page pamphlet produced by Reclaim the Streets and [[Corporate Watch]] which gave details of [[financial institution]]s. An A3 map of the [[City of London]] (the "Square Mile") showed where they were located. 4,000 copies were produced.

====''Evading Standards''====
A spoof version of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', daily London-based newspaper was produced. 30,000 copies were printed and distributed on June 17 and 18 to City workers. The cover resembled the layout of the actual newspaper and the inner pages contained [[agitprop]] and humour. The newspaper was handed out for free. The headline read 'Global Market Meltdown', followed by a spoof report of the collapse of the world's financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libcom.org/library/evading-standards-spoof-newspaper-1999 Evading Standards]'', 18 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fringeli&gt;Christoph Fringeli, "[http://datacide.c8.com/radical-intersections/ Radical Intersections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507174647/http://datacide.c8.com/radical-intersections/ |date=May 7, 2013 }}", ''Datacide'' 10, 31 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mainstream media===
On January 29, 1999, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' ran a full page article entitled "Police spy bid to smash the anti-car protesters."
Closer to the day, stories abounded in the media about possible violent scenarios.

===Reaction of the City===
It was clear that the City was taking things very seriously. All leave was cancelled for [[City of London Police]] officers on the day. The [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] sent letters out to the Managing Director of every firm in the square mile (and many outside it) with instructions to circulate the warning of "major disruption" and the need for extra security measures to be taken on June 18 to all staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no8/j18.html Friday June 18th 1999 (Do or Die)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==June 18==

===London===
In London, there was a large march planned for midday and autonomous actions in the morning. Among other actions, a [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bicycle ride brought the [[City of London]] traffic to a standstill in rush hour. The [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]] closed down a [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds]] bank with a 'die-in'.

====The march====
At twelve, the protesters met at [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] train station. [[Food Not Bombs]] and [[Veggies of Nottingham|Veggies Catering Campaign]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veggies.org.uk/archive.htm#1998|title=Veggies Archive : Campaigning for Human Rights, Animal Right and the Environment|website=www.veggies.org.uk|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave out free food and a samba band played. Carnival masks were distributed in four different colours and five processions set off in different directions (there were four marches planned and another occurred spontaneously).&lt;ref name=Fringeli/&gt; The spontaneous procession erupted in anger at [[London Wall]] when a woman was hit by a reversing police van and had her leg broken.

Between two and three o'clock, the marches came together and an estimated 5,000 people converged on the [[London International Financial Futures Exchange]] (LIFFE). A fire hydrant was set off, symbolising the freeing of the [[Walbrook]] river, and the lower entrance to the [[LIFFE]] was bricked up. Banners were hung, reading ''Global Ecology Not Global Economy'', and ''The Earth Is A Common Treasury For All'', the latter a quote from [[Gerrard Winstanley]] of the seventeenth century [[Diggers]] movement. Graffiti messages were sprayed and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras were disabled. Then sound systems set up and drum &amp; bass music and punk bands played.

In the early afternoon a small group of protesters broke into the Cannon Bridge building, smashed up the reception area and tried to access the LIFFE trading floor, but were prevented by a security screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/18/newsid_2515000/2515679.stm |title=On this day - 18 June - 1999: Anti-capitalism demo turns violent |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=17 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"We'd failed in our under-ambition. Unprepared, we never imagined we could get so close to occupying a trading floor in one of the City’s major exchanges. We'd planned the wall, and built it. We'd planned to free the Walbrook, and done it. But we’d stopped short of planning a full-scale occupation"'' according to Wat Tyler in 2003.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=August 2015}}

The rest of the afternoon became a battle as police using horses and personal incapacitant spray containing [[CS gas]] pushed the protesters down [[Lower Thames Street]] and out of the City of London. In the aftermath, protesters gathered peacefully in [[Trafalgar Square]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=August 2015}}

===Internet coverage and documentary===
The event was covered by [[streaming media|live streaming]] and internet [[citizen journalism]], which at the time were new. In London, the day's events were transmitted live{{r|dissent}} by [[video jockey|VJ]] [[Matt Black (DJ)|Matt Black]] over the internet until the servers were blocked up by the sheer volume of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Australia, CAT TV and Active Sydney got a team together for all day coverage. They collected stories, photos and videos from activists and published them in a [[news feed]]. The global networking of activists, and technology created, formed the basis of the [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]] network.{{r|chat}}{{r|j18sydney}}

The [[electronic civil disobedience]] group called for a [[virtual sit-in]] of the Mexican embassy in London and brought the embassy website to a standstill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

On June 23, 1999, [[Undercurrents_(news)|Undercurrents]], the alternative news organisation, premiered a 30-minute documentary in Oxford about the day produced from the pooled footage of a dozen video operators in London. The documentary was shown at festivals and social centres all over the UK during the following months.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Global===
In [[Nigeria]], 10,000 people took to the streets of [[Port Harcourt]]. A street was renamed in honour of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] and his younger brother [[Owens Wiwa|Owens]] addressed the crowd.

Katherine Ainger described the global atmosphere of protest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The June 18 events were as diverse as the groups taking part. In [[Barcelona]] "street reclaimers" invoked the slogan of the rebellious Paris students of 1968, "Sous les paves, la plage" ("Under the sidewalk, the beach") and, dressed in swimming costumes, put out towels and sun-bathed on the road, handed out French fries to commuters in their cars, and later took part in a 700-strong street party. Music and dancing also hit the streets of [[San Francisco]] with "art attackers" who, armed with giant puppets and candy, lobbied those working for multinationals that exploit sweatshop workers to take the day off work and "join the revolution." In [[Melbourne]], Australia, [[Kim Beazley]], leader of the opposition, received a custard pie in the face for speaking at a global trade conference sponsored by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], while thousands of party goers in Sydney held up traffic as a massive street festival got underway.''&lt;ref name=Ainger&gt;[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Global_Economy/GlobalCarnival.html Katherine Ainger, "Global Carnival Against Capital", ''Z Magazine'', September 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In total there were protests in 40 countries, these included [[Tel Aviv]], [[Minsk]], [[Madrid]], [[Valencia]], [[Prague]], [[Hamburg]], [[Cologne]], [[Milan]], Rome, [[Siena]], [[Florence]], [[Ancona]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Zurich]], [[Geneva]], Toronto, Vancouver, [[Ottawa]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], New York, Los Angeles, [[Austin, Texas]], [[Boston]], and [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=Ainger/&gt;

==After the day==

===Arrests===
In the United Kingdom, James B***K (last name masked by individual) pleaded guilty in January 2004 to Section 20 Unlawful Wounding (GBH) and two violent disorder charges, plus an additional charge of skipping bail in 2000. He received a four and a half year sentence.
A total of sixteen people were arrested on the day. The [[Metropolitan Police]] made a website listing 138 photographs of those wanted for further questioning. Using CCTV footage extensively, they had arrested a further 50 people one year on.

In [[Eugene, Oregon]] Rob Thaxton was sentenced to 88 months in jail after throwing a rock at a police officer while trying to avoid being arrested.

Others who had been identified at the Carnival were arrested at later events, particularly the 30 November WTO protests.

===Later events===
J18 was the first in the line of huge [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-globalisation]] protests. Since then there have been many protests, the largest being the following:
* Against the [[World Trade Organization]] on [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|November 30, 1999]] ([[Seattle]])
* Against the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] in [[Anti-globalization protests in Prague|September 2000]] (Prague)
* Against the [[27th G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]].
* Against the [[31st G8 summit]] in [[Gleneagles Hotel]] in [[Perthshire]], Scotland.

The '''Caterham Academy''' is a [[Auto racing|motor-racing]] championship exclusively open to novices, as their first foray into motorsport.

== Scholarship years - 1995-1999 ==
In 1995 the Caterham Scholarship, a novices-only speed events and racing series, was established in the UK, to introduce new drivers to motorsport.&lt;ref name="CaterhamAcademy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caterham Academy|url=http://uk.caterhamcars.com/motorsport/academy|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series format was a mix of sprints, [[hillclimbing|hillclimbs]] and circuit races.

===Ford Crossflow Cars 1995-97===
The initial cars were [[live axle]] 1600cc Ford 'Kent' Crossflows with rear-exit exhausts. The spec included a Caterham lightened &amp; balanced flywheel, uprated competition clutch cover and drive plate, Caterham distributor with Ignitor electronic ignition, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 120, 30mm venturi, with K&amp;N performance filters. The maximum power was 100&amp;nbsp;bhp at 6000 rpm. They ran on list 1A Michelin MXT tyres.

===Early Vauxhall Cars - 1998===
In 1998, the engine supplier changed to Vauxhall, with 1600 single overhead cam engines being used. They featured a ported &amp; skimmed cylinder head, standard Vauxhall camshaft, flywheel and clutch cover plate, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 115, with K&amp;N performance filters. The maximum power was 101 ps at 5,500 rpm and a max torque of 107&amp;nbsp;lb ft at 3,600 rpm. The main visual difference between the Fords and the Vauxhalls was that the Vauxhalls had a side-exit exhaust, as opposed to the rear exit of the Fords.

The early Vauxhall cars used the same Spax dampers with manual adjusters as the Fords, with an option to adjustable spring platforms.

===Later Vauxhall Cars===
The 1999 and 2000 Vauxhall cars had linear coil springs over Bilstein (rather than Spax) dampers, again with the option of adjustable spring platforms, to optimise corner-weighting.

===Rebranding to 'Academy'===
For the 2000 season, the Scholarship was rebranded the "Caterham Academy"&lt;ref name="CaterhamPastWinners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caterham past winners|url=http://uk.caterhamcars.com/motorsport/academy/past-winners|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academy Years - 2001-2006==
For the 2001 Academy, cars were supplied with the more modern [[De dion tube|Dedion]] chassis, and a [[Rover K engine|Rover K series]] engine. An increasing number of cars were supplied with full rollover cages by this point, although it was not until 2003 that all Academy cars came with a full cage rather than a FIA-spec rollover bar and supporting strut in the passenger footwell.

Cars were supplied with the Caterham ([http://www.archmotor.co.uk Arch Motors]) race chassis in 2001 and 2002. This is recognisable by a shorter passenger footwell (to accommodate the battery in the engine bay) and the handbrake under the dash on the passenger side. Cars from 2003 to 2006 were supplied with a centre (tunnel) handbrake.

From 2004, the Academy chassis was modified slightly and made more rigid. The transmission tunnel was raised slightly, and all cars were supplied with a lowered floorpan, giving the driver a couple of inches more headroom under the rollcage. The rollcage supplier changed at this point, as cars were supplied with 'Caged' rollover cages with slightly curved bars and different frontal load protection, rather than the 'Safety Devices' cages with straight diagonal bars of 2001 to 2003.

2005 cars were supplied with the new style combined side-impact and wheel intrusion bar, which allows the doors to open (the older style bar does not).

2006 cars were supplied with a new D-style 'Caged' rollcage. 2006 was the last year of the Arch Motors Academy chassis.

==Move to Metric Chassis - 2007==
In 2007, manufacture of the Academy chassis was moved to 'Caged' in Bristol, and the chassis were now largely computer-made and metric rather than imperial in their measurements. Other than that, the chassis were much the same as the 2004-onwards ones, albeit with some modifications in the engine bay area to accommodate the upcoming Sigma engines. The engines remained the Rover K-series for 2007.

==Move to Sigma Engines - 2008==
In 2008, Caterham moved from the K-series to the [[Ford Sigma engine]], supplied in a 1.6 litre format.&lt;ref name="CaterhamPastWinners" /&gt; The Caged chassis was modified to incorporate the new engine (such as the exhaust exiting on the right via a 4-branch system with separate catalytic converter), and a number of new parts were manufactured.

The current Academy package (2014) is that for £21,495,&lt;ref name="CaterhamAcademy" /&gt; entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (although a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a setup day, three speed events (sprints and hillclimbs), and four circuit races.

In recent years there have been 2 Academy groups, each of 28 drivers. For 2009, there were plans to run 3 groups of 28 entrants, but ultimately this did not come to pass. 2010's Academy also has two groups.

==Post-Academy Racing==
There is now a considerable amount of racing choice available for cars and drivers who have completed the Academy, both in the [[Caterham Racing|Caterham Motorsport Ladder]] and in the [[Caterham Graduates Racing Club]].

A number of drivers leave the Caterham Academy and move on to other forms of racing, and an equal number sell up and never race again. But most move into either [[Caterham Racing|Roadsport B or Roadsport A]] or into [[Caterham Graduates Racing Club|Grads racing]].

The '''Choking Doberman''' is an [[urban legend]] that originated in the [[United States]]{{R|"Brunvand"}}. [[Urban legend]]s are, as Patricia T. O'Conner of [[The New York Times]] described, "fictitious narratives that are passed from person to person in the guise of true stories and sometimes persist until they reach the status of [[folklore]]."{{R|"O'Conner"}} The story of the choking doberman fits into this category of folklore and generally involves a protective pet found by its owner gagging on human fingers lodged in its throat. As the story unfolds, the dog's owner discovers an intruder whose hand is bleeding from the dog bite.{{R|"Nicolini"}}

[[Jan Harold Brunvand]], a folklorist and professor emeritus of English at the [[University of Utah]],{{R|"Helmer"}} wrote about this and other urban legends in his book ''The Choking Doberman and Other "New" Urban Legends''{{R|"O'Conner"}}{{R|"Bethke"}} published in 1984 by W.W. Norton &amp; Company.{{R|"O'Conner"}} He provided the reader with several varying accounts of the story. While the basic elements of the story remain the same in each version, the details, such as the number of fingers found, the breed of dog, and the condition of the intruder when discovered change slightly.{{R|"Nicolini"}}

== The legend ==
A woman goes out for the evening with friends. Upon her return, she is greeted by her pet [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]] choking in the hallway. Alarmed, she takes the pet to the veterinarian. The vet announces that he must perform a [[tracheotomy]] on the animal and he will call her when he has news. When the woman arrives home, the vet calls and tells her to leave the house at once. The dog was choking on three human fingers. The woman calls the [[police]], who search the house. They discover the burglar, hiding in a [[closet]], passed out from blood loss caused by having three fingers bitten off.

=== Origin ===
In his book Brunvard cites an 1800 CE fable about Llewellyn and his dog Gellert as the oldest known ancestor of the story.{{R|"Brunvand"}} In that story the prince Llewellyn leaves his son at home with his guardian dog Gellert. Upon returning from hunting the hound greets him with a bloody face and he, thinking the animal has eaten the child, immediately slays it. When he investigates the nursery the prince discovers the child playing with the hair of a slain wolf that Gellert had saved the baby from.{{R|"Ashliman"}}

In her 1992 paper ''The Ambiguous Guardians'' Adrienne Mayor cites the fifth century CE narrative ''The Omen of the Wolf'' as an earlier echo of both the 1800 fable and the urban legend as it is today. In this myth the emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]'s retinue was attacked by a pair of wolves. When the beasts were killed they were found to have a pair of human hands in their bellies. Their aggressive behavior - coupled with the awful last meal - were taken as a sinister sign and rumors lit a panic in Rome. The emperor's official [[propagandist]], [[Claudian]], attempted to counter the popular understanding of the sign with his poem ''The Gothic War''.{{R|"Mayor"}}

=== First appearance in United States ===

The first verifiable appearance of the legend is in the [[Phoenix New Times]] on June 24, 1981, pictured to the right.

From the article, in part{{R|"Brunvand"}}{{R|"Phoenix"}}:

''Gagging Dog Story Baffles Police''
 It happened in Las Vegas. A woman returned from work and found her large dog, a Doberman, lying on the floor gasping for air. Concerned over the animal's welfare, she immediately loaded the pet into her car and drove him to a veterinarian.
 ...
 According to the story, police arrived at her house and found an unconscious intruder, sans fingers, lying in a closet.
 ''New Times'' learned of the story from an employee of a large industrial plant in the Valley. He said he had gotten the story third hand from another employee who in turn had said he heard from a woman whose relatives in Las Vegas knew the dog's owner. As of Friday ''New Times'' was not able to nail down the identity of the Doberman's mistress.
 According to a spokesman at the ''Las Vegas Sun'', that paper, too, was very interested in breaking the story. Unfortunately, even though the story was all over Vegas last Thursday, the paper - and police - weren't able to dig up one shred of evidence to prove the incident ever occurred. "The police are baffled," the ''Sun'' spokesman said.

=== Variations ===

* The number of fingers dredged from the dog’s throat varies, as does their color. Though in many tellings the race of the intruder goes unspecified, at times the discovered digits are described as “black” or “Mexican,” adding a racist spin to the tale.{{R|"Snopes"}}
* In the 1980s, a Doberman was the usual star in this story; in the 1990s, the dog became a pit bull when that breed gained media prominence as the decade’s fierce dog of choice. Other breeds of pooch have been known to report for duty in this tale as well — always large, scary-looking dogs.{{R|"Snopes"}}
* The thief is usually discovered hiding in a closet, the bedroom, or in the basement, but in some tellings he gets away from the house and is only brought to justice when his injuries force him to visit an emergency room. His missing fingers identify him as the culprit police are looking for.{{R|"Snopes"}}
* With very few exceptions, the troubled dog owner is female. Moreover, the setting of the tale makes it very clear she lives alone.{{R|"Snopes"}}
* Most of the time, the dog’s presence in the woman’s life passes uncommented upon; nothing of the dog’s history or her reasons for keeping him are mentioned. Occasionally though, we’re told the dog was given by her father when she went off to college in a distant city, or that in the wake of her divorce her lawyer recommended her getting a big dog for protection.{{R|"Snopes"}}

== Appearances and tie-ins outside the story ==
Ronald B. Tobias cites the story as an example of oral tradition that through repeated retelling has become ''plot perfect''.{{R|"Tobias"}}

This story appears in the 1991 Judith Gorog novel On Meeting Witches at Wells.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

There is a margarita named the Choking Doberman made with [[habañero]]-infused tequila at Big Daddy's in Massapequa, New York.{{R|"Margarita"}}

The story also appears in Season 1, episode 1 of [[Mostly True Stories?: Urban Legends Revealed]] from 21:00 to 28:55{{cn|date=April 2018}}{{rp|move to refs}}

The '''Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876''', was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] ([[39 &amp; 40 Vict.]], Public Acts, c. 77.) which set limits on the practice of, and instituted a licensing system for [[animal experimentation]], amending the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1849]]. Its [[long title]] was ''An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to Animals (15th August 1876).'' The Act was replaced 110 years later by the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]].

==The Act==
[[Image:Original-brown-dog-statue.jpg|left|frame|Perception that the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 was weak led to a [[libel]] suit, erection of this monument for a [[Vivisection|vivisected]] ''''[[Brown Dog affair|brown dog]]'''', and riots by medical students in 1907.]]
The Act stipulated that researchers would be prosecuted for cruelty, unless they conformed to its provisions, which required that an experiment involving the infliction of pain upon animals to only be conducted when "''the proposed experiments are absolutely necessary for the due instruction of the persons'' [so they may go onto use the instruction] ''to save or prolong human life''".&lt;ref name=KeanSociety/&gt;

Furthermore, the Act stated that should the experiment occur, the animal must be [[Anesthesia|anaesthetised]], used only once (though several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted), and killed as soon as the study was over.&lt;ref name=KeanSociety&gt;[[Kean, Hilda]]. "An Exploration of the Sculptures of Greyfriars Bobby, Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Brown Dog, Battersea, South London, England," ''Society and Animals'', Volume 1, Number 4, December 2003, pp. 353–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutions under the Act could be made only with the approval of the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="Mason10"&gt;Mason, Peter. ''The Brown Dog Affair''. Two Sevens Publishing, 1997, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was applicable to [[vertebrate]] animals only.

==History and controversy==
Opposition to [[vivisection]] had led the government to set up a [[Royal Commission]] on Vivisection in July 1875, which recommended that legislation be enacted to control it. This Act was created as a result, but was criticized by [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]]nbsp;– itself founded in December 1875&amp;nbsp;– as "infamous but well-named," in that it made no provision for public accountability of licensing decisions. The law remained in force for 110 years, until it was replaced by the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]],&lt;ref name=NAVShistory&gt;[http://newsite.navs.org.uk/about_us/24/0/299/ "The history of the NAVS"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118102555/http://newsite.navs.org.uk/about_us/24/0/299/ |date=January 18, 2008 }}, retrieved December 04, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the subject of similar criticism from the modern [[animal rights movement]].

Such was the perceived weakness of the Act, that vivisection opponents chose, on at least one occasion&amp;nbsp;– the [[Brown Dog affair]]&amp;nbsp;– to incite a [[libel]] suit rather than seek a prosecution under the Act.

==Penalties==
The Act states, in part:
{{quotation|Any person performing or taking part in performing any experiment calculated to give pain, in contravention of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall, if it be the first offence, be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds, and if it be the second or any subsequent offence, be liable, at the discretion of the court by which he is tried, to a penalty not exceeding one hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months.}}

'''Fantoche''' is an [[animation]] [[film festival]] with international participation and takes place each year in the city of [[Baden, Switzerland]].

The first Fantoche took place in 1995 with the goal to enrich the Swiss cultural life with an animation film festival of international reach. Today, Fantoche has become indeed an inter branch meeting point for visual media. All kinds of different animation films, most of them [[Film festival|Short films]] but some feature-length movies as well, are shown in four different cinemas.

The festival sets various priorities like the Swiss film industry, children's film, history, Asia, the US, etc. The competition programme aims to challenge the artistic border of animation film and to push it forward.

== Award Winner ==
In 2005 an amount of 23'000 Swiss francs has been awarded in the following categories:
* '''High Risk'''- Winner [[Craig Welch]] (CA) for ''Welcome To Kentucky''
* '''Hot Talent''' – Winner [[Takashi Kimura (animator)|Takashi Kimura]] (JP) for ''Striking Daughter''
* '''Best Visual''' – Winner [[JJ Villard]] (US) for ''Son of Satan''
* '''Best Sound''' – Winner [[Dmitrij Geller]] (RU) for ''Little Night Symphony''
* '''Best Idea/Best Script''' – Winner [[Arash Riahi]] (AT) for ''Mississippi''
* '''Audience Award''' – Winner [[Laura Neuvonen]] (FI) for ''The last Knit'' [[and Ivan Maksimov]] (RU) for ''The Wind Along the Coast''
* '''Minimotion''' – Winner [[Jean-Claude Campell]] (CH) for ''Metamorpho''

In 2007, the prestigious jury prize was awarded to two Russian movies, which, in accordance to the jury, "particularly point out the innovative character of Russian animation films. The 10'000 francs worth main award was awarded to "Foolish Girl" by the Russian artist [[Zoija Kirejewa]] for "the celebration of a strange female character, an unconventional screenplay and its captured universality through brief moments of beautiful drawings, emotions and gestures".

In 2009, Fantoche introduced a Swiss competition with an award ("Best Swiss") and an Audience Award. One year later the national award "High Swiss Risk" was awarded as well. Furthermore were there two new awards of children's film after 2009; one jury award( which consisted of a five-headed children's jury) and a children's Audience Award.

==Career==
Malthe-Sørenssen grew up in [[Bærum]] and started his journalistic career in the local newspaper ''[[Budstikka|Asker og Bærums Budstikke]]''. He later worked in ''[[Bergensavisen|Bergens Arbeiderblad]]'', ''[[Dagbladet]]'' and ''[[Se og Hør]]'', and as an editor with ''[[Nettavisen]]'' and the [[TV3 (Norway)|TV3]] television show ''Etterlyst'' ("Wanted"). He then left journalism to work as a private detective, and has been a paid private detective on behalf of several defendants in criminal cases. He changed his name from Geir Selvik to Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssen in 2010, and to Geir Eriksen in 2017.&lt;ref name="journalisten"&gt;[http://journalisten.no/2016/02/dette-er-geir-selvik-malthe-sorenssen Slik startet Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssens journalistkarriere: Mannen som i helgen ble avslørt for juks begynte å jobbe som journalist på 1980-tallet], ''Journalisten''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
===Treholt case===

In 2010, he published a book titled ''Forfalskningen'' ("The Fabrication") in which he alleged that the police had fabricated evidence when Arne Treholt was convicted of treason and espionage in 1985. The book was written on behalf of Treholt and Malthe-Sørenssen was paid by Treholt for his work. The book led to much controversy and to a new evaluation of the Treholt case by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. In a 2011 ruling, the commission found no evidence for Malthe-Sørenssen's claims and turned down Treholt's request to reopen his criminal case for the fourth time. The commission concluded that Malthe-Sørenssen's claims were based on fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Malthe-Sorenssen-og-Treholt-saken-8387065.html Malthe-Sørenssen og Treholt-saken]. [[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] 9. mars 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/06/09/nyheter/treholtsaken/innenriks/spionasje/gjenopptakelseskommisjonen/16859594/ Slakter Treholt-forfatteren: Gjenopptakelseskommisjonen hardt ut mot Treholtforfatter Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssen]. ''[[Dagbladet]]'' 9. juni 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/06/09/nyheter/treholt/selvik/16863876/ Treholt-forfatter langer ut mot kommisjonen: Geir Selvik fikk totalslakt av gjenopptakelseskommisjonen. Det tar han ikke tungt.] ''[[Dagbladet]]'' 9. juni 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Malthe-Sørenssen was revealed by the newspaper ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' to have fabricated evidence in his attempt to have Treholt's case reopened, and his alleged source was revealed to be a [[used car salesman]] convicted of murder and fraud, with no connection to the Treholt case, who was paid by Malthe-Sørenssen to impersonate an agent of the secret service.&lt;ref name="forfalskningen"&gt;[http://www.vg.no/spesial/2016/forfalskningen/ Treholt-bløffen], ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/krim/forfalskeren/a/23615940/ Forfalskeren], ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/treholt-saken/helen-saeter-om-treholt-bloeffen-ikke-overrasket/a/23616217/ Helen Sæter om Treholt-bløffen: - Ikke overrasket], ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-lurte-treholts-advokat-1.12801871 Lurte Treholts advokat], NRK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/krim/derfor-publiserer-vg-lydopptakene/a/23615927/ Derfor publiserer VG lydopptakene], ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/treholt-saken/han-lurte-paa-om-jeg-kjente-noen-som-kunne-manipulere-bilder-av-arne-treholt/a/23618606/ Bruktbilselgeren om Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssen: «Han lurte på om jeg kjente noen som kunne manipulere bilder av Arne Treholt»], ''[[Verdens Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cases===
After his fraud in the Treholt case was exposed, it came to light that he had engaged in similar fraud in a large number of other cases.

The '''Great Depression in the United Kingdom''', also known as the '''Great Slump''', was a period of national economic [[Recession|downturn]] in the 1930s, which had its origins in the global [[Great Depression]]. It was [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s largest and most profound [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the 20th century. [[The Great Depression]] originated in the [[United States]] in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] in the 1920s, so its effect appeared less severe.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Richardson, "The Economic Significance of the Depression in Britain," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1970) 4#4 pp. 3–19 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259833 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's  world trade fell by half (1929–33), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment.

Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Wales]]. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole.  Politically the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] dominated the era and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was seriously hurt.

== Background ==
{{main|Great Depression}}

The Great Depression of 1929–32 broke out at a time when the [[United Kingdom]] was still far from having recovered from the effects of the First World War. Economist [[Lee Ohanian]] showed that [[economic output]] fell by 25% between 1918 and 1921 and did not recover until the end of the Great Depression,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Harold L. and Lee E. Ohanian, "The Great U.K. Depression: a Puzzle and a Possible Resolution" in Kehoe, Prescott (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the United Kingdom suffered a twenty-year great depression beginning in 1918. Relative to the rest of the world, economic output declined mildly in the UK between 1929 and 1934.

Heavy industries which formed the bedrock of Britain's export trade (such as [[History of coal mining|coalmining]], [[shipbuilding]] and steel) were heavily concentrated in certain areas of Britain, such as [[northern England]], [[South Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Central Belt|central Scotland]], while the newer industries were heavily concentrated in southern and central England. British industrial output during the 1920s ran at about 80–100%, and exports at about 80% of their pre-war levels.&lt;ref name="Unemployment in Britain Between the Wars"&gt;Constantine, Stephen. (1980) ''Unemployment in Britain Between the Wars'', Longman, {{ISBN|0-582-35232-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Gold standard==
{{further|Gold standard}}

From about 1921, Britain had started a slow economic recovery from the war and the subsequent slump. But in April 1925, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Winston Churchill]], on advice from the [[Bank of England]], restored the [[Pound Sterling]] to the [[gold standard]] at its prewar [[exchange rate]] of $4.86 US dollars to one pound. This made the pound convertible to its value in gold, but at a level that made British exports more expensive on world markets. The price of gold was over-estimated by 10–14% leading to coal and steel as an export becoming less competitive. The economic recovery was immediately slowed. To offset the effects of the high [[exchange rate]], the export industries tried to cut costs by lowering workers' wages.

The industrial areas spent the rest of the 1920s in recession, and these industries received little investment or modernisation. Throughout the 1920s, unemployment stayed at a steady one million.

==Economic crisis and the Labour minority government==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|thumb|right|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]

In May 1929, a [[Second MacDonald ministry|minority Labour government]] headed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] came to office with [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] support. This was only the second time a Labour government had been in office (they had briefly been in office in 1924), and few of the government's members had any deep knowledge of economics or experience of running the economy. MacDonald's Labour Party was not radical in economic thinking, and was wedded to the orthodoxy of [[classical economics]] with its emphasis on maintaining a [[balanced budget]] at any cost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Skidelsky, ''Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929–33'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1929, the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash]] in New York heralded the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had not predicted the slump, said, "'There will be no serious direct consequences in London.  We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Twilight Years: The Paradox of Britain Between the Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQSfaaan1qUC&amp;pg=PT96 |year=2010|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9781101498347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doomsayers on the left such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J.A. Hobson, and G.D.H. Cole repeated the dire warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, ''Twilight  Years'', ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1935 the [[Left Book Club]] provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Samuels, "The Left Book Club", ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1966) 1#2 pp. 65–86 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259923 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing American economic collapse shook the world: World trade contracted, prices fell and governments faced financial crisis as the supply of American credit dried up. Many countries adopted an emergency response to the crisis by erecting trade barriers and tariffs, which worsened the crisis by further hindering global trade. The British Empire tried to hang together by lower tariffs among the members while raising them against the U.S. and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas A. Irwin|title=Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIDsnT3Ze0YC&amp;pg=PA178|year=2011|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=178|isbn=9781400838394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects on the industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for British products collapsed. By the end of 1930, [[unemployment]] had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (from 12% to 20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. During this time there were little to no unemployment benefits, so this mass unemployment lead to many of Britain’s population becoming impoverished.  Government revenues contracted as national income fell, while the cost of assisting the jobless rose. The industrial areas were hardest hit, along with the [[coal mining]] districts. London and the south-east of England were hurt less. In 1933, 30% of [[Glasgow|Glaswegians]] were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry.

Under pressure from its Liberal allies as well as the Conservative opposition, the Labour government appointed a committee to review the state of public finances.   The [[May Report]] of July 1931 urged public sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in benefit payments ("dole") to the unemployed) to avoid incurring a budget deficit.  The sense was that the deficit was dangerous and had to be reduced; the proposal was to meet £24 million by increased taxes on the rich, and £96 million by economies, of which £64 million would come from unemployment relief.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History'' (1965) p 288&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party and among its main supporters, the trade unions, which along with several government ministers refused to support any such measures. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Philip Snowden]], insisted that the Report's recommendations be adopted to avoid incurring a budget deficit.

In a memorandum in January 1930, one junior government minister, [[Oswald Mosley]], proposed that the government should take control of banking and exports, as well as increase pensions to boost purchasing power. When his ideas were turned down, he left Labour to form the [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]], and later the [[British Union of Fascists]].

==National Government==
{{Main|National Government (United Kingdom)}}
The dispute over spending and wage cuts split the Labour government: as it turned out, beyond recovery. The resulting political deadlock caused investors to take fright, and a flight of capital and gold further de-stabilised the economy. In response, MacDonald, on the urging of [[King George V]], decided to form a "National Government" with the Conservatives and the Liberals.

On 24 August, MacDonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led his senior colleagues in forming the new National Government. MacDonald and his supporters were expelled from the Labour Party and adopted the label "[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]". The Labour Party and some Liberals, led by [[David Lloyd George]], went into opposition. The Labour Party denounced MacDonald as a "traitor" and a "rat" for what they saw as his betrayal.

Soon after this, a general election was called. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] resulted in a Conservative landslide victory, with the now leaderless Labour Party winning only 46 seats in Parliament. After the 1931 election the national government became Conservative-dominated, although MacDonald continued as prime minister until 1935.

===Emergency measures===
In an effort to balance the budget and restore confidence in the pound, on 10 September 1931 with [[Philip Snowden]] still as Chancellor, the new national government issued an emergency budget, which immediately instituted a round of cuts in public spending and wages. Public sector wages and unemployment pay were cut by 10%, and [[income tax]] was raised from 4s 6d to 5s in the pound&lt;ref&gt;Taxes raised in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, passed into law in October. See copy of the bill in ''The Times'', 19 September 1931&lt;/ref&gt; (from 22.5% to 25%). The pay cuts did not go down well, however, and resulted [[Invergordon Mutiny|in a non-violent "mutiny"]] in the [[Royal Navy]] protesting pay cut.

These measures were [[deflation]]ary and merely reduced purchasing power in the economy, worsening the situation, and by the end of 1931 unemployment had reached nearly 3 million.&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"&gt;Constantine, Stephen (1983) ''Social Conditions in Britain 1918–1939'' {{ISBN|0-416-36010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures were also unsuccessful at defending the gold standard, which the National Government had ostensibly been created to defend.

The flight of gold continued, however, and the Treasury finally was forced to abandon the gold standard in September 1931.  Until now the government had religiously followed orthodox policies, which demanded balanced-budgets and the gold standard. Instead of the predicted disaster, cutting loose from gold proved a major advantage.  Immediately the exchange rate of the pound fell by 25%, from $4.86 for one pound to $3.40. British exports were now much more competitive, which laid the ground for a gradual economic recovery. The worst was over.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dewey, ''War and progress: Britain 1914–1945'' (1997) 224-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane B. Kunz, ''The battle for Britain's gold standard in 1931'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 1932 following the [[Ottawa Agreement]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], who had become Chancellor after the 1931 election, introduced tariffs on industrial and agricultural imports at a rate of 10% on all imports except those from the countries of the [[British Empire]]. The introduction of tariffs caused [[Liberal Party (UK)#The splits over the National Government|a split in the Liberal Party]], some of whom, along with Phillip Snowden, withdrew support for the National Government.

==During the recession==
Although the overall picture for the British economy in the 1930s was bleak, the effects of the depression were uneven. Some parts of the country, and some industries, fared better than others. Some parts of the country such as the [[South Wales Valleys]] experienced mass unemployment and poverty, while some areas in the [[Home Counties]] did not.

The brightest spot was in home building. From 1926 through 1939 over 200,000 new houses were built every year, with the peak reaching 365,000 in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Mitchell and Phyllis Deane, ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (1962) p 239&lt;/ref&gt;  Many suburban districts in London and other cities were built at this time, and Brighton shows many signs of more "high deco" home architecture.

===The South and the Midlands===
In London and the [[South East England|south east of England]] unemployment was initially as high as 13.5%,&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"/&gt; the later 1930s were a prosperous time in these areas, as a suburban house-building boom was fuelled by the low interest rates which followed the abolition of the gold standard, and as London's growing population buoyed the economy of the [[Home Counties]].

The south was also the home of new developing industries such as the electrical industry, which prospered from the large-scale electrification of housing and industry. [[Mass production]] methods brought new products such as electrical [[Kitchen stove|cooker]]s, washing machines and radios into the reach of the [[middle class]]es, and the industries which produced these prospered. Nearly half of all new factories that opened in Britain between 1932 and 1937 were in the [[Greater London]] area.&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"/&gt;

Another industry that prospered during the 1930s was the British [[motor industry]]. For cities that had a developed motor industry such as [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]] and [[Oxford]], the 1930s were also a boom time. Manufacturers such as [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]], [[Morris Motors|Morris]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] dominated the motor industry during the 1930s, and the number of cars on British roads doubled within the decade. British [[Agriculture]] also flourished in the 1930s.

===In the North and industrial heartlands===
[[Northern England]], however, was a quite different matter. The north was the home to most of Britain's traditional heavy  industries, such as [[coal mining]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Nottinghamshire]], shipbuilding on [[Tyneside]] and [[Wearside]], [[steel]] in [[Sheffield]] and textiles in [[Lancashire]] which were heavily export orientated. The north bore the brunt of the depression, and the '30s were the most difficult time in living memory for people in these areas. The north was hit so hard in the Great Depression because of the structural decline in British industry. Staple industries such as coal, steel and shipbuilding were smaller, less modern and efficient and over-staffed compared to continental rivals.

In the [[North East England|north east]] (including [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]) this was especially so. The north east was a major centre of the shipbuilding industry. The Depression caused a collapse in demand for ships. Between 1929 and 1932 ship production declined by 90%, and this in turn affected all the supply industries such as steel and coal. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70%. Among the worst affected towns was [[Jarrow]], where unemployment led to the famous [[Jarrow March]], in which unemployed workers marched {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to London to protest against unemployment.

The [[North West England|north west]], a centre of the textile industries, was also hard hit, with places such as [[Manchester]] and [[Lancashire]] suffering a slump. The [[South Wales Valleys]], a centre of the coalmining and steel industries, was also devastated by the depression where towns such as [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Swansea]] had unemployment rates reaching above 25% at certain times.&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"/&gt; The industrial belt of central Scotland, also a major shipbuilding centre in [[Glasgow]], was also hard hit by the slump.

In these areas, millions of unemployed and their families were left destitute, and queueing at [[soup kitchen]]s became a way of life. A government report in the mid-1930s estimated that around 25% of the UK's population existed on a [[subsistence]] diet, often with signs of child [[malnutrition]] such as [[scurvy]], [[rickets]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In his book ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', [[George Orwell]] described life for the unemployed in northern England during the depression: "Several hundred men risk their lives and several hundred women scrabble in the mud for hours... searching eagerly for tiny chips of [[coal]] in slagheaps so they could heat their own homes. For them, this arduously-gained 'free' coal was more important almost than food."

==Welfare state during the 1930s==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Britain had a relatively advanced welfare system compared to many of the industrialised countries. In 1911, a compulsory national unemployment and health insurance scheme had been put in place by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert Henry Asquith]] (see [[Liberal reforms]]). This scheme had been funded through contributions from the government, the employers and the workers. At first, the scheme only applied to certain trades but, in 1920, it was expanded to include most manual workers.&lt;ref name="Unemployment in Britain Between the Wars"/&gt;

However, the scheme only paid out according to the level of contributions made rather than according to need, and was only payable for 15 weeks. Anyone unemployed for longer than that had to rely on [[poor law]] relief paid by their local authority. In effect, millions of workers who had been too poorly paid to make contributions, or who had been unemployed long term, were left destitute by the scheme. With the mass unemployment of the 1930s, contributions to the insurance scheme dried up, resulting in a funding crisis.

In August 1931, the 1911 scheme was replaced by a fully government-funded [[unemployment benefit]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/publicpolicy/introduction/historyf.htm rgu.ac.uk]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QZWT5l8U?url=http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/publicpolicy/introduction/historyf.htm |date=24 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, for the first time, paid out according to need rather than the level of contributions. This unemployment benefit was subject to a strict [[means test]], and anyone applying for unemployment pay had to have an inspection by a government official to make sure that they had no hidden earnings or savings, undisclosed source(s) of income or other means of support. For many poor people, this was a humiliating experience and was much resented.

==Slow recovery==
Following Britain's withdrawal from the gold standard and the devaluation of the pound, interest rates were reduced from 6% to 2%. As a result, British exports became more competitive on world markets than those of countries that remained on the gold standard. This led to a modest economic recovery, and a fall in unemployment from 1933 onwards. Although exports were still a fraction of their pre-depression levels, they recovered slightly.

Unemployment began a modest fall in 1934 and fell further in 1935 and 1936, but the rise in employment levels occurred mostly in the south, where lower interest rates had spurred the house building boom, which in turn spurred a recovery in domestic industry. The North and Wales remained severely depressed for most of the decade. In severely depressed parts of the country, the government enacted a number of policies to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment, including road building, loans to shipyards, and tariffs on steel imports. These policies helped but were not, however, on a sufficiently large scale to make a huge impact on the unemployment levels.

==Rearmament and recovery==
Since Britain’s debt was 180% of the national GDP it was difficult to recover. The United Kingdom was able to recover more quickly than other countries that were equally as developed, because their economic growth had been stagnant for some time. This meant that they did not have exponential growth, as the United States did, leaving them with less room to fall. Due to the abandonment of the gold standard in 1931 Britain was able to cut interest rates which led to a drop in real interest rates. This drop in interests rates subsequently led to a boom in construction in the south of Britain; stimulating some renewed economic growth. Also, the government began spending money on goods and services within Britain which aided in the foundation of financial recovery. 
From 1936 onwards, the National Government followed a policy of mass rearmament in the face of the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].  By 1937 unemployment had fallen to 1.5 million, but rose again to 1,810,000 by January 1938 suggesting that the recovery was to be short lived.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=T|title=The UK economy in the 1930s|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/7483/economics/the-uk-economy-in-the-1930s/|website=Economics Helps|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of the Great Depression==
Following the end of the Second World War, the majority of the British people, and particularly the [[working class]] and returning servicemen and women, did not want a return to pre-war Conservative economic policies, which they blamed for the hardship of the 1930s, and there was a mood for widespread social change. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], to the surprise of many observers, [[Winston Churchill]] was defeated by the [[UK Labour Party|Labour Party]] headed by [[Clement Attlee]].

The Labour government built up from pre-war foundations what was to become a comprehensive 'cradle-to-grave' [[welfare state]], and established a tax funded [[National Health Service]], which gave treatment according to need rather than ability to pay as the previous tax funded system had been. The Labour government also enacted [[Keynesian]] economic policies, to create artificial economic demand leading to [[full employment]]. These policies became known as the "[[post-war consensus]]", and were accepted by all major political parties at different times.

There were noted disagreements about the involvement of the state with the steel industry. With one government, it was state owned, to then be sold off with the following conservative administration only to be then re-nationalised by the following labour government. For the most part, the post-war consensus lasted until the late 1970s. Throughout the 1970s, it was becoming clear from all sides that radical change was needed as a result of such economic crises as the [[1973 oil shock]], high inflation, industrial unrest and sterling devaluation. But 1970s governments lacked the necessary political will, leadership and the House of Commons majority from which to change the system until the Conservatives led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] won the 1979 general election.

==Historic evaluation==
The events of the 1930s, and the response of the Labour and National governments to the depression, have generated much historical controversy.

In the decades immediately following the Second World War, most historical opinion was critical of the governments of the period. Certain historians, such as [[Robert Skidelsky]] in his ''Politicians and the Slump'', compared the orthodox policies of the Labour and National governments unfavourably with the more radical proto-Keynesian measures advocated by [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Oswald Mosley]], and the more [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] and [[keynesianism|Keynesian]] responses in other economies: [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] in the United States, the  [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]] in New Zealand, and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic government]] in Sweden. Since the 1970s opinion has become less uniformly hostile. In the preface to the 1994 edition, Skidelsky argues that recent experience of currency crises and [[capital flight]] make it hard to be so critical of the politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting labour costs and defending the value of the currency.

'''Guru Nanak Gurpurab''', also known as '''Guru Nanak's Prakash Utsav''' and '''Guru Nanak Jayanti''', celebrates the birth of the first [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Nanak]].&lt;ref name="Purewal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purewal.biz/gnsbirthdateall.pdf|title=Birth Date of Guru Nanak Sahib|first=Pal|date=|publisher=Pal Singh Purewal|author=Singh Purewal|work=Purewal's Page|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the most sacred festivals in [[Sikhism]], or [[Sikhism|Sikhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guru Nanak Sahib|url=http://sgpc.net/gurus/gurunanak.asp|publisher=SGPC|accessdate=August 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730085918/http://sgpc.net/gurus/gurunanak.asp|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The festivities in the Sikh religion revolve around the anniversaries of the 10 Sikh Gurus. These Gurus were responsible for shaping the beliefs of the Sikhs. Their birthdays, known as ''[[Gurpurab]],'' are occasions for celebration and prayer among the Sikhs.

Guru Nanak, the founder of [[Sikhism]], was born on [[Vaisakhi]] Day, {{OldStyleDateDY|April 14,|1469|March 27, 1469}}&lt;ref name=Purewal/&gt; (Vaisakh 1, 1526 [[Bikrami_calendar|Bikrami]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh Purewal|first1=Pal|title=Vaisakhi Dates Range According To Indian Ephemeris By Swamikannu Pillai – i.e. English Date on 1 Vaisakh Bikrami|url=http://www.purewal.biz/PastVaisakhiDates.pdf|publisher=Pal Singh Purewal|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi in the present [[Shekhupura District]] of [[Pakistan]], now [[Nankana Sahib]].&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web|title=Guru Nanak Dev ji (1469–1539)|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/gurus/nanak1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Public holidays in India|Gazetted holiday]] in India.

According to the controversial [[Bhai Bala]] Janamsakhi, it claims Guru Nanak was born on the Full Moon ([[Purnima|Pooranmashi]]) of the Indian Lunar Month Katik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh Mehboob|first=Harinder|title=As the Sun of Suns Rose: The Darkness of the Creeds Was Dispelled|url={{Google books|_yKiDQAAQBAJ|keywords=katak|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs have been celebrating Guru Nanak's Gurpurab around November for this reason and has it been ingrained in Sikh Traditions.&lt;ref name="Purewal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purewal2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh Purewal|first1=Pal|title=Movable Dates of Gurpurbs|url=http://www.purewal.biz/gurpurbs_movable_dates.pdf|website=www.purewal.biz|publisher=www.purewal.biz|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some scholars and organizations believe the Birthday should be celebrated on [[Vaisakhi]], which falls on April 14 according to the original [[Nanakshahi_calendar|Nanakshahi Calendar]] passed by Sri Akal Takht in 2003. However, many people and organizations would like to keep the traditional date by celebrating on the [[Full moon day|Full Moon Day]] (Pooranmashi or [[Purnima]]) of the Lunar Month Kartik. The original [[Nanakshahi calendar|Nanakshahi Calendar]] follows the tradition and celebrates it on [[Kartik Purnima]] due to demands by various Sikh Saints. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People |url=https://www.sikhs.org/dates.htm |website=www.sikhs.org |publisher=sikhs.org |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The festival==
[[Image:Nankana Sahib.JPG|thumb|280px|left|Gurdwara [[Nankana Sahib]], [[Pakistan]], the birthplace of Guru Nanak]]

The celebration is generally similar for all Sikhs; only the hymns are different. The celebrations usually commence with Prabhat Pheris. Prabhat Pheris are early morning processions that begin at the Gurudwaras and proceed around the localities singing hymns. Generally, two days before the birthday, ''[[Akhand Path]]'' (a forty-eight-hour non-stop reading of the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', the holy book of the Sikhs) is held in the ''[[Gurdwaras]]''.

The day prior to the birthday, a procession, referred to as Nagarkirtan,&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite web|title=GURPURBS|url=http://www.sgpc.net/festivals/index.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601221718/http://www.sgpc.net/festivals/index.asp|archivedate=1 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is organised. This procession is led by the ''Panj Pyaras'' (Five Beloved Ones).&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhpoint.com/religion/sikhcommunity/gurpurab.htm|title=Gurpurab}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite web|title=Guru Nanak|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/sikhism/gurunanak.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; They head the procession carrying the Sikh flag, known as the ''[[Nishan Sahib]]'' and the ''Palki'' (Palanquin) of Guru Granth Sahib. They are followed by teams of singers singing hymns&lt;ref name=ref3/&gt; and devotees sing the chorus. There are brass bands playing different tunes and 'Gatka' teams display their swordsmanship through various martial arts and as mock battles using traditional weapons.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt; The procession pours into the streets of the town. The passage is covered with banners and gates decorated flags and flowers, for this special occasion.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt; The leaders spreading the message of Guru Nanak.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt;
[[File:Palki.jpg|thumb|upright|Guru Nanak Jayanti 2010 at [[Pune]], Maharashtra, India]]

On the day of the Gurpurab, the celebrations commence early in the morning at about 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt; This time of the day is referred to as ''[[Amrit Vela]]''. The day begins with the singing of ''Asaa-Ki-Vaar'' (morning hymns).&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt; This is followed by any combination of ''Katha''&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt; (exposition of the scripture) and ''Kirtan'' (hymns from the Sikh scriptures), in the praise of the Guru.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt; Following that is the ''Langar'', a special community lunch, which is arranged at the ''Gurudwaras'' by volunteers. The idea behind the free communal lunch is that everyone, irrespective of caste, class or creed,&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite web|title=Guru Purab|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/gurupurab/}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be offered food in the spirit of ''seva'' (service) and ''bhakti'' (devotion). 

Night Prayer sessions are also held in some Gurudwaras, which begin around sunset when Rehras(evening prayer) is recited, followed by Kirtan till late at night.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt; The congregation starts singing Gurbani at about 1:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., which is the actual time of birth of Guru Nanak. The celebrations culminate at around 2&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=ref5/&gt;

Guru Nanak Gurpurab is celebrated by the Sikh community all over the world and is one of the most important festivals in the Sikh calendar. The celebrations are especially colorful in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Haryana, and [[Chandigarh]] and many more locations. Even some Sindhis celebrate this festival.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

"'''Ironic'''" is a song by Canadian-American singer [[Alanis Morissette]]. It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third [[studio album]], ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' (1995). It was written by Morissette and [[Glen Ballard]], and was produced by him. "Ironic" is a song written in the key of [[B major]], and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. The lyrics present several situations that are described as "ironic"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of ''[[irony]]''. However, some have argued that it does match what is known as [[Irony#Situational irony|situational irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/08/what_everybody_gets_wrong_about_alanis_morissettes_ironic_partner/|title=What everybody gets wrong about Alanis Morissette's "Ironic"|last=Roberts|first=Michael Reid|website=Salon|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track topped the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']] Top Singles chart for six weeks, and reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and currently is her highest-charting single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "Ironic" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]], and received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations in [[39th Grammy Awards|1997]], for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]. French director [[Stéphane Sednaoui]] filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays [[Dual role|multiple roles]] as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards|1996]], winning three of them. The music video was listed on VH1's "Greatest Music Videos" list and was parodied by DBA Flip, Allison Rheaume and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].

In 2004, Morissette changed the lyrics of "Ironic" to denote her support for [[same-sex marriage]] at the [[15th GLAAD Media Awards|fifteenth]] [[GLAAD Media Awards]]. This version was included on her albums ''[[iTunes Originals – Alanis Morissette|iTunes Originals]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jagged Little Pill Acoustic]]'' (2005), and was performed at the [[House of Blues]] in 2005, along with Canadian singer [[Avril Lavigne]]. "Ironic" was included on the [[set list]] of her Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995), and her compilation albums [[MTV Unplugged (Alanis Morissette album)|''MTV Unplugged'']] (1999), [[Alanis Morissette: The Collection|''The Collection'']] (2005), among others. The song was covered by Mexican [[duet]] [[Jesse &amp; Joy]] for their album ''[[Esta Es Mi Vida|Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones]]'' (2007), and by American band [[Four Year Strong]] for their [[cover album]] ''[[Explains It All]]'' (2009).

"Ironic" was written by [[Alanis Morissette]] and [[Glen Ballard]], and produced by the former for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; In an interview with Christopher Walsh of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how "Ironic" was written. He commented: "I'm telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it—just writing. 'Ironic' was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought 'I don't know what this is—what genre it is—who knows? It's just good{{'}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |page=38 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=June 30, 2001 |issn=0006-2510 |work=Billboard |title=Boutique Distributors Make Noise Under The Radar|volume=113 |issue=26 |first=Christopher |last=Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is a song set in the [[time signature]] of common time, composed in a moderate [[tempo]] of eighty-two beats per minute.&lt;ref name="sheet"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ironic – Alanis Morissette Digital Sheet Music (Digital Download)|publisher=[[Universal Music Publishing Group|Universal Music Publishing Ltd]]. Musicnotes Inc |url= http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0072613}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the key of [[B major]] with Morissette's vocal range from the tone of [[E (musical note)|E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] to [[C (musical note)|B{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], and "Ironic" [[chord progression]] starts with the sequence of Emaj7–F♯6–Emaj7–F♯6, before changing to F♯–Badd9–F♯–G♯m7 in the [[Refrain|chorus]].&lt;ref name="sheet"/&gt;

===Linguistic usage disputes===
The song's usage of the word "[[Irony|ironic]]" attracted media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of ''[[The New York Times]]'', the song gives a distinct "unironic" sense in its implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Simpsons in the classroom: embiggening the learning experience with the wisdom of Springfield |first1=Karma |last1=Waltonen|first2=Denise |last2=Du Vernay|location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company Inc.

Earlier version first published in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]''|origyear=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, lyrics such as "It's like [[rain]] on your [[wedding]] day" and "A [[traffic jam]] when you're already late" are not ironic.&lt;ref name="SGP"/&gt; Morissette commented about the writing of the song: "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that every once in a while I'd be the [[malapropism]] queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic".&lt;ref name="SGP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life |first=Roger|last=Horberry|location=London, England |publisher=A &amp; C Black Publishers Ldt|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4081-2231-0|oclc=659730168|page=136|edition=XVII|quote=A common misconception is that 'ironic' is a direct synonym for coincidental. The lyrics of Alanis Morissette's UK top 11 (and US top five) hit ''Ironic'' describe a number of apparently ironic situations, each verse ending with the refrain 'Isn't it ironic?' To which the answer must be a polite but firm 'no', as the lyrics are in fact a succinct explanation of what irony ''isn't''. How ironic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts wrote for [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] a defense of the song's use of the term "ironic", as he states that the song cites [[situational irony|situational ironies]],&lt;ref name=robertssalon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/08/what_everybody_gets_wrong_about_alanis_morissettes_ironic_partner/|title=What everybody gets wrong about Alanis Morissette's "Ironic"|first=Michael Reid|last=Roberts|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]. Salon Media Group|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "state of affairs or event[s] that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [[:wikt:wryly|wryly]] amusing as a result",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/irony|title=irony|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be "ironic".&lt;ref name=robertssalon/&gt; [[Michael Stevens (educator)|Michael Stevens]] of the YouTube channel [[Vsauce]] devoted time to the discussion of irony in the 2014 episode "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers the difference between the typically cited "situational" irony, versus "dramatic" irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are: the situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Michael Stevens |date=12 August 2014 |title=Dord |work=[[Vsauce]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0YoRMXIY0 |access-date=28 July 2015 |format=video |publisher=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] performed a skit in which he jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: "The only ironic thing about that song is it's called 'Ironic' and it's written by a woman who doesn't know what irony is.

===Critical response===
Jaime Gill from [[Yahoo! Music|Dot Music]] commented on the original version of "Ironic", on his review of ''[[Jagged Little Pill Acoustic]]'' (2005), that "[''Jagged Little Pill''] gave us pop's greatest parlour game, with spot the genuine irony in 'Ironic'" and calling the song "pretty" and "catchy". But he later criticized the lyrics, calling the song "idiotic", and giving a positive review to the acoustic version saying: "it actually sounds more relaxed and engaging without the hoary loud guitars of the original".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/050803/33/1y9vj.html |title=Alanis Morissette – Jagged Little Pill Acoustic |date=August 2, 2005 |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |publisher=Yahoo!

===Music video===

The [[music video]] for "Ironic" was directed by [[Stéphane Sednaoui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1152259-work_of_director_stephane_sednaoui/ |title=The Work of Director Stéphane Sednaoui (2005)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes.

Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile (1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V) with a cup of coffee in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's [[Verse (popular music)#Verse|first verse]]. When it comes to the [[Refrain|chorus]], a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the [[Conclusion (music)|outro]], she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be "ironic" in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her "passengers" have disappeared.

Blaine Allan noted in the book ''Television: Critical Methods and Applications'' (2002) how Morissette interacts with the watcher. He commented that unlike [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]" music video, where Spears plays dual role of a girl named "Lucky" and her fan, and both appear together in some scenes helped by [[visual effects]], "Ironic" does not utilize them, using solely [[film editing|editing]], giving the sense that all the Morissettes interact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications|first=Blaine |last=Allan |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]]|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|page=310|isbn=0-8058-5415-0|oclc=71005849|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Carol Vernallis also found that Morissette's "[[wiktionary:chit-chat|chitchat]]" way of singing the song creates an intimate connection viewer. She mentioned the video in her book ''Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context'' (2004), where she studied how the audience may pay attention to the lyrics of the song in a music video. Vernallis added that "Ironic" music video functions as a limited example of how the meaning of a song's lyrics become "inaccessible" when they are videotaped and televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context |first=Carol |last=Vernallis |location=New York City, New York |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|issn=1752-1963|oclc=4669115003|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20th World Scout Jamboree closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Closing ceremony of the [[20th World Scout Jamboree]], held in [[Thailand]] in 2002/2003]]
In [[Scouting]], a '''jamboree''' is a large gathering of Scouts who rally at a national or international level.

The [[1st World Scout Jamboree]] was held in 1920, and was hosted by the United Kingdom. Since then, there have been twenty three [[World Scout Jamboree]]s, hosted in various countries, generally every four years. The 24th World Jamboree is to be held in North America in 2019.

There are also national and continental jamborees held around the world with varying frequency. Many of these events will invite and attract Scouts from overseas.

{{Quote|The average Scout Life of a boy is a comparatively short one, and it is good for each generation of Scouts to see at least one big rally, since it enables the boy to realize his membership of a really great brotherhood, and at the same time brings him into personal acquaintance with brother Scouts of other districts and other countries.}} [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], September 1932

With the birth of the Jamboree concept, other large gatherings are also organized by national Scout organizations, geared towards a particular group of Scouts. Examples of these large gatherings include: 
*[[World Scout Moot|Moot]] - a camp or a gathering of Rovers
*[[Australian Venture|Venture]] - a gathering of young people in the Venture (Senior Scout) section
*[[World Scout Indaba|Indaba]] - a camp or a gathering of Adult Scout leaders
*[[Agoonoree]] - a camp of Scouts with special needs
*[[COMDECA]] - acronym for Community Development Camp, a large gathering of young people, implementing community development projects{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Etymology==
The origin of the word "Jamboree" is not well understood. This is reflected in many dictionary entries. For example, according to the ''[[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]]'', the etymology is "19th century, origin unknown". The [[OED|Oxford English Dictionary (OED)]] identifies it as coming from American slang, identifying a use in the New York Herald in 1868 and in Irish writings later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100700?redirectedFrom=jamboree jamboree, n.] OED Online. September 2013. [[Oxford University Press]]. Accessed October 07, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a half century, the meaning outside the Scouting program was becoming lost. For example,
[[Robert Graves]] in ''The Crowning Privilege: The Clark Lectures, 1954–1955'' suggests Baden-Powell might have known the word through his regiment's Irish links rather than from the US slang. Poet [[Robert W. Service]] used the term well before the first Scouting jamboree. It appears in the poem "Athabaska Dick" in his ''Rhymes of a Rolling Stone'', which was published in 1912. By then, the word was becoming to mean a rowdy, boisterous gathering.

[[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] was once asked why he chose "jamboree". He replied, "What else would you call it?" His response made sense if the word had already had a specific meaning other than a boisterous gathering.{{cn|date=October 2017}} It is popularly believed within the Scout Movement that the word was coined by Baden-Powell but it was never formally documented by either. 

The word "Jamboree" today has several claimed possible origins, ranging from Hindi to Swahili to Native American dialects, which further confuses the meaning used by Baden-Powell.&lt;ref name="Ashton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashton, E. O. |title=Swahili Grammar: Including intonation |publisher=Longman House |year=1947 |isbn=0-582-62701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nurse, Derek, and Hinnebusch, Thomas J. Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history. 1993. Series: University of California Publications in Linguistics, v. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most logical use is that the name "Jamboree" is derived from the Swahili for hello, ''[[Jambo!]]'', as a result of the considerable amount of time he spent in the South African region in the 1880s then again in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name="Begbie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Begbie |first=Harold |authorlink=Edward Harold Begbie |title=The story of Baden-Powell: The Wolf that never Sleeps |location=London |publisher=Grant Richards |date=1900 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;{{cite book |author=Prins, A. H. J.|title="Swahili The Swahili-Speaking Peoples of Zanzibar and the East African Coast (Arabs, Shirazi and Swahili)" Ethnographic Survey of Africa, edited by Daryll Forde  |publisher= International African Institute, London|year=1961 |isbn= }} See also: Prins, A.H.J. 1970. A Swahili Nautical Dictionary. Preliminary Studies in Swahili Lexicon – 1. Dar es Salaam.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Jamboree''' is used in English, as a borrowed foreign word, with the ending '''-ree'''. The word Jamboree is a [[transitive verb]] with a direct action of the primary word Jambo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopper|first1=Paul J|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra A|title=Transitivity in grammar and discourse|journal=Language|date=June 1980|volume=56|issue=2|pages=251–299|url=http://latina.phil2.uni-freiburg.de/raible/Lehre/2006/Materialien/Hopper_Thompson.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016|doi=10.1353/lan.1980.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an attendee of a Jambo is a Jamboree. The word "Jamboree" is used primarily by the [[Scouting]] program before the first Boy Scout ''Jamboree'' in 1920. The word has also come to mean "a lavish or boisterous celebration or party" outside of the Scouting program.&lt;ref&gt;Jamboree. Oxford University Press from the Concise Oxford University Dictionary 10th Edition, 1999. (accessed: November 02, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jamboree. Dictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. HarperCollins Publishers. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jamboree (accessed: November 02, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a transitive word is "transferee" which the person receiving a transfer (money or goods) is the transfer-ree dropping the extra r. In contrast the person giving the transfer is the "transferor." Such transitive words are still used in formal terms dealing in legal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/T/Transferee.aspx Duhaime's Law Dictionary]: Transferee Definition: A person who receives property being transferred.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baden-Powell deliberately chose the name "Jamboree" where attendees were warmly welcomed attending this first Boy Scout rally or meeting with the word "Jambo!" Many, at this first "Jamboree" or "Scout gathering" did not fully capture the spirit of this then-new concept or greeting. At the first "World Jamboree" at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in 1920, Lord Baden-Powell said "People give different meanings for this word, but from this year on, ''jamboree'' will take a specific meaning. It will be associated to the largest gathering of youth that ever took place."&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave, Lady Baden-Powell]], coined the term ''jamborese'' to refer to the ''lingua franca'' used between Scouts of different languages and cultural habits, that develops when diverse Scouts meet, that fosters friendship and understanding between Scouts of the world. Sometimes the word '''jamborette''' is used to denote smaller, either local or international, gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly used word "[[Camporee]]" in the Scouting program is also reflective of the older English style of use. "Camporee" today reflects a local or regional gathering of [[Scouting]] units for a period of camping and common activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usscouts.org/usscouts/camporees.asp U.S. Scouting Service Project, Camporee]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to a camporee, a [[jamboree (Scouting)|jamboree]] occurs less often and draws units from the entire nation or world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jambo.org/ U.S. Scouting Service Project, US Jamboree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://summit.scouting.org/en/Pages/default.aspx BSA The Summit, US Jamboree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scouting.org/worldjamboree.aspx Scouting.org World Jamboree]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laboratory Cabin Modules''' (LCM)s are a major element of the [[Chinese space station]], based on [[Tiangong-2]], as the final stage of [[Project 921]] [[Tiangong]], part of the [[Chinese space program]]. While China's small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space for scientific research, the LCMs offer a long term environment combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that far exceed the capabilities of [[Shenzhou spacecraft]]. Operations will be controlled from the [[Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Purpose==

The first laboratory module will provide additional navigation avionics, propulsion and [[Yaw, pitch and roll#Aircraft attitudes|orientation]] control as backup functions for the [[Core Cabin Module]] (CCM). Both LCMs provide a pressurized environment for researchers to conduct science experiments in freefall or zero gravity which could not be conducted on Earth for more than a few minutes. Experiments can also be placed on the outside of the modules, for exposure to the [[space environment]], [[cosmic rays]], vacuum, and [[solar wind]]s.

The axial port of the LCMs will be fitted with rendezvous equipment and will first dock to the axial port of the CCM. A mechanical arm similar to the Russian [[Lyappa arm]] used on the [[Mir]] space station will then move the module to a radial port of the CCM.

[[Electrical power]] is provided by two steerable [[solar power]] arrays, which use [[photovoltaic]] cells to convert sunlight into electricity. Energy is stored to power the station when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Resupply ships will replenish fuel for LCM 1 for station-keeping, to counter the effects of atmospheric drag.

==Dimensions==

The length of each module is 14.4m. They are cylindrical with a maximum diameter of 4.2m and an on orbit mass between 20 and 22 thousand kilograms apiece.

==Launch==
Both modules are due for launch after 2020, on [[Long March 5]] from [[Wenchang Satellite Launch Center]], into [[low Earth orbit]] 340 to 450 kilometers above the Earth at an [[orbital inclination]] of 42 to 43 degrees, in the centre of the Earth's [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name=LCM&gt;

[[File:William Davenant.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Davenant]] had Lisle's Tennis Court converted into a [[theatre]] in 1661.  His troupe continued to perform there after his death in 1668, until 1671.]]

'''Lisle's Tennis Court''' was a building off Portugal Street in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in [[London]].  Originally built as a [[real tennis]] court, it was used as a [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] during two periods, 1661&amp;ndash;1674 and 1695&amp;ndash;1705. During the early period, the theatre was called '''Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse''', also known as '''The Duke's Playhouse''', '''The New Theatre''' or '''The Opera'''.  The building was demolished and replaced by a purpose-built theatre for a third period, 1714&amp;ndash;1728.  The tennis court theatre was the first public playhouse in London to feature the moveable [[scenery]] that would become a standard feature of [[Restoration theatre]]s.

==Historical Background==
The period beginning in England in 1642 and lasting until 1660 is known as the Interregnum, meaning "between kings."  At this time, there was no monarch on the throne, and theatre was against the law.  Spanning from 1642 to 1649, the English Civil War occurred.  This war was an uprising against the current King of England, King Charles I, led by Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan.  Cromwell's opposition to the throne was religious but political, as well, which led him to build up an army with the ability to imprison King Charles, who was beheaded in 1649, ending the war.  After his death, the King's wife and children were given permission to leave the country, so they travelled to France to escape and receive protection.  

The years following became known as the Commonwealth Era (1649-1660) because Cromwell, who established himself as the monarch figure without assuming any official authority, ruled the nation with Parliament support and renamed the England Republic to the English Commonwealth.  These were tough times for England as Cromwell persecuted many families, especially those who fought on the behalf of King Charles I and Irish families that held rustic Catholic beliefs.  Needless to say, Oliver Cromwell quickly fell out of the majority's favour, and he died in 1658 of natural causes.  Two years later, Charles II, the beheaded king's son, returned to England and began the Restoration by restoring the throne and claiming his role as the proper King of England.  

In addition, King Charles II's return restored the legality of theatre.  This history is significant because it explains that since Charles II spent most of his life in France, he, as King, appreciated French culture, which prominently impressed upon England during the Restoration, particularly Restoration theatre.

== Structure==
There are no extant photos, elaborate diagrams, paintings, or other forms of visual evidence of the inside of the Lincoln's Inn theatre, but certain aspects are understood of the theatre according to its time period.  However, a great example of the layout of the inside is the Theatre Royal in Richmond, England, which contains components of Restoration theatre spaces and still stands today.  Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse was very small.  In fact, Milhous believes that "the smaller seating capacity… hurt the [Duke’s] company in the long run" as they moved as newer theatres came along (Milhous 71).  It was around 75 feet long by 30 feet wide with about a 650-person audience seating maximum capacity (The Restoration Theater; Wilson and Goldfarb 249).  It was originally an indoor tennis court; courts were used as theatre spaces because they had a similar structure with a narrow, rectangular shape and gallery seating.  The stage was raked, sloping upward toward the back of the stage, in order to help with perspective.  The audience was divided into the pit, boxes, and galleries.  The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines.  Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre.  Boxes sat upper class aristocrats—mostly married couples with wives who wanted to be seen.  Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance.  

The English stage, unlike French or Italian theatres, had a very deep apron to provide adequate acting space, and the background and perspective scenery served as solely as scenery.  The Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse orchestra was housed beneath the stage, and the apron was extended two feet to cover completely the orchestra pit and obtain close proximity between the actors and the audience, creating an intimate atmosphere.  Another uniqueness of English theatres is that there were typically two pairs of doors, one on each side of the stage, called proscenium doors with balconies above them for the actors to utilize in performances.  Proscenium doors served as entrances and exits disregarding the possibility of multiple locations.  Candelabras provided light for the space, and manual moveable scenery was used to move the show along (The Restoration Theater).

==The Duke's Company ==
The building was constructed as a  real tennis court in 1656. Thomas Lisle's wife Anne Tyler and a man named James Hooker developed the indoor court in the winter of 1656 and 1657.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll. Portions [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O79:LincolnsInnFieldsTheatre/Lincolns+Inn+Fields+Theatre+.html?refid=ency_botnm available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tudor Style architecture|Tudor-style]] real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions &amp;mdash; about 75 by 30&amp;nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]] &amp;mdash; are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.&lt;ref&gt;Styan p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse received its first company through the efforts of the King himself and two men who dedicated themselves to theatre.  Sir William Davenant had received a patent from Charles the I in 1639 when he was in power, but he had never used it due to the theatre ban.  When theatre was restored, Davenant and a man named Thomas Killigrew wanted to create theatre in England and thus, Killigrew obtained a warrant expressing that he could "raise a company and a theatre, provided that his company and Davenant’s should be the only ones allowed to play in London" (Hotson 199).  Davenant, then, drafted their joint warrant and after much debate over whether or not their role in theatre infringed on the Master of the Revels’ power, they appealed to Charles II.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] determined their [[Letters of Patent]] were valid and created two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in London: the [[Duke's Company]] of his brother, The Duke of York, led by [[William Davenant]], and his company, the [[King's Company]], led by [[Thomas Killigrew]].  Original intentions were positive, but competition was quickly apparent between the two.  Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] and [[English Civil War|civil war]] (including the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] and [[Salisbury Court Theatre|Salisbury Court]]), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Taking a hint from their new King's taste, Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in [[France]]: converting tennis courts into theatres.

In March 1660, Sir William Davenant contracted to lease Lisle's Tennis Court in order to renovate it into a theatre, and he bought adjoining land to expand the building into the garden area. Killigrew's theatre on Vere Street ([[Gibbon's Tennis Court]]) opened first, in November 1660. Davenant apparently spent more time in his remodelling: Lincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first "moveable" or "changeable" [[theatrical scenery|scenery]] used on the British public stage, and the first [[proscenium arch]].  [[Stage (theatre)#Proscenium stage|Wings]] or shutters ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'' where the soon-to-be famous actor, Thomas Betterton, performed the prologue.&lt;ref&gt;Pepys first records attending "the Opera" on its fourth day of opening, to watch the second half of ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'', attended by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his great aunt, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]]: [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/02/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Tuesday 2 July 1661.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This production at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse "emptied Killigrew’s theatre" according to Milhous (19).  Milhous also explains that the companies and other theatres "deliberately engaged in vicious head-on collision[s], mounting the same plays" (19). The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as diarist and devoted playgoer [[Samuel Pepys]] notes on 4 July:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw ''Claracilla'' (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun&amp;mdash;and so will continue for a while I believe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/04/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Thursday 4 July 1661.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Siege of Rhodes'' "continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause" according to the prompter [[John Downes (17th-century prompter)|John Downes]] in his "historical review of the stage" ''[[Roscius Anglicanus]]'' (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time.  More acclaimed productions by the Duke's Company "with scenes" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''), all highly admired by Pepys.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous p. 19; Pepys records seeing Davenant's ''[[The Wits]]'', on Thursday 15 August 1661,[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/15/index.php] and on two other occasions in the next 8 days [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/17/index.php][http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/23/index.php]; ''[[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]'' on Saturday 24 August 1661;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/24/index.php]; ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' on Wednesday 11 September 1661 [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/11/index.php]; and Davenant's ''[[Love and Honour (play)|Love and Honour]]'' three times in 4 days in October [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/21/index.php][http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/23/index.php][http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/25/index.php]; ''[[The Bondman]]'' by [[Philip Massinger]] twice in November,[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/04/index.php][http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/25/index.php], ''The Siege of Rhodes''[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/15/index.php] and ''Hamlet''[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/12/05/index.php] one further time each, and finishing the year with ''[[Cutter of Coleman Street]]'' by [[Abraham Cowley]] on Monday 16 December 1661, having passed his first negative review, of ''[[The Mad Lover]]'', on Monday 2 December 1661 [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/12/02/index.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
The King's Company was forced to abandon their own, technically unsophisticated tennis-court theatre and commission the construction of a new theatre in Bridges Street, where the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1663.

Prince [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III of Tuscany]] visited the Lisle theatre in 1669, and his official diarist left us this account:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The pit] is surrounded within by separate compartments in which there are several degrees [steps] of seating for the greater comfort of the ladies and gentlemen who, according to the liberal custom of the country, share the same boxes. Down below [in the pit] there remains a broad space for other members of the audience. The scenery is entirely changeable, with various transformations and lovely perspectives. Before the play begins, to render the waiting less annoying and inconvenient, there are very graceful instrumental pieces to be heard, with the result that many go early just to enjoy this part of the entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Langhans p. 16. It was once believed that Cosimo III attended the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]] in Bridges Street, not the theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|right|[[Thomas Betterton]] painted by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]].]]

The theatre was implicated by the Grand Jury of Middlesex on 7 July 1703 for showcasing "profane, irrelevant, lewd, indecent, and immoral expressions". It was also a hot target for riots and disorderly assemblies, murders, and other misdemeanors, but despite its troubles, the theatre remained very popular including hosting the first paid performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1700 and Handel's final two operas (Pedicord 41).

Davenant died in 1668 and the Duke's Company, now under [[Thomas Betterton]], performed out of Lincoln's Inns Fields until 1671, when they relocated to the elaborate new [[Dorset Garden Theatre]] which was more popular at the time. In 1672, the theatre in Bridges Street burnt down, and the King's Company temporarily occupied the recently vacated Lincoln's Inn Field, until their new theatre opened in 1674.

== Betterton and Rich ==

The building was converted back to a tennis court and remained one for almost 20 years. During that time, the Duke's Company, occupying the Dorset Theatre, subsumed the King's Company, housed in the newly rebuilt Theatre Royal, to form the [[United Company]], performing out of [[Drury Lane]]. Betterton, a famous English actor, was forced out as the head of the company in 1688, staying on as an actor (and filling a day-to-day managerial role) while a succession of leaders embezzled funds and cut costs by cutting actors' salaries. This uniting created many conflicts between the members of the companies. For example, each company would have one actor who would always play Hamlet, but when the companies are combined, who claims the role?  Due to rivalry and competition within the United Company, Thomas Betterton petitioned to the king to separate and create his own company.   So, under [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]], the United Company split. Betterton left with a band of actors and a newly issued license to perform, and from 1695 to 1705 his company performed back at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, refurbishing the abandoned building back into a theatre.  The New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields opened in April 1695 with [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[Love for Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later the first venue for Congreve's plays ''[[The Mourning Bride]]'' (1697) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700).
 
The building went unused as a theatre from 1705 until it was demolished in 1714 or shortly before, in preparation to build a new theatre. The man behind the new construction was none other than Christopher Rich, who after 16 years of management, had been pushed out of Drury lane. Rich died in 1714, but his son [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] led a company at the theatre until 1728.  On 29 January 1728, Rich's theatre hosted the first, very successful, production of [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (making "Rich gay and Gay rich").  The theatre was finally abandoned in December 1732, when the company moved to the new [[Covent Garden Theatre]], built by Rich using the capital generated by ''The Beggar's Opera''.[http://instruct.uwo.ca/english/234e/site/bckgrnds/maps/lndnmprstrtnthtrs.html]

The old building was used as a barracks, an auction room, a warehouse for china, and was finally demolished in 1848 to make room for an extension to the neighbouring premises of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901050747/http://world-theatres.com/London%20Theatres.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122556/http://www.coventgarden.uk.com/portugal.html]&lt;!--latter has an image--&gt;

The '''murder of Vera Page''' is a British unsolved [[child murder]] case from the early 1930s. On 16 December, 1931, 10-year-old Vera Page's body was found in undergrowth on Addison Road in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]]. It was believed she had been murdered elsewhere and then transported to this location. Percy Orlando Rush was questioned about the murder but police were unable to discover enough evidence to charge him.

==Murder==
Vera Isobel Minnie Page was born on 13 April 1921 in [[Hammersmith]], [[London]], the only child born to Charles and Isabel Page.&lt;ref&gt;''Unsolved London Murders: The 1920s and 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-63075-1}} p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, 1931, Page left her home on Blenheim Crescent, [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] at 4:30 p.m. to walk the 50 yards to where her aunt lived. When she had not returned home by 5:30 p.m., her father paid a visit to her aunt, who said she had left at around 4:45 p.m. A friend had seen Page outside a chemist's. Page's father then reported she was missing.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, her body was found in the bushes by a house at Addison Road, [[Kensington]], close to [[Holland Park]], about a mile from her home; she had been raped and strangled.

The police thought she had been murdered elsewhere and later dragged into the undergrowth alongside the road. Her remains were examined by Sir [[Bernard Spilsbury]], who discovered coal dust and candle wax on the girl's body, as well as a piece of [[ammonia]]-stained [[finger cot|finger bandage]] lodged against her inner elbow, which had likely dislodged from the hand of her murderer as he deposited her body.&lt;ref&gt;''Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases'' {{ISBN|978-0-856-17216-8}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This coal dust, plus the candle wax discovered upon Page's clothing, led Spilsbury to the conclusion that the girl's body had been hidden in a coal cellar prior to her disposal at Addison Road, and that this cellar most likely had no electric light, as evidenced by the presence of candle wax also found upon the victim's clothing. One coal cellar close to Addison Road was found with its door ajar, and investigators theorised the girl's body had been hidden in this cellar after her murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vera Page Crime: Police Investigations Extended |date=22 December 1931 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19311222&amp;id=659AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3219,7042664&amp;hl=en |accessdate=1 December 2018|publisher=The Glasgow Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Over a thousand people were questioned about the murder of Vera Page, with one individual stating that during the very early morning of 15 December, she had seen a man fitting the description of one Percy Orlando Rush pushing a wheelbarrow covered with a red table-cloth in the direction of Addison Road.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Rush quickly became the [[suspect|prime suspect]].&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He was a forty-year-old married man, who worked as a flannel washer in a nearby launderette, and in this occupation he had regularly come into physical contact with ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Murdered: Demonstration Against Suspect |date=12 February 1932 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19320212&amp;id=631VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tpYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5154,3133445&amp;hl=en |accessdate=1 December 2018|publisher=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Rush had injured a finger on his left hand in his workplace less than a week prior to Page's murder, and freely admitted to having worn a finger bandage since this date.&lt;ref&gt;''Written in Blood: a History of Forensic Detection'' {{ISBN|1-85336-055-4}} p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; Unremarked upon at the February, 1932 inquest into Page's murder was the fact that Rush had been previously found guilty of [[exhibitionism|exposing himself]] to girls.&lt;ref&gt;''Unsolved London Murders: The 1920s and 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-63075-1}} p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush was never charged with the murder of Vera Page. No eyewitness accounts could place him with Page on the day of her death, and no chemist could recall having sold bandages to Rush. Though his movements were never verified, Rush claimed that on 14 December he had finished work and immediately travelled to [[Kensington]]. He died in 1961.

The '''''Opéra Nouvel''''' ('''Nouvel Opera House''') in [[Lyon]], [[France]] is the home of the [[Opéra National de Lyon]]. The original [[opera house]] was re-designed by the distinguished French architect, [[Jean Nouvel]] between 1985 and 1993 in association with the agency of scenography [[Ducks scéno|dUCKS scéno]] and the acoustician Peutz. Serge Dorny was appointed general director in 2003.

==History==
[[File:Lyon - Grand Théâtre.jpg|thumb|The old opera house at the beginning of the 20th century]]

In 1756, one of the first opera houses created inside an existing freestanding building was opened in Lyon. It was designed by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]], the architect of the [[Panthéon]] in Paris. By early in the following century it was found to be too small, and [[Antoine-Marie Chenavard]] and [[Jean-Marie Pollet]] erected the new Lyon theatre which opened on July 1, 1831. It was considered rather undistinguished, but served its purpose.

It was not until 1985 that the City decided to once again re-build the opera house, but this time it was to be within the shell of the existing 1831 building. One of France's most distinguished architects was commissioned to create the house.

The style of the house is essentially Italian with a horseshoe-shaped auditorium and tiers of boxes. 

Leaving only the existing foyer and the exterior façade, Nouvel tripled the space within the house by excavating below ground to create rehearsal space and, most strikingly, by doubling the height of the building by creating a steel and glass barrel vault which hid the [[Fly system|fly tower]] as well as providing space for the ballet company. It has been noted that this achievement was "an architectural tour de force, in which the past has been successfully wedded to the future..",&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert, Thierry, ''Opera Houses of the World'', The Vendome Press, New York, 1995 {{ISBN|0-86565-978-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with the limited backstage space of the 19th-century theatre still remaining.

'''Pocahontas''' is the [[title character]] of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s 33rd animated feature film ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995), and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'' (1998). The character and the events she goes through are loosely based on the actual historical figure [[Pocahontas]].

Pocahontas, as the daughter of a [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native American]] [[paramount chief]] of the [[Powhatan|Powhatan paramountcy]], is the first American [[Disney Princess]]. Pocahontas is also the first Disney Princess to have two love interests. She is voiced by and modeled after [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native American]] actress [[Irene Bedard]] and her singing vocals were performed by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] singer [[Judy Kuhn]] in both films. Pocahontas is the seventh member of the Disney Princess line-up and the franchise's first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous America]]n member.

===Conception and writing===

Following his directorial debut with ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' (1990), [[Mike Gabriel]] happened upon an image of [[Pocahontas]] in a history book and decided that he wanted to pitch a film about her to Disney executives. Feeling that he was not adept at drawing women, he went to the pitch meeting with a [[Xerox]]ed image of [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]] from ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953) which he added animals to. His one sentence pitch for the film was: "An Indian princess falls in love with an English settler, then is torn between her father's wish to destroy the settlers and her need to help them." When Disney executives asked Gabriel to summarize Pocahontas' character, he replied: "She's a girl with a problem."&lt;ref name=orlando&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-06-23/entertainment/9506210252_1_pocahontas-john-smith-disney| last=Pearlman| first=Cindy| title='Pocahontas' Isn't Usual Disney Cartoon| publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''| date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', the film's directors Mike Gabriel and [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]] wanted the story of ''Pocahontas'' to feature two characters of very different backgrounds falling in love.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Sophie|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/revisiting-pocahontas/396626/|title=Revisiting Pocahontas at 20|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042018/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/revisiting-pocahontas/396626/|archivedate=December 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Story supervisor [[Tom Sito]], who became the project's unofficial historical consultant, did extensive research into the early colonial era and the story of [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and Pocahontas, and was confronted over the historical inaccuracies from historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/sort-thanksgiving-movie/|title=That Other (Sort of) Thanksgiving Movie|last=Mallory|first=Michael|work=Animation|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=May 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524081142/http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/sort-thanksgiving-movie/|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already knowing that in reality Pocahontas married [[John Rolfe]], Gabriel explained it was felt that "the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience" so instead, they would focus on Pocahontas's meeting with John Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=So who does Pocahontas's hair?|newspaper=[[The Columbian]]|format=Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=May 24, 2015|date=June 23, 2015|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23325366.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191028/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23325366.html|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the real Pocahontas was a eleven or twelve years old upon meeting John Smith, she is depicted as being around eighteen or nineteen years of age in the film, according to her supervising animator [[Glen Keane]]. Keane explained that this change was made because a film wherein a thirty year-old Smith falls in love with a child would be "sleazy".&lt;ref name=orlando/&gt; [[Roy E. Disney]] felt that making the character older than the historical figure would make the film "more dramatic".&lt;ref name=buzzfeed&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/things-you-never-knew-about-disney-princesses|title =57 Things You Never Knew About Disney Princesses|date = June 9, 2014|accessdate = February 15, 2018|website = [[BuzzFeed]]|last =Epstein|first = Leonora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney sought to consult Native American actors and a Native American organization in an attempt to accurately portray Indigenous culture onscreen. Elaine Dutka of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' theorized that this decision was made due to the negative reception of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) by the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]]; Disney denied Dutka's theory. Native American activist [[Russell Means]] who plays Pocahontas' father [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Powhatan]] in the film, suggested that Pocahontas say she was "honored" by a gift Powhatan gives in a scene of the film to reflect the ways that Native Americans talked; Disney changed the film's script in accordance with Means' suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-09/entertainment/ca-29997_1_native-american| last=Dutka| first=Elaine| title=Disney's History Lesson : 'Pocahontas' Has Its Share of Supporters, Detractors| publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''| date=February 9, 1995|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother, lamenting that "We're always getting fried for having no mothers." The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local women and giving away the child, so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably did not see her mother that much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.7/articles/sito1.7.html|title=Fight To The Death, But Don't Hurt Anybody!

===Personality and design===
[[File:Szyndler Eve.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Animator [[Glen Keane]] likened Pocahontas to a tribal version of [[Eve]].]]
Keane also wanted Pocahontas to be written as a confident adult, unlike [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) or [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; The film's producer, Jim Pentacost, viewed the character as "the strongest heroine we’ve ever had in a Disney film."&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; Disney spokesman Howard Green said that the studio desired for the film to portray its Native American characters in a "real" and "fair" way, in contrast to the "very comic, broad" and inaccurate portrayal of Native Americans in ''Peter Pan'' (1953). Green also said that the studio did not want the film to reinforce [[stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America]].&lt;ref name=orlando1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-12-09/lifestyle/9212090691_1_pocahontas-jamestown-john-smith| last=Boyd| first=Bentley| title=Disney Animators Poised To Portray Pocahontas| publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''| date=December 9, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's crew met with Ray Adams, the chairman of the United Indians of Virginia, and showed him ten minutes of unfinished animation and the song "[[Colors of the Wind]]" to see if they had portrayed Pocahontas in a way which would not be offensive. Adams felt that the character's outfits were an accurate representation of Native American clothing and commented that Pocahontas was shown as "very beautiful and very intelligent and very loving, which the Native Americans are. We usually aren't portrayed as being loving, but the settlers would not have survived the first three winters if we had not been loving and helped them."&lt;ref name=orlando1/&gt;

Renowned for animating female characters such as Ariel, supervising animator Glen Keane was immediately tapped to draw the titular Indian princess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Power Of `Pocahontas' Disney Keeps Its Indian Princess Politically Correct|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1995-06-23/features/3029228_1_pocahontas-judy-kuhn-indian-princess|first=Amy|last=Longsdorf|newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=May 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524080751/http://articles.mcall.com/1995-06-23/features/3029228_1_pocahontas-judy-kuhn-indian-princess|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the demands of [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to make the title character "the most idealized and finest woman ever made", Keane first began to sought his inspirations for his depictions for Pocahontas from Shirley 'Little Dove' Custalow-McGowan and Devi White Dove, women he had met during the research trip to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Bradley|title=Disney Gives Pocahontas Sexiest Cartoon Image Ever|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19950623&amp;id=uy0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wQcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3630,4507147&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keane recalled meeting the women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So I turned around and there's this beautiful Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, and this is my sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.'

==Appearances==

===''Pocahontas''===
{{Main|Pocahontas (1995 film)}}
In the beginning of the film, Pocahontas learns that Kocoum, one of her father's bravest warriors, has asked to marry her. (In place of a wedding ring, Pocahontas is given her deceased mother's wedding necklace, and she wears it throughout most of the film.) However, Pocahontas does not feel that this is the right path for her. She is the first one to spot the ship carrying the Europeans, mistaking the ship's sails for clouds. Pocahontas later encounters one of the settlers, John Smith. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that her mother has died and that she lives with her father.

Over time, the two get to know each other, asking all sorts of questions about each other's people, lives, and different worlds. However, the conversation goes sour when John Smith unintentionally reveals his prejudices towards Native Americans. Pocahontas explains to him the beauty and importance of nature and respecting the earth through the song, "[[Colors of the Wind]]". This causes John to see the ill of his thoughts and change his ways, and the two fall in love with each other.

When Kocoum stumbles upon Pocahontas and John Smith kissing, he becomes enraged and attacks the white man. Before Pocahontas can break them up, however, Thomas, who had been sent to find John, shoots and kills Kocoum. John Smith takes the blame for Kocoum's death, is taken prisoner by the Powhatan men, and sentenced to death at sunrise.

Pocahontas realizes that she must stop the execution that will lead to war between the Native Americans and the settlers. She runs to where it will take place, calling out to the forces of nature to help her reach them in time. Pocahontas reaches John Smith just in time to throw herself over him and save him from being killed by her father, Chief Powhatan, who then comes to his senses and releases Smith. When the enraged Governor Ratcliffe shoots at the chief, John Smith pushes Powhatan out of the way and takes the bullet.

Soon after, a wounded John Smith asks her to come with him to [[England]], but she explains that her place is in Virginia, with her people. To comfort him, she tells him that "no matter what happens, I'll always be with you, forever". They kiss, and the men carry him onto the ship. As it is leaving, Pocahontas runs as fast as she can to a cliff overlooking the ocean. John waves goodbye in the Powhatan fashion, and Pocahontas waves back in the Powhatan fashion, as she showed him earlier when the two first met.

In ''Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World'', Pocahontas goes to London as a diplomat to stop a potential attack upon her people being ordered by King James in a plot by Ratcliffe. There, she is accompanied by John Rolfe and slowly develops a romance with him. In the end, she is reunited with John Smith but explains to him that they are "no longer following the same path that they went on years ago", and parts ways with him. Successfully exposing Ratcliffe, who is then arrested by order of the King, Pocahontas and John Rolfe get on a ship going back to Virginia together, and kiss as the ship sails off into the sunset.

'''Post-war immigration to Australia''' deals with [[Immigration to Australia|migration to Australia]] since the end of [[World War II]]. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, [[Ben Chifley]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (1945–1949), established the federal [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection|Department of Immigration]] to administer a large-scale immigration program. Chifley commissioned a report on the subject which found that Australia was in urgent need of a larger population for the purposes of defence and development and it recommended a 1% annual increase in population through increased immigration.&lt;ref name = CAPrice&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price |first=CA |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=September 1998 |title=POST-WAR IMMIGRATION: 1945-1998 |journal=Journal of the Australian Population Association |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection|Minister for Immigration]], [[Arthur Calwell]], promoted mass immigration with the slogan "populate or perish".&lt;ref name = ImmiTimeline&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/federation/timeline1.pdf| format = pdf of 7 pages|title = Immigration to Australia During the 20th Century – Historical Impacts on Immigration Intake, Population Size and Population Composition – A Timeline |publisher = Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia) | year = 2001| accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calwell coined the term "[[New Australians]]" in an effort to supplant such terms as [[Alternative words for British|pommy]] (Englishman) and [[wog]].

The 1% target remained a part of government policy until the [[Whitlam Government]] (1972–1975), when immigration numbers were substantially cut back, only to be restored by the [[Fraser Government]] (1975–1982).&lt;ref name = CAPrice/&gt;

Some 4.2&amp;nbsp;million immigrants arrived between 1945 and 1985, about 40 per cent of whom came from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Bassett (1986) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, some 6.5 million people have migrated to Australia since 1945.&lt;ref name = FactsImmi&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.diac.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/02key.htm| title = Fact Sheet 2 - Key Facts in Immigration|publisher = Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia) | year = 2008| accessdate = 2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This total comprises 3.35 million males and 3.15 million females. This represents a significant proportion of the overall population increase experienced by Australia in that time, having gone from 7 million in 1945 to the present total of over 23 million.&lt;ref name="FactsImmi"/&gt; 182,159 people were sponsored by the [[International Refugee Organisation]] (IRO) from the end of [[World War II]] up to the end of 1954 to resettle in Australia from Europe—more than the number of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts transported to Australia]] in the first 80 years after European settlement.&lt;ref name = 5thFleet&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fifthfleet.net/index.html?0.8405937949414688|title = What is the Fifth Fleet?|last = Tündern-Smith|first = Ann|publisher = Fifth Fleet Press| date = 2008-05-23|accessdate= 2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  "Populate or perish" policy==

===The Chifley years===

Following the [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|attacks on Darwin]] and the associated fear of [[Imperial Japan]]ese invasion in World War II, the [[Chifley Government]] commissioned a report on the subject which found that Australia was in urgent need of a larger population for the purposes of defence and development and it recommended a 1% annual increase in population through increased immigration.&lt;ref name = CAPrice /&gt; In 1945, the government established the federal [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection|Department of Immigration]] to administer the new immigration program. The first [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection|Minister for Immigration]] was [[Arthur Calwell]]. An [[Assisted Passage Migration Scheme]] was also established in 1945 to encourage Britons to migrate to Australia. The government's objective was summarised in the slogan "populate or perish". Calwell stated in 1947, to critics of mass immigration from non-British Europe: "We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us."

The post-war immigration program of the Chifley Government gave them preference to migrants from [[Great Britain]], and initially an ambitious target was set of nine British out of ten immigrants.&lt;ref name = CAPrice/&gt; However, it was soon apparent that even with assisted passage the government target would be impossible to achieve given that Britain's shipping capacity was quite diminished from pre-war levels. As a consequence, Calwell looked further afield to maintain overall immigration numbers, and this meant relying on the IRO refugees from Eastern Europe, with the [[United States of America|USA]] providing the necessary shipping.&lt;ref name = CAPrice/&gt; Many Eastern Europeans were refugees from the [[Red Army]] and thus mostly anti-[[Communist]] and so politically acceptable.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;[http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/calwellACHSconf09.pdf J. Franklin, 'Calwell, Catholicism and the origins of multicultural Australia', 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menzies years===
The 1% target survived a change of government in 1949, when the [[Menzies Government]] succeeded Chifley's. The new Minister of Immigration was [[Harold Holt]] (1949–56).

The British component remained the largest component of the migrant intake until 1953.&lt;ref name = CAPrice/&gt; Between 1953 and late 1956, migrants from [[Southern Europe]] outnumbered the British, and this caused some alarm in the Australian government, causing it to place restrictions on Southern Europeans sponsoring newcomers and to commence the "Bring out a Briton" campaign. With the increase in financial assistance to British settlers provided during the 1960s, the British component was able to return to the top position in the overall number of new settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube| 8MzGR4OJmGE | "Look at Life - Immigration to Australia 1950s 1960s" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans migrated to Australia and over 1,000,000 Britons immigrated with financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200711/programs/ZY8804A001D1112007T203000.htm |title=Ten Pound Poms|date=1 November 2007|work=[[ABC Television (Australia)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration assistance scheme initially targeted citizens of Commonwealth countries; but it was gradually extended to other countries such as the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]]. The qualifications were straightforward: migrants needed to be in sound health and under the age of 45 years. There were initially no skill requirements, although under the White Australia policy, people from mixed-race backgrounds found it very difficult to take advantage of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/immigrationmuseum/discoverycentre/your-questions/ten-pound-poms/|title=Ten Pound Poms|date=10 May 2009|work=[[Museum Victoria]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117183339/http://museumvictoria.com.au/immigrationmuseum/discoverycentre/your-questions/ten-pound-poms/|archivedate=17 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured voters that unskilled non-British migrants were needed for "labour on rugged projects ...work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Michael Dugan and Josef Swarc (1984) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian economy stood in sharp contrast to war-ravaged Europe, and newly arrived migrants found employment in a booming manufacturing industry and government assisted programmes such as the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. This [[hydroelectricity]] and [[irrigation in Australia|irrigation]] complex in south-east Australia consisted of sixteen major dams and seven power stations constructed between 1949 and 1974. It remains the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. Necessitating the employment of 100,000 people from over 30 countries, to many it denotes the birth of multicultural Australia.&lt;ref name="The Snowy Mountains Scheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/snowyscheme/ |title=The Snowy Mountains Scheme |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the one-millionth post-war immigrant arrived in Australia.  Australia's population reached 10&amp;nbsp;million in 1959, up from 7 million in 1945.

== End to the White Australia policy ==
In 1972, [[Whitlam Government]] (1972-1975) adopted a completely non-discriminatory immigration policy, effectively putting an end to the White Australia policy.  However, the change occurred in the context of a substantial reduction in the overall migrant intake. During the [[Fraser Government]] (1975-1982) there was a final end to the White Australia policy but there was an increasing intake of [[Vietnam]]ese refugees in the aftermath of the end of the [[Vietnam War]], and Australia experienced the largest intake of Asian immigrants since the arrival of the [[China|Chinese]] gold miners during the gold rush of the 1850s and 60s. In 1983, the level of British immigration was below the level of Asian immigration for the first time in Australian history.&lt;ref name = CAPrice/&gt;

== International agreements ==
Financial assistance was an important element of the post war immigration program and as such there were a number of agreements in place between the Australian government and various governments and international organisations.&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/04fifty.htm|title = Fact Sheet 4 - More than 60 Years of Post-war Migration |publisher = Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia) | year = 2007| accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* United Kingdom - free or assisted passages.&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4/&gt;  Immigrants under this scheme became known as [[Ten Pound Poms]].
* assisted passages for ex-servicemen of the [[British Empire]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4/&gt;  This scheme later covered ex-servicemen or resistance fighters from the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4/&gt;
* an agreement with the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO) to settle at least 12,000 displaced people a year from camps in Europe.&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4/&gt; Australia accepted a disproportionate share of refugees sponsored by IRO in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref name = Neumann2003&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann |first= Klaus| year=2003 |month= |title= Providing a ‘home for the oppressed’?

* formal migration agreements, often involving the grant of assisted passage, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Turkey]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name = ImmiFactSht4/&gt;

== Migrant reception and training centres ==

[[File:Bonegilla camp 1954.jpg|thumb|[[Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre]], 1954]]

On arrival in Australia, many migrants went to migrant reception and training centres where they learned some English while they looked for a job. The Department of Immigration was responsible for the camps and kept records on camp administration and residents.&lt;ref name="accom"&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/migration/migrant-accommodation.aspx Migrant accommodation]&lt;/ref&gt; The migrant reception and training centres were also known as Commonwealth Immigration Camps, migrant hostels, immigration dependants' holding centres, migrant accommodation, or migrant workers' hostels.&lt;ref name="sharpes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sharpesonline.com/migrant_hostels_in_ausralia.htm | title=Migrant Hostels in Australia | accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs170.aspx | title=Migrant hostels in New South Wales, 1946–78 – Fact sheet 170 | accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first migrant reception centre opened at [[Bonegilla, Victoria]] near [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] in December 1947. When the camp closed in 1971, some 300,000 migrants had spent time there.&lt;ref name = Bonegillaheritage/&gt;

By 1951, the government had established three migrant reception centres for non-English speaking displaced persons from Europe, and twenty holding centres, principally to house non-working dependants, when the pressure of arrival numbers on the reception centres was too great to keep families together.&lt;ref name = Bonegillaheritage/&gt;  The purpose of reception and training centres was to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;provide for general medical examination and x-ray of migrants, issue of necessary clothing, payment of social service benefits, interview to determine employment potential, instruction in English and the Australian way of life generally.&lt;ref name = Bonegillaheritage/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The centres were located throughout Australia (dates are those of post office opening and closing&lt;ref name = "a"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Since 1950 Australia has experienced average arrivals of around one million per decade, with the totals in the earlier decades being slightly above the totals in the more recent decades.  Current statistics suggest that one million will be reached again in the current decade.&lt;ref name="FactsImmi"/&gt; The breakdown by decade is as follows:

* 1.6 million between October 1945 and 30 June 1960;
* about 1.3 million in the 1960s;
* about 960.000 in the 1970s;
* about 1.1 million in the 1980s; and
* over 900,000 in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="FactsImmi"/&gt;

The highest number of arrivals in any one year since World War II was 185,099 in 1969-70 and the lowest was 52,752 in 1975-76.&lt;ref name="FactsImmi"/&gt;

== Demography as at 2006 for non-English speaking ethnic groups ==

In the 2006 census, birthplace was enumerated as was date of arrival in Australia for those not born in Australia.  For the major immigrant groups enlarged by the arrival of immigrants to Australia after World War II, they are still major demographic groups in Australia:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">The '''RTMC Astronomy Expo''' is one of the major gatherings of [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] in the [[United States]].

== History ==

Founded by Clifford W. Holmes and the Riverside Astronomical Society, the RTMC Astronomy Expo began in 1969 as the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference at [[Riverside City College]] in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]]. It consisted of a series of lectures about [[astronomy]] and [[telescope]] making with a competition for quality and innovative telescopes. In 1973 it was moved to a dark-sky site near [[Idyllwild, California|Idyllwild]] and in 1975 it was moved to its current home near [[Big Bear City, California|Big Bear City]]. It is held on the three-day [[Memorial Day]] weekend. In 2010, it was held in May on the weekend that corresponded with new moon to allow amateur astronomers the best viewing conditions. Due to low attendance the date was moved back to the Memorial Day weekend in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/general.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204336/http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/general.html |archivedate=2013-05-20 |df= }} RTMC Dates&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization annually presents the [[Clifford W. Holmes Award]] for "Major Contribution to Popularizing Astronomy, the Warren Estes Memorial Award for "Best Use of Simple Materials and Technique" in making telescopes, and the [[Clyde Tombaugh]] Award "Creative Innovation in Telescope Design".

To better reflect the evolution of amateur astronomy, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference was renamed the RTMC Astronomy Expo in 2003.  Each year the scope of activities continues to grow and evolve and has lectures, workshops, extensive beginners activities, a swap meet, astronomy clubs and other organizations, and vendors demonstrating and selling astronomical products.  The Expo continues to promote family activities with swimming, canoeing, horseback riding, archery, wall climbing.  Extensive hiking and mountain biking trails are also available.

== Nightfall ==

The RTMC also produces an early autumn star party called Nightfall in [[Borrego Springs, CA]]. Nightfall is held on the weekend in October that corresponds with the new moon.

== Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS) ==

In 2007, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference, Inc. announced a fall event to be held in Pasadena named the Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS). This annual event was held annually 2008 thru 2012 at the Pasadena Convention Center and focused displays by commercial vendors, astronomy clubs and other organizations as well as talks and workshops. The first PATS was held September 13–14, 2008. The 2013 event was cancelled. PATS was designed to complement the ongoing RTMC Astronomy Expo which continues to be held in Big Bear in May of each year.

==History==

Mirroring the television show ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', Joe Reynolds organized and launched [[Great Urban Race]], LLC and hosted the first race on September 15, 2007 in Chicago.&lt;ref name=IntEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneurs Unpluggd|url=http://www.entrepreneursunpluggd.com/blog/red-frog-events|work=Interview with Red Frog Events|accessdate=18 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027172021/http://www.entrepreneursunpluggd.com/blog/red-frog-events|archivedate=27 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In December 2008, Reynolds brought on four Event Coordinator interns ("Tadpoles") and moved the business into an office in Chicago's [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood to help keep up with the planning and organizing of Great Urban Race.&lt;ref name="IntEU"/&gt; In 2009, Ryan Kunkel joined Reynolds to expand Great Urban Race and develop new events. 

In the summer of 2009 the company was renamed Red Frog Events, LLC, and the first [[Warrior Dash]], was held in [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet, IL]].&lt;ref name="TribJoeRyan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-19/business/ct-biz-0619-confidential-races-20110619_1_staycation-ambition-craze|work=Joe Reynolds, Ryan Kunkel: Lead Warriors|accessdate=1 December 2011|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Red Frog Events moved from their Lincoln Park office to their current location at 320 West Ohio Street.&lt;ref name="isu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Illinois State Business Magazine|url=http://blogs.ilstu.edu/business-magazine/2011/09/red-frog-events/|work=Red Frog Events|accessdate=1 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528073933/http://blogs.ilstu.edu/business-magazine/2011/09/red-frog-events/|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2010, the first [[Beach Palooza]] (later rebranded as Beach Dash to maintain consistency with their Warrior Dash race series) was held at Daytona Beach, FL.&lt;ref name="Timetoast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timetoast timelines|url=http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/a-history-of-the-red-frog-family|work=A history of the Red Frog Family! timeline|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Red Frog Bar Crawls were launched.

Two more bar crawls were introduced in 2012: Bright 'N' Tight in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]], and Derby Days in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

In 2012 the [[Firefly Music Festival]] was launched in [[Dover, Delaware]], and Farm to Fork, a 'farm style dinner,' took place on September 22 at McDonald Farm in [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville, IL.]]

In 2013 Red Frog launched three new running events: Iron Warrior Dash, Urban Warrior Dash, and Illuminite Run. They also launched the American Beer Classic beer festival and The Candy Cane Express. 

In 2014,  Red Frog launched the Bacon Chase in Atlanta, GA on March 22, 2014. They also bought DC-based [[ShamrockFest]] from GoCity Events and began offering its ticketing platform, EventSprout, to third party event organizers.

In 2015, Red Frog Events launched Big Barrel Country Music Festival and Red Frog Food and Beverage. On July 21, 2015, Red Frog laid off 29 of its roughly 105 employees.&lt;ref name="layoff"&gt;{{cite news|title= Red Frog Events lays off nearly a third of Chicago staff |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150721/NEWS07/150729960/red-frog-events-lays-off-nearly-one-third-of-chicago-staff|accessdate=24 July 2015|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during World War II, the [[Wehrmacht]] built several standardised [[bunker]]s and weapon positions in Germany and German-occupied countries. These buildings were called [[Regelbau]], i.e. standardised buildings. This building, Regelbau 638, was a small [[field hospital]] (''Kleiner Sanitätsunterstand'').

At [[Fjell Fortress]] outside [[Bergen]] in [[Norway]] a fully restored Regelbau 638 bunker can be seen at the museum, Fjell festning. In 2009–2010 this bunker was restored inside and supplied with authentic German hospital and sanitary equipment from World War II by the local voluntary society ''Fjell Festnings Militærhistoriske Samlinger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fjellfms.blogspot.com/2009/09/starten.html|title=Fjell Festning Militærhistoriske Samlinger: Regelbau 638|work=Fjell Festning Militærhistoriske Samlinger|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=20 September 2009|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reggaesoca Music Awards''' were first presented in 1994 by its founder Winsome ‘Lady C’ Charlton at The Bailey Concert Hall in [[Davie, Florida|Davie, South Florida]]. The Awards became a reality after years of deliberation, pondering and due to the lack of recognition for [[Reggae music|reggae]] and [[soca music]] in the United States despite its continued popularity. 

The ceremony consists of twenty five awards in various categories namely [[vocalists]], [[D.J.]]s, producers, albums, songs, [[record label]]s, instrumentals, videos and many more.

In August 2011, a female American high-school student named '''Savannah Dietrich''' was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] by Will Frey and Austin Zehnder, lacrosse players from [[Trinity High School (Louisville)]], an exclusive Catholic high school in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chinn, Valerie |url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19428803/parents-of-juveniles-accused-of-sexual-assault-upset-that-names-are-public |title=Parents of juveniles accused of sexual assault upset that names are public  |publisher=wdrb.com |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesta |first=Abigail |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/advice/a4420/cyberbullying/ |title=Fighting Back: One Girl's Mission to End Cyberbullying |publisher=Cosmopolitan.com |date=2013-06-04 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gye, Hugo |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2197400/Savannah-Dietrich-told-lawyer-assaulted-classmates.html |title=Savannah Dietrich was told to 'get over it' by lawyer after being assaulted by classmates &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assault was photographed by Frey and Zehnder and other observers, and images and comments from the incident went viral on the internet.

In a [[plea bargain]], two 16-year-old boys Frey and Zehnder pleaded guilty to [[sexual abuse]] in the first degree, a felony, and [[voyeurism]], a misdemeanor. Dietrich released the names of her attackers and argued publicly that they were not adequately punished despite being instructed not to discuss the case by the presiding judge. International controversy regarding the case developed when attorneys for the boys attempted to have her held [[Contempt of court|in contempt]], but the motion was subsequently dropped.

Afterwards, at the time of sentencing, the judge said that because of the "serious nature" of the crime, she would revise the punishment requested by the prosecutor.  Accordingly, the judge removed a provision that would have [[Expungement in the United States|expunged]] the defendants' records upon reaching age {{frac|19|1|2}}, and also ordered that their [[community service]] be served at a charity that deals with women's issues.{{r|C-J}}

==Initial court proceedings, plea deal, and privacy law==
The two defendants pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in the first degree, a felony and voyeurism, a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"/&gt; The initial plea-deal agreed to by the prosecutor was 50 hours of community service, a diversion agreement, counseling, and a provision to expunge the defendants' criminal records—provided they maintained good behavior—at age {{frac|19|1|2}}.{{r|WDRB}} Paul Richwalsky, the prosecutor in the case was a graduate and booster of [[Trinity High School (Louisville)]], the same school the boys attended.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"/&gt;

On June 26, 2012, Judge Deana H. McDonald admonished the parties to the case that they must follow the statutes and laws regarding privacy and confidentiality of juvenile proceedings on the Commonwealth of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/23/savannah_dietrich_outs_her_rapists_on_twitter_and_facebook.html |title=Savannah Dietrich outs her rapists on Twitter and Facebook |publisher=Slate.com |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Kentucky is one of 11 states which [[Record sealing|seal court cases]] if the accused is under 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chang, Juju|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/kentucky-teen-sexually-assaulted-threatened-jail-time/story?id=17005633&amp;page=2#.UOrMGWfAUbc |title=Kentucky Teen Sexually Assaulted, Then Threatened With Jail Time - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Judge McDonald took an extra step, indicating that the crime itself should not be discussed and that no one should "speak about the incident to anyone for any reason," she said, according to court files. "No one is to talk or type anything."&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"/&gt; This meant that Dietrich (the 16-year-old female victim) was not permitted to speak about the case, the charges, the facts and allegations therein, and the identities of the defendants.{{r|Pesta}}

==Statements by victim protesting leniency==
Dietrich stated that she felt her concerns were not properly addressed and that the proposed deal was too lenient.  Later that evening, she announced the names of the defendants on [[Twitter]], tweeting "Will Frey and Austin Zehnder sexually assaulted me," and "There you go, lock me up. I'm not protecting anyone that made my life a living hell."&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"/&gt;

The primary judge on the case, Angela McCormick Bisig, was away the day the controversial order of silence was issued by Judge McDonald. In 2013 Judge Bisig, then a circuit-court judge, went on record acknowledging Dietrich should have been allowed to discuss the crime itself, "We cannot tell a young crime victim that they cannot tell their personal story."&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan.com"/&gt;

Attorneys for the boys attempted to have Dietrich held in contempt for publishing their names, but the motion was subsequently dropped.{{r|C-J}}  Notwithstanding Judge McDonald's admonitions forbidding anyone "talk or type anything", on August 28, 2012 Judge Bisig stated in her ruling that on July 30, 2012 "Judge McDonald ruled that there was no "gag order" in place and that her admonishment had been to comply with the law of confidentiality required by Kentucky Statutes."&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson District Court, Juvenile Division, [http://www.rcfp.org/sites/default/files/docs/20120828_215324_courierjournal_.pdf "Opinion and Order"], p. 4 (August 28, 2012), obtained via [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an affidavit, Dietrich also stated that Paul Richwalsky, the chief prosecutor in the juvenile court division, said she should "get over it and see a therapist. ... The jail was for 'real' rapists, murderers and robbers".{{r|Riley}}  Richwalsky denied the allegation and stated in an affidavit "Perhaps it is not so much she is trying to intentionally mislead and deceive this court, but rather the delusional assertions made in her affidavit are merely the byproduct of what she would like to believe happened and not what in actuality took place."{{r|Riley}}

==Sentencing and revision of plea deal==
During sentencing, Judge Angela Bisig emphasized the "serious nature" of the crime.  She removed a provision of the plea deal that would have expunged the defendants' records when they reach age of {{frac|19|1|2}}. She also ordered that their community service be served at a charity that deals with women's issues.{{r|C-J}}

Terms of the sentences require supervision by the state's juvenile justice department, offender treatment and performance of 50 hours of community service at a women's facility. After three years of good behavior the two felony charges may be amended down to misdemeanors and after five years the boys may request that the convictions be expunged.{{r|C-J}}

==Subsequent activities==
Dietrich was reportedly satisfied with the revised punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Jaimie.  "[http://m.wave3.com/autojuice?targetUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wave3.com%2Fstory%2F19549571%2Fjudge-changes-plea-deal-after-teen-tweets-displeasure Judge changes plea deal after teen Tweets displeasure]",{{dead link|date=May 2014}} ''[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE News]]'' (September 14, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2013, she took an active and public role in advocating legislation in the [[Kentucky General Assembly|Kentucky legislature]], as reported by ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'':&lt;ref name=Halladay&gt;Halladay, Jessie. "Kentucky House advances bill to allow juvenile court victims to discuss case",  ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' (March 4, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]he hopes that a law would prevent what happened to her from happening to anyone else. She said perhaps the law will make it clear to everyone that it is the victim's right to talk about what happened.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the same time, Dietrich indicated that such a state law is not absolutely necessary, given the protections that she believes are already afforded by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Halladay"/&gt; First Amendment expert [[Eugene Volokh]] has commented about this Louisville case, saying that a pertinent [[U.S. Supreme Court]] precedent on this subject is [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7719461183308362244 Oklahoma Publishing v. District Court, 430 U.S. 308 (1977)].  "An order barring a victim from revealing the names of her assailants is, I think, clearly unconstitutional, even when the assailants are juveniles. Oklahoma Publishing Co. v. District Court (1977) expressly rejected the notion that courts or legislatures may bar the publication of the names of juvenile offenders; that case involved a newspaper's publishing the name of the juvenile offender, which it learned from a court hearing, but the rationale applies at least as strongly to a person's publishing a name that she learned from the attack itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volokh |first=Eugene |url=http://volokh.com/2012/07/22/the-dark-side-of-privacy/ |title=The Dark Side of Privacy |publisher=The Volokh Conspiracy |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sijelo''' (In [[Ijekavian]]), '''silo''' (In [[Ikavian]]) or '''selo''' (In [[Ekavian]]) is the name of an evening gathering at a house, a social event (i.e. a [[party]]), in [[former Yugoslavia]]. The use of the word ''sijelo'' is particularly widespread in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

'''''Smederevska Sedmica''''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Смедеревска Седмица)  was an independent local magazine in [[Serbia]], published weekly between September 1997 and July 2005. It was the only magazine in Smederevo that was independent during the rule of [[Slobodan Milošević]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vazdan.com/link_search.php?criteria=Nezavisne%20novine vazdan :: Linkovi :: Pretraga&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knight-international.org/i/braithwaite.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090909/http://www.knight-international.org/i/braithwaite.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine slogan was ''Truth at least once a week'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Истина бар једном седмично). The word "sedmica" means "seven" in Serbian, but it can also mean a "week".

As the magazine editorial says "Smederevska sedmica was published by staff dedicated to freedom of speech and of the media despite the fact that they operate in a difficult economic and political environment".

[[Image:SurfBoatCompetitionAtIllawarraCarnival.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Surf boat competition during a ''surf carnival''.]]
In Australian culture sports carnivals are held to perform competitions in the individual or team disciplines like athletics, swimming or [[Surf Life Saving]]. Teams from different clubs or schools gather together for both individual point-score and team score. Often, the carnival is opened by a parade with the teams marching in uniforms and flags over the field of competition.

==Surf carnival==

[[Surf Life Saving Club]]s in [[Australia]] train their [[nippers]] and young [[surf lifesaving|life savers]] for competitions in ''surf carnivals''. Local, regional, state and nationwide competitions are held across the country. Junior carnivals compete for age groups starting from under-8 to under-14, while senior competitions among active surf life savers start from under-15 to ''veterans''. Veterans are athletes 30 years and older; the age groups are in 5-year blocks: 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, all the way up to 65+. Surf boat competitions start from 16+.

'''''Spremnost''''' was a weekly [[newsmagazine]] of former [[Ustaše|Ustaše movement]] from [[Zagreb]], that has written about everything, politics, war, economy and culture. Magazine was published from the beginning of 1942 until breakdown of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] in May 1945.

==Founding and breakdown==
Since the establishment of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] the leading Croatian dailies, have become; ''Hrvatski narod''  and ''Nova Hrvatska'', the leading ideological weekly newspaper of general type was ''Spremnost''.

Other newspapers that are coming out then were; weekly humorous magazine ''Šilo'', newspapers ''Gospodarstvo'' (Economic Affairs), ''Hrvatski radnik'', ''Plug'', ''Plava revija'', ''Hrvatska revija'' and ''Vienac''.

Newsmagazine ''Spremnost'' was initiated only when the [[Ustaše|Ustaša regime]] mastered the methods of total control of the press. The initiator and main organizer was [[Ivo Bogdan]] and chief editor was [[Tias Mortigjija]] (until 1944). In addition with Mortigjija and Bogdan, in magazine regularly publish articles on politics; Milivoj Magdić, [[Savić Marković Štedimlija|Savić Štedimlija]] and [[Ante Ciliga]] (since 1943). Magdić was responsible for the critique of [[Marxism–Leninism]], Štedimlija was some kind of specialist in [[Balkans]] issues, especially for the  ''[[Chetniks|Chetnik movement]]'', and Ciliga wrote about the [[Soviet Union]] (he was spent in [[Russia]] about 10 years). Other important collaborators  were: [[Ljubomir Maraković]] (literature), Ton Smerdel, Radoslav Glavaš, Albert Haler, [[Antun Barac]] and Mihovil Kombol.

Overall  ''Spremnost'' was a typical puppet news magazine of this time with a strong nationalistic note, - defended the policy of its [[Axis powers|sponsors]], and critical writing about politics of [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] tried to show his politics as disastrous for Europe.

Allies are generally portrayed as unnatural interest coalition of ''[[Jews]], [[Freemasonry]]  and [[Communists]]''. Thus, to illustrate the ''Spremnost'' published on 13 September 1942. Ivo Bogdan article that says that the [[Independent State of Croatia]] must resist »the Jews, freemasons, communists«, as internal enemies, with »courage, determination and political foresight«.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2004/04/22/Clanak.asp?r=sta&amp;c=2 Ivo Horvat: Ne može se rehabilitirati novinstvo koje je služilo totalitarističkoj politici i praksi ustaškoga režima (22. travnja 2004.), Vjesnik online (Accessed: september 2,  2010) {{hr icon}}]{{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when it was clear that the Axis powers have lost the war - the Allied successes were depicted in an entirely different light, or are completely minimized. In this light is described [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] - as a completely insignificant event, which does not have any military significance in relation to the main east front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://szi-humanistika.ffzg.hr/webpac/?rm=results&amp;show_full=1&amp;f=UncontrolledTerms&amp;v=tjednik%20 O tjedniku Spremnost, Knjižnice Filozofskog fakulteta, Sveučilišta u Zagrebu (Accessed: september 2,  2010) {{hr icon}}]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Superkart.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|A Formula E/Division  250 cc Superkart at [[Castle Combe Circuit|Castle Combe]], England.]]
'''Superkart''' is a form of [[motorsport]] [[road racing]] in which the class is a racing vehicle sized like a [[kart]] but with several characteristics more strongly associated with [[Open wheel car|open-wheel racing cars]].

The most obvious difference between a Superkart and any other form of kart is that they have full aerodynamic bodykits and can race on car circuits over 1,500&amp;nbsp;metres in length. The power unit, most often, but not exclusively [[Two-stroke engine|two stroke]] 250 cc engines, can be specially designed kart engines or production motorcycle engines with either five or six-speed sequential gearboxes. Owing to their high top speed and superb cornering ability, a Superkart's [[aerodynamic]] [[Car body style|bodywork]] includes a front [[Kart fairing|fairing]], larger [[sidepod]]s, and a [[Spoiler (automotive)|rear wing]]. They use either {{convert|5|or|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[tire]]s and [[wheel]]s and most often race on full size auto-racing circuits.

250 cc Superkarts often{{quantify|date=October 2012}} set faster lap times than much more expensive and technically advanced racing machines.&lt;ref name="magny"&gt;[http://www.mediasuperkart.com/en/news-actualite-313-french-cup-superkart-a-magny-cours.html Magny Cours F1 - Superkarts fire the crowds imagination !!] - 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadandtrack"&gt;[http://www.roadandtrack.com/racing/motorsports/superkarts-super-speeds Superkarts — Super Speeds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106122037/http://www.roadandtrack.com/racing/motorsports/superkarts-super-speeds |date=6 November 2011 }} - ''Road &amp; Track'', November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some British and Australian classes also include 125 cc gearbox karts.

==Performance==
Powered by a [[2-stroke]] 250&amp;nbsp;cc engine producing 62 [[horsepower|hp]] for an overall weight including the driver of 205 kilograms, Superkarts have a [[Power-to-weight ratio|power/weight ratio]] of 440&amp;nbsp;hp/[[tonne]] (330 W/kg)(c.5&amp;nbsp;lbs/hp). Superkarts can accelerate from 0 to 60&amp;nbsp;mph in less than 3&amp;nbsp;seconds with a top speed of 155&amp;nbsp;mph (250&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parcferme.com/content/view/2663/2/ Superkart at Magny-Cours - 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Their low weight and good [[downforce]] make for excellent cornering&lt;ref&gt;''"Yeah, I can take that right-hander flat-out in 6th gear at just shy of 120 mph." When my face shows disbelief (120 mph?!), he adds, "It moves around a little, but you just keep your foot in it. The rear wing is producing good downforce there and it will hold."'' — [[Eddie Lawson]] - [http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=21&amp;article_id=2827 Superkart Thrill Ride, page 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127222725/http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=21&amp;article_id=2827 |date=27 January 2006 }} - Road &amp; Track,October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and braking abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''"The biggest adjustment compared to cars or even other karts is the speed with which this kart enters turns and how late I can brake for them. Its ability to shed speed is right up there with many open-wheel race cars. Braking is performed in a straighter line than with a rear brake-only sprint kart, though the rate of deceleration is considerably greater."'' - [http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=21&amp;article_id=2827&amp;page_number=2 Superkart Thrill Ride, page 2]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Road &amp; Track,October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A Superkart is capable of braking from 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h) to standstill in around 2&amp;nbsp;seconds, and taking corners at nearly 3 ''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (30&amp;nbsp;m/s²).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906220216/http://www.qldsuperkart.org/?q=taxonomy/term/12 Performance ; 250cc International] - Queensland Superkart Club&lt;/ref&gt;

'''British Superkart Divisions''' :
{{main|British Superkart Championship}}
*'''Division 1''' is open to 250 cc karts with one or two cylinders and five or six speed gearboxes. Typically the karts produce 100&amp;nbsp;hp and are capable of 160&amp;nbsp;mph - the fastest form of kart. This formula was previously known as Formula E, which was changed to avoid confusion with the [[Formula E]] series.
*'''Division 2''' is for single cylinder karts with 5 and 6-speed boxes. Typically these karts produce 65&amp;nbsp;hp and are capable of 140&amp;nbsp;mph. However, being lighter than the twin cylinder (Division 1) karts they can be as quick on twisted circuits. This formula was previously known as 250 International. However the main British series is for single cylinder 250 cc karts with 5-speed only, also known as 250 National.
*'''125 Open''' - Powered by 125 cc engines and again featuring 6-speed sequential gearboxes, this [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint kart]] class uses lighter chassis than the 250's.
*'''125 ICC (KZ)''' - Powered by similar 6-speed 125 cc engines to the 125 Open class with tighter tuning restrictions, this CIK [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint kart]] class hosts some of the closest Superkart racing in the UK.

Superkarting in Australia has, since 1989, referred to any form of racing kart to race on full-size motor racing circuits, usually as sanctioned by the Australian ASN, [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]].
*'''250 cc International''' - commonly referred to as ''twins'' or ''inters'', these karts are powered by twin cylinder engines and usually have 6-speed sequential gearboxes. Several European and North American chassis are popular in addition to locally developed designs.
*'''250 cc National''' - single cylinder class, the 250 National class is powered by 250 cc [[motocross]] engines and also feature 6-speed sequential gearboxes.
*'''125 cc Gearbox''' - most often powered by 125 cc Honda and Yamaha Grand Prix motorcycle engines equipped with six speed sequential gearboxes, this Superkart class uses mostly the same chassis as the 250 classes. They run at lighter weights than the 250 classes, which makes for close racing with mid-field 250 Nationals at some circuits.
*'''80 cc Gearbox''' - also dominated by Honda and Yamaha motor cycle engines, 80 cc gearbox Superkarts is no longer a sanctioned class in Australian racing. Some 80 cc karts were noticeably smaller than 125/250 cc gearbox karts, with 'laydown' style karts, where the driver lies flat in the kart rather than sitting upright, proliferating. Last contested at national level in 2005.&lt;ref name="CAMS"/&gt; and state level in 2008, some 80 cc karts survive racing in the 125 cc division at state level, but are uncompetitive as they no longer run at lighter homologated weight levels.
*'''125 cc [[Rotax Max]]''' - a cross-over class from Australian short-circuit non-gearbox [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint kart racing]] to allow easier and cheaper graduation from Sprint karting to long circuit racing. Three national championships exist for two weight divisions, '''Heavy''' and '''Light''', and also sometimes a '''Junior''' division for drivers under the age of sixteen which run a version of the Rotax Max engine without a power valve. Rotax Max karts frequently race amongst gearbox equipped Superkarts at state championship level, while racing for their own titles at national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camsmanual.com.au/sportregs/2011_Aust_Non-Gearbox_Superkart_Nationals_SportRegs-1.pdf |title=2011 Australian Non Gearbox Superkart Nationals: Sporting Regulations |publisher=[[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''100 cc''' Another non-gearbox class, 100 cc also was split into Heavy, Light and Junior classes, and was last contested in 2002 and has since been replaced completely by Rotax Max.&lt;ref name="CAMS"/&gt;

*'''250 cc Formula/E or F/E''' - Twin cylinder, 6-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines such as the Honda RS250, Yamaha TZ250 or made for karting engines such as the BRC250.
*'''250 cc Inter-Continental E or IC/E''' - Single cylinder, 5 or 6-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines.

==Spectacle==
{{original research|section|date=October 2012}}
''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' reports Supercart to cost between $15,000 to $20,000 USD in 2005.&lt;ref name="roadandtrack"/&gt; Entries of 60 or more are common in Britain. Overtaking tends to be easy, as there is room to get past, so the races tend to be full of action. Race lengths tend to be around 20–25&amp;nbsp;miles (30–40&amp;nbsp;km), because the fuel tanks are quite small, so at most meetings which feature Superkarts, the karts race is often a brief, spectacular highlight (U.S. Superkart races are a timed 30-minute race; Pre-Final on Saturday, Final on Sunday).

A global category, Superkarts are endorsed by the [[FIA]], and were featured as a support category to the [[French Grand Prix|French Formula 1 Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] in 2007 where they bettered [[Porsche Supercup]] lap times.&lt;ref name="magny"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Tango no Sekku'''''|端午の節句}} also known as ''Ayame no hi'' (Iris festival) is one the five annual ceremonies that were traditionally held at the Japanese imperial court called [[Gosekku]] . It is the Japanese version of [[Double Fifth]] and was celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth moon in the [[lunar calendar]] or [[Chinese calendar]]. After Japan switched to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the date was moved to [[May 5]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum948"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al'' (2005). "Tango no Sekku" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 948.|page=948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is still celebrated in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] as the [[Duanwu Festival]] or Tuen Ng Festival (Cantonese), in Korea  as the [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano Festival]], and Vietnam as the [[Tết Đoan Ngọ]] on the traditional lunar calendar date.

{{nihongo||端|Tan}} means "beginning" and {{nihongo||[[wikt:午|午]]|go}} is a simplified form of ⾺ ([[Horse (zodiac)|horse]]), referring to the [[Chinese zodiac#Months and solar terms|Chinese zodiac name]] for the fifth lunar month. Days of the week also have zodiac animals. Thus, ''tango'' originally meant "the first horse day of the fifth month". However, ''go'' is a [[homonym]] for 五 (five) in Japanese, so during the [[Nara period]] the meaning shifted to become the fifth day of the fifth month.&lt;ref name=ningyo&gt;{{cite web|title=端午の節句と5月人形|trans-title=Tango no sekku and May dolls|language=ja|url=http://www.ningyo-kyokai.or.jp/sekku/tango.html|publisher=Japanese Doll Association|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sekku'' means a seasonal festival. There are five ''sekku'', including [[shogatsu|O-Shogatsu]] (January 1), [[hinamatsuri|Hina Matsuri]] (March 3), [[Tanabata]] (July 7) and [[Chrysanthemum Day|Kiku Matsuri]] (September 9th) along with Tango. ''Tango no Sekku'' marks the beginning of [[summer]] or the [[rainy season]].

==History==
[[Image:Japanese Festival in Honor of the Birth of Children.jpg|left|thumb|"Japanese Festival in Honor of the Birth of Children" from ''Sketches of Japanese Manners and Customs'', by J.M.W. Silver, illustrated by native drawings, published in London in 1867]] Although it is not known precisely when this day started to be celebrated, it was probably during the reign of the [[Empress Suiko]] (593&amp;ndash;628 A.D.). In [[Japan]], ''Tango no Sekku'' was assigned to the fifth day of the fifth month after the [[Nara period]].

Until recently, ''Tango no Sekku'' was known as '''Boys' Day''' (also known as '''Feast of Banners''') while Girls' Day (''[[Hinamatsuri]]'') was celebrated on March 3. In 1948, the government decreed this day to be a national holiday to celebrate the happiness of all children and to express gratitude toward mothers. It was renamed ''[[Kodomo no Hi]]'' (Children's Day) and changed to include both boys and girls.

Before this day, families raise the [[carp]]-shaped ''[[koinobori]]'' flags (carp because of the Chinese legend that a carp that swims upstream becomes a dragon, and the way the flags blow in the wind looks like they are swimming), one for each boy (or child), display a [[Kintarō]] [[Japanese traditional dolls|doll]] usually riding on a large carp, and the traditional Japanese military helmet, ''[[kabuto]]''. Kintarō and the ''kabuto'' are symbols of a strong and healthy boy.

{{nihongo|Kintarō|金太郎}} is the childhood name of ''Sakata no Kintoki'' who was a hero in the [[Heian period]], a subordinate samurai of [[Yorimitsu Minamoto|Minamoto no Raikou]], having been famous for his strength when he was a child. It is said that Kintarō rode a [[bear]], instead of a [[horse]], and played with animals in the mountains when he was a young boy.

''[[Mochi]]'' rice cakes wrapped in ''kashiwa'' ([[oak]]) leaves&amp;mdash;''kashiwa-mochi'' (''mochi'' filled with [[red bean paste|red bean jam]]) and ''chimaki'' (a kind of "sweet rice paste", wrapped in an iris or bamboo leaf)&amp;mdash;are traditionally served on this day.

'''''Tornrak''''' is the third [[opera]] by [[Wales|Welsh]] composer [[John Metcalf (composer)|John Metcalf]]. It has an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Michael Wilcox]] with [[Inuktitut]] sections translated by Blendina Makkik.&lt;ref name =Genesis /&gt; Set between the worlds of the Canadian [[Arctic]] and Victorian Britain, it features [[Inuit throat singing]] and other [[Vocal extended technique|extended vocal techniques]] that give the Arctic scenes a distinct character. The opera was composed between 1986 and 1990 when Metcalf was working in Canada. It was first staged in 1990 in a co-production by the [[Banff Centre]], where Metcalf worked, and the [[Welsh National Opera]] who had commissioned the work.

==Composition==
Although [[Welsh National Opera]] (WNO) had first discussed with Metcalf the possibility of his writing a second opera, after ''The Journey'', for them in 1981,&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;Mark Morris "The Genesis of Tornrak" in Simon Rees (ed.) ''Tornrak'' programme, Welsh National Opera, 1990, pp.19–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Composer profile, p.38 of WNO programme.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 1986 that  [[Brian McMaster]], the company's then managing director, first brought the composer and librettist together.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt;  After Wilcox had initially started work on another idea, Metcalf contacted him about the true story of a 19th-century [[Inuit]] girl, Milak, who rescued a British sailor, Arthur. Like the character in the opera, the true Milak was shown as a [[circus freak]]; unlike her, she returned home.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;Michael Wilcox "Writing the libretto" in Simon Rees (ed.) ''Tornrak'' programme, Welsh National Opera 1990, pp.17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of ''Tornrak'' was greatly influenced by Metcalf's move to Canada later in 1986 to teach on the Music Theatre course at the [[Banff Centre]] in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;  He subsequently became Artistic Director of the programme and Composer-in-Residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/theatre/history/opera/production_1996B/biographies.asp#metcalf Biography of Metcalf for ''Kafka's Chimp''], Banff Centre website, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilcox visited Metcalf in Canada that winter to work on the first draft of the libretto and used the library facilities there to learn about Inuit traditions and mythology.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt; Metcalf too found that the setting enabled him to portray their subject in a more genuine manner. "If I wasn't in the North itself, at least I could now be in contact with a way of looking at the world, the culture, the music, and the language of the Inuit that would have been absolutely impossible in Wales."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Morris "The Genesis of ''Tornrak''" p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 onwards, Metcalf tried out sections of the developing opera in workshops at Banff. Such support for new compositions were an important facet of the programme there.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt; He also had ready access to experienced colleagues such as Keith Turnbull, the Assistant Director on the course, and Richard E. Armstrong who had worked with [[Roy Hart]]. Just as [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] had composed ''[[Eight Songs for a Mad King]]'' with Hart's unusual voice and extended vocal techniques in mind, so Metcalf was able to compose ''Tornrak'' knowing that Armstrong would participate in the opera and also coach the other performers. Armstrong's repertoire of unusual sounds were used in the writing for the spirits and animals. The Inuit parts also required techniques new to Western singers. Fides Krucker, who played the part of Milak in Banff, visited [[Iqaluit]] in 1989 and 1990. There she learnt the [[Inuit throat singing]] techniques which she used in her performances and on which she advised Metcalf.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

Wilcox encouraged Metcalf to make any changes to the libretto that he needed. He himself revisited Banff again to update the text.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt; Even when he was in Britain, he would respond to urgent phone calls to make changes during the workshops.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt; One of the most significant of the changes to the libretto was the decision to translate much of the first act from English into Inuktitut. Differences in stress patterns between the two languages meant that Metcalf recomposed vocal lines, moving material initially intended to be sung into the orchestral parts.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

Meanwhile, WNO had agreed to a change in the scale of ''Tornrak''. Instead of it being a [[chamber opera]] using just ten singers to be performed in small venues in Wales, it would now use a larger cast including a chorus and be staged in the large venues normally used by the full company. While those who were involved in the project were sure that the final work was stronger than it would have otherwise been, the many changes resulted in severe delays to the opera's completion and led to repeated postponements of the first performance.&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt;

==Performance history==
''Tornrak'' was given a "World Preview Performance", without a chorus, in workshops in Banff on 23 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmetcalf.co.uk/works.php?name=Tornrak&amp;id=9 "Tornrak"] details at composer's website. Viewed 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpanda.org/pdfs/csob/csob/2904.pdf] Vol.29 No.4, ''Central Opera Service Bulletin'' Fall/Winter 1989–1990  p.15, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a co-production with Welsh National Opera with scenery, props and costumes being shared.&lt;ref&gt;WNO programme pp.1&amp;3&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance by WNO was on 19 May 1990 at the [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|New Theatre, Cardiff]], two years later than originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rees (ed.) "Tornrak" programme, Welsh National Opera 1990, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpanda.org/pdfs/csob/csob/2801-2.pdf "New Operas and Premieres"] in ''Central Opera Service Bulletin'' Vol.28 Nos. 1&amp;2, Fall/Winter 1987–1988, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; This first Welsh performance, with chorus, is often listed as the official première.&lt;ref name=Boyd /&gt; A second performance in Cardiff later that month was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/t/to/tornrak.html Broadcast details], Radio listings. Accessed 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The production was toured to six English cities during June and July.&lt;ref&gt;WNO programme book p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The first act is based on an ascending scale running from C through F to C again using the five black notes; the second act uses a descending scale, again based on C but this time using all white notes taken from the [[major scale]] with the exception of the [[augmented fourth|sharpened F]] ([[eleventh harmonic]]).&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

While the opera is representative of the composer's early musical style,&lt;ref name=Groveonline /&gt; it also advances it.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; The music is multi-layered and rhythmically complex, much of it using middle colours including woodwind and tuned percussion. In Metcalf's first opera, ''The Journey'', solo instruments, usually high pitched, reacted to the voices; ''Tornrak'' makes only occasional use of solo violin or the upper registers of the piano. Extreme colours and registers serve to increase the contrasts already present in earlier works.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

On the non-musical level, too, ''Tornrak'' develops ideas seen in the composer's earlier works. Metcalf's sometime collaborator, the writer Mark Morris, notes that Metcalf's first two operas and his [[cantata]] ''The Boundaries of Time'' had already considered such themes as the clash of cultures, the alienation of individuals from their surroundings, the attempts of humanity to communicate with Nature and the displacement of individuals from their homelands.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;"Tornrak" in programme for the WNO production pp.13–15&lt;/ref&gt; These all appear in his third opera. ''Tornrak'' presents the theme of clashing cultures most strongly in two crowd scenes musically distinct from the balance of the score: in the fair and court scenes, the music is vertical, reflecting the clash in values between those present, whereas in most of the opera each layer has its own momentum and the music develops horizontally, representing individual destinies that largely develop autonomously.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

The score is remarkable for its incorporation of [[Inuit throat singing]] and other extended vocal techniques, establishing distinct sound worlds for the scenes set in the Arctic and those set in Victorian Britain.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Malcolm Boyd (1999) "Metcalf, John" in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', version dated 25/01/99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Groveonline&gt;Geraint Lewis, "Metcalf, John", Grove Music Online, accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous singers took part in the workshops in Banff and also travelled to Wales to train the WNO cast.&lt;ref&gt;Geraint Lewis (2005) Sleevenotes to ''John Metcalf: Mapping Wales, Plain Chants, Cello Symphony'' Nimbus Records, NI 5746.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not uncommon for opera to mix different national music styles when portraying clashes between cultures, ''Tornrak'' stands out because both Inuit music and its singing techniques are foreign to the Western musical tradition.&lt;ref name=Genesis /&gt;

==Reception==
The North American performances won the 1991 National Opera Association Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/bsaf/2004/history/#80_90 "Festival History"], Banff Centre site, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Best New Opera award from [[Opera America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=265&amp;facId=72&amp;p=member Profile of Richard Armstrong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306055926/http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=265&amp;facId=72&amp;p=member |date=6 March 2012 }}, Banff Centre, Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The production team, led by Mike Ashman, won praise for its creativity with the limited resources available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Millington]] "Ashman, Mike" in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the Welsh premiere, [[Rodney Milnes]] described ''Tornrak'' as "[a]n absorbing, thought-provoking and very approachable new opera" and as more successful than Metcalf's first opera ''The Journey''. Milnes particularly praises the economy of writing in both the libretto and the score.&lt;ref&gt;Milnes, Rodney "Arts: Tornrak : New Theatre, Cardiff", ''[[Financial Times]]'', Monday, 21 May 1990, p.13.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
1850, a British naval survey ship, the ''Endeavour'', is in the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;The synopsis is derived from that in the programme to the 1990 WNO production edited by Simon Rees pp.4–6, supplemented with the English version of the Inuktitut parts of the text on pp.7–10 and comments by the librettist on pp.17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; After being told by the Mate that Arthur Nesbit, a sailor from [[North Shields]], has been behaving in a disruptive manner, the Captain asks him to explain his conduct. The rest of Act I and most of Act II is told in flashback.

1845, the ''Enterprise'', a sister ship of ''Endeavour'', has foundered in the Arctic. Arthur and three others escape into the ice. One of them, Kellett, kills Collinson, a young officer, after they argue over some valuables. Kellett and the last sailor Billy escape without Arthur who is saved from starvation only when he sees a polar bear taking meat from its hidden store. Arthur dreams of returning home and of the rich life he would afford with the valuables. An apparition warns him that he needs to survive first.

Milak, a young [[Inuit|Inuk]], arrives led by her ''[[Inuit_mythology#Tuurngait|tornrak]]'', or spirit guide, that takes the form of an owl. She knows of the bear's meat cache and intends to raid it. The ''tornrak'' abandons her when she notices signs of Arthur's presence. Milak wonders whether it has led her into a trap. Arthur, in turn, thinks she has come to steal from him. 

The bear returns and the two humans fight it. The spirits of Inuit hunters sing that the bear's time has come and Arthur strikes the killing blow. Milak throat-sings with the dying animal and frees its ''tornrak'' by skinning it. She gives Arthur the pelt. She leads him towards her village which has been devastated by disease caught from the British. On the way she persuades him to leave behind the valuables that have been slowing him down, but she decides to keep the "Great White Bird flying with many wings", a [[Impossible bottle|ship in a bottle]] that reminds her of her ''tornrak''.

When they return to the village, only Milak's father Utak is still alive. Expecting death, he tears off his clothing and calls his ''tornrak''. It kills him as payment for all the help it has given him since childhood, leaving his bones unburied and his spirit to wander.

During the Winter, Arthur and Milak learn bits of each other's languages. In the Spring, they are discovered by a British ship which has come to trade with the village. The explorer Sir Charles Keighley decides to take Milak to Britain to help with his research. She agrees because she thinks the ship is her ''tornrak''.

===Act II===
Sir Charles has given the last of his lectures on the Arctic and is thanked by Lady Delisle at her home. Now he has finished with Milak, he tells Arthur to look after her.

Arthur and Milak, "The Wild Savage of the Frozen North", join a [[Traveling carnival|travelling fair]] in Wales where she is shown to members of the public in a cage. The spectators find her performance frightening. Another member of the fair, a bearkeeper, tries to rape her. Although she escapes him, she is locked in her cage. She persuades the bear to break open the cage and then escape. The crowd are frightened by it and a constable shoots it despite the bearkeeper's pleas. Both he and Arthur find themselves without exhibits.

Milak survives in the country by catching animals such as rabbits and sheep. A molecatcher warns her that she could be hanged for theft. She moves to an industrial town where she becomes a prostitute. She meets Arthur again who tries to persuade her to return to the Arctic but she thinks this is now impossible as she has become Westernised and cut off from Nature. The two are recognised by the bearkeeper who has Milak arrested as the wild woman who has been reported to be stealing sheep. The Judge sentences her to hang despite protests from Arthur and the spectators that she had no other option.

Back on the ''Endeavour'', Arthur has finished his narration. The Captain leaves him in charge of the helm. Arthur tears off his clothes and calls to Milak's spirit in the hope that the ship will be sunk and the Inuit protected from the dangers its crew bring. In a squall, Milak's ''tornrak'' arrives, once more in the form of an owl. 

Arthur is found dead and frozen to the wheel. Only the Mate is willing to obey the Captain and remove the body. When he throws the corpse overboard, the squall stops and the ship is suddenly becalmed. There is no reading on the compass.

In 1936, [[Republic Studios]] announced plans to make a version of the film starring [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] and produced by Bert Clark.&lt;ref&gt;James Dunn Going to Sea in Classic Story, "Two Years Before the Mast": Other Players Cast in Important Roles Ernst Lubitsch Begins Organization of His Film Unit; Virginia Bruce to Appear in "Born to Dance; Young Going Abroad

Republic never made the movie. [[Edward Small]] announced plans to film the book in 1939 under his deal with [[United Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;"Marshall Will Play in 'My Son, My Son': Europe Lures Notables Students Belittle Stars Tommy Kelly Assigned Ann Sheridan's New Role" Schallert, Edwin.

Paramount eventually bought the rights off Small in 1943, including a script Seton I Miller had written for the producer in 1939; Miller had since become a writer and producer at Paramount. [[Alan Ladd]] was announced as star.&lt;ref&gt;"SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Paramount to Film 'Two Years Before Mast' -- 2 Broadway Openings This Week" Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.. ''New York Times'' (1923-Current file) 06 Dec 1943: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Production===
In March 1944 it was announced Ladd would be re-inducted into the army but that this would be delayed so he could make ''Mast''.&lt;ref&gt;SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Paramount Plans a Remake of 'The Virginian' -- Two New Films Open Here Today

Brian Donlevy was originally going to play the sadistic captain but was given the role of Dana instead. Howard da Silva, who had just achieved fame playing Judd in ''Oklahoma!'' on Broadway, played the captain.&lt;ref&gt;Astaire, Kelly Will Vie in 'Ziegfeld' Number Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 11 Apr 1944: A10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican film star [[Esther Fernandez]] had been signed to Paramount for two years without making a film. John Farrow watched some test footage she made and was impressed; she was brought back to play the female lead.&lt;ref&gt;SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Esther Fernandez, Mexican Star, Gets Romantic Lead -- German War Films Here

Due to war time restrictions - notably lack of transport - Paramount had endured many logistical difficulties filming the pirate movie ''[[Frenchman's Creek (film)|Frenchman's Creek]]'' on location. This prompted them to decide to shoot ''Two Years Before the Mast'' entirely within the confines of the studio. Seascapes and soundscapes from Paramount's ''[[Souls at Sea]]'' (1937) were re-used.&lt;ref&gt;A BELATED TRIBUTE TO G.I.

The film heavily dramatised the novel but attempted to be faithful. "Dana's tale is so well known that we shall have to stay close to the line of his yarn," said John Farrow, "Especially in the characters."&lt;ref name="two"&gt;'ROUND THE HORN ON A HOLLYWOOD SET: Synthetic Seas and Painted Cities Frame a Saga Of Sailing Days By IDWAL JONES HOLLYWOOD..

===Shooting===
Filming began in May 1944 and took 69 days.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; "We could do it in less but we've got to allow stubble to grow," said Farrow. "Chins have got to grow over with gray plush. May cost a hundred thousand. Depends on how long it takes those chins to sprout. But meantime, we can be shooting storms and Miss Fernandez."&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

[[Alan Ladd]] injured his back during filming and had to miss a week of shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69187442 |title=ACTORS ATTEND SCHOOL OF SEAMANSHIP. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=22 October 1948 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was shot on three studio sound stages. Four stage were combined into one, for the interiors. There was another stage holding the water tank. Two models of the ship were built at a total cost of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ships, Sea Improvised in Dana Film Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 25 June 1944: C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was not released until late 1946, after the release of several films Ladd made subsequent to ''Mast'': ''[[Salty O'Rourke]]'', ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' and ''[[O.S.S. (film)|O.S.S.]]''. This also meant that Barry Fitzgerald, who became a star in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944) while the film was waiting for release, was upped to above the title billing.

===Box office===
''Two Years Before the Mast'' was one of the most popular films released in the US that year, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describing it as "a phenomenal hit".&lt;ref&gt;Bing Will Harmonize With Andrews Sisters Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 09 Dec 1946: A2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Variety'' listed it as the tenth most popular movie of 1946.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt;

Studio Artists are either about to finish their undergraduate study or have just begun work on a graduate degree. They sing ensemble and small roles in WTOC productions and present a staged scenes program.

From a pool of over 1,000 singers, typically 400-500 are chosen to audition.  From that group 15-20 are selected as Filene Young Artists and 12-16 are selected as Studio Artists.

The company typically presents three operas at the Filene Center and/or The Barns at Wolf Trap.  In addition, recitals and other performances take place.  In 2010 the company presented ''[[Zaide]]'', ''[[Il Turco in Italia]]'', and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The 2012 season included [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at The Barns. The 2013 season opened with [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'', followed by [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">'''Zecchino d'Oro''' ({{IPA-it|dzekˈkiːno ˈdɔːro; tsek-}}; meaning "Golden [[Sequin (coin)|Sequin]]") is an international children's song festival that has taken place every year since 1959. It is broadcast by [[Rai 1]].

It was started by [[Cino Tortorella]], and the first two festivals were held in [[Milan]]. In 1961, the festival was taken up by the [[Antoniano Institute]] and moved to [[Bologna]]. In 2009, Cino Tortorella left Zecchino d'Oro.

In 1963, [[Mariele Ventre]], a conductor and director of young performers, created the [[Piccolo Coro dell'Antoniano]] Children's Choir (called Piccolo Coro "Mariele Ventre" dell'Antoniano after her death in 1995, and directed by [[Sabrina Simoni]]).
From 1976 the festival took on an international perspective - each year seven Italian songs and seven foreign songs are sung by children and voted for by a children's jury. The winning song is rewarded with the Zecchino d'Oro award.

As has been regularly stated during the event, the winners of the Zecchino d'Oro and Zecchino d'Argento are the writers and composers of the songs, not the children who interpret them. This rule applies to all editions.

Younger songwriters are Yumiko Ashikawa (芦川祐美子, 7, who also has sung her song), Miruna Codruța Oprea (13), Ioachim Octavian Petre (13) and Lara Polli (13).
