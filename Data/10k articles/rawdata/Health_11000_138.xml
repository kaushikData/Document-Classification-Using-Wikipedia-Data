'''AIDS Walk Boston''' is a [[walkathon|walkathon fundraiser]] hosted annually in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] to benefit [[AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts]] (AAC), [[New England|New England's]] oldest and largest [[not-for-profit]] AIDS service organization.&lt;ref&gt;AEGiS, {{cite web|url=http://www.aegis.com/countries/us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008082204/http://www.aegis.com/countries/us.html |archivedate=2009-10-08 |df= }} 02 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts|AAC]]'s mission is to stop the epidemic by preventing new [[HIV/AIDS]] infections and optimizing the health of those already infected.

==About==

===Event===
AIDS Walk Boston is always held on the first Sunday in June. It begins and ends at the [[Hatch Shell|DCR Hatch Shell]] on the Charles River Esplanade, with the actual route following a 10K path through the cities of [[Boston]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].

Concurrent with the Walk is the [[Larry Kessler 5K Run]], a 5K race along the banks of the [[Charles River]]. Awards are given out to the winners of each age group.

Upon completion of the Walk, participants are welcomed back to the [[Hatch Shell|DCR Hatch Shell]] with the Wellness Festival, a celebration of healthy living.

===Online Community===
AIDS Walk Boston has an online community to connect and communicate with participants in a variety of different ways.

===Volunteering===
AIDS Walk Boston relies on the help of hundreds of volunteers. These volunteers perform a number of different duties, such as handing out snacks and refreshments, taking pictures, and directing walkers along the route, to help serve over 10,000 participants for AIDS Walk Boston and the [[Larry Kessler 5K Run]] every year.

===Fundraising===
Fundraising is the central focus of AIDS Walk Boston.  Participants are encouraged to engage in peer-to-peer fundraising, and are given many different tools to do so, including a personal fundraising page and a Facebook fundraising application.  AIDS Walk Boston also works with corporate sponsors who support the programs and services of [[AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts|AAC]] and form teams to do fundraising of their own.

==History==
AIDS Walk Boston was started in 1986 as a grassroots community event.  AIDS Walk Boston 2010 will be the 25th annual Walk, and it will be held on June 6, 2010.

The '''Babhali project / barrage''' is a controversial reservoir project being constructed by [[Maharashtra]] across the river [[Godavari]], disputed by [[Andhra Pradesh|Telangana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/10/stories/2008121055100600.htm www.hindu.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] delivered a ruling after seven years in favour of Maharashtra with the Andhra Pradesh government expected to appeal against it.&lt;ref&gt;http://newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/article1483064.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dispute arises from the fact that [[S.B. Chavan]] and [[Jalagam Vengal Rao]] reached an agreement in October 1975, which was later made part of the [[Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal]] (GWDT) Award.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/58795771/Godavari-Water-Dispute-Tribunal-Report "GODAVARI RIVER WATER SHARING ACCORD"&lt;/ref&gt; As per the terms of the pact, Maharashtra could utilise 60 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) of Godavari water while Andhra Pradesh could go ahead with building the [[Sriram Sagar]] Project (SRSP) and utilise the rest of the water.

==Water Allocation==
Andhra Pradesh contended that Maharashtra has used up its quota in course of time by building four projects. Yet, in an action without precedent, Maharashtra began construction of the Babli project on the foreshores of SRSP and 13 other small projects upstream.

Eighteen [[lakh]] acres under the SRSP ayacut in the [[Telangana]] region will become barren if Maharashtra is allowed to have its way.

==Legal battle==
As per a report,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtoearth.org.in/category/thesaurus/babli-project&lt;/ref&gt; dated 30 Jan 2012 even when Andhra Pradesh is waging a legal battle against Maharashtra’s Babli barrage and eleven other barrages across the Godavari river, Maharashtra has agreed to Andhra Pradesh's proposal for constituting an Inter State Board (ISB) for implementing the Rs 403&amp;nbsp;billion mega [[Pranahita Chevella lift irrigation scheme]]. With this green signal, Andhra Pradesh has overcome a major hurdle in making its dream project a reality.

==2013 Supreme Court ruling==
The Supreme Court ruled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/160288133/|title= Supreme Court verdict on Babhali project dispute |date=February 2013|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of Maharashtra, with safeguards contained in the judgment included the stipulation to open Babli gates during the monsoon period (July to October ) to allow inflows to SRSP. The Union Cabinet on 17 October 2013 gave its approval for Constitution of the 3-Members Supervisory Committee on the Babhali Barrage to implement the directions of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/babli-verdict-andhra-pradesh-to-le-review-petition-in-sc-if-farmers-suffer-loss/article4467281.ece?homepage=true&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6136">'''Bioaccumulation''' is the accumulation of substances, such as [[pesticides]], or other chemicals in an organism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost by [[catabolism]] and [[excretion]]. Thus, the longer the [[biological half-life]] of a [[Toxin|toxic substance]], the greater the risk of chronic [[poisoning]], even if [[Measured environmental concentration|environmental level]]s of the toxin are not very high.&lt;ref&gt;Bioaccumulation of Marine Pollutants [and Discussion], by G. W. Bryan, M. Waldichuk, R. J. Pentreath and Ann Darracott Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaccumulation, for example in [[fish]], can be predicted by models.&lt;ref&gt;Stadnicka, J; Schirmer, K; Ashauer, R (2012). Predicting Concentrations of Organic Chemicals in Fish by Using Toxicokinetic Models. Environ. Sci. Technol. {{DOI|10.1021/es2043728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otero-Muras, I; Franco-Uria, A; Alonso, A A; Balsa-Canto, E (2010). Dynamic multi-compartmental modelling of metal bioaccumulation in fish.

[[Bioconcentration]] is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=|date=|title=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F1-4020-4494-1_31|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.

[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.

Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as "[[red tide]]s" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.

Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.
Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.
Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of [[Vitamin A]], which becomes concentrated in [[carnivore]] [[liver]]s of e.g. [[polar bear]]s: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of Vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic [[explorer]]s have suffered [[Hypervitaminosis A]] from eating the bear livers (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of [[Xavier Mertz|Antarctic explorers]] eating [[husky]] [[dog]] livers).  One notable example of this is the expedition of [[Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.

[[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic puffin]]) are often monitored for [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] bioaccumulation.

In some eutrophic aquatic systems, [[biodilution]] can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to "dilute" the concentration of the pollutant.

'''Cannabis in Romania''' is illegal for recreational use and allowed in only limited form for medical use.

Some of the earliest evidence of the psychoactive use of cannabis have been found in Romania, including the archaeological sites of [[Frumușica, Botoșani|Frumușica]] and [[Gurbănești]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Clarke, Mark D. Merlin. ''Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany''. University of California Press, 2013. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibition==
In 1928 Romania established laws for countering narcotics, including hashish and its preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu//html.cfm//index5174EN.html?# |title=EMCDDA &amp;#124; Country legal profiles |publisher=Emcdda.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical cannabis==
A limited medical cannabis law was passed in 2013 allowing for the use of low-[[THC]] (below 0.2%) derivatives of the plant only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romania Legalizes Medical Marijuana, Becomes 10th EU Country To Permit Theraputic Use|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=154315|accessdate=14 October 2013|newspaper=Novinite|date=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gates |first1=Sara |title=Romania To Allow Medicinal Use Of Marijuana Derivatives, But Drug Remains Illegal |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/05/romania-medical-marijuana-legal_n_4049658.html |accessdate=24 August 2018 |work=HuffPost |date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medical Marijuana in Romania |url=https://www.marijuanadoctors.com/international-patients/romania/ |website=marijuanadoctors.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Toea |first1=Diana |title=Marijuana medicinala e legala in Romania.

'''DISC''' is a [[behavior]] assessment tool based on the DISC theory of psychologist [[William Moulton Marston]], which centers on four different personality traits which are currently Dominance (D), Influence (I), Steadiness (S), and Conscientiousness (C). This theory was then developed into a behavioral assessment tool by [[industrial psychologist]] Walter Vernon Clarke.

== History ==
Marston was a lawyer and a psychologist; he also contributed to the first [[polygraph]] test, authored [[self-help]] books and created the character [[Wonder Woman]]. His major contribution to psychology came when he generated the DISC characteristics of emotions and behavior of normal people (at the time, 'normal' had the meaning of 'typical' rather than an antonym for 'abnormal'). Marston, after conducting research on human emotions, published his findings in his 1928 book called ''Emotions of Normal People'' in which he explained that people illustrate their emotions using four behavior types: Dominance (D), Inducement (I), Submission (S), and Compliance (C). He argued that these behavioral types came from people's sense of self and their interaction with the environment.&lt;ref name="Emotions of Normal People"&gt;{{cite book |last= Marston |first= William M. |title= Emotions of Normal People |year= 1928 |publisher= K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co. Ltd |pages= 405 |url= https://archive.org/details/emotionsofnormal032195mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included two dimensions that influenced people's emotional behavior. The first dimension is whether a person views his environment as favorable or unfavorable. The second dimension is whether a person perceives himself as having control or lack of control over his environment. 

Although Marston contributed to the creation of the DISC assessment, he did not create it. In 1956, Walter Clarke, an industrial psychologist, constructed the DISC assessment using Marston's theory of the DISC model. He did this by publishing the Activity Vector Analysis, a checklist of adjectives on which he asked people to indicate descriptions that were accurate about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace &amp; Clarke|first=|date=September 1956|title=The Activity Vector Analysis as a Selector of Life Insurance Salesmen|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1956.tb01072.x|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=9|pages=337-345|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was intended for use in businesses needing assistance in choosing qualified employees.

In 1965, Merenda, Peter F. and Clarke published their findings on a new instrument in the "Journal of Clinical Psychology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merenda|first=Peter F.|date=January 1965|title=Self description and personality measurement|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-4679(196501)21:1&lt;52::AID-JCLP2270210115&gt;3.0.CO;2-K|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=21|pages=52-56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using a checklist, this "Self Description" test forced respondents to make a choice between two or more terms. Factor analysis of this assessment added to the support of a DISC-based instrument. "Self Description" was used by [[John Geier]] to create the original Personal Profile System in the 1970s. 

DISC has been used to help determine a course of action when dealing with problems as a leadership team—that is, taking the various aspects of each type into account when solving problems or assigning jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Beamish, G. (2005). How chief executives learn and what behavior factors distinguish them from other people. Industrial and Commercial Training, 37(3), 138–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">'''Disease surveillance''' is an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] practice by which the spread of [[disease]] is monitored in order to establish patterns of progression. The main role of disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by [[outbreak]], [[epidemic]], and [[pandemic]] situations, as well as increase knowledge about which factors contribute to such circumstances. A key part of modern disease surveillance is the practice of '''disease case reporting'''.

In modern times, reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping, to instant worldwide internet communication.

The number of cases could be gathered from hospitals - which would be expected to see most of the occurrences - collated, and eventually made public. With the advent of modern [[communication technology]], this has changed dramatically. Organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) now can report cases and deaths from significant diseases within days - sometimes within hours - of the occurrence. Further, there is considerable public pressure to make this information available quickly and accurately. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mandatory reporting==
Formal reporting of [[Notifiable disease|notifiable]] infectious diseases is a requirement placed upon health care providers by many regional and national governments, and upon national governments by the [[World Health Organization]] to monitor spread as a result of the [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of infectious agents. Since 1969, WHO has required that all cases of the following diseases be reported to the organization: [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], [[relapsing fever]] and [[typhus]]. In 2005, the list was extended to include [[polio]] and [[SARS]].  Regional and national governments typically monitor a larger set of (around 80 in the U.S.) communicable diseases that can potentially threaten the general population. [[Tuberculosis]], [[HIV]], [[botulism]], [[hantavirus]], [[anthrax]], and [[rabies]] are examples of such diseases. The incidence counts of diseases are often used as [[health indicators]] to describe the overall health of a population.

==World Health Organization==

The [[World Health Organization]] is the lead agency for coordinating global response to major diseases. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] maintains Web sites for a number of diseases, and has active teams in many countries where these diseases occur.

During the [[SARS]] outbreak in early 2004, for example, the [[Beijing]] staff of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] produced updates every few days for the duration of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/index.html WHO SARS]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in January 2004, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] has produced similar updates for [[H5N1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/ WHO H5N1]&lt;/ref&gt; These results are [[Global spread of H5N1|widely reported]] and closely watched.

[[WHO]]'s Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) to detect, verify rapidly and respond appropriately to epidemic-prone and emerging disease threats covers the following diseases:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/en/ WHO EPR]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anthrax]]
*[[Avian influenza]]
*[[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]]
*[[Dengue hemorrhagic fever]]
*[[Ebola virus disease]]
*[[Hepatitis]]
*[[Influenza]]
*[[Lassa fever]]
*[[Marburg virus|Marburg hemorrhagic fever]]
*[[Meningococcal disease]]
*[[Bubonic plague|Plague]]
*[[Rift Valley fever]]
*[[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]]
*[[Smallpox]]
*[[Tularaemia]]
*[[Yellow fever]]

==Political challenges==
As the lead organization in global public health, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] occupies a delicate role in [[global politics]]. It must maintain good relationships with each of the many countries in which it is active. As a result, it may only report results within a particular country with the agreement of the country's government. Because some governments regard the release of ''any'' information on disease outbreaks as a state secret, this can place the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] in a difficult position.

The WHO coordinated ''International Outbreak Alert and Response'' is designed to ensure "outbreaks of potential international importance are rapidly verified and information is quickly shared within the Network" but not necessarily by the public; integrate and coordinate "activities to support national efforts" rather than challenge national authority within that nation in order to "respect the independence and objectivity of all partners". The commitment that "All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/guidingprinciples/en/index.html WHO Outbreak Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical challenges==
Testing for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of [[antibodies]] that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by [[H5N1|Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)]]. Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.

There is currently little available data on the spread of [[H5N1]] in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include:
* Surveillance of wild bird populations
* Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases

==H5N1==
Surveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.

H5N1 in China is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases have excluded China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf WHO]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000000/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf |date=July 27, 2011 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html WHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213164120/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html |date=2006-02-13 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_27a/en/index.html WHO] [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ WHO]&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Disease surveillance in China]].)

"Only half the world's human bird flu cases are being reported to the World Health Organization within two weeks of being detected, a response time that must be improved to avert a pandemic, a senior WHO official said Saturday. Shigeru Omi, WHO's regional director for the Western Pacific, said it is estimated that countries would have only two to three weeks to stamp out, or at least slow, a pandemic flu strain after it began spreading in humans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=1931433 ABC News] from AP published May 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Nabarro]], chief avian flu coordinator for the [[United Nations]], says avian flu has too many unanswered questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/27/news/worrier.php NYT article picked up by IHT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IISD&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/ymb/ais/ymbvol123num1e.html  International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)] ''Scientific Seminar on Avian Influenza, the Environment and Migratory Birds on  10–11 April 2006'' published 14 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CIDRAP]] reported on August 25, 2006 on a [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928222400/http://wildlifedisease.nbii.gov/ai/ new US government Web site] that allows the public to view current information about testing of wild birds for H5N1 avian influenza which is part of a national wild-bird surveillance plan that "includes five strategies for early detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Sample numbers from three of these will be available on HEDDS: live wild birds, subsistence hunter-killed birds, and investigations of sick and dead wild birds. The other two strategies involve domestic bird testing and environmental sampling of water and wild-bird droppings. [...] A map on the new USGS site shows that 9,327 birds from Alaska have been tested so far this year, with only a few from most other states.  Last year officials tested just 721 birds from Alaska and none from most other states, another map shows. The goal of the surveillance program for 2006 is to collect 75,000 to 100,000 samples from wild birds and 50,000 environmental samples, officials have said."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/aug2506wildbirds.html CIDRAP News] article ''New Web tool tracks H5N1 testing of US wild birds'' published August 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dreem''' is a sleep device that monitors, analyzes, and claims to enhance quality of sleep. It's a miniaturized and autonomous headband that monitors the quality of sleep and then uses sound to help fall asleep faster, get deeper sleep, and wake up at the optimal time through smart alarm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techgyd.com/ultimate-sleep-solution/30845/|title=Ultimate Sleep Solution - Get Quicker &amp; Deeper Sleep Without Pills|date=10 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/dreem-sleep-wearable-news/|title=A better night’s sleep may not be a far-off dream with this sci-fi wearable|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sharpbrains.com/blog/2015/09/29/next-wearable-neurotechnologies-to-improve-sleep-and-circadian-rhythm-regulation/|title=Next: Wearable neurotechnologies to improve sleep and circadian rhythm regulation|date=29 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/15/dreem-machine-rythm-raises-11-million-and-launches-its-500-sleep-tracking-headband/|title=Dreem machine: Rythm raises $11 million and launches $500 sleep-monitoring headband - VentureBeat|website=venturebeat.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreem is a headband that collects, reports data and also claims to enhance the user's behavior in real-time according to the data collected. The sensors include EEG electrodes, accelerometer and pulse oximeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/26/15874698/yves-behar-dreem-headband-help-sleep-rhythm|title=Yves Béhar designed a headband to help you sleep|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/rythm-dreem/preview//|title=Rythm Dreem claims to be the first active wearable device to improve sleep quality|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rythm, manufacturer of Dreem, was launched in 2014. $11 million were raised from private investors and public grants the same year to pursue the manufacturing of sleep-improving neurotechnology device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/29/rythm-raises-11m-to-pursue-sleep-improving-neurotechnology/|title=Rythm raises $11M to pursue sleep-improving&amp;nbsp;neurotechnology|first=Devin|last=Coldewey|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017, a total of $22 million were raised by Rythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/rythms-sleep-tracking-wearable-makes-official-debut|title=Rythm's sleep-tracking wearable makes official debut|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version 2 of the Dreem headband was released in June 2017 on pre order after practicing tests with a first beta version on 500 users at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sleeptrackers.io/qa-dreem-active-eeg-sleep-wearable/|title=Meet Dreem, a 'neurotechnology' wearable to improve your sleep - Best Sleep Trackers 2017|date=20 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims that more than 50 engineers worked on the second version, collaborating with famous neuroscientists such as Emmanuel Mignot, Christoph Koch, David Eagleman. The device was designed by Yves Béhar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wareable.com/health-and-wellbeing/rythm-dreem-release-date-price-features-566|title=Rythm's Dreem headset is finally ready to help you sleep better|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleep quality==
The dry polymer EEG electrodes monitor the brain activity, and the bone-conducting audio devices transmit sound directly to the inner ear. The company claims that the device will improve the deep sleep by up to 32 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgetsandwearables.com/2016/07/07/dreem/|title=Dreem headband monitors brain activity to help you sleep|date=7 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headband comes with sensors in contact with the forehead and around the ears that keep track of a wearer's sleep stage by measuring brain activity. When the sensors detect a sleeper has entered into deep sleep, the headband turns on a frequency of sound called "pink noise" at a precise time that enhances the quality of deep sleep. The pink noise also helps the deep sleeper better transition to the dreamy REM (rapid eye movement) state that comes afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numerama.com/tech/267132-dreem-nous-avons-approche-la-version-finale-du-bandeau-qui-ameliore-le-sommeil.html|title=Dreem : nous avons approché la version finale du bandeau qui améliore le sommeil - Tech - Numerama|first=Julien|last=Cadot|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fonasa.jpg|thumb|upright|FONASA, the funding branch of the Ministry of Health.]]

'''Fondo Nacional de Salud''', also known as '''FONASA''', is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in [[Chile]]. It is funded by the public (7% of employees' monthly income).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chileclic.gob.cl/1481/article-46697.html |title=Certificado de afiliación a Fonasa |publisher=ChileClic |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 1979 by Decree Law No. 2763.

FONASA is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]. FONASA headquarters are in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FONASA |title=FONASA (@FONASA) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve million beneficiaries benefit from FONASA. It provides health benefits and health care by professionals and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonasa.cl |title=FONASA |publisher=Fonasa.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficiaries==

==Choice of care==
All beneficiaries are placed into four sections according to their income.

There are two types of care arrangements:

*Modality of Institutional Care: Delivered in public health facilities (clinics, rehabilitation centers and hospitals CDT).
*Free Choice Modality: Delivered by professional and private health facilities and who have signed an agreement with FONASA. Public hospitals are included in free choice modality if the recipient chooses their physician and/or are hospitalized in a private room.

A '''garnish''' is an item or substance used as a decoration or [[embellishment]] accompanying a prepared food [[Dish (food)|dish]] or [[drink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Garnish | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | date=May 27, 2017 | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/garnish | access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, it may give added or contrasting [[flavor]].  Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished.'

Many garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so.  [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.

==Overview==
A garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.&lt;ref name="Niz 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may, for example, enhance their color,&lt;ref name="Niz 2014"/&gt; such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entrée]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.

A garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].

'''Health food''' is food marketed to provide [[human health]] effects beyond a normal [[healthy diet]] required for [[human nutrition]]. Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as [[natural foods]], [[organic food]]s, [[whole food]]s,  [[Vegetarian food|vegetarian foods]] or [[dietary supplement]]s. These products may be sold in [[health food store]]s or in the health food or organic sections of [[grocery store]]s.

==Health claims== 
{{Main|Health claims on food labels}}
In the United States, [[health claim]]s on [[Nutrition facts label#United States|nutrition facts label]]s are regulated by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), while advertising is regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Several other countries provide regulations on food labeling to address the quality of possible health foods, such as Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's food guides|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-food-guides.html|publisher=Health Canada, Government of Canada|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Food Safety Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition and health claims|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/nutrition-and-health-claims|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FDA, "Health claims describe a relationship between a food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient, and reducing risk of a disease or health-related condition".&lt;ref name ="FDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm111447.htm|title=Claims That Can Be Made for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements|author= |date=September 2003|work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, claims of health benefits for specific foodstuffs are not supported by scientific evidence and are not evaluated by national regulatory agencies. Additionally, research funded by manufacturers or marketers has been criticized to result in more favorable results than those from independently funded research.&lt;ref name ="Slop"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040005

&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no precise definition for "health food", the [[FDA warning letter|FDA monitors and warns]] food manufacturers against labeling foods as having specific health effects when no evidence exists to support such statements, such as for one manufacturer in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edmundo Garcia Jr.|title=Warning letter: Carol Bond Health Foods|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm600398.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic food==
In conditions of [[malnutrition]], ready-to-use [[therapeutic food]]s have been used successfully to improve the health of malnourished children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23794237|year=2013|author1=Lazzerini|first1=M|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD009584|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''human milk bank''' is "a service which collects, screens, processes, and dispenses by prescription [[breast milk|human milk]] donated by [[breastfeeding|nursing]] mothers who are not biologically related to the recipient infant".&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2014, there are 18 [[Human-milk bank|milk banks]] in [[North America]] that are members of the Human Milk Bank Association of North America (HMBANA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hmbana.org/hmbana-about&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually housed in [[hospital]]s, although some are free standing. Members of HMBANA's follow the annually revised "Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of a Donor Human Milk Bank."  The guidelines were developed with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and include protocols for soliciting donors, collecting, processing and distributing the milk. Some of these protocols are described below.

According to a joint statement by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF): "The best food for a baby who cannot be breastfed is milk expressed from the mother's breast or from another healthy mother. The best food for any baby whose own mother's milk is not available is the breastmilk of another healthy mother" (UNICEF, p.&amp;nbsp;48). "Where it is not possible for the biological mother to breast feed, the first alternative, if available, should be the use of human milk from other sources. Human milk banks should be made available in appropriate situations" (Wight, 2001).

==History==
[[File:The Canadian nurse (1939) (14771396465).jpg|thumb|A 1930s breast pump in action on a hospital patient]]
''The Canadian Nurse'' described in 1939 how nurses at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Montreal Maternity Hospital]] travelled to Boston to learn from the successful programme at the Directory for Mother's Milk, Inc., set up by Dr Fritz Talbot. It was "a miniature dairy with all modern appliances". The quick freezing of fractions of an ounce of breastmilk had been perfected earlier that decade by researchers at Borden Labs. The women recruited were paid by the ounce, and visited daily by a nurse, as most would not have had refrigeration at home. The Maternity Hospital kept a stock of about 1000 frozen ounces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=Caroline V.|title=The Collection and Preservation of Breast Milk|journal=The canadian Nurse|date=1939|volume=35|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening donors==
Milk donors are new mothers who are in good health, whose [[infant]]s are growing, thriving, and under six months old when they begin (Arnold, 1997). Some milk banks accept milk from mothers whose baby is up to a year old. Women who have given their baby up for adoption, acted as a surrogate, or are a bereaved mother may also donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milkbankontario.ca/screening.html|title=Eligibility for Human Milk Donors|website=www.milkbankontario.ca|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is some risk of passing [[infection]]s and [[virus]]es to babies through [[breast milk]], donors must undergo a medical screening and a blood test to rule out infectious diseases such as [[HIV]]-1 and-2, [[hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] and [[syphilis]] (Arnold, 1997). After administering a verbal or written questionnaire, healthcare providers for the mother and her baby must sign statements confirming that both are in good health.

The mother must not [[tobacco smoking|smoke]] or regularly use any [[medication]]s, [[herb]]s, or [[Megavitamin therapy|megavitamins]]. If she or her baby has a [[common cold]], she should not express milk for donation until they have recovered. If she consumes [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], she must wait out an "exclusion period" of twelve hours before expressing milk for donation. For a premature or medically fragile recipient baby, even a tiny amount of alcohol, medications, or herbs in the milk may be problematic.

==Collection==

Methods of collection and types of containers used vary among milk banks. Donors are educated about hygienic milk expression and given containers in which to express their milk. Some milk banks have collection points where couriers pick up donations, some have mothers deliver the milk to the facility, and others ask women who live far away to freeze and ship their milk to the milk bank.

==Screening and processing milk==
In addition to careful screening of donors, each batch of milk is tested for [[bacteria]]l counts before [[pasteurization]]. Some milk banks pool milk before testing it, others test each mother's milk as it comes in before it is pooled.

Milk banks require [[Refrigerator|freezers]] and pasteurizers for processing milk. Most milk banks have two freezers, for unprocessed and processed milk. The HMBANA guidelines state that "all milk should be heat treated for 30 minutes at 62.5 °C. Heat treatment of milk occurs at 62.5°C for 30 minutes (Holder pasteurizing)" (Arnold, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;243). At the end of pasteurization, another sample of milk is tested to make sure the treatment was effective. Colony counts should be zero and no bacterial growth should be detected (Arnold, 1997). Containers for pasteurizing must be able to withstand heating and cooling without breakage or leaking. Most containers are recyclable, usually [[glass]] or [[plastic]].

==Distribution==
Donor milk is dispensed by [[medical prescription|prescription]] from the recipient's physician. Often, it is used within the hospital [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]] (NICU) for premature or critically ill babies. Sometimes, however, donor milk is shipped to recipients' homes. In these cases, it is frozen, packed in special containers, and shipped over night.

Breast milk content of mothers of premature babies differs from that of mothers of full term babies (Wight, 2001). Therefore, most milk banks separate "preemie milk" &amp;ndash; milk collected in the first 30 days after delivery of an infant less than 36 weeks gestation &amp;ndash; from "term milk."

==Costs==
The HMBANA Guidelines stipulate that donors not be paid for their milk. However, hospitals and recipients are required to cover some of the cost for collection, processing and distribution of milk which may be from $3.00 to $5.00 an ounce. This remains a much lower cost than pasteurized milk can be obtained otherwise. Community fundraising and grants also help milk banks meet expenses. The guidelines ensure that no one is denied donor milk for lack of ability to pay. For non-hospitalized recipients, the milk bank will often work with the family to obtain coverage for processing fees (Arnold, 1997). However, [[insurance company|insurance companies]] rarely cover donor milk, except under unusual circumstances (Griffith, 2002). In some states, and under some circumstances, [[Medicaid]] and [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children|WIC]] will cover the costs of using banked milk (Arnold, 1999, Wight, 2001).

When hospitals order banked milk for their NICUs it is often brought into the [[pharmacy]] and billed through the hospital. In these cases, insurance companies are much more likely to cover the processing fees than for outpatients (Arnold, 1997).

==Donors==
Communities with milk banks use different methods to educate and solicit donors including brochures in doctors' offices and hospital information packets. Referrals also come from childbirth educators, nursing mothers groups, and [[La Leche League]]. Like [[blood bank]]s, milk banks sometimes use newspaper, television and radio ads to solicit donors, especially when supplies are low (Arnold, 1997).  NICUs with successful breastfeeding promotion and support often have mothers with excess milk, and they are frequently given information about how to donate their milk. In addition, mothers of infants who die sometimes choose to donate their milk.

Currently, many of the milk banks will receive milk from donors in states throughout the [[United States]] depending on their supply. Donors should always contact the closest milk bank first.

==Recipients==
Premature infants are the most frequent recipients of donor breast milk. Full term babies with [[Digestive disease|gastrointestinal (GI) disorder]]s also sometimes receive banked milk. Occasionally, [[adoption|adopted]] babies and mothers who cannot nurse their healthy babies use banked milk as well, often at their own expense.

When there is milk available some milk banks will distribute it to adults who are [[immune system|immuno]]-compromised. Preliminary research indicates that breast milk can have nutritive, immunologic and palliative effects for [[cancer]] patients (Radetsky, 1999). Adults with GI disorders and [[organ donation]] recipients can also benefit from the immunologic powers of breast milk. More research is needed in these areas.

==Risks and mitigation==
Two concerns are often raised by potential donor milk recipients and health care providers regarding potential risks of using banked human milk:

# [[Virus]]es, including [[HIV]], have been shown to transmit through breast milk. However, as mentioned above, breast milk donors are screened very carefully. In addition, each batch of milk is screened and pasteurized and retested for the presence of bacteria. "There have been no documented cases of disease transmission from donor milk provided by a milk bank operating under standard practice." (Arnold, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;3) All of the milk banks listed below abide by the Guidelines of HMBANA. Potential donors are excluded from donating under the following circumstances:
#*Receipt of a blood product or [[blood transfusion]], or a tissue or [[organ transplant]] within the last 12 months.
#*Regular use of more than 2 ounces of [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]] or its equivalent in a 24-hour period.
#*Regular use of [[over-the-counter drug]]s or systemic prescriptions (replacement [[hormone]]s and some [[birth control]] hormones are acceptable).
#*Use of [[megavitamin therapy|mega-dose vitamins]] and/or pharmacologically active [[herb]]al preparations.
#*Total [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] ([[veganism|vegans]]) who do not supplement their diet with [[vitamin]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
#*Use of [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] or [[tobacco]] products.
#*[[Silicone]] [[breast implant]]s
#*A history of [[hepatitis]], systemic disorders of any kind or chronic infections (e.g. HIV, [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV]], [[Tuberculosis|TB]]) (Arnold, 1999)
# Some of the worthwhile components of breast milk are compromised in the [[pasteurization]] process. However, many are not. "Donor milk retains its bioactivity despite partial or complete loss of some components" (Arnold, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;3). The [[enzyme]]s in breast milk (e.g. [[Bile Salt Stimulated Lipase|lipase]]) appear to be most affected by the heat. However, immune factors are less sensitive to heat and growth factors and [[fatty acid]]s are stable at pasteurization temperatures. The lower the temperature at which safe processing can take place the better (Arnold, 1999). HMBANA Guidelines reflect careful research in this area.

==Milk banking alternatives==
Private milk donation is an alternative arrangement to milk donation through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America. Private donation is a less formal method of donation that involves direct connection between mothers donating milk and the families receiving donations. Many families engaging in private milk donation, include blood testing and complete donor screening while involving a supportive care provider.  This is a modern continuation of the ancient concept of the [[wet nurse]].

It was established by the House of Delegates at the 103rd Annual Session of the [[Mississippi State Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmaonline.com Mississippi State Medical Association Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; with an incorporation date of July 6, 1971. A grant from the National Center for Health Services Research and Development in 1971 allowed development of a physician-sponsored system for evaluating the quality of medical care. The primary goal was to improve the quality of medical care in the state and produce long lasting and tangible results. Programs such as the Experimental Medical Care Review Organization (EMCRO) and the [[Professional Standards Review Organization]] (PSRO) preceded the Peer Review Organization (PRO) designation which came on July 1, 1984.

In the spring of 1998 the leadership of Mississippi Foundation For Medical Care voted to change the name to Information &amp; Quality Healthcare in order to better meet the challenges of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Carole  ''New Name and Look for Mississippi PRO: I.Q.H. Information and Quality Healthcare''. Quality Matters, May–June 1998 Volume XV, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;

IQH has worked in quality improvement under contract with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for over 40 years and provided tobacco cessation services since 1999. CMS has recently restructured the [[Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) in Medicare|QIO program]] to a more regional structure with 14 entities known as Quality Innovation Networks (QIN-QIOs). IQH is a part of the newly formed atom Alliance. The alliance comprises Qsource (Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee); Information and Quality Healthcare, Mississippi; and Alabama Quality Assurance Foundation.

==Charter==
Signatures on the 1971 charter are those of Governor [[John Bell Williams]] and Secretary of State Heber Ladner for the state and Dr. J.T. Davis, Sr., M.D.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Theo Davis, Sr., M.D. ''Hand in Hand''. LeFleurs Bluff Publishing Company, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Corinth, MS]], Dr. Everett Crawford of [[Tylertown, MS]] and Dr. James O. Gilmore of [[Oxford, MS]] as officers of the Mississippi State Medical Association. The charter describes the Foundation as "a [[nonprofit]] corporation" and as a "civic improvement corporation", governed by a board of directors, with each member having voting privileges.

==Dr. Arthur A. Derrick Memorial Award recipients==
The Arthur A. Derrick Award that is presented annually by IQH to recognize a physician’s outstanding efforts to the quality program was created in 1993 in memory of Dr. Derrick. The Durant, Mississippi physician is remembered for his special contributions to medicine in the state and as a long-time supporter of quality improvement and the organization’s work. The award emphasizes the importance of quality improvement.

'''João Pedro Furtado da Cunha Semedo''' (20 June 1951 &amp;ndash; 17 July 2018), was a Portuguese physician and politician. 

He was born in 1951 in Lisbon, where he attended [[Camões Secondary School]] and graduated from the Faculty of Medicineof [[University of Lisbon]] in 1975. Between 1972 and 1974, he was a member of the board of the Association of Students of that college. In 1975, he participated in the creation and dynamization of the Movement ALFA (for adult literacy), to whose direction it belonged. He completed his internship in the former Civil Hospitals of Lisbon, now the Hospital Central Lisbon Center, and then integrated the national movement of internal physicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.pt/DeputadoGP/Paginas/Biografia.aspx?ID=803 Biografia] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[Oporto]] in 1978, where he practiced medicine and developed his political, social and cultural activity. Participated in the founding of the Union of Doctors of the North and the Popular University of Porto, integrated the direction of FITEI and the artistic cooperative Tree. He worked in several public, private and social health services, did a postdoctoral degree in Drug Addiction at the Faculty of Psychology of Porto and worked in Associação Norte Vida with the homeless population. In the 1990s he was founder and director of a private clinic and directed the medical services of an IPSS. Between 2000 and 2006, he was chairman of the Board of Administration of the Joaquim Urbano Hospital, a unit of the National Health Service (SNS) specialized in respiratory and infectious diseases. In 2006, he leaves the administration of the hospital to be a Member of the Assembly of the Republic on an exclusive basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2018-07-17-Morreu-Joao-Semedo--1951-2018-#gs.epGvc5Q Morreu João Semedo (1951-2018)] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Union of Communist Students (UEC) and, consequently, the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP) in 1972. In 1973, he was detained by the political police of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo dictatorial regime]], [[PIDE|PIDE/DGS]], accused of subversive activities. He served on the Central Commission of the UEC and the Central Committee of the PCP. He resigned from the PCP Central Committee in 1991 and the party in 2000. In 2003 he participated in the creation of the Communist Renewal Movement. In 2004, as an independent member, he joins the list of the Left Bloc (BE) to the [[European Parliament]] and in 2005, he is a candidate for the same party to the Assembly of the Republic, which he would repeat in 2009 and 2011 as head of the list by the circle of Porto. He was a national deputy between 2006 and 2015, resigning halfway through the last term because of illness. It was the candidate of the BE to the municipal councils of Gondomar, in 2005, of Gaia, in 2009 and of Lisbon, in 2013, never being the most voted.

He died on 17 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://expresso.sapo.pt/politica/2018-07-17-Morreu-Joao-Semedo--1951-2018-#gs.epGvc5Q Morreu João Semedo (1951-2018)] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accidents and incidents]] which have resulted in fatalities on the ground. Aircraft crashes with a high number of ground fatalities typically occur in areas where there are large congregations of people, such as [[building]]s, [[marketplace]]s, and [[sporting event]]s.

There have been 200 aircraft crashes which are known to have resulted in ground fatalities. Of these, 62 have involved at least a dozen ground fatalities, 15 have involved at least 50 ground fatalities, and 3 have involved over 200 ground fatalities. The crashes of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]] are by far the deadliest incidents of this sort, with approximately 2,500 ground fatalities attributed to the two crashes and subsequent [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] of [[One World Trade Center#Original building (1970–2001)|1 WTC]] and [[2 World Trade Center#Original building (1973–2001)|2 WTC]]. The deadliest accidental crash of an aircraft was the [[1996 Air Africa crash]], which resulted in the deaths of at least 225 people on the ground.

'''''Million Calorie March: The Movie''''' is a 2007 [[United States|American]] [[documentary film]] directed by, co-produced by and starring [[Gary Marino|Gary Michael Marino]], an author, speaker and anti-[[obesity]] activist.  The film follows Marino as he embarks on a {{convert|1200|mi|km|adj=on}} fundraiser and awareness walk, the Million Calorie March, from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The walk took 100 days and was designed to raise money and awareness for the causes of [[childhood obesity]] and [[Self care|healthy lifestyles]].

==Synopsis==
''Million Calorie March: The Movie'' documents the Million Calorie March awareness and fundraising campaign and incorporates stories from Marino’s 2005 book, "Big &amp; Tall Chronicles: Misadventures Of A Lifelong Food Addict."  Through flashbacks to his childhood, Marino documents the influences that led to his struggles with [[weight loss]] and his personal battle to overcome [[food addiction]]. The purpose behind Marino’s film is the increasing awareness of the spread of [[obesity]] throughout the [[United States]] and inspiring people to dig deep to fix themselves.

The 95 minute documentary premiered on September 21, 2007 at the [[Boston Film Festival]] to positive reviews. The film also screened at the [[Palm Beach, California|Palm Beach]], [[Jacksonville]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] and [[Long Island]] film festivals as well as health and wellness events throughout the United States. A shortened version of the film screened at over 40 tour stops during Marino’s follow-up campaign, 2008’s Million Step March. In November 2008, the documentary won an International Freddie Award from the National Health and Medical Media Awards Association in the area of Diet &amp; Nutrition.

===Motivation===
Formerly 400&amp;nbsp;lbs, Marino had lost over 110 pounds between 2001 and 2003 largely by [[dieting]], [[exercise]] and researching the [[obesity]] epidemic. Through his research as well as his own struggles with [[weight loss]] and [[food addiction]], Marino became passionate about the obesity issue and wanted to make a contribution to the cause. He formed the anti-[[childhood obesity]] nonprofit organization Generation Excel in 2004 and created the Million Calorie March, the awareness campaign and fundraiser that became the film of the same name. The Million Calorie March was designed to be interactive with other walkers, weight loss groups and media representatives, who were invited to join the walk at any point along the route. Marino also raised money by asking for pledges at each stop in his journey up the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].

===Journey===
The Million Calorie March kicked off live on national television from Jacksonville, Florida. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]’s ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' broadcast the kickoff in front of an estimated audience of 10 million people. The TV show covered the March again live on remote broadcast from the [[Washington Mall]] in D.C. on June 15, 2004, as well as the March crew’s arrival in [[Manhattan]] on June 24, 2004. Other media, including [[Fox News Channel]], [[CBS radio]], [[USA Today]], [[People Magazine]] as well as local and statewide media also covered the event.

==Book==
Marino signed book deal with [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] I-Universe Star division (one of the sponsors of the Million Calorie March) before embarking on the campaign. The book ''Big &amp; Tall Chronicles: MisAdventures of a Lifelong Food Addict'' was released during the final weeks of the March and distributed to audiences at events in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]]. Nine months later in April 2005 it was released nationwide in store.

==Results==
The Million Calorie March reached over 70 million people through local, statewide and national media coverage and raised approximately $150,000 for Generation Excel. Marino himself lost another 40 pounds on the march.

===Events after the March===
Marino launched a career as a motivational speaker in early 2005, donating all of his fees and book sales to the non-profit foundation, Generation Excel. Additionally he formed a running team to train for the 109th [[Boston Marathon]] with pledges also going to Generation Excel. “My goal is to simply complete this because the winner will be shaved, showered, have his check cashed and be on the plane back to [[Kenya]] by the time we hit the finish line,” Marino told [[WFXT|Fox 25]] Morning News the morning of the race. He completed the {{convert|42.195|km|mi|adj=on}} race in 6 hours and 30 minutes.

===Shrink &amp; Shrunk===
Marino also formed a business relationship with Psychologist and Wellness expert Dr. Howard Rankin. The pair recorded a radio pilot called ''The Shrink &amp; The Shrunk'' and began making appearances together at seminars, conferences and health tours.

===Million Pound Meltdown (2005 &amp; 2006)===
One year after the Million Calorie March concluded, [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of Northeastern Pennsylvania asked Marino to serve as spokesman and producer for a two-year awareness campaign aimed at inspiring Pennsylvania’s residents to lose weight and adopt a healthier lifestyle. The Million Pound Meltdown reunited most of the original road team from the Million Calorie March.

With obesity statistics running dangerously high in [[Pennsylvania]], the “Meltdown” kicked off with a three-week tour of the area by Marino and his team including radio, print and TV stops. Walking through all 13 counties in [[Pennsylvania]], Marino and his crew made three campaign stops per day speaking to audiences and leading walks around the anti-obesity theme.

Throughout the “Meltdown”, Marino also hosted his own weekly TV segment called “Gary Weighs In” which aired on [[WBRE-TV]] ([[NBC]] affiliate) and [[WYOU]] ([[CBS]] affiliate).

The “Meltdown” wrapped up at the end of 2006 with over 52,000 pounds lost by Pennsylvanians. The Meltdown participant’s [[Primary care physician]]s confirmed the weight loss as part of the weight loss contest held in conjunction with the campaign.

===Million Step March (2008)===
The following year [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of North Carolina (BCBSNC) joined forces with Marino and Generation Excel to launch a healthy lifestyle and exercise campaign called the “Million Step March”. The “Million Step March” was designed to focus on encouraging walking and fitness as opposed to weight loss.  Marino and BCBSNC Vice President Kathy Higgins kicked off the campaign April 1, 2008 in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. Promoted as a “mountains to the coast” statewide campaign, the “Million Step March” moved 12 –15 miles per day through eight media markets including Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Durham, Greenville, Fayetteville and ending in coastal Wilmington. Marino and Higgins appeared at nearly 60 live events during the 75-day walk. Over 800 people turned out for the ½ point “Rally In Raleigh” event and 600 showed up to cheer the walkers at the finish line event in Wilmington’s [[Riverfront Park (Wilmington, North Carolina)|Riverfront Park]] . Over all, more than 6400 walkers joined the Million Step March walking over half a billion steps.

===Inspiring Wellness Campaign===
In early 2009 Marino again joined forces with Dr. Howard Rankin to launch the “Inspiring Wellness Campaign”, in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]. This was a free community-wide effort offering eight weeks of free health and wellness seminars, film screenings and beach walks.

'''Afghan Ministry of Public Health''' is the [[Government ministries of Afghanistan|ministry]] of the [[government of Afghanistan]] which deals with matters concerning the [[health]] of [[Afghanistan]]'s [[population]]. This body has large funds at its disposal to train, educate and cure. {{as of|2015}} the minister of Health is Dr. [[Ferozudin Feroz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moph.gov.af/en/Page/837 | title=Minister's Biography | publisher=Ministry of Public Health Afghanistan | accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalil"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&amp;id=398&amp;task=view&amp;total=2977&amp;start=622&amp;Itemid=2 | title=Dalil, Soraya | publisher=Afghan Biographies Database | date=2014-10-01 | accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Public Health provides an [[annual report]] to inform the public of advancements in Afghanistan's health sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://moph.gov.af/en/documents/category/annual-report&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ministry==
Following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] the Ministry of Health, along with the [[World Health Organization]] reconstructed the health sector. At the time, at least 70%&lt;ref&gt;[http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/p/tp-se0993.html US Embassy website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041220123839/http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/p/tp-se0993.html |date=2004-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Afghan population was dependent on health services provided by the international community. Almost six million Afghans had no or very little access to medical care. In addition, 50 of the country's 330 districts had no health facilities whatsoever.

The goal of the ministry is to develop the health sector to improve the health of the people of Afghanistan, especially women and children, through implementing the basic package of health services (BPHS) and the essential package of hospital services (EPHS) as the standard, agreed-upon minimum of health care to be provided at each level of the health system. It wants to reduce the high levels of mortality and morbidity by:
* 1) Improving access to quality emergency and routine reproductive and child health services,
* 2) Increasing the coverage and quality of services to prevent and treat communicable diseases and malnutrition among children and adults
* 3) Strengthening institutional development and management at central and provincial levels to ensure the effective and cost-efficient delivery of quality health services and
*4) Further developing the capacity of health personnel to manage and better deliver quality health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision for Health 2005-2015|url=http://moph.gov.af/en/page/584|publisher=Ministry of Health|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">In 1938, [[Henry Murray]]  developed a system of [[needs]] as part of his theory of personality, which he called 'personology.' He argued that everyone had a set of universal basic needs, with individual differences on these needs leading to the uniqueness of personality through varying dispositional tendencies for each need; in other words, specific needs are more important to some than to others. In his theory, Murray argues that needs and presses (another component of the theory) acted together to create an internal state of disequilibrium; the individual is then driven to engage in some sort of behavior to reduce the tension. Murray believed that the study of personality should look at the entire person over the course of their lifespan – that people needed to be analysed in terms of complex interactions and whole systems rather than individual parts – and an individual's behaviors, needs and their levels, etc. are all part of that understanding. Murray also argued that there was a biological (specifically neurological) basis for personality and behavior&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Explorations in Personality|date=1938|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flett|first1=Gordon L|title=Personality theory and research: an international perspective|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Needs ==

Murray defines a need as a drive that has the potential to prompt a behavior from the person. For example, the need for affiliation may drive a person to join social organization. Needs are often influenced by environmental stimulus or 'presses,' another component of Murray's theory.

Individual differences in levels of needs lead to the uniqueness of a person's personality; in other words, specific needs may be more important to some than to others. According to Murray, human needs are psychogenic in origin, function on an unconscious level, and can play a major role in defining personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustration of these psychogenic needs plays a central role in the origin of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages =  | isbn = | chapter =  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that these needs could be measured by projective tests, specifically one he had developed, known as the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT). Unlike [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], Murray's needs are not based on a hierarchy; individuals may be high in one and low in the other, and multiple needs may be affected by a single action.

Murray differentiated each need as unique, but recognized commonalities among them, codified at least partially in his categorization system. Behaviors may meet more than one need:  for instance, performing a difficult task for your fraternity may meet the needs of both achievement and affiliation. While each need is important in and of itself, he also believed that needs can support or conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term 'subsidation of needs' to describe when two or more needs are combined in order to satisfy a more powerful need, and the term 'fusion of needs' to describe when a single action satisfies more than one need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the need for dominance may conflict the need with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. A need may be a purely internal state, but more often it is evoked by a press.

== Presses ==

Murray argued environmental factors play a role in how psychogenic needs are displayed in behavior. He used the term 'presses' to describe external influences on motivation that may influence an individual's level of a need as well as their subsequent behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'press' of an object is what it can do for or to the subject.

Any stimulus with the potential to affect the individual in a positive or negative way is referred to as 'pressive,' and everything else is referred to as inert. 'Pressive Perception' is how the subject interprets a press as either a positive or negative stimulus. 'Pressive Apperception' refers to the subjects anticipation that the stimulus will be perceived as either positive or negative. Murray notes that both Pressive Perception and Apperception are largely unconscious. Presses may have positive or negative effects, may be mobile (affecting the subject if they do nothing) or immobile (affecting the subject if they take an action), and may be an alpha press (real effects) or a beta press (merely perceived).

== Needs by Category ==
Murray divides needs into several binary categories; Manifest (Overt) or Latent (Covert), Conscious or Unconscious, and Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Manifest (sometimes called overt) needs are those that are allowed to be directly expressed, while latent (sometimes called covert) needs are not outwardly acted on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Paul|last2=Culbertson|first2=Amy L.|last3=Magnusson|first3=Paul|title=Human Needs: A Literature Review and Cognitive Life Span Model|journal=Navy Personnel Research and Development Center|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conscious needs as those that a subject can self-report, while Unconscious needs are all others. This is distinct from manifest vs latent in that a person may directly express a need they are unaware of, or not express a need they are aware of. The categorization most commonly referred to is the division between Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs.

=== Primary/Viscerogenic Needs ===
Primary (Viscerogenic) needs are defined by Murray&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as needs involving some biological process and arise in response to certain stimuli or events that drive the body towards a certain outcome ('positive' or 'negative').For example, dehydration would trigger a "need for water," which in turn drives a person to seek out and intake water. The first six primary needs; Air, Water, Food, Sentience, Sex, and Lactation, are considered 'positive' needs, as they drive a person towards a certain object or action. The remaining seven; Expiration, Urination, Defecation, and the four avoidance needs (see 'Retraction' below), are considered to be 'negative' needs as they drive a person away from an object (or in some cases towards the expulsion of an object).

=== Secondary/Psychogenic Needs ===
Secondary (Psychogenic) needs emerge from or are influenced by primary needs. Murray identified 17 secondary needs, each belonging to one of eight need domains: Ambition, Materialism, Status, Power, Sado-Masochism, Social-Conformance, Affection, and Information. Needs in each domain have similar themes underpinning them; for instance, the Ambition domain contains all those needs which relate to achievement and recognition.

===Personality testing===

Murray's system of needs has influenced the creation of personality testing, including both objective and subjective measures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. Murray's system of needs directly influenced the development of a variety of personality measures, including the ''Personality Research Form'' and the ''Jackson Personality Inventory''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Thematic apperception test.|date=1943|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thematic apperception test===

Henry Murray, along with [[Christiana Morgan]], developed the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) as a tool to assess personality. The TAT is based on the assumption that human unconscious needs are directed towards an external stimulus. Murray and Morgan created the TAT to evaluate "press" and "need," which Murray emphasized in his theory of personality. The TAT is administered  by an  assessor, who chooses a subset of cards (generally concerning a particular theme, or those that they feel best suit the subject) out of the 32 available; Murray recommended selecting 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramer|first1=P|title=Storytelling, narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test.|date=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each card features various ambiguous scenes which relate to interpersonal situations. The test-taker is asked to give a detailed explanation of what they see. For example, an explanation may include a narrative of what is happening and what may unfold, and what the characters in the scene are feeling or thinking. From this narrative, the assessor uses Murray's theoretical themes to infer personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Further research===

Murray's theory of personality was the basis for several areas of further psychological research. Three of the needs he identified–the [[need for power]], the [[need for affiliation]], and the [[need for achievement]]–were later the subject of substantial study and considered especially significant; used to develop theories such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[David McClelland]]'s 'Achievement Motivation Theory', aspects of [[Richard Boyatzis]]' competency-based models of management effectiveness, and more.

Murray's concept of the 'press' and his emphasis on the importance of environmental events (and their subjective interpretation) were also highly significant to later psychological research. Behavioral psychology-pioneered by [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]-focused on environmental events, while cognitive psychology included a focus on subjective interpretation of events, based on another one of Murray's ideas (his categorization of presses as either Alpha or Beta).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Salem health: psychology &amp; mental health|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Nancy A|date=2010|publisher=Salem Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Although Murray's theory has had a substantial influence on personality testing and research, some critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. One criticism of this hierarchy is that it lacks the objective criterion for needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Vittorio Caprara|first2=Gian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521587484|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that some of the needs can conflict with each other like achievement and nurturance, which deal with opposing ideas of having to obstacles with achievement being active and nurturance being passive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When evaluating the TAT, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''National Organ, Tissue and Cell Transplantation Policy''' is a [[policy]] that was formulated by the Surgical and Emergency Services Unit of the Medical Services Development Section, Medical Development Division of the [[Malaysia]]n [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Ministry of Health]] in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mst.org.my/articles/MALAYSIA%20TRANSPLANT%20POLICY.pdf |title=National Organ, Tissue and Cell Transplantation Policy |format=ODF |author=Medical Development Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia |publisher=Malaysian Society of Transplantation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Transplant Resource Centre (NTRC) was established by the Ministry of Health together with the support and cooperation from the Medical Development Division. Its main objective is to spread correct information and increase awareness on organ donation and transplantation in Malaysia. It is also responsible for getting more people to pledge and at the same time act as the registrar for organ, tissue and cells donation in Malaysia. The NTRC also collaborate with various NGOs, religious bodies, students’ association, corporate bodies as well as the media to spread information on organ donation and transplantation to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://agiftoflife.gov.my/eng/ntp10.html |title=National Transplant Resource Centre |author=Transplantation Services Unit, Medical Development Unit and National Transplant Resource Centre, Ministry of Health Malaysia |publisher=MOH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413154656/http://agiftoflife.gov.my/eng/ntp10.html |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nitrogen dioxide poisoning''' is the illness resulting from the toxic effect of [[nitrogen dioxide]] ({{chem|NO|2}}). It usually occurs after the inhalation of the gas beyond the [[threshold limit value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11869-008-0008-9|publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer|title =Update of WHO air quality guidelines|year = June 2008|access-date = August 1, 2015|doi=10.1007/s11869-008-0008-9|volume=1|issue=1|journal=Air Quality, Atmosphere &amp; Health|pages=7–13|author=Krzyzanowski Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nitrogen dioxide is reddish-brown with very harsh smell at high concentrations. It is colorless and odorless at lower concentration but still harmful. Nitrogen dioxide poisoning depends on the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposure.
Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant of the [[mucous membrane]] linked with another air pollutant that causes pulmonary diseases such as [[Obstructive lung disease|OLD]], [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and sometimes acute exacerbation of COPD and in fatal cases, deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/nitrogenoxides/health.html|title=Nitrogen dioxide|work=US EPA|access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its poor solubility in water enhances its passage and its ability to pass through the moist oral mucosa of the respiratory tract.
Like most toxic gases, the dose inhaled determines the toxicity on the respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and domestic exposure is uncommon. Prolonged exposure to low concentration of the gas may have lethal effects, as can short-term exposure to high concentrations like [[chlorine gas poisoning]]. It is one of the major air pollutant capable of causing severe heath hazards such as [[coronary artery disease]] as well as [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/no2.html|title=Indoor Air|work=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nitrogen dioxide is often released into the environment as a byproduct of [[Combustion|fuel combustion]] but rarely released by [[spontaneous combustion]]. Known sources of nitrogen dioxide gas poisoning include [[Exhaust gas|automobile exhaust]] and [[power station]]s. 
The [[toxicity]] may also result from non-combustible sources such as the one released from [[Lactic acid fermentation|anaerobic fermentation]] of [[food grain]]s and [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[biodegradable waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashok|first=Pandey|date=2014 |title=Pretreatment of Biomass: Processes and Technologies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8w6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Nitrogen+oxides+are+produced+from+anaerobic+digestion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G33d2turdP&amp;sig=2jSWCb6z3ZV37ipP0rWh0ddWqSk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBWoVChMI-eiYqNeHxwIVhLIUCh2Hwwvb|location=USA |publisher=Elsevier |page=202 |isbn=0128003960|access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) developed a global recommendation limiting exposures to less than 20 [[Parts-per notation|parts per billion]] for chronic exposure and value less 100&amp;nbsp;ppb for one hour for acute exposure, using nitrogen dioxide as a marker for other pollutants from fuel combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138707/|title=Nitrogen dioxide - WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Selected|work=PubMed|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The standards also based on the concentration of nitrogen dioxide that show a significant and profound effects on the function of the pulmonary of asthmatic patients.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=173|issue=3|date=February 1, 2006|title=Association of indoor nitrogen dioxide exposure with respiratory symptoms in children with asthma|author=Belanger K, Gent JF, Triche EW, Bracken MB, Leaderer BP|pmc=2662932|pmid=2662932|pages=297–303|doi=10.1164/rccm.200408-1123OC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, some cities in the United States including [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]] have high levels of nitrogen dioxide but the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] set a standard values less than 100&amp;nbsp;ppb for a one-hour exposure and less than 53&amp;nbsp;ppb for chronic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-01-25/news/ct-met-0126-dirty-air-20100125_1_nitrogen-illinois-epa-chicago-area|title=Nitrogen oxides limits: Chicago would fail to meet Obama's tougher |work=Chicargo Tribune|access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/healthy-air/outdoor/resources/nitrogen-dioxide.html|title=Nitrogen Dioxide |work= American Lung Association|access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Nitrogen dioxide poisoning is not harmful to all forms of life just like "chlorine gas poisoning" and [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. It is easily absorbed through the lungs and its inhalation result in [[heart failure]] and sometimes death in severe and cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/∼0P3dBt:2|title=Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) [online database]. Nitrogen dioxide.|work=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Individual and races may differ in nitrogen dioxide tolerance level and individual tolerance level for the gas may be altered by several factors, such as metabolic rate, barometric pressure, and hematological disorders but significant exposure may result in fatal conditions that could lead to shorter lifespan due to heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Indoor pollution from heating|year=1996|pmid=8768665 | volume=34|issue=3|journal=Ind Health|pages=205–15|author=Arashidani K, Yoshikawa M, Kawamoto T, Matsuno K, Kayama F, Kodama Y|doi=10.2486/indhealth.34.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute poisoning===

Exposure to high level of nitrogen dioxide may lead to inflammation of the [[mucous membrane]] and the lower and upper respiratory tracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|volume=88|issue=12|pages=1781–6|year=1998|title=Determinants of nitrogen dioxide concentrations in indoor ice skating rinks|author=J I Levy, K Lee, Y Yanagisawa, P Hutchinson, and J D Spengler|doi=10.2105/ajph.88.12.1781|journal=American Journal of Public Health|pmc=1509046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The symptoms of acute nitrogen dioxide poisoning is non-specific and have a semblance with ammonia gas poisoning, chlorine gas poisoning, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms also resembles that of [[pneumonia]] or viral infection and other inhalational injuries but common symptoms includes [[rhinitis]] wheezing or coughing, [[conjunctivitis]], headache, [[throat irritation]] and [[dyspnea]] which may progress to nasal fissures, ulcerations, or perforation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=18|issue=4|pages=283–92|year=2008|title=Is a quantitative risk assessment of air quality in underground parking garages possible?|author=Glorennec P, et al.|pmid=18717983|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2008.00529.x|journal=Indoor Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The patient is usually ill-appearing and presents with hypoxemia coupled with shallow rapid breathing. 
Therapy is supportive and includes removal from further nitrogen dioxide exposure.
Systemic symptoms include fever and anorexia. [[Electrocardiography]] and [[chest radiograph]]y can help in revealing diffuse, bilateral alveolar infiltrates.

Chest radiography may be used in diagnosis and the baseline could be established with [[pulmonary function testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=28|issue=5|pages=585–90|year=1998|title=Indoor environment of residential homes in Hong Kong – relevance to asthma and allergic disease|author=Leung R, et al.|pmid=9645595|journal=Clin Exp Allergy|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=12|issue=9|pages=1261–1264|year=1996|title= Measurements of indoor and outdoor nitrogen dioxide concentrations using a diffusive sampler|author=Hagenbjork-Gustafsson A, et al.|pmid=8831283|journal=Analyst|doi=10.1039/an9962101261|bibcode=1996Ana...121.1261H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is no specific laboratory diagnostic test for acute nitrogen dioxide poisoning but analysis of arterial blood gas level, 
methemoglobin level, [[complete blood count]], [[glucose test]], [[lactate threshold]] measurement and [[Blood film|r peripheral blood smear]] may be helpful in the diagnosis of nitrogen dioxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=48|issue=6|pages=553–60|year=1998|title=Impact of residential nitrogen dioxide exposure on personal exposure: an international study|author=Levy JI, et al.|pmid=9949739|journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc|doi=10.1080/10473289.1998.10463704}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The determination of nitrogen dioxide in urine or tissue does not establish the diagnosis, and there are technical and interpretive problems with these tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=58|issue=33–50|pages=51–80|year=1993|title=Nitrogen dioxide and respiratory illness in children. Part II. Assessment of exposure to nitrogen dioxide|author=Lambert WE, et al.|pmid=8240759|journal=Res Rep Health Eff Inst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic poisoning===

Prolonged exposure to a very high level of nitrogen dioxide in micro meter-size range, may have an inflammatory effect that principally targets the respiratory tracts leading to chronic nitrogen dioxide poisoning which can occur within days or weeks after the threshold limit value is excessively exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=57|issue=2|pages=130–6|year=2002|title=The Po River Delta (north Italy) indoor epidemiological study: effects of pollutant exposure on acute respiratory symptoms and respiratory function in adults|author=Simoni M, et al.|pmid=12194158|doi=10.1080/00039890209602928|journal=Arch Environ Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This condition causes fever, rapid breathing coupled with rapid heart rate, and severe seizure of breath.
Other effects include diaphoresis, chest pain, and persistent dry cough, all of which may result in weight loss, anorexia and may also lead to right-side heart enlargement and heart disease in advanced cases.
Prolonged exposure to relatively low levels of nitrogen (II) oxide may cause persistent headaches and nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=53|issue=11|pages=1312–7|year=2003|title= Sources and concentrations of indoor nitrogen dioxide in Barcelona, Spain|author=Garcia-Algar O, et al.|pmid=14649750|journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc|doi=10.1080/10473289.2003.10466297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like chlorine gas poisoning, symptoms usually resolve themselves upon removal from further nitrogen dioxide exposure, unless there had been an episode of severe acute poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=89|issue=3|pages=236–44|year=2002|title=Environmental NO2 concentration and exposure in daily life along main roads in Tokyo|author=Kodama Y, et al.|pmid=12176007|journal=Environ Res|doi=10.1006/enrs.2002.4350|bibcode=2002ER.....89..236K}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Treatment and management vary with symptoms. Patients are often observed for [[hypoxemia]] for a minimum of 12 hours if there are no initial symptoms and if the patient is hypoxemic, oxygen may be administered but high-dose steroids are recommended for patients with pulmonary manifestations. Patients may also be hospitalized for 12 to 24 hours or longer for observation if the gaseous exchange is impaired.
In a case where gaseous exchange is impaired, mechanical ventilation and intubation may be necessary and if [[bronchiolitis obliterans]] develop within 2 to 6 weeks of nitrogen dioxide exposure, [[Corticosteroid|corticosteroid therapy]] such as [[anticholinergic]] may be required for 6 to 12 months to lower the body overreaction to nitrogen dioxide gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125–36|year=1995|title= Respiratory health associated with exposure to automobile exhaust.

==Cause==
Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and it is often high for farmers especially those that deal with food grains. It is equally high for firefighters and military personnel, especially those officers that deal in explosives. The risk is also high for arc welders, traffic officers, aerospace staffs and miners as well as those people whose occupations are connected with the [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=41|issue=31|pages=6561–6571|year=2007|title=Predicting residential indoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter, and elemental carbon using questionnaire and geographic information system based data.|author=Baxter LK, et al|pmid=19830252|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.04.027|journal=Atmos Environ (1994)|pmc=2760735|bibcode=2007AtmEn..41.6561B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silo-filler's disease]] is a consequence of exposure to nitrogen dioxide poisoning by farmers dealing with silos. Food grains such as corn and millet, as well as grasses such as alfalfa and some other plant material, produces nitrogen dioxide within hours due to [[Lactic acid fermentation|anaerobic fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=116|issue=10|pages=1428–32|year=2008|title= A longitudinal study of indoor nitrogen dioxide levels and respiratory symptoms in inner-city children with asthma. |author=Hansel N, et al.|pmid=18941590|doi=10.1289/ehp.11349|pmc=2569107|journal=Environ Health Perspect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are often attained within 1 to 2 days and begin to decline gradually after 10 to 14 days but if the silos is well sealed, the gas may remain in there for weeks. Heavily fertilized [[silage]], particularly the ones produced from immature plants, generate a higher concentration of the gas within the silo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=26|issue=4|pages=788–96|year=1997|title= Respiratory effects associated with indoor nitrogen dioxide exposure in children|author=Pilotto LS, et al.|pmid=9279611|journal=Int J Epidemiol|doi=10.1093/ije/26.4.788}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nitrogen dioxide is about 1.5 times heavier than air and during silage storage, nitrogen dioxide remains in the silage material.
Improper ventilation may result in exposure during the leveling of the silage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=281|issue=1–3|pages=46–62|year=2001|title= Wood-burning appliances and indoor air quality|author=Lévesque B, et al.|pmid=11778959|journal=Sci Total Environ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Nitrogen dioxide is sparingly soluble in water and on inhalation, it diffuses into the lung and slowly hydrolyzes to nitrous and [[nitric acid]] which causes [[pulmonary edema]] and [[pneumonitis]] leading to the inflammation of the [[bronchiole]]s and [[pulmonary alveolus]] resulting from [[lipid peroxidation]] and [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=2–12|year=2005|title=Relationship between outdoor and indoor air quality in eight French schools.|author=Blondeau P, et al.|pmid=15660564|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00263.x|journal=Indoor Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mucous membrane is primarily affected alongside with [[type I pneumocyte]] and the [[respiratory epithelium]]. The generation of free radicals from lipid peroxidation results in irritation of the bronchioles and alveoli that causes rapid destruction of the respiratory epithelial cells.
The overall reaction results in the release of fluid that causes pulmonary edema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=11|issue=3|pages=442–6|year=2006|title=Workgroup report: indoor chemistry and health. Environmental Health Perspectives|author=Weschler CJ, et. al|pmid=16507469|journal=Environ Health Perspect|pmc=1392240|doi=10.1289/ehp.8271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen dioxide poisoning may alter macrophage activity and immune function leading to susceptibility of the body to a wide range of infections, and overexposure to the gas may also lead to [[methemoglobinemia]], a disorder characterized by a higher than normal level of methemoglobin (metHb, i.e., ferric [Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;] rather than ferrous [Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] haemoglobin) in the [[blood]].

Methemoglobinemia prevents the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin causing oxygen depletion that could lead to severe hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=120|issue=3|pages=618–24|year=2007|title= Health effects of indoor nitrogen dioxide and passive smoking on urban asthmatic children.|author=Kattan M, et al.|pmid=17582483|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.05.014|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If nitrogen dioxide poisoning is untreated,  fibrous granulation tissue is likely to develop within the [[alveolar duct]]s, tiny ducts that connect the respiratory bronchioles to alveolar sacs, each of which contains a collection of alveoli (small mucus-lined pouches made of flattened epithelial cells). The overall reaction may cause an [[obstructive lung disease]]. Meanwhile, proliferative bronchiolitis is a secondary effect of nitrogen dioxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=17|issue=5|pages=433–44|year=2007|title=Predictors of concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter, and particle constituents inside of lower socioeconomic status urban homes|author=Baxter LK, et al.|pmid=17051138|doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500532|journal=J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

[[Image:Aura OMI Nitrogen dioxide troposphere column.png|thumb|Nitrogen dioxide 2011 tropospheric column density.]]

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] have some regulations and guidelines for monitoring nitrogen dioxide levels. Historically, some states in the U.S including [[Chicago]], [[Northeast corridor]] and [[Los Angeles|L.A]] have had high levels of nitrogen dioxide.

In 2006, the WHO estimated that over 2 million deaths result annually from air pollution in which nitrogen dioxide constitute one of the pollutants. While over 50% of the disease that results from these pollutants are common in developing countries and the effects in developed countries is also significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=19|issue=1|pages=14–21|year=2008|title=lMagnitude of indoor NO2 from biomass fuels in rural settings of Ethiopia|author=Kumie A, et al.|pmid=19191924|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2008.00555.x|journal=Indoor Air}}&lt;/ref&gt; An EPA survey in the U.S. suggests that 16 percent of United State's housing units are sited close to an airport, highway or railroad increasing in the United States the exposure risk of approximately 48 million people.

A feasibility study of the [[ozone]] formed from the oxidation of nitrogen dioxide in ambient air reported by the WHO suggested that daily deaths of 1 to 2% is attributed to exposure to ozone concentration above 47.3 ppb and exposure above 75.7ppb is attributed to 3 to 5% increase in daily mortality. A level of 114 ppb was attributed to 5 to 9% increase daily mortality.

Silo filler's disease is pervasive during the harvest seasons of food grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=15|issue=2|pages=76–82|year=2005|title= Indoor/outdoor relationships of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in domestic homes with roadside, urban and rural locations in a central Indian region.|author=Lawrence AJ et. al.|pmid=15737150|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00311.x|journal=Indoor Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the [[National Green Tribunal Act|National Green Tribunal]] directed [[Delhi]] and other states in [[India]] to ban diesel vehicles over 10 years old as a measure to reduce nitrogen dioxide emission that may result in nitrogen dioxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/home/environment/pollution/UK-set-for-war-on-NO2-emissions/articleshow/47275314.cms|title=UK set for war on NO2 emissions|work=Times of India|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the report of [[United Kingdom]] committee on the medical effects of air pollutants (COMEAP) suggested that air pollution is the cause of about 29,000 deaths in UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/motors/london-set-to-declare-war-on-diesel-1.1888240|title=London set to declare war on diesel|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO urban air quality database estimated Delhi's mean annual PM 10 levels in 2010 as 286 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and London as 23 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2014, the database estimated Delhi's annual mean PM 2.5 particulate matter levels in 2013 as 156 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whereas, [[London]] have only 8 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 2010 but the nitrogen dioxide in London breach the [[European Union]]'s standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-in-londons-oxford-street-has-already-breached-the-legal-limit-for-the-whole-of-2015--in-just-four-days-9960277.html|title=Air pollution in London's Oxford Street has already breached the|work=Independent News|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the annual mean nitrogen dioxide level in London was estimated as 58 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; but the save and "threshold limit value" is 40 μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/410906/uk-set-for-war-on-no2-emissions/|title=UK set for war on NO2 emissions |work= India Environment Portal |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2015, [[Brussels]] took the United Kingdom into court for breaching emissions limits of nitrogen dioxide at its coal-fired [[Aberthaw power stations]] in [[Wales]]. The plant operated  under a permit allowing emissions of 0.0012 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is more than twice the 0.000 5μg /m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; limit specified in the EU’s large combustion plant directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/26/uk-faces-european-court-over-coal-plant-emissions|title=UK faces European court over coal plant emissions|work=The Guardian News|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Generally, long-term [[prognosis]] is helpful to survival of initial exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Some cases of nitrogen dioxide poisoning resolves with no observable symptoms and patient may be determined by pulmonary function testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=49|issue=1|pages=76–81|year=1996|title=Nitrogen dioxide in Australian homes: levels and sources.|author=Garrett MH, Hooper MA, Hooper BM|pmid=9951416|journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc}}&lt;/ref&gt; If chronic exposure causes lung damage, it could take several days or months for the pulmonary function to improve. Meanwhile, permanent mild dysfunction may result from bronchiolitis obliterans and could manifest as abnormal flow at 50 to 70 percent of vital capacity. It may also manifest as mild hyperinflammation, airway obstruction and in that case, patient may be subject to steroid treatment to treat [[deconditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=15|issue=6|pages=393–401|year=2005|title= Ventilation in public housing: implications for indoor nitrogen dioxide concentrations|author=Zota A, et al.|pmid=16268829|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2005.00375.x|journal=Indoor Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Complications from prolong exposure includes  bronchiolitis obliterans and other secondary infections such as pneumonia due to injuries on the mucous membrane from  pulmonary edema and inhibition of immune system by nitrogen dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=58|issue=8|pages=511–6|year=2001|title=Ultrafine particles and nitrogen oxides generated by gas and electric cooking |author=Dennekamp M, et al|pmid=11452045|journal=Occup Environ Med|doi=10.1136/oem.58.8.511|pmc=1740176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen dioxide inhalation can result in short and long-term morbidity or death depending on the extent of exposure and inhaled concentration and the exposure time.
Illness resulting from acute exposure is usually not fatal although some exposure may cause bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary edema as well as [[Asphyxia|rapid asphyxiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=110|issue=2|pages=145–50|year=2002|title= Nitrous acid, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone concentrations in residential environments.|author=Lee K, et al.|pmid=11836142|journal=Environ Health Perspect|doi=10.1289/ehp.02110145|pmc=1240728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If the concentration of exposure is excessively high, the gas may displace oxygen resulting in fatal asphyxiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/302133-overview#4|title=Nitrogen dioxide toxicity|work=medscape.com|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, patients and workers should be educated by medical personnel on how to identify the signs and symptoms of Nitrogen dioxide poisoning.
Farmers and other farm workers should be educated on the proper way of food grain storage to prevent silo filler's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=110|issue=7|page=665-170|year=2002|title=Synergism between rhinovirus infection and oxidant pollutant exposure enhances airway epithelial cell cytokine production.|author=Spannhake EW, et al.|pmid=12117643|journal=Environ Health Perspect|doi=10.1289/ehp.02110665|pmc=1240912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemical effects==

[[File:AChe inhibitors pic.jpg|thumb|left|Mechanism of Inhibitors of AChE]]

Chronic exposure to high level of nitrogen dioxide results in the [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric inhibition]] of [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione S-transferase]], both of which are important enzymes found in the mucous membrane antioxidant defense system, that catalyse nucleophilic attack by reduced glutathione (GSH) on non-polar compounds that contain an electrophillic [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. These inhibition mechanisms generates [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] that causes [[Lipid peroxidation|peroxidation]] from the [[lipids]] in the mucous membrane leading to increased peroxidized eyrthrocyte lipids, a reaction that proceeds by a free radical [[Chemical reaction|chain reaction]] mechanism that result in oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=66|issue=2|pages=121–32|year=1991|title=Biochemical effects of combined gases of nitrogen dioxide |author=Sanga M, ichinose T|pmid=2014515|journal=Toxicology|doi=10.1016/0300-483x(91)90213-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidative stress on the mucous membrane causes the dissociation of the GSTp-JNK complex, oligomerization of GSTP  and induction of the [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases|JNK pathway]], resulting in [[apoptosis]] or inflammation of the bronchioles and pulmonary alveolus in mild cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=234–235|issue=1–2|pages=71–80|year=2002|title=Molecular mechanisms of nitrogen dioxide induced epithelial injury|author=Persinger RL et. al|pmid=12162462|journal=Mol Cell Biochem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On migrating to the [[blood]]stream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an [[Enzyme inhibitor#Irreversible inhibitors|irreversible inhibition]] of the [[Acetylcholinesterase|erythrocite membrane acetylcholinesterase]] which may lead to [[Paralysis|muscular paralysis]], convulsions, [[bronchoconstriction]], the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by [[asphyxia]]tion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Pesticide Information Center-Diazinon Technical Fact Sheet|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/diazinontech.pdf|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drachman|first=D.B.|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|year=1998|publisher=The McCraw-Hill Companies|isbn=978-0-07-020291-7|pages=2469–2472|edition=14|author2=Isselbacher, K.J., Braunwald, E., Wilson, J.D., Martin, J.B., Fauci, A.S.

Acute and chronic exposure also reduces [[glutathione reductase]], an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting ''oxidative stress'' and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell.&lt;ref name="Meister_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meister A | title = Glutathione metabolism and its selective modification | journal = J.

==Reproductive effects==
Exposure to nitrogen dioxide has a significant effect on the male reproductive system by inhibiting the production of [[Sertoli cell]], a "nurse" [[Cell (biology)|cell]] of the [[testicle]]s that is part of a [[Seminiferous tubule|seminiferous]] tubule and helps in the process of [[spermatogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=3|issue=28|pages=3–28|year=2005|title=Role of oxidative stress in female reproduction|author=Ashok Agawa et. al|pmc=1215514|pmid=16018814|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-3-28|journal=Reprod.

These effects consequently retard the production of sperm cell. 
The effects of nitrogen dioxide poisoning of female reproduction may be linked with the effects of oxidative stress in female reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1477-7827-3-28|volume=3|issue=28|page=1477-7827|year=2005|title=Role of oxidative stress in female reproduction|author=Ashok Agarwal et. al.|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-3-28|journal=Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology|pmid=16018814|pmc=1215514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nitrogen dioxide poisoning disrupts the balance of [[reactive oxygen species]], ROS which results in OS and this has significant effects on female reproductive life span. ROS play a significant role in body physiology, from [[oocyte]] production, development and maturation to [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], development of embryo and [[pregnancy]].
Exposure to nitrogen dioxide causes an ovulation-induced oxidative damage to the [[DNA]] of ovarian epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=10|issue=49|page=1477-7827|year=2012|title=The effects of oxidative stress on female reproduction: a review|author=Ashok Agawa et. al|pmc=3527168|pmid=22748101|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-10-49|journal=Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a growing literature on the pathological effects of ROS on female reproduction in relation to free radical-induced birth defect, abortion, hydatidiform mole and pathophysiogy of pre-eclampsia. ROS also play a significant role in [[Pathogenesis|etiopathogenesis]] of [[endometriosis]], a disease in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=62|issue=5|pages=335–47|year=2007|title=The role of oxidative stress in spontaneous abortion and recurrent |author=Gupta S et. al|pmid=17425812|doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000261644.89300.df|journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oxidative stress causes defective [[placentation]] which is likely to lead to placental hypoxia, shortage of oxygen in the placental as well as reperfusion injury resulting from ischemia which may lead to endothelial cell dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=133|issue=5|pages=550–551|year=2011|title=Sperm DNA damage &amp; oxidative stress in recurrent spontaneous|author=Monis Bilial Shamsi et. al.|pmc=3121290|pmid=21623044|journal=Indian J.

==Causes==

Reasons for [[obesity]] in the Pacific islands are thought to include:
* Diet. Much of the local diet is of processed, calorie-dense, imported food such as [[Spam (food)|spam]] or [[corned beef]], rather than fresh fish, fruit and vegetables, in part because past mining reduced the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1578329/Spam-at-heart-of-South-Pacific-obesity-crisis.html|title=Spam at heart of South Pacific obesity crisis|author=Nick Squires|accessdate=21 August 2009|date=12 April 2008|location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2007-02-26-voa10/331876.html |accessdate=15 July 2016 |title=South Pacific Leads the World in Obesity |author=Phil Mercer |date=26 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Obesity in Nauru#Cause of obesity]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} Some very unhealthy foods are sold in the Pacific islands due to relatively low wealth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35346493&lt;/ref&gt;
* A relatively sedentary lifestyle, including among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1681297.stm|title=Pacific Islanders are world's fattest|date=28 November 2001|accessdate=21 August 2009 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parrot harness''' or '''bird flight harness''' is a type of [[pet harness]] that is specifically designed to be worn by a parrot. A parrot harness may enable a [[companion parrot]] to be taken outdoors without flying away, as they should not be able to by being restrained. Some [[parrot]]s may dislike wearing a harness and bite at it, but parrot that are harness-trained from a very young age may accept them willingly; more often, though, parrots must be very carefully and gradually accustomed and trained to wear a harness. Care must be taken that the parrot does not feel threatened. Properly trained parrots often appear to enjoy wearing their harnesses if they associate them with going outdoors.

With a properly designed [[:wikt:harness|harness]] and [[leash]], a tame parrot can be taken outside. It can even be given some limited flight outside. However, this can be potentially dangerous for the parrot, which may be initially frightened by unfamiliar events, noises, and objects. It is usually best to first take the parrot out in a cage or carrier to let it become accustomed to being outdoors.  Parrot harnesses are available commercially in a range of brands and sizes, fitting small birds such as [[budgerigar]]s and [[cockatiel]]s, all the way up to the largest [[macaw]]s and [[cockatoo]]s. Some parrot owners may choose to make their own harnesses.

Heavy harnesses that require assembly with metal buckles and clips can be uncomfortable. They may be broken or unlatched by some larger birds with strong beaks.  A leash should always be fastened securely to the person holding the leash (such as by an elastic band around the wrist) to avoid the possibility of dropping the leash, as a dropped leash may become entangled in a tree or other object if a parrot flies off.  A harness should only be used when the parrot is supervised and should never be used to tether a parrot to a perch or other object.

The best way to train a parrot to wear a harness is to use positive and negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is used to reward the parrot until it overcomes its fear of the harness. Food treats are used as [[positive reinforcement]] to reward the parrot for putting on the harness. A well trained parrot will put the harness on itself by slipping its head through the collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theparrotforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1329 | title=Flight Harness Training Parrot | accessdate= 5 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3153">[[File:Partogramm Modell NSIONI 2005.JPG|thumb|Partogram]]
A '''partogram''' or '''partograph''' is a composite graphical record of key data (maternal and fetal) during [[childbirth|labour]] entered against time on a single sheet of paper.  Relevant measurements might include statistics such as [[cervical dilation]], [[fetal heart rate]], duration of labour and [[vital signs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://staff.um.edu.mt/csav1/lectures/partogram.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221515/http://staff.um.edu.mt/csav1/lectures/partogram.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is intended to provide an accurate record of the progress in labour, so that any delay or deviation from normal may be detected quickly and treated accordingly. However, a [[Cochrane review]] came to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to recommend partograms in standard labour management and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005461.pub2| title = Effect of partogram use on outcomes for women in spontaneous labour at term|journal=The Cochrane Library| year = 2008| last1 = Lavender | first1 = T. | last2 = Hart | first2 = A. | last3 = Smyth | first3 = R. M. | pmc = 4161496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
# Patient identification
# Time: It is recorded at an interval of one hour. Zero time for spontaneous labour is time of admission in the labour ward and for induced labour is time of induction.
# Fetal heart rate: It is recorded at an interval of thirty minutes.
# State of membranes and colour of liquor: "I" designates intact membranes, "C" designates clear and "M" designates [[meconium]] stained liquor.
# Cervical dilatation and descent of head
# Uterine contractions: Squares in vertical columns are shaded according to duration and intensity.
# Drugs and Fluids
# [[Blood pressure]]: It is recorded in vertical lines at an interval of 2 hours.
# [[Pulse rate]]: It is also recorded in vertical lines at an interval of 30 minutes.
# [[Oxytocin]]: Concentration is noted down in upper box; while dose is noted in lower box.
# Urine analysis
# Temperature record

==Advantages==
* Provides information on single sheet of paper at a glance
* No need to record labour events repeatedly
* Prediction of deviation from normal progress of labour
* Improvement in maternal [[Disease|morbidity]], perinatal morbidity and [[Death|mortality]]

==Usage==
A partogram is contained in the Perinatal Institute's "Birth notes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Perinatal Institute|url = http://www.perinatal.nhs.uk/index.htm|website = www.perinatal.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of a partogram in established labour is recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) http://www.nice.org.uk/ in the "Intrapartum Care" guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrapartum care: care of healthy women and their babies during childbirth|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190|publisher=NICE guidelines [CG190]|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PatientCareProviderSad.jpg|thumb|Visual example of caregiver burnout, a common result of patient initiated violence.]]

'''Patient-initiated violence ''' is a specific form of [[workplace violence]] that affects [[Health professional|healthcare workers]] that is the result of verbal, physical, or emotional abuse from a patient or family members of whom they have assumed care. [[Nursing|Nurses]] represent the highest percentage of affected workers; however, other roles include physicians, therapists, technicians, home care workers, and social workers.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"&gt;National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (2003) Workplace Violence: issues in Response. National Criminal Justice Reference Service. (53-55) Received from https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204462&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] used 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics and reported that healthcare workplace violence requiring days absent from work from patients represented 80% of cases.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2015) Workplace Violence in Healthcare. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Received from https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hospitals/workplace_violence.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a survey by the [[American Nurses Association]] of 3,765 21% of nurses and nursing students reported physical abuse and over 50% reported verbal abuse within a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association. 2014.

==Areas of high prevalence==

===Emergency departments===

The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] found that greater than 75% of emergency physicians were the victim of one or more violent incidents in the workplace, noting that the majority was by patients or their families.&lt;ref name="EPM"&gt;Emergency Physicians Monthly. (n.d.). Emergency Department Violence Fact Sheet. Retrieved July 30, 2016, from http://epmonthly.com/article/violence-against-ed-workers-a-growing-problem/&lt;/ref&gt; Causes for the increased presence of violence, especially in urban settings, are related to gang activity, lengthened waiting periods to see a doctor, a failure of community medical resources, and unavailable acute psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name="EPM"/&gt; In 2011 the [[Emergency Nurses Association]] studies the occurrence of physical violence at 54.4% and verbal violence at 42.5% among emergency room nurses.&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;Emergency Nurses Association. (2011). Emergency department violence surveillance study. Des Plaines, IL: Emergency Nurses Association&lt;/ref&gt; Within this study, 55.7% perpetrators of physical violence were under the influence of alcohol. 46.8% were under the influence of illegal or prescription drugs, and 45.2% were being treated for psychiatric reasons. A majority of the violent behavior that occurred was during the [[triage]] process at 40.2%.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

===Psychiatric and dementia units===
Workers in departments that specialize in [[mental health]] are particularly at risk for patient abuse due to the psychiatric disease states, high rates of [[substance abuse]], and previous violent patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12912-015-0079-5 |pmid=25999795 |pmc=4440495 |title=Registered nurses' experiences of patient violence on acute care psychiatric inpatient units: An interpretive descriptive study |journal=BMC Nursing |volume=14 |pages=35 |year=2015 |last1=Stevenson |first1=Kelly N. |last2=Jack |first2=Susan M. |last3=o'Mara |first3=Linda |last4=Legris |first4=Jeannette }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses noted that [[social stigma]] of psychiatric disorders plays a significant role in how nurses perceive violence. Caregivers were uncomfortable with the notion that patient violence is part of the job but also that it is unfair to believe that those with [[mental illness]] should be seen as more violent in nature.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt; Osha reported that violent injuries in psychiatric aids was 10 times higher than any other healthcare worker at 590 injuries per 10,000 full-time employees.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"/&gt;

==Underreporting==
Underreporting of patient initiated violence is common with professionals claiming that assault is a part of the job. A report from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] dedicates underreporting is likely due to a fear of [[retaliation]], or belief that it will not lead to any change. There is also a commonly held belief that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNA"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association, Congress on Health and Safety, Workplace Violence and Abuse Prevention Task Force, Luce, S. (2005). Violence is NOT Part of the Job. Massachusetts Nurses Association. Received from: https://massnurses.org/files/file/MNA%20Survey%20results%20FINAL%20on%20Workplace%20Violence%20Abuse%202016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts Nurses Association followed up on this common belief through a survey of three [[New England]] hospitals, finding that only 39% of participants reported all incidences of violence. The same report found that 70% of those who reported an incident found that management was supportive, however a majority noted that nothing was done to solve the problem.&lt;ref name=MNA/&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses reported that not only was violence a part of the job, but its occurrence no longer warranted a reporting.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; The same report noted that underreporting drastically affects the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to track these occurrences.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt; Many qualitative studies done on nurses suggest that there is frequent discouragement by hospital officials and legal officers to not press charges against abusive patients or their families related to an understanding that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt;

==Lasting effects of violence==
The effects of patient initiated violence has been found correlate to lasting symptoms of [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[acute stress disorder]], and high rates of [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;  Nurses who experience a lack of support from public officials after the event reported feelings of anxiety and frustration.&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt; OSHA sampled one hospital who paid for medical treatment of 30 staff members subject to patient initiated violence over a one-year period costing $94,146.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; It was also estimated that the costs of separation, recruitment, hiring, and training of new staff to be anywhere from 25,000 to 103,000.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

A study in Orebro Reginal Hospital in [[Sweden]] suggested a link between patient initiated violence, [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and decreased care outcomes. It was reported that the highest indicator of care quality outcomes is a positive or negative association with an individuals work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00146-5 |pmid=11330776 |title=Violence towards health care staff and possible effects on the quality of patient care |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=417–27 |year=2001 |last1=Arnetz |first1=Judith E |last2=Arnetz |first2=Bengt B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media==
In November 2014 Charles Logan, a 68-year-old patient at St John's Hospital in Mapplewood Minnesota attacked nurses using a bar from his stretcher.&lt;ref&gt;(WGN) CNN WIRE. (2014, November 7). Surveillance video captures patient attacking nurses in Minnesota hospital. Retrieved August 6, 2016, from http://wgntv.com/2014/11/07/surveillance-video-captures-patient-attacking-nurses-in-minnesota-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==

Patrick Berhault is best known for popularizing [[sport climbing]] in France with his friend rock climber legend [[Patrick Edlinger]] in the late 70s and in the 80s. He also practiced [[free solo climbing]] and was one of the pioneer alpinists who developed light and fast mountaineering in the nineties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}In [[botany]], a '''photoassimilate''' is one of a number of biological compounds formed by [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] using [[light-dependent reaction]]s. This term is most commonly used to refer to the energy-storing [[monosaccharide]]s produced by [[photosynthesis]] in the leaves of plants.

Only NADPH, ATP and water are made in the "light" reactions. Monosaccharides, though generally more complex sugars, are made in the "dark" reactions.The term "light" reaction can be confusing as some "dark" reactions require light to be active.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Photoassimilate movement through plants from "source to sink" using [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] is of biological significance. This movement is mimicked by many infectious particles - namely [[viroid]]s - to accomplish long ranged movement and consequently infection of an entire plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15373">[[File:Piergiorgio Welby.JPG|Piergiorgio Welby in late 2006.|thumb|right]]
'''Piergiorgio Welby''' ([[Rome]], 26 December 1945 - 20 December 2006) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[poet]], [[painting|painter]] and [[activism|activist]] whose three-month-long battle to establish his [[right to die]] led to a debate about [[euthanasia]] in his country.

Welby was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy as a teenager in the early 1960s. The disease progressed, and in 1997 he became unable to breathe on his own. He became politically active in the right-to-die movement, and in 2006 he publicly declared his wish to refuse the medical treatment that kept him alive. The case was controversial, with liberal politicians supporting him and conservatives and the Vatican speaking out against his cause. After three months, he was allowed to die, though he was denied a church burial.

==Life and career==

Born in [[Rome]], the son of [[Alfredo Welby]], a [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] playing for [[A.S. Roma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bolloli | first=Brunella | url=http://www.radicali.it/view.php?id=79344 | title=Da quarant'anni attendo la morte | publisher=Libero | date=2006-12-14 | accessdate=2007-01-24 | language=Italian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123617/http://www.radicali.it/view.php?id=79344 | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welby was diagnosed with [[muscular dystrophy]] at the age of 17.

During the 1960s, he became influenced by the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], extensively travelling throughout [[Europe]] from 1969 to 1971 and using [[drug]]s to help forget his disease; back in [[Italy]],
he devoted his life to poetry and painting, supporting himself by giving private lessons.

During the 1980s, he cured his drug dependency with the help of a [[methadone]]-based therapy which, while successfully detoxifying him, accelerated the progression of the disease, irreversibly paralyzing him from his waist down. At this time, he met his future wife Mina while she was traveling to Rome with her [[parish]].

On July 14, 1997, Welby suffered a [[Respiratory failure|respiratory insufficiency]] that left him completely unable to breathe naturally. He depended on [[mechanical ventilation]] and [[Feeding tube|artificial feeding]] and communicated through a [[Speech synthesis|speech-synthesizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Piergiorgio Welby: la biografia | url=http://www.lucacoscioni.it/welby_biografia | publisher=Associazione Luca Coscioni | accessdate=2007-01-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211025005/http://www.lucacoscioni.it/welby_biografia | archivedate=2007-02-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

The last years of his life were marked by [[activism]]. He joined the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Italian Radical Party]] and later the [[Associazione Luca Coscioni]], which named him co-president in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=V Congresso Associazione Coscioni: elette nuove cariche, lanciata mobilitazione straordinaria di 100 giorni | url=http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/6701 | publisher=Associazione Luca Coscioni | accessdate=2007-01-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200528/http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/6701 | archivedate=2007-09-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a group with close ties to the Radical Party, that advocates euthanasia, free access to [[assistive technology]] and freedom of [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. Welby used the [[Internet]] as his primary mean of communication by posting on [[Internet forum|web forums]] and, since 2003, on his own [[blog]].

On May 1, 2002 he posted a message with the title ''Eutanasia'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for euthanasia) on Radical Party's on line forum, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everything still? Worse than the desert of the Tartars. ... while staring at the horizon. ... terminal patients like me. ... envy the Dutch people. ... WAKE UP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=eutanasia | url=http://www.radicali.it/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3828&amp;start=20160 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040357/http://www.radicali.it/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3828&amp;start=20160 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-09-27 | publisher=Radical Party Forum | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of January 2007, the thread received over 20,000 replies.

In April 2003 he opened a blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Il pensiero magico | url=http://calibano.ilcannocchiale.it/?id_blogdoc=4869 | publisher=Piergiorgo Welby | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing his views on different topics, commenting on current political events and publishing small poems. Since his death, the blog has been maintained by his widow.

In May 2005, on the occasion of a [[referendum]] dealing, among other topics, with the use of human [[embryo]]s for [[stem cell]] research, he specifically asked his fellow Radical Party members to take him to his local [[polling station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radicali.it/view.php?id=79344 | title=Al voto con il respiratore | publisher=La Repubblica | date=2005-06-12 | accessdate=2007-01-25 | language=Italian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123617/http://www.radicali.it/view.php?id=79344 | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after his request to let disabled people who depend on [[life-support]] machinery to vote in their homes was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Negato il diritto di voto dei disabili | url=http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/5398 | publisher=Associazione Luca Coscioni | accessdate=2007-01-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200547/http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/5398 | archivedate=2007-09-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, a worsening of his muscular dystrophy paralyzed the finger which let him use the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], making him unable to use his [[computer]] and heavily limiting his communication. He decided to publicize his request to die, hoping to start a nationwide debate on euthanasia.

==Battle for euthanasia==

On September 22, 2006, Welby sent an open video-letter to Italian President [[Giorgio Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/09_Settembre/22/welby.shtml | title=Caro Presidente, lasciatemi morire | publisher=Corriere della Sera | date=2006-09-22 | accessdate=2007-01-26 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown on national [[television]] and made available for [[download]]ing on the Internet (see [[#Links|links]]), describing his condition and explaining his desire to die. Napolitano answered he felt deeply touched by Welby's situation, inviting Italian politicians to a [[parliamentary debate]] on this and similar complex [[ethics|ethical]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/7136 | title=Risposta del Presidente della Repubblica, Giorgio Napolitano, alla lettera aperta di Piergiorgio Welby. | publisher=Associazione Luca Coscioni | accessdate=2007-01-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128100530/http://www.lucacoscioni.it/node/7136 | archivedate=2007-01-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welby's case aroused a heated debate, involving political, ethical, religious and medical aspects. Radical Party members supported Welby's decision by organizing [[Hunger strike|hunger-strikes]] and [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]; party founder [[Marco Pannella]] declared his readiness to turn the machines off himself as an "act of [[civil disobedience]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/09/sezioni/cronaca/eutanasia-welby/pannella/pannella.html | title=Eutanasia, la provocazione di Pannella: "Pronto a staccare la spina a Welby" | publisher=La Repubblica | date=2006-09-22 | accessdate=2007-01-26 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Catholic]] politicians adhered to the official position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], opposing both euthanasia and aggressive medical treatment. On a televised debate, [[Javier Lozano Barragán|Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragán]] declared that stopping mechanical ventilation would only be 
acceptable if it were judged futile or disproportionate by his doctors.
Health Minister [[Livia Turco]] said that a parliamentary debate should focus more on improving palliative care rather than on euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/09_Settembre/23/turco.shtml | title=Bertinotti: "Giusto l'invito di Napolitano" | publisher=Corriere della Sera | date=2006-09-25 | accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head-physician and president of the "Italian Association of Sclerosis Patients",  [[Mario Melazzini]], had [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], a similar sickness to Welby's. Melazzini decided to speak in [[Rome]] with other ALS patients, asking the help of the State for the right of such people to life. He declared to the weekly newspaper ''Oggi'' that "''Only those who want death are listened to''".&lt;ref name="Oggi"&gt;"Ma noi malati come Welby, invochiamo il diritto alla vita", Oggi, 2006-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; That appeal gained the support of many Italians, including the writer [[Claudio Magris]] and the singer [[Ron (singer)|Ron]]. Subsequently, after Melazzini's statement, hundreds of patients (among them notable cases in medical ethics such as Nello Guerra Crescenzi, Enrico Canova, and Salvatore Crisafulli &amp;mdash; who was famous for having come out of a 2-year coma) wrote letters to Welby asking him to "''fight for his life''".&lt;ref name="Oggi"/&gt;

[[Oncology|Oncologist]] and long-time euthanasia supporter [[Umberto Veronesi]] and [[Surgery|surgeon]] [[Ignazio Marino]] said Welby's right to refuse medical treatment was granted  by [[Constitution of Italy|Italian constitution]] and by the [[code of conduct]] of the Italian [[medical association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ignaziomarino.it/news.asp?ID=3 | title=Marino, grave errore confondere eutanasia e consenso informato | publisher=Ignazio Marino | date=2006-12-07 | accessdate=2007-01-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221440/http://www.ignaziomarino.it/news.asp?ID=3 | archivedate=2007-09-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Welby's doctors noted that after switching off the ventilator, the code of conduct would force him to take proper action to revive the patient once he reached a state of [[unconsciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/cronaca/welby2/medico-welby/medico-welby.html | title=Welby, il medico non può staccare la spina "Devono decidere le autorità competenti" | publisher=La Repubblica | date=2006-11-28 | accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought to a court which denied the request, finding no specific law governed it and urging Parliament to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/12_Dicembre/16/welby.shtml | title=Il tribunale respinge il ricorso di Welby | publisher=Corriere della Sera | date=2006-12-10 | accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, [[Anesthesia|anesthetist]] Mario Riccio contacted Radical Party member [[Marco Cappato]], informing him that he would perform the operation, seeing no legal impediments. Doctor Riccio arrived in Rome and after ensuring Welby's request was voluntary and not dictated by external pressures,  decided to grant his request.

==Death and aftermath==

After the doctor agreed to his request, Welby asked to listen to [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''; as it was not available, he then chose [[Bob Dylan]]. The procedure started with [[sedation]] at 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 20 and ended at 11:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., when Welby was officially declared dead.

His death was announced the following morning by Marco Pannella on radio; further details were given at a [[News conference|press conference]] held some hours later.

[[File:Mina Welby.jpg|thumb|150px|The wife, Mina Welby, in 2011]]
Italian politicians were divided after his death. Members of the Radical Party and of left wing expressed sorrow for Welby's death, together with relief for ending his long suffering. On the other hand, members of the Italian conservative parties criticized the doctor and the political use of Welby's case. Luca Volonté, of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, 1997)|Christian Democrats]], requested the immediate arrest of "Welby's murderers." Despite strong pressure from public opinion, both the Ethical Committee of local Medical Association and the criminal court judged Doctor Riccio’s conduct to be legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/07/sezioni/cronaca/welby-medico/welby-medico/welby-medico.html Welby, prosciolto il medico Riccio Aveva il dovere di assecondare il malato] Repubblica.it, 23 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controversial move, Roman Catholic Church refused to allow a religious [[funeral]], officially declaring that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Welby had repeatedly and publicly affirmed his desire to end his own life, which is against Catholic doctrine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6204995.stm | title=Church denies funeral for Italian | publisher=BBC News | date=2006-12-22 | accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A civil funeral was celebrated in a public square in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6207857.stm | title=Hundreds attend Italian's funeral | date=2006-12-24 | accessdate=2007-01-27 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, commentators contrasted the church's denial of a ceremony for Welby with a ceremony for [[Vittorio Casamonica]], an alleged mafia boss.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34015420 Italy anger at 'Godfather' funeral for alleged Rome mafia boss] BBC 21 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution pricing reform (PPR) is the process of adjusting [[Market price|market prices]] to include direct [[Environmental issue|environmental impact]] on [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable]] parameters, as e.g. dust and gas exhaust from combustion engines especially in road traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://novascotia.ca/finance/docs/tr/FS-Pollution_Tax.pdf Pollution Tax Nova Scotia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_pdf/v54/p104_107.pdf Taxation on pollution]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach differs from general ecologic taxation schemes, where the measurability of the impact is not available on short term or direct comparison of the tax affected choice for investment or operation.

An externality (a type of market failure) exists where a market price omits pollution raise and affection. In such a situation, rational (self-interested) fiscal or individual decisions can lead to environmental harm, as well as to economic distortions and inefficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/Schriftenreihe_Oekologie__Nachhaltig_aus_der_Krise.pdf Nachhaltig aus der Krise]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pollution adjusted taxation schemes ==

Environmental pricing reform can be economy-wide, or more focused (e.g. specific to a sector (such as electric power generation or traffic) or a particular environmental issue (such as climate change). "Market based instruments" or "economic instrument for environmental protections" may be tailored according to measurable impact of [[pollution]] as an escape to the permanent neglection of climate impact by polluting technologies. 
Examples include [[Ecotax|green tax-shifting]] (ecotaxation), tradeable pollution permits, or the creation of markets for ecological technologies.

There are generally three types of options available:
* additional taxation on fuel types with typically higher quantities of dust or polluting gas exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fuelseurope.eu/policy-priorities/climate-energy/energy-taxation Energy taxation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307182910/https://www.fuelseurope.eu/policy-priorities/climate-energy/energy-taxation |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* annual taxation on engine types with typically higher quantities of dust or polluting gas exhaust after catalysating afterburners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueltaxinquiry.treasury.gov.au/content/backgnd/002.asp Fuel tax enquiry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pregaming''' (also '''pre-drinking'''&lt;ref name=VanderVen /&gt; or '''pre-loading'''&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;) is the process of getting [[drunk]] prior to going out socializing, typically done by college students and young adults in the United States and Europe,&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt; in a manner as cost-efficient as possible, with [[hard liquor]] and cheap beer consumed while in small groups.&lt;ref name=VanderVen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gold /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koutsoudakis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;

Although pregaming is typically done before a night out, it can also precede other activities, like attending a [[college football]] game, large party, social function, or another activity where possession of alcohol may be limited or prohibited.&lt;ref name=VanderVen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cimarusti /&gt;&lt;ref name=Munzenrieder /&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaza /&gt;  The name "pregaming" spread from the drinking that took place during [[tailgate party|tailgating]] before football games to encompass similar drinking periods.&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;

Other terms for the practice are '''pre-partying''',&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt; '''prinking'''&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt; and (in Europe) '''prefunking'''.&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt;

==Background==

===Origins===
Pregaming first became popular in the United States in the 1990s, becoming a common practice after [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] pressured the [[United States federal government|federal government]] to coerce states into increasing the [[legal drinking age]] in the United States to 21.&lt;ref name=Seaman /&gt; It is also an [[unintended consequence]] of alcohol laws that prohibit [[happy hours]] and other discounts on alcohol,&lt;ref name=Wells /&gt; as well as rising [[tuition]] and other costs for students.&lt;ref name=Gillespie /&gt; Pregaming minimizes the cost of purchasing alcohol at local bars and clubs and can reduce the problems associated with obtaining and using [[fake identification]] listing an age permitting legal consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koutsoudakis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;  The high cost of bar tabs in nightlife and the difficult financial situations often faced by students and young adults has been a major factor increasing the rate of pregaming.&lt;ref name=Holland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;

Pregaming appeals to persons under 21 years of age who may not otherwise legally enter bars or purchase alcohol in the United States.&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt; Pregaming also ensures that the drinker is drunk before going out in public, lessens inhibitions, and can stall the going-on process so that the group enters the local nightlife scene at a more exciting hour.&lt;ref name=Holland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;

===Pervasiveness===
Experts believe that 65 to 75 percent of college-age youths predrink,&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt; while in the UK, a study reported that 55 percent of men and 60 percent of women acknowledged pre-drinking.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Researchers believe that the practice is becoming more widespread due to changing cultural mores, alcohol laws, and economics.&lt;ref name=Gillespie /&gt;

==Effects==

===Local business===
Local bars and clubs lose business from pregaming both because students purchase alcohol elsewhere and because pregaming can delay students' arrival, pushing these businesses toward failure.&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt;  Young adults often don't arrive until 11:30 pm or midnight, relatively near the [[Last call (bar term)|time bars are required to close]] in many [[U.S. states]].&lt;ref name= Holland /&gt;

Local bars might sell only one or two drinks to students who have consumed alcohol heavily earlier in the night.&lt;ref name=Gillespie /&gt;  In addition, nightlife establishments may become liable for fines and civil and criminal penalties under local laws prohibiting the serving of alcohol to an intoxicated person or permitting a person to be intoxicated in the bar, even when that person pregamed elsewhere and entered the bar before the alcohol caused intoxication.&lt;ref name=Gillespie /&gt;

===Health===
Pregaming has been associated with [[binge drinking]] and other dangerous activities, leading some universities to attempt to crack down on the practice.&lt;ref name=McMahon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grazian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Seaman /&gt; Government agencies at both the state and federal level have studied the problems created by pregaming.&lt;ref name=Koutsoudakis /&gt;

The furtive nature of pregaming and bingeing can lead to massive quick consumption, acute [[alcohol poisoning]], hospitalization, and death.&lt;ref name=Seaman /&gt;

A 2012 study of more 250 Swiss students indicated that those who "pre-loaded" ended up consuming more total alcohol over the night (seven drinks rather than four) and engaged in riskier behavior.&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt;  They had a 24% chance of reporting negative consequences from drinking (such as injury, unprotected sex, and unplanned drug use), compared to 18% chance for those who did not pre-drink.&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt;

The '''social determinants of health in poverty''' describe the factors that affect impoverished populations' [[health]] and [[health inequality]]. [[Health equity|Inequalities]] in health stem from the conditions of people's lives, including [[living conditions]], work environment, [[ageing|age]], and other social factors, and how these affect people's ability to respond to [[illness]].&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; These conditions are also shaped by political, social, and economic structures.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  The majority of people around the globe do not meet their potential best health because of a "toxic combination of bad policies, economics, and politics".&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Daily living conditions work together with these structural drivers to result in the social determinants of health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

[[Poverty]] and poor health are inseparably linked.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Poverty has many dimensions – material deprivation (of food, [[shelter (building)|shelter]], [[sanitation]], and safe drinking water), [[social exclusion]], lack of education, [[unemployment]], and low income – that all work together to reduce opportunities, limit choices, undermine hope, and, as a result, threaten health.&lt;ref name=char&gt;{{cite report | first1= Charlotte | last1 = Loppie | first2 = Fred | last2 = Wien | work = National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health. | title = Health Inequalities and Social determinants of Aboriginal People's Health | publisher = University of Victoria | date = 2009 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.476.3081&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty has been linked to higher prevalence of many health conditions, including increased risk of [[chronic disease]], injury, deprived infant development, stress, anxiety, depression, and [[premature death]].&lt;ref name="char" /&gt; According to Loppie and Wien, these health afflictions of poverty most burden outlying groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and the disabled.&lt;ref name="char" /&gt; [[Social determinants of health]] – like [[child development]], [[education]], living and [[working conditions]], and [[healthcare]]&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite report | publisher = World Health Organization. | work = Commission on Social Determinants of Health | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf | title = Closing the Gap in a Generation- Health equity through action and the social determinants of health | location = Geneva | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;- are of special importance to the impoverished.

According to Moss, socioeconomic factors that affect impoverished populations such as education, [[income inequality]], and [[Job (role)|occupation]], represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality.&lt;ref name=gend&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moss NE | year = 2002 | title = Gender equity and socioeconomic inequality: a framework for the patterning of women's health; Social &amp; Economic Patterning of Women's Health in a Changing World | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 5| pages = 649–661 | doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's lives, like individuals' access to health care, [[schools]], their conditions of work and [[leisure]], [[households]], communities, towns, or cities,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the [[World Health Organization]]. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is not by any means natural, "but is the result of a toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics".&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the social determinants of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Along with these social conditions, "Gender, education, occupation, income, [[ethnicity]], and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care."&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Social determinants of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as [[racism]], [[gender inequality]], poverty, violence, and war.&lt;ref name="med"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer PE, Nizeye B, Stulac S, Keshavjee S | title = Structural violence and clinical medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the development status of a nation.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the social determinants of health determine the distribution of human dignity.&lt;ref name=teal&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy K, Chaudhuri A | title = Influence of socioeconomic status, wealth and financial empowerment on gender differences in health and healthcare utilization in later life: evidence from India | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 66 | issue = 9 | pages = 1951–62 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18313185 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.015 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953608000415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and measurements==
Social determinants of health in poverty reveal inequalities in health. [[Health]] is defined "as feeling sound, well, vigorous, and physically able to do things that most people ordinarily can do".&lt;ref name=edu&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John | last1 = Mirowsky | first2 = Catherine E. | last2 = Ross | name-list-format = vanc | title = Education, social status, and health | location = New York | publisher = Walter de Gruyter, Inc. | year = 2003 | pages = 1–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of health take several forms including subjective health reports completed by individuals and surveys that measure physical impairment, vitality and well being, diagnosis of serious chronic disease, and expected life longevity.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] defines the social determinants of health as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age" ,&lt;ref name="Viner_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viner RM, Ozer EM, Denny S, Marmot M, Resnick M, Fatusi A, Currie C | title = Adolescence and the social determinants of health | language = English | journal = Lancet | volume = 379 | issue = 9826 | pages = 1641–52 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22538179 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60149-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conditions that are determined by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels.&lt;ref name="Viner_2012" /&gt; There exist two main determinants of health: structural and proximal determinants. Structural determinants include societal divisions between social, economic, and political contexts, and lead to differences in power, status, and privilege within society. Proximal determinants are immediate factors present in daily life such as family and household relationships, peer and work relationships, and educational environments.&lt;ref name="Viner_2012" /&gt; Proximal determinants are influenced by the social stratification caused by structural determinants. According to the [[World Health Organization]], social determinants of health include early [[child development]], [[globalization]], [[health systems]], measurement and evidence, urbanization, employment conditions, [[social exclusion]], public health conditions, and women and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Different exposures and vulnerabilities to disease and injury determined by social, occupational, and physical environments and conditions, result in more or less vulnerability to poor health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council recognized two distinct forms of social determinants for health- [[social position]] and socioeconomic and political context. The following divisions are adapted from World Health Organization's Social Determinants Conceptual Framework for explaining and understanding social determinants of health.

==Social position==

===Poverty gradient and severity===
Within the impoverished population exists a wide range of real income, from less than $2 USD a day, to the United States [[poverty threshold]],&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; which is $22,350 for a family of four.&lt;ref name=povguide&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = US. Department of Health and Human Services. | title = The 2011 HHS Poverty Guidelines | journal = Federal Register | volume = 76 | issue = 13 | date = January 20, 2011 | pages = 3637–3638 | url = http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/11poverty.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within impoverished populations, being relatively versus absolutely impoverished can determine health outcomes, in their severity and type of ailment. According to the World Health Organization, the poorest of all, globally, are the least healthy.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Those in the lowest economic distribution of health, [[marginalized]] and excluded, and countries whose historical exploitation and inequality in global institutions of power and policy-making, suffer the worst health outcomes.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; As such, two broad categories distinguish between relative severity of poverty. [[Absolute poverty]] is the severe deprivation of basic human needs such as food, safe drinking water and shelter, and is used as a minimum standard below which no one should fall regardless of where they live. It is measured in relation to the 'poverty line' or the lowest amount of money needed to sustain human life.&lt;ref name=char /&gt; [[Relative poverty]] is "the inability to afford the goods, services, and activities needed to fully participate in a given society."&lt;ref name=char /&gt; Relative poverty still results in bad health outcomes because of the diminished [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of the impoverished.&lt;ref name=WDR12&gt;{{cite book | publisher = World Bank | title = World Development Report 2012, Gender Equality and Education | location = Washington DC | year = 2012 | page = 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain personal, household factors, such as living conditions, are more or less unstable in the lives of the impoverished and represent the determining factors for health amongst the poverty gradient.&lt;ref name=child&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mosley WH, Chen LC | title = An analytical framework for the study of child survival in developing countries. 1984 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–5 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12756980 | pmc = 2572391 | doi = 10.2307/2807954 | jstor = 2807954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mosley, these factors prove challenging to individuals in poverty and are responsible for health deficits amongst the general impoverished population.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Having sufficient access to a minimum amount of food that is nutritious and sanitary plays an important part in building health and reducing [[disease transmission]].&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Access to sufficient amounts of quality water for drinking, bathing, and food preparation determines health and exposure to disease.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Clothing that provides appropriate climatic protection and resources to wash clothes and bedding appropriately to prevent irritation, rashes, and parasitic life are also important to health.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;[[House|Housing]], including size, quality, [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], [[crowding]], [[sanitation]], and separation, prove paramount in determining health and spread of disease.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Availability of fuel for adequate sterilizing of eating utensils and food and the preservation of food proves necessary to promote health.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Transportation, which provides access to [[medical care]], shopping, and employment, proves absolutely essential.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Hygienic and [[preventative care]], including soap and [[insecticides]], and vitamins and [[contraceptives]], are necessary for maintaining health.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Differential access to these life essentials depending on ability to afford with a given income results in differential health.

===Gender===
[[Gender]] can determine health inequity in general health and particular diseases, and is especially magnified in poverty. Socioeconomic inequality is often cited as the fundamental cause for differential health outcomes among men and women.&lt;ref name="Adler_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler NE, Ostrove JM | title = Socioeconomic status and health: what we know and what we don't | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 896 | issue = | pages = 3–15 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10681884 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08101.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huisman_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huisman M, Kunst AE, Mackenbach JP | title = Socioeconomic inequalities in morbidity among the elderly; a European overview | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–73 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12850111 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00454-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonough_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonough P, Walters V | title = Gender and health: reassessing patterns and explanations | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–59 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11206652 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00159-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teal /&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], the health gap between the impoverished and other populations will only be closed if the lives of women are improved and gender inequalities are solved. Therefore, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] sees [[gender empowerment]] as key in achieving fair distribution of health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; The rate at which girls and women die relative to men is higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. "Globally, girls missing at birth and deaths from excess female mortality after birth add up to 6 million women a year, 3.9 million below the age of 60. Of the 6 million, one-fifth is never born, one-tenth dies in early childhood, one- fifth in the reproductive years, and two-fifths at older ages.&lt;ref name="WDR12"/&gt; Excess female deaths have persisted and even increased in countries immensely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, like South Africa.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; In South Africa, excess female mortality between 10 and 50 years of age rose from close to zero to 74,000 deaths per year in 2008.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; In impoverished populations, there are pronounced differences in the types of illnesses and injuries men and women contract. According to Ward, poor women have more [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], cancer, and [[infant mortality]].&lt;ref name=HIV&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward MC | title = A different disease: HIV/AIDS and health care for women in poverty | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–30 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8112085 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor women also have significant [[comorbidity]], or existence of two ailments, such as psychiatric disorders with psychoactive substance use.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; They are also at greater risk for contracting endemic conditions like [[tuberculosis]], diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Women of low socioeconomic status in urban areas are more liable to contract sexually transmitted diseases and have unplanned pregnancies.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Global studies demonstrate that risk for contracting cervical cancer, exclusive to women, increases as socioeconomic status decreases.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt;

====Household causes====
Health of poor women is impacted by gender inequalities through discriminating distribution of household goods, domestic violence, lack of agency, and unfair distribution of work, leisure, and opportunities between each gender.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; The way in which resources such as income, [[nourishment]], and [[emotional support]] are traded in the [[household]] influences women's psychosocial health, [[nutrition]], [[wellness (medicine)|wellness]], access to healthcare services, and threat of [[violence]].&lt;ref name=child /&gt; The exchange of these elements in a home mediates in the impacts of geographical, cultural, and household patterns that result in inequality in health status and outcomes.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;  Health-related behaviors, access and use of healthcare, stress, and psychosocial resources like [[social ties]], [[coping (psychology)|coping]], and [[spirituality]] all serve as factors that mediate health inequality.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; Household discrimination causes missing girls at birth, and the persistence of discrimination and poor service delivery perpetuates high female mortality.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt;

====Societal causes====
Socioeconomic status has long been related to health, those higher in the social hierarchy typically enjoy better health than do those below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler NE, Boyce T, Chesney MA, Cohen S, Folkman S, Kahn RL, Syme SL | title = Socioeconomic status and health. The challenge of the gradient | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–24 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8122813 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.49.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to [[socioeconomic]] factors, poor institutions of [[public health]] and services can cause worse health in women.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; According to Moss, components of the geopolitical system that spawn gender and economic inequality, such as [[history]] of a nation, [[geography]], policy, services, [[legal rights]], [[organizations]], institutions, and social structures, are all determinants of women's health in poverty.&lt;ref name=gend /&gt; These structures, like socieo-demographic status and culture, norms and sanctions, shape women's productive role in the workplace and reproductive role in the household, which determines health.&lt;ref name=gend /&gt; Women's social capital, gender roles, psychological stress, social resources, healthcare, and behavior form the social, economic, and cultural effects on health outcomes.&lt;ref name=gend /&gt;  Also, women facing financial difficulty are more likely to report chronic conditions of health,&lt;ref name=pat&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonough P | year = 2001 | title = Gender and health: reassessing patterns and explanations | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–559 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00159-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs often in the lives of the impoverished. Socioeconomic inequality is often cited as the fundamental cause for differential health outcomes among men and women.&lt;ref name="Adler_1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huisman_2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonough_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=teal /&gt; Differences in socioeconomic status and resulting financial disempowerment for women explain the poorer health and lower healthcare utilization noted among older women compared to men in India, according to a study.&lt;ref name=teal /&gt; According to another study, psycho-social factors also contribute to differences in reported health.&lt;ref name=teal /&gt; First, women might report higher levels of health problems as a result of differential exposure or reduced access to material and social factors that foster health and well-being (Arber &amp; Cooper, 1999)&lt;ref name=teal /&gt; Second, women might report higher health problems because of differential vulnerability to material, behavioral, and psychosocial factors that foster health.&lt;ref name="McDonough_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=teal /&gt;

====Prenatal and maternal health====
[[Prenatal care]] also plays a role in the health of women and their children, with excess infant mortality in impoverished populations and nations representing these differentials in health. According to Ward, poverty is the strongest predictor of insufficient prenatal care,&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; which is caused by three factors that reduce access. These include socieodemographic factors (such as age, ethnicity, marital status, and education), systematic barriers, and barriers based on lack of knowledge, attitudes and life-styles.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Several studies show the complex associations between poverty and [[education]], [[employment]], teen births, and the health of the mother and child. In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations.&lt;ref name=below /&gt; Furthermore, increased rates of postpartum depression were found in mothers belonging to low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Goyal_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goyal D, Gay C, Lee KA | title = How much does low socioeconomic status increase the risk of prenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms in first-time mothers? | language = English | journal = Women's Health Issues | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 96–104 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20133153 | doi = 10.1016/j.whi.2009.11.003 | pmc = 2835803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differential health for men====

There also exist differentials in health with respect to men. In many post-transition countries, like the [[Russian Federation]], excess female mortality is not a problem, but rather there has been an increase in mortality risks for men.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; Evidence suggests that excess male mortality correlates with behavior considered socially acceptable among men, including smoking, binge drinking, and risky activities.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt;  According to Moss, "Women are more likely to experience role strain and overload that occur when familial responsibilities are combined with occupation-related stress."&lt;ref name=gend /&gt;

=== Age ===
Social determinants can have differential effects on health outcomes based on age group.

==== Youth health ====
Adolescent health has been proven to be influenced by both structural and proximal determinants, but structural determinants play the more significant role. Structural determinants such as national wealth, income inequality, and access to education have been found to affect adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Viner_2012"/&gt; Additionally, proximal determinants such as school and household environments are influenced by stratification created by structural determinants, can also affect adolescent health. Access to education was determined to be the most influential structural determinant affecting adolescent health.Proximal determinants include household and community factors, such as household environment, familial relationships, peer relationships, access to adequate food, and opportunities for recreation and activity.&lt;ref name="Viner_2012" /&gt; The most influential proximal determinant has proven to be family affluence.&lt;ref name="WHO_2010"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hbsc.unito.it/it/images/pdf/hbsc/prelims-part1.pdf | title = Social determinants of health and well-being among young people: International report from the 2009/2010 survey | date = 2010 | work = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; Family affluence directly affects [[food security]], which correlates with adolescent nutrition and health. Family affluence also influences participation in regular physical activity. While nutrition and physical activity promote physical well-being, both promote psychological health as well.&lt;ref name="WHO_2010" /&gt; Thus family affluence is correlated with reduced psychological stress during adolescence. Family affluence also affects access to healthcare services; however, in countries with universal healthcare systems, youth belonging to less-affluent households still display poorer health than adolescents from wealthier families.&lt;ref name="Schreier_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schreier HM, Chen E | title = Socioeconomic status and the health of youth: a multilevel, multidomain approach to conceptualizing pathways | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages = 606–54 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22845752 | pmc = 3500451 | doi = 10.1037/a0029416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of chronic diseases&lt;ref name="Hanson_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanson MD, Chen E | title = Socioeconomic status and health behaviors in adolescence: a review of the literature | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–85 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17514418 | doi = 10.1007/s10865-007-9098-3 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10865-007-9098-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as obesity and diabetes, as well as cigarette smoking&lt;ref name="Green_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Green MJ, Leyland AH, Sweeting H, Benzeval M | title = Socioeconomic position and early adolescent smoking development: evidence from the British Youth Panel Survey (1994-2008) | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–10 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 25380762 | doi = 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were found in adolescents aged 10–21 belonging to low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Hanson_2007" /&gt;

==== Infant health ====
Poverty during pregnancy has been reported to cause a wide range of disparities in newborns. Low maternal socioeconomic status has been correlated with low infant birth weight and preterm delivery,&lt;ref name="Parker_1994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker JD, Schoendorf KC, Kiely JL | title = Associations between measures of socioeconomic status and low birth weight, small for gestational age, and premature delivery in the United States | journal = Annals of Epidemiology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–8 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7921316 | url = https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/1047279794900825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; physical complications such as ectopic pregnancy, poorer infant physical condition, compromised immune system and increased susceptibility to illness, and prenatal infant death.&lt;ref name="Larson_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Larson CP | title = Poverty during pregnancy: Its effects on child health outcomes | journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 673–7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 19030445 | pmc = 2528810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of children born into poor families have at least one chronic disease.&lt;ref name="HIV" /&gt; Infant mental complications include delayed cognitive development, poor academic performance, and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Larson_2007" /&gt; Poor women display greater rates of smoking,&lt;ref name="Comstock_1971"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Comstock GW, Shah FK, Meyer MB, Abbey H | title = Low birth weight and neonatal mortality rate related to maternal smoking and socioeconomic status | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 111 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–9 | date = September 1971 | pmid = 5107001 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(71)90926-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alcohol consumption, and engagement in risky behaviors.&lt;ref name="Larson_2007" /&gt; Such risk factors function as stressors that, in combination with social factors such as crowded and unhygienic living environments, financial difficulties, and unemployment, affect fetus health.&lt;ref name="Larson_2007" /&gt;

===Ethnicity ===
[[Ethnicity]] can play an especially large part in determining health outcomes for impoverished minorities. Poverty can overpower race, but within poverty, race highly contributes to health outcomes.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; [[African Americans]], even in some of the wealthiest cities in the [[United States]], have lower life expectancy at birth than people in much poorer countries like [[China]] or [[India]].&lt;ref name=path /&gt; In the United States, specifically for African American women, as of 2013 for every 100,000 births 43.5 black women would not survive compared to the 12.7 of white women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pmss.html|title=Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System |date=November 9, 2017| publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to studies, black individuals in [[South Africa]] suffer worse morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited access to social resources.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; Poverty is the chief cause of the endemic amounts of disease and [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] among this population.&lt;ref name=path&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = Paul | title = Pathologies of power: health, human rights, and the new war on the poor. | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2003 | location = Los Angeles | page = 8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2sbP7J-lckoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; A disproportionate number of cases of the AIDS epidemic in North America are from American minorities, with 72% of women's AIDS cases among Hispanic or African-American women.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Among those American minorities, African Americans comprise 12% of the American population yet, made up 45% of new HIV diagnoses. Blacks in American account for the highest proportion of those living with HIV and AIDS in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/africanamericans/index.html | title = HIV/AIDS Among African Americans | date = October 26, 2017 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer says the growing mortality differentials between whites and blacks must be attributed to class differentials-&lt;ref name="path" /&gt; which includes recognizing race within impoverished populations. Recognition of race as a determining factor for poor health without recognizing poverty has misled individuals to believe race is the only factor.&lt;ref name="HIV" /&gt;

[[Race and health|Health differentials amongst races]] can also serve as determining factors for other facets of life, including income and marital status.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; AIDS-affected Hispanic women hold smaller salaries than average women, are part of poorer families, and are more likely to head households.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; According to one study, black teenage women living in dysfunctional homes were more likely to have serious health issues for themselves or children.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt;

===Education===
[[Poverty#Education|Education plays an especially influential part in the lives of the impoverished]]. According to Mirowsky and Ross, education determines other factors of livelihood like occupation and income that determines income, which determines health outcomes.&lt;ref name=edu /&gt; Education is a major social determinant of health, with educational attainment related to improved health outcomes, due to its effect on income, employment, and living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = Catherine E. | last2 = Wu | first2 = Chia-ling | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Links Between Education and Health | journal = American Sociological Review | date = October 1995 | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 719 | doi = 10.2307/2096319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cutler_2006"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Education and Health: Evaluating Theories and Evidence | first1 = David M. | last1 = Cutler | first2 = Adriana | last2 = Lleras-Muney | name-list-format = vanc | veditors = House J, Schoeni R, Kaplan G, Pollack H | title = Making Americans Healthier: Social and Economic Policy as Health Policy | location = New York | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation | date = July 2006 | doi = 10.3386/w12352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = David E. | last1 = Bloom | first2 = David | last2 = Canning | first3 = Gunther | last3 = Fink | year = 2014 | title = Disease and Development Revisited | journal = Journal of Political Economy, | publisher = University of Chicago Press | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 1355–1366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Social resources, such as education, determine life expectancy and infant mortality, which measures health.&lt;ref name=HHS&gt;{{cite report | title = Health, United States 2010 | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Center for Disease Control and Prevention. National Center for Health Statistics | date = 2010 | location = Hyattsville, MD. | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus10.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education has a lasting, continuous, and increasing effect on health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Education is a special determinant of health because it enables people toward self-direction, which leads them to seek goals such as health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Education helps the impoverished develop usable skills, abilities, and resources that help individuals reach goals, including bettering health.&lt;ref name=edu /&gt; Parent's educational level is also important to health, which influences the health of children and the future population. Parent's education level also determines child health, survival, and their educational attainment (Caldwell, 1986; Cleland &amp; Van Ginneken, 1988).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  "Children born to more educated mothers are less likely to die in infancy and more likely to have higher birth weights and be immunized.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; Studies in the United States suggest maternal education results in higher parity, greater use of prenatal care, and lower smoking rates, which positively affects child health.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; An increase in child schooling in Taiwan during the educational reform of 1968 reduced the infant morality rate by 11%, saving 1 infant per 1000 births.&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt;

"Fig. 2.1 shows variation between countries in infant mortality from just over 20/1000 live births in [[Colombia]] to just over 120 in [[Mozambique]].  It also shows inequities within countries – an infant's chances of survival are closely related to her mother's education. In [[Bolivia]], babies born to women with no education have infant mortality greater than 100 per 1000 live births; the infant mortality rate of babies born to mothers with at least secondary education is under 40/1000.All countries included in Fig. 2.1 show the survival disadvantage of children born to women with no education."&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

===Occupation===
Impoverished workers are more likely to hold part-time jobs, move in and out of work, be migrant workers, or experience stress associated with being unemployed and searching unsuccessfully for unemployment, which all in turn affects health outcomes.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which are more likely for low-status jobs.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% excess risk of heart disease (Stansfeld &amp; Candy, 2006).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions. (EMCONET, 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  In high- income countries, there has been a growth in job insecurity and precarious employment arrangements (such as informal work, temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections. Informal work can threaten health through its precarious job instability, lack of regulation to protect working conditions and occupational health and safety.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Evidence from the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] suggests mortality is greater among temporary workers than permanent workers. (Kivimaki et al., 2003).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Since most of the global workforce operates under the informal economy, particularly low- and middle-income countries,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; impoverished populations are greatly affected by these factors.

==Socioeconomic and political context==

===Location===

====Nation-state/geographical region====
Which particular nation an impoverished person lives in deeply affects health outcomes. This can be attributed to governmental, environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Using life expectancy as a measure of health indicates a difference between countries in likeliness of living to a certain age. Where people are born dramatically impacts their life chances. High-income countries like [[Japan]] or [[Sweden]] have a life expectancy of 80 years, [[Brazil]]-72, [[India]]-63.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] cites that for rich countries, only 56 (Iceland) to 107 (US) of 1000 adults between 15 and 60 years old will die each year, while Western and Central African countries have adult mortality rates exceeding 300 and 400 of every 1000. The rates are even higher in African nations suffering the AIDS epidemic, such as [[Zimbabwe]] where 772 of 1000 adults die each year (WHO 2010).&lt;ref name=WDR12 /&gt; Also, the type of health affliction varies by countries for populations in poverty.  Over 80% of [[cardiovascular disease]] deaths, that totaled 17.5 million people globally in 2005, occur in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]],13500 people die from smoking every day, and soon it will become the leading cause of death in developing countries, just as in high income countries. (Mathers &amp; Loncar, 2005).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

Infant and [[maternal mortality]] also reveals disparity in health between nations. There exist great inequalities in infant death rates within and between countries, ranging from 20/10000 births in Columbia to 120/10000 in Mozambique.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations.&lt;ref name=below&gt;{{cite journal | last = Farmer | first = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1996 | title = On Suffering and Structural Violence: A View from Below | journal = Social Suffering | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 261–283 | jstor = 20027362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urban or rural location====

=====Urban=====
The location where people live affects their health and life outcomes,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; which means impoverished people's health outcomes are especially determined by whether they live in a [[metropolitan area]] or rural area.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; With the prevalence of inner city [[ghettos]] and [[slums]] around the globe in cities, with approximately 1 billion people living in slums globally,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; living situation is an especially strong determinant of health in poverty. Urban areas present health risks through poor living conditions, limited food resources, traffic accidents, and [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;  Urbanization is immensely altering public health problems, particularly for the poor, by directing it towards non-communicable diseases, accidental and violent injuries, and death and health impacts from ecological disaster. (Capbell &amp;Campbell, 2007; Yusuf et al., 2001).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Daily living conditions enormously impact health equity too.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Equity in living conditions, such as access to quality housing and clean water and hygiene, have been greatly degraded in urban areas by increasing [[car dependence]], land use for roads, inconvenience of non-car transportation, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and lack of physical activity (NHF, 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; The challenges of urban areas, such as high population density, crowding, unsuitable living conditions, and little social support, provide a special challenge to the disabled and populations in low and middle income countries(Frumkin et al., 2004).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

*[[Obesity]]: Obesity is a paramount problem, especially among the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra &amp; Satcher, 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the [[nutrition transition]] that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and '[[supersized]]' portions" (Dixon et al., 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, the extent to which streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward physical inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra &amp; Satcher, 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;
*Crime: Violence and crime are major urban health challenges. Worldwide, 90% of the 1.6 million annual violent deaths occur in low and middle income counties(WHO, 2002).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; A large number of deaths and injuries occur because of crime, which affects health.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;
*Traffic: Individuals in ghettos and urban areas are the most affected by traffic injuries and vehicle-created air pollution, which causes 800,000 annual deaths due to air pollution, and 1.2 million from traffic accidents. (Roberts &amp; Meddings, 2007; Prüss- Üstün &amp; Corvalán, 2006).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; This results in greater health risks, like death,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;  for impoverished populations in cities.
*Mental illness: Living in a ghetto increases the likelihood of developing a mental illness, especially in children. People in this environment are less likely to receive effective mental health services. Children exposed to ongoing poverty, present in a ghetto, present a high level of depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, peer conflict and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;(McLeod &amp; Shanahan, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health symptoms are increased in the ghetto due to exposure to community crime, gang induced violence, neighborhood drug infestations, and substandard housing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;(González 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other: In the United States, HIV is more prevalent in cities along the east coast, with prevalence among African-American women in cities 5 to 15 times higher than for women in all areas of that state.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt;  "Inner-city women are the most likely of all in the United States to birth dead or extremely sick babies, partially because the massive erosion of prenatal care availability in their area.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Slums, made up exclusively of extremely poor populations, provide a particularly strong threat for poor health. Child mortality in the slums of Nairobi, which 60% of the population inhabits, is 2.5 times greater than in other areas of the city.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; In the slums of Manila, 39% of children have TB, which is twice the national average.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

=====Rural=====
Living in a rural community, whether in the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, [[health insurance]], and changes health culture.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=child /&gt;&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health disadvantages exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; The National Health Interview Survey indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage.&lt;ref name=rural /&gt; Demographic and socioeconomic factors vary between rural and urban areas, which contributes to some health disparities.&lt;ref name=rural&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Mark S. | last1 = Eberhardt | first2 = Elsie R. | last2 = Pamuk | name-list-format = vanc | title = he Importance of Place of Residence: Examining Health in Rural and Nonrural Areas | journal = American Journal of Public Health | date = October 2004 | volume = 94 | issue = 10 | pages = 1682–1686 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.94.10.1682 | pmc = 1448515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For extremely poor rural communities, variables in the community, like ecological setting, including climate, soil, rainfall, temperature, altitude, and [[seasonality]] greatly impact health.&lt;ref name=child /&gt; "In rural subsistence societies, these variables can have strong influence on child survival by affecting the quantity and variety of food crops produced, the availability and quality of water, vector-borne [[disease transmission]]"&lt;ref name=child /&gt;

===Governance/policy===
Type and structure of governments and their social and economic policy more deeply affects the health of the impoverished than other populations.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Every component of government- from finance, education, housing, employment, transportation, and [[health policy]]- affects population health and health equity.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Life expectancy variation between countries can be partially attributed to the type of political regime, whether that be [[fascist]], [[communist]], [[conservative]], or [[social-democratic]].&lt;ref name=dia /&gt; However, changing the status of government regime does not always end the type of policies in place, as seen in South Africa. The end of South Africa's apartheid regime has still not dismantled the structures of inequality and oppression, which has led the persistent social inequality to perpetuate the spread of HIV, diminishing population health.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; Also, the political economy, encompassing production organization, physical [[infrastructure]], and political institutions [9] play a large role in determining health inequalities.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;

===Social service and healthcare availability===

[[File:CDC healthcare source adults.png|600px|Image: 600 pixels|right|alt=health care source|No usual source of healthcare due to weak social safety net]]

Impoverished people depend on healthcare and other social services to be provided in the [[social safety net]], therefore availability greatly determines health outcomes. Since low living standards greatly influence health inequity, generous social protection systems result in greater population health, with lower mortality rates, especially in disadvantaged populations.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Nations that have more generous social protection systems have better population health (Lundberg et al., 2007).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; More generous family policies correlate with lower infant mortality.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Nations that offered higher coverage and reimbursement for pensions and sickness, unemployment, and employment accident insurance have a higher LEB (Lundberg et al., 2007), as well as countries with more liberal pensions have less senior mortality. (Lundberg et al., 2007)&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

====Healthcare====
The health care system represents a social determinant of health as well as it influences other determining factors. People's access to health care, their experiences there, and the benefits they gain are closely related to other social determinants of health like income, gender, education, ethnicity, occupation, and more.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; For poor people, systematic barriers in the social structure are formidable, especially financing.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; Medicaid and maternity coverage structures have complex and time-consuming registration processes, along with long waits and unsure eligibility.&lt;ref name=HIV /&gt; 
Inequalities in health are also determined by these socioeconomic and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Health care is inequitably distributed globally, with pronounced inequality for the poor in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; One study demonstrated that doctors treat poor populations differently, showing that disadvantaged patients are less likely to receive the recommended diabetic treatments and are more likely to undergo hospitalization due to the complications of diabetes (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, 2003).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], healthcare systems can most improve health equality when institutions are organized to provide universal coverage, where everyone receives the same quality healthcare regardless of ability to pay, as well as a Primary Healthcare system rather than emergency center assistance.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

These structural problems result in worse healthcare and therefore worse health outcomes for impoverished populations. Health care costs can pose absolutely serious threats to impoverished populations, especially in countries without proper social provisions. According to US HHS, "In 2009, children 6–17 years of age were more likely to be uninsured than younger children, and children with a family income below 200% of the poverty level were more likely to be uninsured than children in higher-income families."&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; In elderly populations, individuals below 400% of the poverty line were between 3 and 5 times more likely to lack insurance.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; Children below 200% of the poverty line were also less likely to have insurance than wealthier families.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; Also, in 2009 in the US, 20% of adults (ages 18–64) below 200% of the poverty line did not receive their necessary drugs because of cost, compared to only 4% of those above 400% of the poverty line.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; This can be seen in other nations, where in Asia, payments for healthcare pushed almost 3% of the population of 11 countries below 1 US$ per day.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

===Societal psychological influences===
In impoverished communities, different [[social norms]] and stressors exist than in other populations, which can greatly affect health outcomes in disadvantaged populations.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; According to the National Institutes of Health, "low socioeconomic status may result in poor physical and/or mental health ... through various psychosocial mechanisms such as poor or "risky" health-related behaviors, social exclusion, prolonged and/ or heightened stress, loss of sense of control, and low self-esteem as well as through differential access to proper nutrition and to health and social services (National Institutes of Health 1998)."&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt; These stressors can cause physiological alterations including increased cortisol, changed blood-pressure, and reduced immunity which increases their risks for poor health.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt;

===Structural violence===
Underlying social structures that propagate and perpetuate poverty and suffering- [[structural violence]]- majorly determine health outcomes of impoverished populations. Poor and unequal living conditions result from deeper structural conditions, including "poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics,"&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; that determine the way societies are organized. The structure of the global system causes inequality and systematic suffering of higher death rates, which is caused by inequity in distribution of opportunities and resources, which is termed [[structural violence]].&lt;ref name=dia&gt;{{cite journal | last = Alcock | first = Norman | name-list-format = vanc | title = Structural Violence at the World Level: diachronic findings | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = XIV | issue = 3 | year = 1979 | pages = 255 | url = http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/16/3/255.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition====

[[Structural violence]] is a term devised by [[Johan Galtung]] and [[liberation theologians]] during the 1960s to describe economic, political, legal, religious, and cultural social structures that harm and inhibit individuals, groups, and societies from reaching their full potential.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Structural violence is structural because the causes of misery are "embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world; they are violent because they cause injury to people."&lt;ref name="med"/&gt; Structural violence is different from personal or behavioral violence because it exclusively refers to preventable harm done to people by no one clear individual, but arises from unequal distribution of power and resources, pre-built into social structure.&lt;ref name=wei /&gt; Structural violence broadly includes all kinds of violations of human dignity: absolute and relative poverty, social inequalities like gender inequality and racism, and outright displays of human rights violations.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; The idea of structural violence is as old as the study of [[Social conflict|conflict]] and [[violence]],&lt;ref name=wei /&gt;  and so it can also be understood as related to [[social injustice]] and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=med /&gt;

====Effects====

Structural violence is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; These social structures seem so normal in our understanding of the world that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, [[political power]], [[education]], [[healthcare]], and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Structural violence occurs "whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures"&lt;ref name=emp /&gt; Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like armed violence can have these effects.&lt;ref name=emp /&gt; This type of unintended harm perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and [[hunger]] that eventually results in death, among other effects.&lt;ref name=wei&gt;{{cite book | first = Kathleen | last = Weigert |editor-last1=Fink | editor-first1=George | name-list-format = vanc |title=Stress of war, conflict and disaster|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-381382-4 | doi = 10.1016/B978-012373985-8.00169-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=emp /&gt; Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world.&lt;ref name=emp&gt;{{cite journal | title = An Empirical Table of Structural Violence | first1 = Gernot | last1 = Köhler | first2 = Norman | last2 = Alcock | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | year = 1976 | pages = 343–356 | doi = 10.2307/422498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural violence connection to health====
Inequality in daily living conditions stem from unseen social structures and practices.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; This systematic inequality is produced by social norms, policies, and practices that promote the unfair distribution of power, wealth, and other social resources,&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; such as healthcare. "The poor health of the poor, the social gradient in health within countries, and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, [[income]], [[good (economics)|good]]s, and [[Public services|services]], globally and nationally."&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; First, structural violence is often a major determinant of the distribution and outcome of disease.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; It has been known for decades that epidemic disease is caused by structural forces.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Structural violence can affect disease progression, such as in [[HIV]], where harmful social structures profoundly affect [[diagnosis]], [[Staging (pathology)|staging]], and [[Therapy|treatment]] of HIV and associated illnesses.&lt;ref name=med /&gt;  The determinants of disease and their outcome are set by the social factors, usually rampant with structural violence, that determine risk to be infected with the disease.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Understanding how structural violence is embodied at the community, individual, and microbial levels is vital to understanding the dynamics of disease.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; The consequences of structural violence is post pronounced in the world's poorest countries and greatly affects the provision of  clinical services in these countries.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Elements of structural violence such as "social upheaval, poverty, and [[gender inequality]] decrease the effectiveness of distal services and of [[preventive medicine|prevention]] efforts" presents barriers to medical care in countries like Rwanda and Haiti&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Due to structural violence, there exists a growing outcome gap where some countries have access to interventions and treatment, and countries in poverty who are neglected. With the power of improved distal interventions, the only way to close this outcome gap between countries who do and do not have access to effective treatment, lies on proximal interventions to reduce the factors contributing to health problems that arise from structural violence.&lt;ref name=med /&gt;&lt;ref name=structural&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer P | title = The major infectious diseases in the world--to treat or not to treat? | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 345 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–10 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11463018 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200107193450310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{desalination}}

'''Solar desalination''' is a technique to desalinate water using '''[[solar energy]]'''. There are two basic methods of achieving  '''[[desalination]]''' using this technique; direct and indirect. Sunlight may provide heat for evaporative desalination processes, or for some indirect methods, convert to electricity to power a membrane process.&lt;ref name = lowCDesal&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs | URL = https://jwafs.mit.edu/node/66| author = J H Lienhard, G P Thiel, D M Warsinger, L D Banchik| journal = Report of a Workshop Conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Association With the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance, MIT Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  | date = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Methods==
In the direct method, a solar collector is coupled with a distilling mechanism and the process is carried out in one simple cycle.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(01)00432-5 |title=Comparison of solar thermal technologies for applications in seawater desalination |journal=Desalination |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=135–42 |year=2002 |last1=García-Rodríguez |first1=Lourdes |last2=Palmero-Marrero |first2=Ana I. |last3=Gómez-Camacho |first3=Carlos }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar still|'''Solar stills''']] of this type are described in survival guides, provided in marine survival kits, and employed in many small desalination and distillation plants. Water production by direct method solar distillation is proportional to the area of the solar surface and incidence angle and has an average estimated value of 3-4L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"&gt;Kalogirou, S. (2009). Solar energy engineering: Processes and systems. Burlington, MA: Elsevier/Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this proportionality and the relatively high cost of property and material for construction direct method distillation tends to favor plants with production capacities less than 200m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt;

Indirect solar desalination employs two separate systems; a solar collection array, consisting of [[Solar panel|'''photovoltaic''']] and/or fluid based thermal collectors, and a separate conventional desalination plant.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; Production by indirect method is dependent on the efficiency of the plant and the cost per unit produced is generally reduced by an increase in scale. Many different plant arrangements have been theoretically analyzed, experimentally tested and in some cases installed. They include but are not limited to multiple-effect humidification (MEH), [[multi-stage flash distillation]] (MSF), [[multiple-effect distillation]] (MED), multiple-effect boiling (MEB), humidification–dehumidification (HDH), [[reverse osmosis]] (RO), and freeze-effect distillation.&lt;ref name="Qiblawey"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.059 |title=Solar thermal desalination technologies |journal=Desalination |volume=220 |pages=633–44 |year=2008 |last1=Qiblawey |first1=Hazim Mohameed |last2=Banat |first2=Fawzi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect solar desalination systems using [[Solar panel|photovoltaic (PV)]] panels and [[reverse osmosis|reverse osmosis (RO)]] have been commercially available and in use since 2009. Output by 2013 is up to {{convert|1600|L|usgal}} per hour per system, and 200 litres/day per square metre of PV panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trunzwatersystems.com/fileadmin/dam/tws/water_products/E_Aquifier_200.pdf "Trunk size solar desalination unit"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trunzwatersystems.com/fileadmin/dam/tws/water_products/E_Container.pdf "Container size solar desalination unit"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Municipal-scale systems are planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/news/491201/ "Al-Khafji plant"]''Arab News item 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Utirik Atoll]] in the Pacific Ocean has been supplied with fresh water this way since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshallislandsjournal.com/Archive%201-17-14-page.html "Utrik RO unit a big success"]''Marshall Islands Journal Jan 17th 2014''&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect solar desalination by a form of humidification/dehumidification is in use in the [[Seawater Greenhouse]].

==History==

Methods of solar distillation have been employed by humankind for thousands of years. From early Greek mariners to Persian alchemists, this basic technology has been utilized to produce both freshwater and medicinal distillates. Solar stills were in fact the first method used on a large scale to process contaminated water and convert it to a potable form.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt;

In 1870 the first US patent was granted for a solar distillation device to Norman Wheeler and Walton Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, N., Evans, W., (1870) Improvements in Evaporating and Distilling by Solar Heat. http://www.google.com/patents/US102633&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in Las Salinas, Chile, Charles Wilson, a Swedish engineer, began building a direct method solar powered distillation plant to supply freshwater to workers at a saltpeter and silver mine. It operated continuously for 40 years and produced an average of 22.7 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of distilled water a day using the effluent from mining operations as its feed water.&lt;ref name="Delyannis"&gt;Delyannis, E. (2003). Historic background of desalination and renewable energies, Solar Energy, 75(5), 357-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater in the modern United States extends back to the early 1950s when Congress passed the Conversion of Saline Water Act, which led to the establishment of the Office of Saline Water (OSW) in 1955. The OSW’s main function was to administer funds for research and development of desalination projects.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/380.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the five demonstration plants constructed was located in Daytona Beach, Florida and devoted to exploring methods of solar distillation. Many of the projects were aimed at solving [[water scarcity]] issues in remote desert and coastal communities.&lt;ref name="Delyannis"/&gt; In the 1960s and 70’s several modern solar distillations plants were constructed on the Greek isles with capacities ranging from 2000 to 8500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt; In 1984 a MED plant was constructed in Abu-Dhabi with a capacity of 120 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day and is still in operation.&lt;ref name="Delyannis"/&gt; In [[Italy]], an [[open source design]] called "the Eliodomestico" by Gabriele Diamanti was developed for personal use at the building materials price of $50.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/EHE/HTML_KAG/Kimweb/files/SolarStill%20Project.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the estimated 22 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of freshwater being produced a day through desalination processes worldwide, less than 1% is made using solar energy.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt; The prevailing methods of desalination, MSF and RO, are energy intensive and rely heavily on fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Qiblawey"/&gt; Because of inexpensive methods of freshwater delivery and abundant low cost energy resources, solar distillation has, up to this point, been viewed as cost prohibitive and impractical.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt; It is estimated that desalination plants powered by conventional fuels consume the equivalent of 203 million tons of fuel a year.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt; With the approach (or passage) of [[Peak oil|'''peak oil production''']], fossil fuel prices will continue to increase as those resources decline; as a result solar energy will become a more attractive alternative for achieving the world’s desalination needs.&lt;ref name="Attia"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.05.018 |bibcode=2012SoEn...86.2486A |title=Thermal analysis for system uses solar energy as a pressure source for reverse osmosis (RO) water desalination |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=2486–93 |year=2012 |last1=Attia |first1=Ahmed A.A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of solar desalination==

There are two primary means of achieving desalination using solar energy, through a phase change by thermal input, or in a single phase through mechanical separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2012.04.059 |title=Solar assisted sea water desalination: A review |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=19 |pages=136–63 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Chennan |last2=Goswami |first2=Yogi |last3=Stefanakos |first3=Elias }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase change (or multi-phase) can be accomplished by either direct or indirect solar distillation. Single phase is predominantly accomplished by the use of photovoltaic cells to produce electricity to drive pumps although there are experimental methods being researched using solar thermal collection to provide this mechanical energy.&lt;ref name="Attia"/&gt;

==Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF)==

[[Multi-stage flash distillation]] is one of the predominant conventional phase-change methods of achieving desalination. It accounts for roughly 45% of the total world desalination capacity and 93% of all thermal methods.&lt;ref name="Kalogirou"/&gt;

Solar derivatives have been studied and in some cases implemented in small and medium scale plants around the world. In Margarita de Savoya, Italy there is a 50–60 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day MSF plant with a salinity gradient solar pond providing its thermal energy and storage capacity. In El Paso, Texas there is a similar project in operation that produces 19 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day. In Kuwait a MSF facility has been built using parabolic trough collectors to provide the necessary solar thermal energy to produce 100 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of fresh water a day.&lt;ref name="Qiblawey"/&gt; And in Northern China there is an experimental, automatic, unmanned operation that uses 80 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of vacuum tube solar collectors coupled with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine (to drive several small pumps) to produce 0.8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2011.08.037 |bibcode=2012SoEn...86...31C |title=Field test of a solar seawater desalination unit with triple-effect falling film regeneration in northern China |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |pages=31–9 |year=2012 |last1=Chen |first1=Zhili |last2=Xie |first2=Guo |last3=Chen |first3=Ziqian |last4=Zheng |first4=Hongfei |last5=Zhuang |first5=Chunlong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production data shows that MSF solar distillation has an output capacity of 6-60 L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day versus the 3-4 L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day standard output of a solar still.&lt;ref name="Qiblawey"/&gt; MSF experience very poor efficiency during start up or low energy periods. In order to achieve the highest efficiency MSF requires carefully controlled pressure drops across each stage and a steady energy input. As a result, solar applications require some form of thermal energy storage to deal with cloud interference, varying solar patterns, night time operation, and seasonal changes in ambient air temperature. As thermal energy storage capacity increases a more continuous process can be achieved and production rates approach maximum efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.10.018 |title=Low temperature desalination using solar collectors augmented by thermal energy storage |journal=Applied Energy |volume=91 |pages=466–74 |year=2012 |last1=Gude |first1=Veera Gnaneswar |last2=Nirmalakhandan |first2=Nagamany |last3=Deng |first3=Shuguang |last4=Maganti |first4=Anand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towered desalination plant built in Pakistan===

In 1993 a desalination plant was invented in Pakistan, producing 4 liters of water per square meter per day, which is at least ten times more productive than a conventional horizontal solar desalination plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyglobe.info/awards/national/awdid/70178/#.UmGu7FDIbcw National ENERGY GLOBE Award Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;
The structure is a raised tower made of concrete, with a tank at the top. The whole plant is covered with glass of the same shape, but slightly larger, allowing for a gap between the cement tower and the glass.

The tank is filled with saline water and water from an outside tank, drop by drop water enters the inner tank. The excessive water from the inner tank drips out onto the cement walls of the tower, from top to bottom. By solar radiation, the water on the wet surface and in the tank evaporate and condense on the inner surface of the glass cylinder and flow down onto the collecting drain channel. Meanwhile, the concentrated saline water drains out through a saline drain.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In this process fresh saline water is continuously added to the walls from the top of the tower. After evaporation, the remaining saline water falls down and drains out continuously. The movement of water also increases the energy of molecules and increases the evaporation process. The increase in the tower’s height also increases the production.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Whereas in the conventional system water that is filled remains at a standstill for several days, a condenser is provided at the top in an isolated space, allowing cold water to pass through the condenser. The condensed hot vapors and hot water from the condenser are also thrown on the cement wall.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

This plant’s base is {{convert|3.5|x|1.5|x|10|ft|m}} high, and gives about {{convert|12|l|usgal}} of water per day. Built horizontally, a structured plant receives solar radiation at noon only. But Zuberi’s plant is a vertical tower and receives solar energy from sunrise till sunset. From early morning, it receives perpendicular radiation on one side of the plant, while at noon its top gets radiation equivalent to the horizontal plant. From noon till sunset, the other side receives maximum radiation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

By increasing the height, the tower plant receives more solar energy and the inner temperature increases as height increases. Ultimately this increases the water yield.

Different successive plants were constructed during the 1960s.
A number of experiments have been conducted and a much more productive plant has been developed, with further work continuing.

This project can be implemented anywhere there is ground water, brine or sea water available with suitable sun. During different experiments a plant {{convert|6|ft|m}} high can attain a temperature of {{convert|60|C|F}}, while a plant of {{convert|10|ft|m}} high can reach a temperature of up to {{convert|86|C|F}}.

The solar humidification–dehumidification (HDH) process (also called the multiple-effect humidification–dehumidification process, ''solar multistage condensation evaporation cycle'' (SMCEC) or [[multiple-effect humidification]] (MEH),&lt;ref&gt;The MEH-method (in German with english abstract): [http://mediatum2.ub.tum.de/node?id=601861 Solar Desalination using the MEH method, Diss. Technical University of Munich]&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique that mimics the natural [[water cycle]] on a shorter time frame by [[evaporation|evaporating]] and [[condensation|condensing]] water to separate it from other substances. The driving force in this process is thermal solar energy to produce water vapor which is later condensed in a separate chamber. In sophisticated systems, [[waste heat]] is minimized by collecting the heat from the condensing water vapor and pre-heating the incoming water source. This system is effective for small- to mid- scale desalination systems in remote locations because of the relative inexpensiveness of [[solar thermal collector]]s.

== Problems with thermal systems ==
There are two inherent design problems facing any thermal solar desalination project.  Firstly, the system's efficiency is governed by preferably high heat and mass transfer rates during evaporation and condensation. The surfaces have to be properly designed within the contradictory objectives of heat transfer efficiency, economy, and reliability.&lt;ref name=lowCDesal/&gt;

Secondly, the [[standard enthalpy change of vaporization|heat of condensation]] is valuable because it takes large amounts of solar energy to evaporate water and generate saturated, vapor-laden hot air.   This energy is, by definition, transferred to the condenser's surface during condensation.  With most forms of solar stills, this heat of condensation is ejected from the system as waste heat.  The challenge still existing in the field today, is to achieve the optimum temperature difference between the solar-generated vapor and the seawater-cooled condenser, maximal reuse of the energy of condensation, and minimizing the asset investment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Solutions for thermal systems ==
Efficient desalination systems use heat recovery to allow the same heat input to provide several times the water than a simple evaporative process such as solar stills.&lt;ref name=lowCDesal/&gt;

One solution to the barrier presented by the high level of solar energy required in solar desalination efforts is to reduce the pressure within the reservoir. This can be accomplished using a vacuum pump, and significantly decreases the temperature of heat energy required for desalination.  For example, water at a pressure of 0.1 atmospheres boils at {{convert|50|C|F}} rather than {{convert|100|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwarmingsolutions.co.uk/large_scale_solar_desalination_using_multi_effect_humidification.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221121006/http://www.globalwarmingsolutions.co.uk/large_scale_solar_desalination_using_multi_effect_humidification.htm |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }} Large scale Solar Desalination using Multi Effect Humidification&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">The '''Swedish National Board of Institutional Care''' ({{lang-sv|Statens institutionsstyrelse}}, abbreviated '''SiS''') is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] organized under the [[Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry of Health and Social Affairs]]. The agency arrange compulsory care for young people with [[psychosocial]] problems and for adults suffering from substance abuse problems. SiS offers a number of different treatment plans and mandatory care, when voluntary intervention have failed, and the right to forcibly detain and isolate individuals has become necessary. Decisions regarding compulsory care is made by the [[Administrative courts in Sweden|administrative court]], on the application of social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrative courts|url=http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2321.aspx|publisher=The Swedish courts|accessdate=18 July 2014|date=2005-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about-sis"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish National Board of Institutional Care|url=http://www.stat-inst.se/om-webbplatsen/other-languages/the-swedish-national-board-of-institutional-care/|publisher=The Swedish National Board of Institutional Care|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SiS runs residential homes for young people with psychosocial problems, suffering from substance abuse problems, or having committed crimes, under the terms of the Care of Young Persons Special Provisions Act (abbreviated LVU) and the Secure Youth Care Act (LSU).{{ref|1}} SiS also operates homes for adults with alcohol abuse problems, substance abuse problems, or a combination of these under the Care of Substance Abusers Special Provisions Act (LVM).{{ref|2}}&lt;ref name="about-sis" /&gt; 

==Residential homes for young people==
About 1,300 children and young people each year are placed at one of SiS's residential homes for young people, under the terms of LVU. The average time spent in these homes are around five months, and just over half are discharged within three months. Everyone is given a treatment plan based on their individual needs and circumstances, and treatment is planned together with the patient, family and social services. The most common therapeutic approach is [[cognitive behavioural therapy]]. Methods of treatment include: [[Aggression Replacement Training]], [[Relapse Prevention]], [[Motivational Interviewing]] and individual psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LVU – assessment and treatment in special residential homes for young people|url=http://www.stat-inst.se/om-webbplatsen/other-languages/the-swedish-national-board-of-institutional-care/special-residential-homes-for-young-people/|publisher=SiS|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secure youth care==
Young people between the ages of 15 and 17, who commit serious criminal offences such as robbery, aggravated assault, rape, manslaughter or murder can be sentenced to a high-security youth care unit, managed by the SiS. As treatment progresses the person is moved to more open units, and aftercare is the responsibility of social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSU – secure youth care instead of prison|url=http://www.stat-inst.se/om-webbplatsen/other-languages/the-swedish-national-board-of-institutional-care/secure-youth-care/|publisher=SiS|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Homes for adults with substance misuse==
Approximately one thousand adults with serious substance abuse problems are taken into care each year, and admitted to one of SiS homes for people with substance misuse problems, under the terms of LVM. Compulsory care is limited to a maximum of six months. During that time, the client is detoxified, receives care and medical treatment. The methods of treatment vary from patient to patient. [[Motivational Interviewing]], [[Relapse Prevention]], the [[Community Reinforcement Approach]] and [[Twelve-step program|12-Step programmes]] are the most common methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LVM – motivating adults with substance misuse problems to continue their treatment|url=http://www.stat-inst.se/om-webbplatsen/other-languages/the-swedish-national-board-of-institutional-care/lvm-homes-for-adults-with-substance-misuse/|publisher=SiS|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thai Red Cross Society''' ({{lang-th|สภากาชาดไทย}}; {{RTGS|Sapha Ka Chat Thai}}) is a major [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] organisation in Thailand, providing services as part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

The society was founded in 1893 and is headquartered in [[Bangkok]]. It is governed by the Act on Thai Red Cross Society, Buddhist Era 2461 (1918), and is supervised by the [[Cabinet of Thailand|Council of Ministers]]. Its expenses are borne by the [[Government of Thailand|government]]. Its president is appointed by the [[King of Thailand|king]] upon [[advice and consent]] of the council of ministers. The current president is Queen [[Sirikit]] who has held the position since 12 August 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=th:ประกาศตั้งสภานายิกาสภากาชาดไทย ลงวันที่ ๑๒ สิงหาคม ๒๔๙๙ |trans-title=Proclamation on Appointment of President of Thai Red Cross Society dated 12 August 1956 | journal = [[Royal Thai Government Gazette|Government Gazette]] | volume = 73 | issue = 66 A | page = 957 | date = 1956-08-21 | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | language = Thai | format = pdf | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2499/A/066/957.PDF |publisher=Cabinet Secretariat |location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pattayamail.com/news/long-live-majesty-queen-sirikit-2-218552|title=Long Live Her Majesty Queen Sirikit - Pattaya Mail|last=Mail|first=Pattaya|date=2018-08-12|work=Pattaya Mail|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of the Thai Red Cross Society dates to the Franco–Siamese [[Franco-Siamese War|territorial dispute]] of 1893 in which no organised aid was available to assist military casualties. Lady Plien Pasakornravongs assembled a group of female volunteers and asked [[Savang Vadhana|Queen Savang Vadhana]] for royal permission to establish a humanitarian organisation. Permission was granted by [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]], who also granted permission to raise initial funding, 443,716 baht. The society, then known as the '''Red Unalom Society''' (สภาอุณาโลมแดง), was founded on 26 April 1893, with Queen Savang Vadhana as maternal patron. Queen Saovabha was appointed the first president, and Lady Plien acted as the society secretary.

The society's name was later changed to the Siam Red Cross Society and, following the renaming of the country, the Thai Red Cross Society. The society was officially recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] on 27 May 1920, and membership in the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (then the League of Red Cross Societies) was granted on 8 April 1921.

== Services ==
Following the statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Thai Red Cross Society provides humanitarian aid and relief services in times of war and disaster, which is handled by its Relief and Public Health Bureau. The bureau offers public health services in remote areas of the country. The society also provides other medical and charitable services.

In total the Thai Red Cross Society has 14 bureaus, 6 specialized centers, and 5 special affair offices. Key focus areas are holistic public health services, disaster relief assistance, supply of blood products and transfusion, and improving quality of life in impoverished communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://english.redcross.or.th/article/1165|title=121st Anniversary of the Thai Red Cross Society|last=Ia|first=Watchariya|date=2014-04-28|work=Thai Red Cross|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical services ===
The Thai Red Cross Society operates the [[King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital]] in Bangkok, with 1,479 beds, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and [[Queen Savang Vadhana Memorial Hospital]], a 500-bed general hospital in [[Si Racha District]], [[Chonburi Province]]. The Red Cross Rehabilitation Centre in [[Samut Prakan Province]], provides physical medicine and rehabilitation services for long-term patients.

=== Blood donation ===
[[Blood donation]] services provided by the National Blood Centre are one of the society's most visible activities. Founded in 1952, the centre collects, processes, and provides blood and blood components to hospitals in Bangkok and nationwide through 147 regional chapters.

=== Organ donation ===
The Thai Red Cross Organ Donation Centre began operation in 1994 and is the sole national coordinator of [[organ donation]]s. The Thai Red Cross Eye Bank, in operation since 1965, provides eye tissue for [[corneal transplantation]], and has 10 regional offices.

=== AIDS programme ===
In 1991, the Thai Red Cross Society AIDS Research Centre opened the first HIV-voluntary counselling and testing clinic in Asia. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/thailand/red-cross-opens-first-clinic-for-transgender-community-in-asia-70749/|title=Red Cross opens first clinic for transgender|last=Roux|first=Kate|date=2015-12-15|work=International Red Cross and Red Crescent Society|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre offers HIV testing and counseling services through its Anonymous Clinic, and runs education and awareness campaigns to battle the spread of the epidemic and better the lives of those living with HIV. The centre conducts research on HIV and clinical interventions under HIV-NAT and SEARCH units, and offers many services to help those living with HIV.

=== Vaccines and rabies prevention ===
[[Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute]] produces [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] and [[rabies]] [[vaccine]]s and snake [[antivenin]]s for national distribution. The institute provides rabies prevention and immunisation services. Its snake farm is open to visitors and tourists, providing education in addition to its research activities.

=== Medical education ===
The [[Thai Red Cross College of Nursing]] is one of the country's major professional nurse training centres. King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital serves as the [[teaching hospital]] for both the college and also the Chulalongkorn University [[Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University|Faculty of Medicine]].

=== Child welfare ===
The Thai Red Cross Children's Home takes care of abandoned children at King Chulalongkorn and Queen Sawangvatana Memorial Hospitals, and attempts to reunite the families or provide the children with suitable adoptive homes.

=== Transgender services ===
On November 27, 2015, The Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre in Bangkok opened the first clinic in Asia to target services exclusively to the transgender community. The Tangerine Community Health Centre is funded by the US Agency for International Development. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">The '''Vertifolia effect''' is a well documented phenomenon in the fields of [[plant breeding]] and [[plant pathology]]. It is characterized by the erosion of a crop’s [[horizontal resistance]] to disease during a breeding cycle due to the presence of strong [[vertical resistance]], characterized by the presence of [[R genes]]. This phenomenon was first described by J.E. Van der Plank in his 1963 book Plant Disease: Epidemics and Control.&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Plank observed that under artificial selection the potato variety Vertifolia had stronger vertical resistance to the potato late blight bacterium, ''Phytophthora infestans'', as measured by the presence of specific [[R genes]]. However, when the pathogen overcame these [[R genes]] Vertifolia exhibited a greater loss of [[horizontal resistance]] than varieties with fewer [[R genes]] and lower [[vertical resistance]].&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect suggests that when a pathogen evolves an [[avirulence gene]] to counteract a variety’s R gene, that variety will be more susceptible to the pathogen than other varieties.

The Vertifolia effect has important implications for the breeding of disease resistant crops.  To avoid it plant breeders may opt to cross in R genes or insert transgenes at the end of the breeding cycle to maintain levels of horizontal resistance during  early rounds of selection. It is also suggests that breeders should focus on enhancing [[horizontal resistance]] to avoid potential catastrophic crop losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
