{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
{{Canon Law}}
An '''apostolic constitution''' ({{lang-la|'''constitutio apostolica'''}}) is the most solemn form of legislation issued by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref name=NewCommentary57&gt;New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, pg. 57, footnote 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/Magazines/TheCatholicAnswer/Article/TabId/652/ArtMID/13618/ArticleID/20552/What-Is-a-Papal-Bull.aspx Mann, Stephanie A., "What Is a Papal Bull?", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', September 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''[[constitution]]'' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] {{lang|la|constitutio}}, which referred to any important law issued by the [[Roman emperor]], and is retained in church documents because of the inheritance that the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the Roman Catholic Church received from [[Roman law]].

By their nature, apostolic constitutions are addressed to the public. Generic constitutions use the title ''apostolic constitution'' and treat on solemn matters of the church, such as the promulgation of laws or definitive teachings. The forms '''dogmatic constitution''' and '''pastoral constitution''' are titles sometimes used to be more descriptive as to the document's purpose.

Apostolic constitutions are issued as [[papal bull]]s because of their solemn, public form. Among types of papal legislation, apostolic letters issued ''[[motu proprio]]'' are next in solemnity.&lt;ref name=NewCommentary57/&gt;

==Introduction==
Generic constitutions contain the following introduction:
:[Pope name], Bishop
:Servant of the Servants of God
:For an everlasting memorial/eternal memory/etc.

The '''Art Institute of Chicago''', founded in 1879 and located in [[Chicago]]'s [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], is one of the oldest and [[list of largest art museums|largest]] art museums in the United States. Recognized for its curatorial efforts and popularity among visitors, the museum hosts approximately 1.5 million guests annually.&lt;ref name="ArtnewsApril2014"&gt;[http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheArtNewspaper2013_ranking.pdf Visitor Figures 2013: Museum and exhibition attendance numbers compiled and analysed], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', International Edition, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection, stewarded by 11 curatorial departments, is encyclopedic, and includes iconic works such as [[Georges Seurat]]'s [[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|''A Sunday on La Grande Jatte'']], [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Edward Hopper]]'s ''[[Nighthawks]]'', and [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]''. Its permanent collection of nearly 300,000 works of art is augmented by more than 30 special exhibitions mounted yearly that illuminate aspects of the collection and present cutting-edge curatorial and scientific research.

As a research institution, the Art Institute also has a conservation and conservation science department, five conservation laboratories, and one of the largest art history and architecture libraries in the country—the [[Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries|Ryerson and Burnham Libraries]].

The growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's original 1893 building, which was constructed for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of the same year. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by [[Renzo Piano]], opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet, making it the [[List of largest art museums in the world|second-largest]] art museum in the United States, after the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="secondlargest"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/arts/design/14inst.html?ref=design|title=A Grand and Intimate Modern Art Trove|date=13 May 2009|work=The New York Times|publisher=NYTimes.com|author=Roberta Smith|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Institute is associated with the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], a leading art school, making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States.

==History==
In 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the '''Chicago Academy of Design''' in a studio on Dearborn Street, with the intent to run a free school with its own art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the [[Royal Academy]], with Academicians and Associate Academicians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.

Classes started in 1868, meeting every day at a cost of $10 per month. The Academy's success enabled it to build a new home for the school, a five-story stone building on 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.

When the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy was thrown into debt. Attempts to continue despite the loss by using rented facilities failed. By 1878 the Academy was $10,000 in debt. Members tried to rescue the ailing institution by making deals with local businessmen, before some finally abandoned it in 1879 to found a new organization, named the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets at auction.

In 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current '''Art Institute of Chicago''' and elected as its first president the banker and philanthropist [[Charles L. Hutchinson]], who "is arguably the single most important individual to have shaped the direction and fortunes of the Art Institute of Chicago"&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Hutchinson was a director of many prominent Chicago organizations, including the [[University of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=|title= Few Changes Made - University of Chicago Trustees Hold an Election - Two Vacancies Filled - Other Members Whose Terms Expired Re-Elected - Examinations for Positions as Teachers in the Public Schools of the City|journal=The Daily Inter-Ocean|volume= | issue = |date=June 28, 1893|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would transform the Art Institute into a world-class museum during his presidency, which he held until his death in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Encyclopedia of Chicago - Art Institute of Chicago|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html| author=Dillon, Diane |publisher=The Newberry Library|date= 2004-09-18| accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1882, the organization purchased a lot on the southwest corner of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and Van Buren Street for $45,000. The existing commercial building on that property was used for the organization's headquarters, and a new addition was constructed behind it to provide gallery space and to house the school's facilities.&lt;ref name="Hilliard"&gt;{{cite book | title="The Prime Mover" - Charles L. Hutchinson and the making of the Art Institute of Chicago| publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago | author= Hilliard, Celia | year=2010 | location=Chicago | isbn=978-086559-238-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} By January 1885 the trustees recognized the need to provide additional space for the organization's growing collection, and to this end purchased the vacant lot directly south on Michigan Avenue. The commercial building was demolished,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=  |title=The Art Institute – The Western Art Movement and its Splendid Achievements in Chicago – The New Home of the Fine Arts – The Ward Collection – The Century, Harper's  - The Formal Opening of the New Museum – The Loan Collection – A Noble Triumph|journal=The (Chicago) Inter Ocean|volume= XVI| issue = 239|date= November 20, 1887 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the noted architect John Wellborn Root was hired by Hutchinson to design a building that would create an "impressive presence" on Michigan Avenue,&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt;{{rp|22–23}} and these facilities opened to great fanfare in 1887.&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

With the announcement of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] to be held in 1892&amp;ndash;93, the Art Institute pressed for a building on the lakefront to be constructed for the fair, but to be used by the Institute afterwards. The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were met by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893 the Institute moved into the new building. For the opening reception on December 8, 1893, [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] and the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] performed. From the 1900s (decade) to the 1960s the school offered with the Logan Family (members of the board) the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]], an award which became one of the most distinguished awards presented to artists in the US.

Between 1959 and 1970 the Institute was a key site in the battle to gain art and documentary photography a place in galleries, under curator [[Hugh Edwards (curator)|Hugh Edwards]] and his assistants.

As Director of the museum starting in the early 1980s, [[James N. Wood]] conducted a major expansion of its collection and oversaw a major renovation and expansion project for its facilities. As "one of the most respected museum leaders in the country", as described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wood created major exhibitions of works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] that set records for attendance at the museum. He retired from the museum in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/design/15wood.html "James N. Wood, President of the Getty Trust, Dies at 69"], ''The New York Times'', June 14, 2010. Accessed June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Art Institute began construction of "The Modern Wing", an addition situated on the southwest corner of Columbus and Monroe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0505310147may31-story.html|title=ART INSTITUTE TO ADD NEW WING|last=Kamin|first=Blair|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, designed by [[Pritzker Prize]] winning architect [[Renzo Piano]], was completed and officially opened to the public on May 16, 2009. The {{convert|264000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building makes the Art Institute the second-largest art museum in the United States. The building houses the museum's world-renowned collections of 20th- and 21st-century art, specifically modern European painting and sculpture, contemporary art, architecture and design, and photography.

There are around 5,000 works in the collection, offering a comprehensive survey of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean world, beginning with the third millennium B.C. and extending to the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/ancient|title=Ancient and Byzantine {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection also holds the mummy and mummy case of Paankhenamun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/citi/resources/Rsrc_001412.pdf|title=Coffin and Mummy Case of Paankhenamun|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/64339?search_no=1&amp;index=11|title=Coffin and Mummy of Paankhenamun {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture and Design ===
The Department of Architecture and Design holds more than 140,000 works, from models to drawings from the 1870s to the present day. The collection covers [[landscape architecture]], [[structural engineering]], and [[industrial design]], including the works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/arch|title=Architecture and Design {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian Art ===
The Art Institute's Asian collection spans nearly 5,000 years, including significant works and objects from China, Korea, Japan, India, southeast Asia, and the Near and Middle East. There are 35,000 objects in the collection, showcasing bronzes, ceramics, and jades as well as textiles, screens, woodcuts, and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/asian|title=Asian {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One gallery in particular attempts to mimic the quiet and meditative way in which [[Japanese screens]] are traditionally viewed.

=== European Decorative Arts ===

The Art Institute's collection of European decorative arts includes some 25,000 objects of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, glass, enamel, and ivory from 1100 A.D. to the present day. The department contains the 1,544 objects in the [[Arthur Rubloff]] Paperweight Collection and the 68 [[Thorne miniature rooms|Thorne Miniature Rooms]]–a collection of miniaturized interiors of a 1:12 scale showcasing American, European, and Asian architectural and furniture styles from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 1930s (when the rooms were constructed).&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/thorne|title=Thorne Miniature Rooms|date=|publisher=artic.edu|accessdate=2011-06-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615091025/http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/thorne|archivedate=15 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the paperweights and the Thorne Rooms are located on the ground floor of the museum.

=== European Painting and Sculpture ===
[[File:A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.png|alt=Georges Seurat, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884, 1884/86|left|thumb|300px|Georges Seurat, ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', 1884-86.]]
The museum is most famous for its collections of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], [[Post-impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings, widely regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as one of the finest collections outside of France. Highlights include more than 30 paintings by [[Claude Monet]], including six of his [[Haystacks (Monet)|''Haystacks'']] and a number of ''[[Water Lilies]]''. Also in the collection are important works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] such as ''[[Two Sisters (On the Terrace)]],'' and [[Gustave Caillebotte]]'s ''[[Paris Street; Rainy Day]].'' Post-Impressionist works include [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''[[The Basket of Apples]]'', and ''[[Marie-Hortense Fiquet|Madame Cézanne]] in a Yellow Chair.'' ''[[At the Moulin Rouge]]'' by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] is another highlight. The [[Pointillism|pointillist]] masterpiece, which also inspired [[Sunday in the Park with George|a musical]] and was famously featured in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', [[Georges Seurat|Georges Seurat's]] ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte—1884]],'' is prominently displayed. Additionally, [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Bathers by a River'', is an important example of his work. Highlights of non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[Bedroom in Arles]]'' and ''[[:File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|Self-portrait]],1887''.

In the mid-1930's the Art Institute received a gift of over one hundred works of art from [[Annie Swan Coburn]] ("Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection"). The "Coburn Renoirs" became the core of the Art Institute's [[Impressionist]] painting collection.&lt;ref name="aic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Case 8: Annie Swan Coburn |url=http://archive.artic.edu/ryerson/making-history/8 |website=Women of the Art Institute |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection also includes the Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and Armor holdings and three centuries of [[Old Master]]s works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/armor|title=Arms, Armor, Medieval, and Renaissance {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern and Contemporary Art ===
[[File:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', 1903]]
The museum's collection of modern and contemporary art was significantly augmented when collectors Stefan Edlie and Gael Neeson gifted 40 master works to the department in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-edlis-neeson-art-institute-1210-20151209-story.html|title=Massive art gift transforms Art Institute|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pablo Picasso]]'s [[The Old Guitarist|''Old Guitarist'']], [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Bathers by a River'', [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''Golden Bird'', and [[René Magritte]]'s ''[[Time Transfixed]]'' are highlights of the modern galleries, located on the third floor of the Modern Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/modern|title=Modern {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary installation, located on the second floor, contains works by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Jasper Johns]], and other significant modern and contemporary artists.

=== Photography ===
The Art Institute didn't officially establish a photography collection until 1949, when [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] donated a significant portion of the [[Alfred Stieglitz]] collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/photo|title=Photography  {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the museum's collection has grown to approximately 20,000 works spanning the history of the artform from its inception in 1839 to the present.

=== Prints and Drawings ===
The print and drawings collection began with a donation by Elizabeth S. Stickney of 460 works in 1887, and was organized into its own department of the museum in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Engelbrecht, Theresa Moir. [http://artinprint.org/article/inter-collected-the-shared-history-of-the-print-club-and-museum-collection/ "Inter-Collected: The Shared History of the Print Club and Museum Collection,"] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 2 (July–August 2017), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Their holdings have subsequently grown to 11,500 drawings and 60,000 prints, ranging from 15th-century works to contemporary. The collection contains a strong group of the works of [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Francisco Goya]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]]. Because works on paper are sensitive to light and degrade quickly, the works are on display infrequently in order to keep them in good condition for as long as possible.

=== Textiles ===
The Department of Textiles has more than 13,000 textiles and 66,000 sample swatches in total, covering an array of cultures from 300 B.C. to the present. From English [[needlework]] to Japanese garments to American quilts, the collection presents a diverse group of objects, including contemporary works and [[fiber art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/textiles|title=Textiles {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current building at 111 South Michigan Avenue is the third address for the Art Institute.  It was designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] of [[Boston]]&lt;ref name=formyrs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/formative/index.html|accessdate=2007-06-20|title=1879–1913: The Formative Years|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|year=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609191723/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/formative/index.html| archivedate= 9 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building with the intent that the Art Institute occupy the space after the fair closed.

[[File:Interrior view, Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|thumb|Interior view, Art Institute of Chicago]]

The Art Institute's famous western entrance on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] is guarded by two [[bronze]] [[lion]] statues created by [[Edward Kemeys]]. The lions were unveiled on May 10, 1894, each weighing more than two tons. The sculptor gave them unofficial names: the south lion is "stands in an attitude of defiance," and the north lion is "on the prowl." When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (i.e. the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.

The east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance to the old [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]. Designed by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1894, the Exchange was torn down in 1972, but salvaged portions of the original trading room were brought to the Art Institute and reconstructed.

The Art Institute building has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect the east and west buildings while the [[Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.

===Libraries===
[[Image:Burnham Library Simon Fieldhouse 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries|Burnham Library]] was founded in 1912]]Located on the ground floor of the museum is the [[Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries]]. The Libraries' collections cover all periods of art, but is most known for its extensive collection of 18th to 20th century architecture.  It serves the museum staff, college and university students, and is also open to the general public. The Friends of the Libraries, a support group for the Libraries, offers events and special tours for its members.

===Modern Wing===

=== Attendance ===
During 2009, attendance was around 2 million—up 33 percent from 2008—in addition to a total of approximately 100,000 museum memberships. Despite a 25 percent boost in museum admission fees, the Modern Wing was a major catalyst for a rise in visitor traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Viera (May 9, 2011), [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-09/entertainment/ct-live-0510-james-cuno-resigns-20110509_1_james-cuno-modern-wing-art-institute Art Institute leader resigns] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
[[File:Art Institute of Chicago Michigan Avenue.jpg|thumb|left|Art Institute of Chicago, [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]]]]

As of 2011, the Art Institute continues to rebuild its $783 million endowment since the [[Great Recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (August 24, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904875404576528873604216228 "Chicago's Art Institute Names New Director"]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, its endowment was $827 million. As of 2012, the museum is rated A1 by [[Moody's]], its fifth-highest grade, in part reflecting the museum's pension and retirement liabilities; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] rates the museum A+, fifth-best. In October 2012, the Art Institute sold about $100 million of taxable and tax-exempt bonds partly to shore up unfunded pension obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Chappatta (October 9, 2012), [https://archive.is/20130118162817/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-09/chicago-art-institute-borrows-100-million-for-pensions Chicago Art Institute Borrows $100 Million for Pensions] ''[[Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The $294 million extension in 2009 was the culmination of a $385 million fundraising campaign—roughly $300 million for design and construction and $85 million for the endowment. Around $370 million were raised primarily from private patrons in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Edward Kaufman (May 13, 2009), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Art-Institute-of-Chicago-s-massive-extension-opens/17325 Art Institute of Chicago’s massive extension opens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016131345/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Art-Institute-of-Chicago-s-massive-extension-opens/17325 |date=October 16, 2012 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Art Institute received a $10 million gift from the Jaharis Family Foundation to renovate and expand galleries devoted to Greek, Roman and Byzantine art, as well as to support acquisitions and special exhibitions of that art.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Taylor (February 27, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/arts/design/28arts-AGIFTFORARTI_BRF.html A Gift for Art Institute] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisitions and deaccessioning ===
In 1990, the Art Institute of Chicago sold 11 works at auction, including paintings by [[Claude Monet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Maurice Utrillo]] and [[Edgar Degas]], to raise the $12 million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, ''Golden Bird'', by [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. At the time, the sculpture was owned by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]], which was selling it to buy a new gallery for its other works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-10/entertainment/ca-1857_1_chicago-gallery Chicago Gallery to Sell 11 Works to Buy Brancusi] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 10, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the museum sold two paintings by [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Auguste Renoir]] at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (October 26, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/arts/design/26muse.html Museums Set to Sell Art, and Some Experts Cringe] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it auctioned two Picassos (''Sur l'impériale traversant la Seine'' (1901) and ''Verre et pipe'' (1919)), [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme au fauteuil'' (1919), and [[Georges Braque]]'s ''Nature morte à la guitare (rideaux rouge)'' (1938) at [[Christie's]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Viera (January 11, 2011), [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-11/entertainment/ct-live-0112-art-institute-developmen20110111_1_art-institute-paintings-institute-spokeswoman-erin-hogan-deaccession Art Institute paintings to fetch $10-$16 million at auction] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pogrebin11&gt;{{cite news| first=Robin| last=Pogrebin| date=January 26, 2011| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html| title=The Permanent Collection May Not Be So Permanent| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2002, the Art Institute of Chicago filed suit alleging fraud by a small Dallas firm called Integral Investment Management, along with related parties. The museum, which put $43 million of its endowment into funds run by the defendants, claimed that it faced losses of up to 90% on the investments after they soured.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.economist.com/node/922809| title=Stick to paintings| work=[[The Economist]]| date=3 January 2002| accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the year after the opening of its massive Modern Wing, the Art Institute of Chicago sued the engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup]] for $10 million over what it said were flaws in the [[concrete]] floors and air-circulation systems. The suit was [[settled out of court]].&lt;ref name=Finkel14&gt;{{cite news| first=Jori| last=Finkel| date=3 June 2014| title=Eli Broad's Art Showcase, Still Unfinished, Sues Over Delays in Los Angeles| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/arts/design/eli-broads-los-angeles-art-showcase-still-unfinished-sues-over-delays.html| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kapos13&gt;{{cite news| title=Art Institute closes Modern Wing's 3rd floor for 7 months| url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130917/NEWS07/130919817/art-institute-closes-modern-wings-3rd-floor-for-7-months#| last=Kapos| first=Shia| date=17 September 2013| work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]| accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Film director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] included a sequence   in the Art Institute in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', which is set in Chicago. Hughes had first visited the Institute as a "refuge" while in high school.&lt;ref name="ferris_commentary"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p89gBjHB2Gs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player|title=John Hughes commentary - The Museum scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off|date=7 August 2009|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' commentary on the sequence was used as a reference point by journalist [[Hadley Freeman]] in a discussion of the Republican Presidential primary candidates in 2011.&lt;ref name="freeman"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/15/werner-herzog-america-republican Two new films reveal the death and triumph of the American dream], Hadley Freeman, ''The Guardian'', November 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Artsy "has the potential to introduce each buyer to a wide range of artists and artworks, all of them related in some way and—this is key—most of them unknown and otherwise inaccessible to any but the most knowledgeable connoisseurs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mufti|first=Shahan|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|accessdate=2 September 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] said that "[o]ver the past nine years the New York startup has become one of the top destinations for buying, viewing, and learning about art. It has pulled off this feat by partnering with galleries and auction houses, rather than directly competing with them." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/new-york-s-artsy-is-making-it-even-easier-to-buy-art-online|title=New York's Artsy Is Making It Even Easier to Buy Art Online|last=Schuetz|first=Molly|date=March 27, 2018|work=Bloomberg|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, criticism around The Art Genome Project centered on "“its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way. 'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with Cindy Sherman,' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of.'" Also, "there's the issue of whether art can be properly represented on the Web. "'There is something sensual about a visual object that doesn't translate online,"' says New York City-based collector Niel Frankel." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Anita|title=Works for Me|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2115626,00.html|accessdate=31 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bicycle serial number compilation.jpg|thumb|Examples of bicycle serial numbers.]]

'''Bike registries''' are databases of unique, identifying information about [[bicycle]]s and their ownership. Most registration programs use the unique serial numbers which are permanently affixed to most bicycles during manufacture.

Bicycle registration programs generally aim to reduce the prevalence of [[Bicycle theft|bike theft]]. Bicycle theft is one of the major factors that slow the development of [[utility cycling]] since it discourages people from investing in a bicycle.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Bicycle registration may be a [[public service]] provided by local, state or national government, or be provided by an independent organization.

Some registration programs are exclusively designed for spreading the word after a bike has been stolen, while others focus on registering bikes before they are stolen.

== Purpose ==
Bike registration is intended to provide:  
# An element of security (such as at schools and universities)  
# A means of theft deterrence and a method of recovery in the event of theft

Bikes are stolen in large numbers in many parts of the world.
* In [[Copenhagen]] approximately 20,000 annually.
* In the USA an average of 230,000 annually, according to the [[FBI]].
* In UK, the [[Home Office]] reports an average 400,000.

Globally the number is estimated at 1.5 million bikes reported stolen annually; perhaps another 2 to 3 million go unreported annually.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Procedure ==
At many schools and universities, all bikes brought onto campus are routinely required to be registered by their owners and to display prominently their annual school provided registration decal.

Some states in the USA, such as California, have laws which allow cities and municipalities to require registration of bikes.  The registration period typically is in excess of one year. Building on existing law, California has passed a bill in 2014 that will allow cities, counties or regional park districts to impose an annual vehicle registration surcharge of up to $5 to pay for local bike lanes and trails, valid until Jan. 1, 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New state law allows vehicle surcharge for bike lanes|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2863550-181/new-state-law-allows-car|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commercial and peer based bike registries exist for the purpose of theft deterrence and to improve the probability of recovery in the event of loss.  The registration period typically is from 1 year to unlimited.  Some commercial and peer-to-peer registries are typically preventative in nature and are performed prior to loss, while other registries perform their service only after a theft occurs.

The bike owner generally supplies detailed bike information to the registrar such as: manufacturer, model, frame style, frame material, wheel diameter, serial number, color, frame size, and accessory details.  Contact information pertaining to the owner are also included in the registration process.

== Marking ==
[[File:Bike Index registration spokecard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bike Index]] registration spoke card in a front wheel, with a [[QR code]] to provide information about the bike and a link to its registration.]]
The registrar will typically provide a [[decal]] or decal kit to the bike owner such that their bike can be easily identified as being registered.  Decals at academic institutions usually have their color/design changed on an annual basis and are typically fairly large such that they can be easily seen at a distance.  Decals issued by municipalities are typically of a design similar to academic decals, but not changed annually.

Decals provided by commercial and peer based registries are typically smaller than academic/municipal decals and use a more aggressive adhesive and/or construction such that they will remain on the bike in the event of a theft and will be able to assist in recovery and return effort.  Some registrars [[engrave]] a registration number on the bottom bracket or other part.

[[RFID]] (Radio-frequency identification) has been widely used for identification of such things as livestock, pets and industrial commodities.  There is a trend by some registrars to use RFID, in conjunction with decal identification, as a means of rapidly determining bike ownership by law enforcement agencies.

== Fees charged ==
Fees can vary. Most peer based registries are free or charge a very nominal fee.  School and university bike registration fees range from $2 to $5 for a single-year registration.  Fees for commercial registrars range typically range from $10 to $25 for multi-year registration, though [[Bike Index]] provides free registration forever.  For RFID there can be a surcharge of $15 onto the base registration fee.

== Access to registry information ==
Access to school, university and municipality registry databases is typically limited to the law enforcement agency in charge of the registration program; commercial registrars make their registration information available to law enforcement agencies upon request; and peer-to-peer registries make their stolen bike information publicly available via the Internet.

The '''''Chronica parva Ferrariensis''''' was a short chronicle of the history of [[Ferrara]] up to 1264 written by [[Riccobaldo of Ferrara]] in the years 1313–17. The chronicler tends to laud the "good old days", and deprecate contemporary Ferrara as fallen away from its former glory, as when he writes of the years before 1240: "At that time the Ferrarese republic was propsering, and its citizens were enjoying wealth and peace."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai Rubinstein, ''Studies in Italian history in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'', vol. 1, ser. ed. Giovanni Ciappelli (Editrice di Storia e Letteratura, 2004), 44 and 113: ''Huius pacis tempore floruit respublica Ferrariensis et cives bonorum copia fruebantur et pace. Nemo nisi facinorosus et scelestus exulabat a patria''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was included by [[Ludovico Muratori]] in his ''Rerum italicarum Scriptores'', and was edited by Gabriele Zanella in 1983.

[[Cotton Cleopatra]] A.iii is an Anglo-Saxon manuscript once held in the [[Cotton library]], now held in the [[British Library]], and contains three [[glossary|glossaries]], providing important evidence for [[Old English]] vocabulary, as well as for learning and scholarship in Anglo-Saxon England generally. The manuscript was probably written at [[St Augustine's, Canterbury]], and has generally been dated to the mid-tenth century,&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1957), pp. 180-82 [no. 143].&lt;/ref&gt; though recent work suggests the 930s specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Guthrie Rusche (ed.), ‘The Cleopatra Glossaries: An Edition  with Commentary on the Glosses and their Sources’ (diss. Yale University, 1996), pp. 2-6, 33-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript contains three Latin-Old English glossaries.

The ''First Cleopatra Glossary'' (folios 5r-75v) is alphabeticised by first letter, drawing on a wide range of sources, including a glossary more or less identical to the ''Third Cleopatra Glossary'', material related to the ''[[Corpus Glossary]]'', and a glossed text of [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''Etymologiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Pulsiano, ‘Prayers, Glosses and Glossaries’, in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford, 2001), p. 218; Patrizia Lendinara, ‘Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction’, in ''Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries'' (Aldershot, 1999), pp. 1–26 (pp. 22-26); Wolfgang Kittlick, 'Die Glossen der Hs. British Library, Cotton Cleopatra A. III: Phonologie, Morphologie, Wortgeographie', Europäische Hochschulschriften: Reihe XIV, Angelsächsische Sprache und Literatur, 347 (Frankfurt am Main, 1998) §§2.2, 14.2.5; cf. 14.1.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these sources are among the earliest glosses in English, but the Cleopatra reviser (or his source) often revised them. The glossary only gets as far as P: the compilation or copying seems never to have been completed.

The ''Second Cleopatra Glossary'' (folios 76r-91v) contains a shorter glossary, organised by subject. A closely related glossary is found in the first three subject lists of the [[Brussels Glossary]] (Brussels, Royal Library, 1928-30).

The ''Third Cleopatra Glossary'' (folios 92r-117v) contains glosses to [[Aldhelm]]'s ''Prosa de virginitate'' and ''Carmen de virginitate'', with the lemmata in the same order as they appear in the text. It was presumably, therefore, based on a copy of Aldhelm's texts which had interlinear glosses.&lt;ref&gt;See for more detail Mechthild Gretsch, ''The Intellectual Foundations of the English Benedictine Reform'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 25 (Cambridge, 1999), pp. 139-41.&lt;/ref&gt; This glossary or one like it was influential, influencing [[Byrhtferth]] of Ramsey and at least one Anglo-Saxon medical text.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge and Peter S. Baker, ''Byrhtferth’s Enchiridion'', Early English Text Society, s.s. 15 (Oxford, 1995), pp. lxxxiii–lxxxiv; Alaric Hall, ''Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity'', Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007; pbk repr. 2009), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Kittlick's linguistic investigation showed that some, at least, of the glosses in the ''Third Cleopatra Glossary'' are in the Anglian dialect of Old English, with later overlays from West Saxon and Kentish (probably in that order). The glossary--though not necessarily all its entries--must have originated in the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kittlick, 'Die Glossen der Hs. British Library, Cotton Cleopatra A. III: Phonologie, Morphologie, Wortgeographie', Europäische Hochschulschriften: Reihe XIV, Angelsächsische Sprache und Literatur, 347 (Frankfurt am Main, 1998), §§2.2, 14.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

About two thirds of the material in the ''Cleopatra Glossaries'' also occurs in the later ''[[Harley Glossary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Pulsiano, ‘Prayers, Glosses and Glossaries’, in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford, 2001), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

'''E.S. (Sheridan) Wibbeke''' (born 1965) is an Irish-American organizational theorist, intercultural consultant, and author in the field of [[Global Leadership|global leadership]] known for the development of Wibbeke’s Geoleadership Model of global business leadership competencies.

==Biography==

Born in Los Angeles to Irish parents, Wibbeke in 1987 received a BA from [[Loyola Marymount University]] and in 1992 and MBA from the [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]]. In 2005, Wibbeke received a [[doctor of management|Doctorate in Management]] (Organizational Leadership) for the thesis: ''Intercultural Leadership Competencies for U.S. Business Leaders in the New Millennium''.

In 1987, Wibbeke started a career at the [[World Affairs Councils of America|Los Angeles World Affairs Council]], wherein major business, cultural, and political figures gave lectures on current topics. These included [[Ronald Reagan]], King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[Carl Sagan]], and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]].

In 1992, Wibbeke worked at [[Xerox]] Corporation in managing corporate revenue. In 1994, Wibbeke led the volunteer workforce for the [[FIFA World Cup]], including the semi-finals and final matches at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] stadium in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]]. Wibbeke was recruited to relocate to [[Silicon Valley]] in 1996, and began a decade assisting high-technology firms in their global marketing endeavors. Such firms included [[Borland International]], [[PointCast (dotcom)|PointCast]], [[Novell]] (under CEO [[Eric Schmidt]], later of [[Google]]), and [[Siebel Systems]].

The first edition of Wibbeke's text appeared in 2008 with the title, Global Business Leadership, published by [[Elsevier]] (Butterworth-Heinemann) in Oxford, UK. Wibbeke was asked to present the book at a [[Google Tech Talk]] in 2008. The book also won the 2008 [[San Diego]] Book Awards prize for Best Business Book. The second edition of Global Business Leadership was published in 2014 by Taylor &amp; Francis ([[Routledge]]).

Wibbeke then began a tenure of teaching at several universities, including the [[University of California (Santa Cruz)]], the [[University of Liverpool]], and the [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]].

Wibbeke holds dual [[citizenship]] with the [[United States]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] and is a [[Novell]] Certified Internet Business Strategist. Wibbeke currently is on the U.S. [[Fulbright Specialist]] Roster and has already completed one grant in New Zealand (2015) on the topic of geoleadership.

Dr. Wibbeke was invited to the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (aka VMI) in 2016 to speak about the Geoleadership Model to cadets and military faculty during their 7th Annual VMI Leadership and Ethics Conference. [[Virginia Military Institute]] is a small, public, nationally ranked college committed to leadership development in a military environment in [[Lexington, Virginia]].  The speaker for this 7th annual conference was the Honorable [[James A. Baker]], the former White House Chief of Staff, The U.S. Secretary of State, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

==Work==

''Wibbeke’s Geoleadership Model of Global Business Leadership Competencies''

Wibbeke’s Geoleadership Model of Global Business Leadership Competencies is a framework for global leadership applied to business, cross-cultural communication, and management. This model of global business competencies has seven dimensions.

#	Capability (Capable of intercultural learning agility)
#	Care (Capable of equal concern for stakeholders and bottom line)
#	Communication (Capable of open and respectful dialogue through active listening)
#	Consciousness (Capable of self-awareness without personal bias)
#	Context  (Capable of perceiving, discerning, and adapting to work situations)
#	Contrasts (Capable of perceiving multiple levels of meaning simultaneously)
#	Change (Capable of  working flexibly within complex socio-cultural system)

'''EYE Film Institute Netherlands''' is a Dutch archive and museum in Amsterdam that preserves and presents both Dutch and foreign films screened in the Netherlands. The museum collection includes 37,000 film titles, 60,000 posters, 700,000 photographs and 20,000 books. The earliest materials date from the start of the film industry in the Netherlands in 1895.

==Location and history==
EYE is located in the [[Overhoeks]] neighborhood of [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It includes a [[cinematography]] museum formerly called ''Filmmuseum'', founded in 1952. Its predecessor was the Dutch Historical Film Archive, founded in 1946. The Filmmuseum was situated in the [[Vondelparkpaviljoen]] since 1975. In 2009, '''The Nederlands Filmmuseum''' merged with '''Holland Film''', the '''Netherlands Institute for Film Education''' and the [[Filmbank]]&lt;ref name="NFM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmarchives-online.eu/partneriai/nederlands-filmmuseum | title=Nederlands Filmmuseum (NFM) | publisher=[[filmarchives online]] | accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans were announced for a new home on the north bank of Amsterdam's [[IJ (bay)|waterfront]], just behind the [[Amsterdam Centraal station|Central Station]] and connected to it by a free ferry.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam.info"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amsterdam.info/museums/filmmuseum/ | title=EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam | publisher=Amsterdam.info | accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially opened on April 4, 2012 by [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]].&lt;ref name="nyt-n"&gt;

'''''Fine Prints of the Year''''' was an annual series of books that reported and discussed the [[etching]]s, [[engraving]]s, [[woodcut]]s and [[lithograph]]s published each year between 1923 and 1938 by major artists of the period. All volumes reproduced in [[monochrome]] on high quality glossy paper a selection of about 100 [[special edition|limited edition]] prints published during the preceding year. The series provides an important record of the work of artists in the last years of the [[etching revival]] and during the collapse of the market for prints.

==History==
The first volume of ''Fine Prints of the Year'' was published in London in 1924 by Halton and Truscott Smith as a review of the prints issued during the year up to October, 1923.&lt;ref name=FPOY1&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1924). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1923.  An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 1. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited&lt;/ref&gt;  The volume reproduced 150 etchings, drypoints, lithographs or woodcuts by major British and American printmakers of the day such as [[Stanley Anderson]], [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank Benson]], [[Edmund Blampied]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Gerald Brockhurst]], [[F.L. Griggs]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[James McBey]], [[Henry Rushbury]], [[Frank Short]] and [[William Walcot]] as well as the work of many artists whose work is less well known.&lt;ref name=FPOY1/&gt;  Some copies of volume two, for the year 1924, contained as a frontispiece an unsigned, original etching by Frank Brangwyn.&lt;ref name=FPOY2&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1925). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1924. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 2. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited&lt;/ref&gt; From the third volume ''Fine Prints of the Year'' was also published in the USA by Minton, Balch and Company of New York.&lt;ref name=FPOY3&gt;Salaman, M.C., editor (1926). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1925. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 3. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 13 volumes, from 1923 to 1935, contained an introductory essay by [[Malcolm Charles Salaman|Malcolm Salaman]], an art critic and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, now the [[Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers]]. From 1936 to 1938 the introduction was provided by [[Campbell Dodgson]], who was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the [[British Museum]]. From 1926 to 1930 each volume contained a short introduction to American prints by Helen Fagg; from 1931 to 1934 the introduction was written by Susan A. Hutchinson.

From the second volume, published in 1924, the series also published a directory of the publishers of prints and a directory of the name and address of the etchers, engravers and lithographers then working in Great Britain, France, the United States of America and elsewhere with the titles, dimensions, publishers and sometimes with the prices of the prints designed or released by each artist during the previous year. This constitutes an important record of the work of many artists which, until the print boom ended in around 1930, were seen as an investment and were the subject of substantial trading and inflated prices. For example, an etching entitled ''Mersea, Sunset'' by [[James McBey]], whose work was highly sought after in the 1920s, was issued to subscribers in an edition of 76 [[artist's proof]]s in 1926 at a price of 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name=FPOY3/&gt; A proof of this print from the edition of 76 was sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in December of the same year for just under 105 guineas, a ten times higher price.&lt;ref name=PPC9&gt;Wilder, F.L. &amp; Wilder, E.L. (1928). ''Print Prices Current'', volume 9, October 1926-August 1927. London: F.L. &amp; E.L. Wilder.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wall Street Crash]] in the USA and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] greatly diminished the market for prints, but many artists continued to design plates, though fewer in number, in smaller editions and at lower prices, as the volumes of ''Fine Prints of the Year'' between 1930 and 1938 show. For example, the artist Edmund Blampied issued 76 etchings between 1920 and 1929, typically in editions of 100 proofs, but in the following decade only published 23 etchings, some in editions of less than 50 proofs.&lt;ref name=Hall1&gt;Hall, A. (2010). ''[[Edmund Blampied]]. An illustrated life''.  Pp 272.  Jersey: [[Jersey Heritage]]. {{ISBN|978-0-9562079-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fine Prints of the Year'' continued as a record of the work of etchers and engravers until the sixteenth and last annual volume for 1938,&lt;ref name=FPOY16&gt;Dodgson, C., editor (1938). ''Fine Prints of the Year 1938. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving'', Volume 16. London: Halton &amp; Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; just before the start of the [[Second World War]] in Europe brought about rationing of paper and presumably put an end to the series. The 16 volumes published in the series reproduced over 1,700 prints and remains an important visual and factual record of the work of etchers and engravers, many of whom were once well known and whose prints commanded high prices.

'''''Help!''''' is a 1965 British [[Musical film|musical]] [[Comedy film|comedy]]-[[Adventure film|adventure]] film directed by [[Richard Lester]], starring [[the Beatles]]–[[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]—and featuring [[Leo McKern]], [[Eleanor Bron]], [[Victor Spinetti]], [[John Bluthal]], [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[Patrick Cargill]]. The second film starring The Beatles following Lester's ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', ''Help!'' sees Ringo as the human sacrifice for an evil [[cult]] and the band must protect him.&lt;ref name="Beatles.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Help!|url=http://www.beatles.com/#/films/Help|publisher=Beatles.com|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was released as an album, also called ''[[Help!]]''.

The film had its Royal World Premiere at the [[London Pavilion]] Theatre in the [[West End of London]] on 29 July 1965 in the presence of [[Princess Margaret]], Countess of Snowdon and the [[Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]]. While not reviewed at the time with the same high level of admiration as their first film, the film is regarded a half century later as being influential, including in the subsequent development of  [[music videos]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:The Beatles Trailer USHelp.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|Screenshot of [[The Beatles]] in ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'']]
An [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[cult]] (a parody of the [[Thuggee]] cult) is about to sacrifice a woman to the [[goddess]] Kaili. Just as she is about to be killed, the high priestess of the cult, Ahme, notices that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. [[Ringo Starr]], drummer of [[the Beatles]], has the ring and is wearing it; it was secretly sent to him by the victim in a fan letter. Determined to retrieve the ring and sacrifice the woman, the great [[Swami]] Clang, Ahme, and several cult members including Bhuta, leave for London. After several failed attempts to steal the ring, they confront the Beatles in an Indian restaurant. Ringo learns that if he does not return the ring soon, he will become the next sacrifice. Ringo then discovers that the ring is stuck on his finger.

The Beatles go to a jeweller to remove the ring, but the tools he uses all break. They then go to a mad scientist, Foot, and his assistant Algernon. In a lab full of American-made equipment, they attempt to expand the ring's molecules so it can slide off Ringo's finger. But the machines only manage to remove all his other rings. Astonished that his equipment has no effect on the ring, Foot decides that he, too, must have it. While they bumble with trying to get a laser together, Ahme crashes the lab and holds the scientists at gunpoint while she lets the Beatles escape.

Back home, Ahme tells the group that her sister's time has passed and she is now out of danger and Ringo is now the sacrificial victim. She prepares a special solution intended to shrink Ringo's finger so she can get the ring off. But then Clang and his henchmen crash the house, causing Ahme to drop the syringe on Paul's leg. While a shrunken Paul hides in an ashtray, the cult attack the other Beatles and pour red paint on Ringo (as part of the sacrifice). Foot and Algernon come in, shoots a warning shot with his [[Webley revolver|Webley]] and scares the cult away, Ahme in tow. Paul unshrinks and John subsequently starts to swing a lamp at Foot who tries to shoot him, but his gun misfires. Blaming this on the fact that the gun is British made, Foot retreats. The boys are left to sort things out.

The band flees to the Austrian Alps for refuge but both thugs and Foot follow in pursuit.  The Beatles practise skiing, then participate in a game of [[curling]].  Foot and Algernon booby-trap one of the curling stones with a bomb; George sees the "fiendish thingy" and tells everyone to run. The bomb eventually goes off after a delay, creating a big hole in the ice from which a Channel swimmer ([[Mal Evans]]) emerges and asks directions to the White Cliffs of Dover. The boys ski down a slope fleeing from Clang, directed by Ahme, who then misdirects Clang to the take-off ramp for a Ski jumping contest. Clang is the winner, and is forced to the winners' platform to receive a gold medal.

The group escapes back to England and they ask for "protection" from [[Scotland Yard]]; and get it in the form of a cowardly [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]] (Cargill). After being attacked while recording in the middle of [[Salisbury Plain]] surrounded by the [[British Army]], they hide in "A Well Known Palace" ([[Buckingham Palace]]) until they are almost captured by Foot.

While on a walk with the police, the group step into a small pub, where Clang is disguised as a barman. After being served beer, Ringo cannot pick his glass up from the table, so George tips it over, unknowingly opening a [[trapdoor]] to the cellar that Clang set up, into which Ringo drops.  Inside the cellar is a door with a broken knob, a broken ladder and a [[tiger]]. They go summon the Inspector who tells them to sing the "Ode to Joy" from [[Beethoven's 9th Symphony]] to the tiger in order to tame it; everyone inside and outside the pub joins in.

The Beatles put out in the press that they're going to the [[Bahamas]] to throw the cult off their scent, but Ringo wants to go there anyway. The Beatles arrive, followed by Scotland Yard officers, Foot and Clang. After Ringo is nearly captured, the other Beatles pose as him in order to lure the cult members, who are then arrested by the [[Royal Bahamas Police Force|Bahamas Police]]. Despite their best efforts, Ringo is captured by Foot, who takes him on to a ship intending to cut off his finger to get the ring.

Ahme rescues Ringo from Foot by exchanging him for a vial of the "distilled essence of certain orchids". The two try to escape the ship by jumping into the water; however, Ringo cannot swim. They are captured by the cult and tied down on the beach where they are surrounded by two battalions of [[Gurkhas|Kukhri Rifles]]. Clang begins the ceremony to sacrifice Ringo, with cult members prepared to attack the rest of the Beatles and police when they come to the rescue.

Ringo and Ahme manage to untie themselves, and the ring slips off his finger as he tries to wave to his band mates to warn them away. He puts the ring on Clang's hand, and Ahme declares Clang as the next sacrifice. A final brawl ensues between the Beatles, the cult, and the police. Clang manages to get the ring off himself and gives it to Foot and Algernon. They, however, leave the ring in the sand in favour of the shrinking solution. The ring ends up on the greedy Bhuta's finger and he becomes the target for sacrifice to the put-upon Clang's obvious glee; meanwhile, the Channel swimmer reappears on the beach and once again asks for directions to the White Cliffs of Dover. The movie ends with a dedication to "[[Elias Howe]], who, in 1846, invented the [[sewing machine]]".

The credits feature the characters acting up in front of the camera, with the jewel of the ring being placed in front of the lens. The music playing during the credits is the Overture of ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]], with The Beatles adding their own laughing and comments.

==Inspiration==

The Beatles said the film was inspired by the [[Marx Brothers]] classic ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRpqWHwLZNoC&amp;pg=PT377 |title=Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation |page=1377 |isbn=0-7432-5378-7 |year=2011 |last=Norman |first=Phillip |publisher=Simon and Schuster |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also directly satirical of the [[James Bond]] series of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Ob1bL_ongC&amp;pg=PA102 |page=102 |title=Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four |year=2012 |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |author2=Davis, Todd F |isbn=0-7914-8196-4 |publisher=SUNY Press |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the original release of ''Help!'', its distributor, [[United Artists]], also held the rights to the Bond series.

The humour of the film is strongly influenced by the abstract humour of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', in which the director had personal and direct experience in the conversion of the radio format to television, and personal working experience with [[Peter Sellers]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HESlHkg_pRoC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=John Lennon Imagined: Cultural History of a Rock Star |page=54 |isbn=0-8204-6788-X |year=2004 |last=Mäkelä |first=Janne |publisher=Peter Lang |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatles recording producer [[George Martin]] had also produced records for the ''Goon Show'' team. McCartney has always said that the Beatles style of humour was taken from the ''Goon Show''. Many of the film's concepts are derived from ''Goon Show''s, such as the presence of wild animals, music, [[fourth wall]]-breaking jokes and abstractions such as the closing statement that concludes the film.

==Working title==

The original working title for the film was ''Eight Arms to Hold You''. This title was printed on the single "Ticket to Ride" as an upcoming movie. Because of this, the phrase has been used as a title for an album by [[Veruca Salt]] and for songs by [[The Goonies]] and by The Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.

==Production==
According to interviews conducted with [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and Ringo Starr for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', director Richard Lester was given a larger budget for this film than he had for ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', thanks to the commercial success of the latter. Thus, this feature film was in colour and was shot on several exotic foreign locations. It was also given a more extensive musical score than ''A Hard Day's Night'', provided by a full orchestra, and including pieces of well known classical music: [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Act III Overture, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s "[[1812 Overture]]", [[Beethoven]]'s "[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]" ("Ode to Joy"), and, during the end credits and with their own comic vocal interpretation, [[Rossini]]'s "[[The Barber of Seville|Barber of Seville]]" overture. The original title for the film – only changed to ''Help!'' very near to its release – was ''Eight Arms To Hold You.''&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Brian."Part 7," ''The Beatles Story'' (BBC, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Help!'' was shot in London, [[Salisbury Plain]], the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]], [[New Providence Island]] and [[Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas and [[Twickenham Film Studios]], beginning in the Bahamas on 23 February 1965. Starr commented in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' that they were in the Bahamas for the hot weather scenes, and therefore had to wear light clothing even though it was rather cold. Tony Bramwell, the assistant to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, stated in his book ''A Magical Mystery Tour'' that Epstein chose the Bahamas for tax reasons. According to ''The Beatles Anthology'', during the restaurant sequence filmed in early April, George began to discover [[India]]n-style music, which would be a key element in future songs such as [[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|"Norwegian Wood"]]. Filming finished on 14 April at Ailsa Avenue in [[Twickenham]].

The ski scenes were shot at [[Obertauern]], a small village in Austria. One reason this location was chosen was that the stars of the movie were less likely to be recognized there than at one of the larger resorts with many British tourists. The Beatles were in Obertauern for about two weeks in March 1965 along with a film crew of around 60 people. Locals served as ski stunt doubles for the Beatles who stayed at the hotel "Edelweiss". Most of the crew were based in the hotel "Marieta", where one night the Beatles gave an impromptu concert on the occasion of a director's assistant's birthday. This was the only time they ever played on stage in Austria.&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;{{cite news | last =  Kast| first = Günter| author2 = | title = Hi-Hi-Hilfe! | newspaper = Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung | location = Travel Section | pages = 4 | language = German | publisher = | date = 4 January 2015 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles did not particularly enjoy the filming of the movie, nor were they pleased with the end product. In 1970, [[John Lennon]] said they felt like extras in their own movie.

{{quote|text=The movie was out of our control. With ''A Hard Day's Night'', we had a lot of input, and it was semi-realistic. But with ''Help!'', Dick Lester didn't tell us what it was all about. |sign=John Lennon on filming ''Help!''}}

Ten years later Lennon was more charitable:&lt;ref&gt;Sheff, David.  ''All We Are Saying''. 2000, St Martin's Griffin, {{ISBN|0-312-25464-4}}, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=I realize, looking back, how advanced it was. It was a precursor to the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] "Pow!  Wow!" on TV—that kind of stuff. But [Lester] never explained it to us. Partly, maybe, because we hadn't spent a lot of time together between ''A Hard Day's Night'' and ''Help!'', and partly because we were smoking marijuana for breakfast during that period. Nobody could communicate with us, it was all glazed eyes and giggling all the time. In our own world. It's like doing nothing most of the time, but still having to rise at 7&amp;nbsp;am, so we became bored.}}

A contributing factor was exhaustion attributable to their busy schedule of writing, recording and touring. Afterward they were hesitant to begin another film project, and indeed ''Help!'' was their last full-length scripted theatrical film. Their obligation for a third film to United Artists was met by the 1970 documentary film [[Let It Be (film)|''Let It Be'']]. The 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' did not meet contractual obligations because it did not star the Beatles, and their only live appearance was featured for less than two minutes at the film's conclusion.

==="Haze of marijuana"===
The Beatles later said the film was shot in a "haze of marijuana". According to Starr's interviews in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', during the Austrian Alps film shooting, he and McCartney ran off over the hill from the "[[curling]]" scene set to smoke a joint.
{{quote|text=A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film. It was great. That helped make it a lot of fun&amp;nbsp;... In one of the scenes, Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear are playing curling: sliding along those big stones. One of the stones has a bomb in it and we find out that it's going to blow up, and have to run away. Well, Paul and I ran about seven miles, we ran and ran, just so we could stop and have a joint before we came back. We could have run all the way to Switzerland. If you look at pictures of us you can see a lot of red-eyed shots; they were red from the dope we were smoking. And these were those clean-cut boys! Dick Lester knew that very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script. We had such hysterics that no one could do anything. Dick Lester would say, "No, boys, could we do it again?" It was just that we had a lot of fun – a lot of fun in those days.|sign=Ringo Starr}}

In the ''Beatles Anthology Director's Cut'', Harrison admitted that they were smoking marijuana on the plane ride all the way to the Bahamas.

McCartney also shared some of his memories of when they were filming ''Help!'':

{{quote|text=We showed up a bit stoned, smiled a lot and hoped we'd get through it. We giggled a lot. I remember one time at Cliveden (Lord Astor's place, where the [[Profumo Affair|Christine Keeler/Profumo scandal]] went on); we were filming the [[Buckingham Palace]] scene where we were all supposed to have our hands up. It was after lunch, which was fatal because someone might have brought out a glass of wine as well. We were all a bit merry and all had our backs to the camera and the giggles set in. All we had to do was turn around and look amazed, or something. But every time we'd turn round to the camera there were tears streaming down our faces. It's OK to get the giggles anywhere else but in films, because the technicians get pissed off with you. They think, "They're not very professional." Then you start thinking, "This isn't very professional – but we're having a great laugh."|sign=Paul McCartney}}

{{quote|text=John did once offer me a joint. And I obligingly tried to take a little puff. I knew there was some special way of doing it – but I don't smoke anyway. So I took a little puff and then thought, "This is so expensive. I mustn't waste it!"  And gave it back to him. So that's your definition of naïve, I think.|sign=Eleanor Bron}}

The photographer [[Michael Peto]] was commissioned in 1965 to take still photographs during the making of the film; these became known for their candid and expressive quality. During the digitisation of the Michael Peto Collection, which is held by Archive Services, [[University of Dundee]], in 2002, 500 previously unpublished photographs of the Beatles taken during the making of ''Help!'' were reported to have been uncovered.&lt;ref name="Pictures discovered"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare Beatles pictures discovered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2304101.stm|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatles photographs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatles photographs come to light|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/oct/08/thebeatles.highereducation|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Photos uncovered"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen photos of The Beatles uncovered|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/proct02/beatles.html|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Peto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Peto Photographic Collection |url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/peto.htm |publisher=University of Dundee |accessdate=2 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903021711/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/peto.htm |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Now These Days are Gone'', a limited edition volume of Peto's photographs focusing on the Beatles images was produced in 2006 with deluxe editions of the book signed by [[Richard Lester]].

==Songs==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beatles - You're Going To Lose That Girl.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Beatles performing "[[You're Going to Lose That Girl]]".]] --&gt;

The songs played during the film are:

* "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]"
* "[[You're Going to Lose That Girl]]"
* "[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]"
* "[[Ticket to Ride]]"
* "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]"
* "[[The Night Before (song)|The Night Before]]" intersperesed with excerpts of "She's A Woman" (also see below) with an explosion at the end not heard on the Beatles' commercial recordings
* "[[Another Girl]]"
* "[[She's a Woman]]" (heard in the background, on a tape machine, and underground in the Salisbury Plain scene)
* "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]" titled on the US soundtrack album as "Another Hard Day's Night" (played by Indian band and as an instrumental)
* "[[I'm Happy Just to Dance with You]]" (played by a band during the bike-riding scene)
* "[[You Can't Do That]]" (played as an instrumental during the Austrian Alps sequence)
* "[[From Me To You]]" titled on the US soundtrack album as "From Me To You Fantasy" (played as an instrumental during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo's finger while he sleeps in the Beatles' communal apartment)

The seven main songs formed the first side of the British release of the ''[[Help!]]'' album. The second side consisted of other new Beatles songs recorded at the same time or shortly afterwards.  The US album, released by Capitol Records, includes the 7 movie tracks along with instrumental soundtrack songs orchestrated by Ken Thorne.  In addition, the US soundtrack leads off with a hidden track stylized as a satirical "James Bond Theme" before the title track, "Help!".  Early pressings of the US version of the album ''1962-1966'' include this hidden track banded as "Help!", and later pressings, when the UK catalogue was made the official and only catalogue of Beatles albums, omit it.

==Critical response==
Critical opinion at the time of release was generally positive, but many critics feel that this big budget effort was not as strong as ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. [[Leslie Halliwell]] describes it as an {{quote|text=[e]xhausting attempt to outdo ''A Hard Day's Night'' in lunatic frenzy, which goes to show that some talents work best on low budgets. The humour is a frantic cross between ''[[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'', [[The Goon Show|The Goons]], [[Goofy]], [[Mr. Magoo]] and the shade of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]] to come. It looks good but becomes too tiresome to entertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Halliwell |first=Leslie |title=Halliwell's Film and Video Guide |year=1997 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-638779-9 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Allmovie]]'s Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. describes it as {{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;a forerunner to music videos.&amp;nbsp;... [[Richard Lester|Lester]] seemed to find the right tone for ''Help!'', creating an enjoyable portrait of the Beatles and never allowing the film to take itself too seriously. His style would later be co-opted by [[Bob Rafelson|Bob Rafaelson]]{{sic}} for [[the Monkees]]' television series in the '60s and has continued to influence rock musicals like ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:22130~T1 |title=Help! |accessdate=24 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archivedate=26 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a contemporary review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' their critic [[Bosley Crowther]] was not impressed: {{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;It's a fiasco of farcical whimseys that are thrown together in this film—a clutter of mechancial gimmicks and madcap chases.&amp;nbsp;... Funny? Exciting? Different? Well, there's nothing in "Help!" to compare with that wild ballet of the Beatles racing across a playground in "A Hard Day's Night", nothing as wistful as the ramble of Ringo around London all alone.&amp;nbsp;... The boys themselves are exuberant and uninhibited in their own genial way. They just become awfully redundant and—dare I say it?—dull.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | last = Crowther | first = Bosley |title =Singers romp through comic adventures | newspaper = The New York Times|date = August 24, 1965| url = https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0CEEDC103CE733A25757C2A96E9C946491D6CF| accessdate = April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Novelisation==

A [[novelisation]] entitled ''The Beatles in Help!'' was written by Al Hine and published by [[Dell (publisher)|Dell]] in 1965.

A sequence featuring [[Frankie Howerd]] and [[Wendy Richard]] was filmed but left out of final editing owing to its length. However, the sequence was left in the film novelisation.

==Release history==
Like ''A Hard Day's Night'', ''Help!'' was originally distributed theatrically by [[United Artists]] – the company handled distribution from 1965 to the end of 1980. In January 1981, rights to the movie reverted from UA to producer Walter Shenson, and the movie was withdrawn from circulation.

''Help!'' was released several times in different video formats by MPI Home Video and [[The Criterion Collection]]. A version was released in February 1987 in VHS and Beta through MPI, along with a reissue of ''A Hard Day's Night'' the very same day, and was followed by a special-edition release on 31 October 1995. MPI also issued a CLV laserdisc in 1995 and two releases on DVD, the first as a single DVD release on 12 November 1997 and the second as part of ''The Beatles DVD Collector's Set'' on 8 August 2000.

LaserDisc releases include a Criterion CAV laserdisc and a Voyager CLV laserdisc in 1987, each of which had three pressings. The first pressings had no [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on the gatefold covers while the other two had the UPC either as a sticker or printed directly on the jacket.

The film's transfer on the CAV laserdiscs was done correctly so that no blending of frames occurs and thus movements are not blurry. The supplemental section, which, with few exceptions, has never been available on any other home video release, contains the following:
* original theatrical trailer (which includes deleted scenes)
* silent home movie footage of the film set and of the world premiere
* still photos, some of which are introduced by text describing the production history of the film
* posters
* sheet music
* record jackets
* radio ads (on audio during the silent footage)
* an open interview, originally designed for disc jockeys. By reading prompts on the screen, one can pretend to talk to the Beatles.

In June 2007, a version of ''Help!'', sub-titled in Korean, became available on Amazon.com. However, by July 2007, all home video versions of the film were pulled from the market because of rights issues involving Apple Corps – now the full rights holders to the film. The rights issues were eventually resolved and Apple Corps/EMI/Capitol released a new double DVD version with a fully restored image and newly remixed in 2.0 stereo and [[5.1]] [[surround]] sound of the film. This came in standard 2xDVD packaging and 2xDVD deluxe edition box set on 30 October 2007 in the UK and 6 November 2007 in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press60.htm |title=Stop worrying&amp;nbsp;...

The film was released on Blu-ray format in June 2013 by [[Universal Music]], now the owners of EMI/Capitol Records, using the 2007 restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1562341/beatles-help-comes-to-blu-ray | title=Beatles 'Help!'

'''''In Spring''''' ({{lang-uk|Навесні|Navesni}}, {{lang-ru|Весной|Vesnoi}}) is a 1929  Soviet Ukraine [[silent film|silent]] [[experimental film|experimental]] [[documentary]] directed by [[Mikhail Kaufman]]. It was the first independent work of the cinematographer, made in accordance with the ideas of the avant-garde manifesto [[Kinoks]] and was Kaufman's directorial debut.

According to some Russian media, at the end of the 20th century the film was considered lost; a copy was discovered in 2005 at an archive in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="АН" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvkultura.ru/article/show/article_id/115962 |title=In the art park "Muzeon" a program of film screenings accompanied by live music has concluded|date=2014|publisher=[[Russia-K]]|accessdate=2015-05-19|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
A discord between Michael Kaufman and [[Dziga Vertov]] foreshadowed the creation of the film "In Spring". Between the filmmaker brothers there were creative differences even when working on the picture [[Man with a Movie Camera]]. According to Kaufman, the film itself had a lot of chaos, and footage assembly was carried out without "a clearly worked out plan". The spat led to Mikhail deciding to create his own film on the basis of stylistic and technical methods that have been used by him in previous films:&lt;ref name="НМ"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kopalina G. I.|title=Last interview of Mikhail Kaufman|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/1994/1/kaufman01.html|publisher=[[Novy Mir]]|year=1994|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="That year with Vertov we diverged in views for good and all and began to work independently. I was armed with a movie camera and had a multitude of methods concerning reflection of life. Regarding the topic of spring, I actually stumbled upon it by accident."}}

By composition, the picture "In Spring" was divided into five nominal parts ("At the Turn", "Spring Vexation", "Life", "National Holidays", "Spring is Coming"), but the director did not conduct a special "organization of material for the film"; at the heart of the work was only observation of the progress of life.&lt;ref name="НМ" /&gt; At the same time, as noted by Nikolai Ushakov, author of the book "Three Cinematographers", Kaufman sometimes had to take on the role of a tamer: to get closer to a bird which is filmed and to get its trust, he "accustomed it to a movie camera".&lt;ref name="КЗ"&gt;{{cite news |author=Alexander Deryabin |title= Three cinematographers.

==Overview==
The beginning of the film shows the gradual progression from winter to spring. The snowman, which in the first frame looks strong and monolithic, suddenly reduces in size; streams are flowing on roads, thawed ice is melting on the roofs. Citizens open windows, remove winter insulation, wash the glass and bring warm blankets to the balcony. On the streets there are mobile cisterns and carts with [[kvass]] with ice cream.

Next part of the picture presents an industrial landscape which is a continuous movement of mechanisms, gears and trolleys. One of the shops lays out the newspaper "[[Socialist emulation]] Bulletin" for the year 1929. Then the camera transports the viewer to the city parks and gardens. On the trunk of a tree a [[snail]] is moving, in the branches birds build nests, bees swarm around flowers, buds bloom directly before the eyes. Citizens, freed from winter clothing walk in pairs or singly; young mothers wheel open strollers through the streets.

May Days. A demonstration with flags, sport competitions, a football match at a packed stadium. Daredevil-bicyclist rides on a street while playing the harmonica; girls are dancing.

==Reception==
The film, released in 1930, received a positive response, and became a subject of special film studies research. The French film theorist [[Georges Sadoul]] declared Kaufman's directorial debut film as "the best picture of 1929".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evgenia Leonova|title=Evgeniy Tsimbal: "Dziga and his brothers". Part of history |url=http://kinoart.ru/archive/2003/07/n7-article17|publisher=Iskusstvo Kino|year=2003|issue=7|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the discussion which took place in Kiev after the premiere of "In Spring", the writer and critic [[Leonid Pervomayskiy]] noted that in the film are present "both Kaufman the artist and Kaufman the poet" and described the author's montage as "brilliant". According to writer [[Oleksandr Korniychuk]], creator of the picture was able to "brilliantly organize scattered pieces united by a common idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. Shatsilo |chapter=Mikhail Kaufman |title= The chroniclers of our times.

Reviewers did not do without comparing aesthetic positions of Vertov and Kaufman. Nikolai Ushakov when comparing their style noted that "Kaufman exceeds Vertov in deciphering reality because the director 'partially abstracts' what is shot by the cinematographer".&lt;ref name="КЗ" /&gt; At the same time the film historian Lev Roshal described the film as "one of the most beautiful, lyrically delicate and plastically perfect documentaries", gave credit to Dziga as the mentor brother: "The pupil has learned a lot. &lt;...&gt; It was Kaufman's victory but Vertov could also be proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lev Roshal|title=Dziga Vertov|url=http://2011.russiancinema.ru/template.php?dept_id=15&amp;e_dept_id=1&amp;e_person_id=4847|place=M. |publisher=Iskusstvo|year=1982|pages=310|series=Life in Art|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators of "Modern History of Russian Cinema", establishing the genre of "In Spring" as a cinema poem, have separately identified "a generic trait", which defines not only the Kaufman film, but also other documentary films of the 1920s - "a vividly pronounced beginning of an auteur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Glossary.

==Stylistic Aspects==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F5DC |salign=center |width=250px |align=right
| quote =Kaufman really does not have any revolutionary transformation of reality. &lt;...&gt; His world is full of joy just from the fact of his own existence. From puddles, from shiny icicles from a couple strolling along the boulevard. And there was evening and there was morning, and he saw that it was good.&lt;ref name="АН"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colta.ru/articles/cinema/4207|title=Withot Vertov |author=Assa Novikova |date=2014-11-08|publisher=Colta.ru|accessdate=2015-05-11 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; | source =
}}
In his last interview published in the journal "New World", Mikhail Kaufman said that during the work he also wanted to show a destructive force and "biology of spring", and the change in the consciousness that comes along with the melting snow. To the director it was important to "avoid head-on proselytism": the spectator observing together with the author the short-term transformation of everything living has to feel the symbolism of individual shots and sequences by himself.&lt;ref name="НМ" /&gt;

Special emphasis during montage was given to the rhythm: he took charge of the "natural processes", and the traffic and movement of citizens on the streets. Kaufman combined "gustatory, olfactory and auditory sensations" of nature when demonstrating the "lyricism of spring": flowers in his film directly before the eyes fill with vitality and chestnuts "communicate" with each other. At some point the viewer changes from the passive observer to an active participant of the on-screen action: in particular during the scene where water splashes charge from the screen - under the wheels of the car - right into the cinema hall. The same proximity effect to observed events is visible in the episode with the train:&lt;ref name="КЗ" /&gt;
{{Quote|text="In Spring" also has footage which shows what the camera attached between the wheels of the train sees as it moves along with the train - the wheels race directly at the viewer. Kaufman succeeded marvelously at dissecting the train's movements.}}

The '''Jadeite Cabbage''' ({{zh|c=翠玉白菜|p=Cuìyù Báicài|poj=''Chhùi-ge̍k Pe̍h-chhài''}}) or '''Jadeite Cabbage with Insects''' is a piece of [[jadeite]] carved into the shape of a [[Chinese cabbage]] head, and with a [[locust]] and [[katydid]] camouflaged in the leaves. It is part of the collection of the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Palace"&gt;[http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/Article.aspx?sNo=04001080 Jadeite Cabbage with Insects] at the National Palace Museum website. Retrieved 20 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its popularity with museum-goers and frequent misrepresentation as a national treasure, it in fact is only designated as a significant antiquity, having less rarity and value than required for categorization as a national treasure under the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/090326/58/1grfb.html 江昭倫，故宮副院長馮明珠：不反對翠玉白菜、肉形石升級為國寶，中央廣播電台，2009-03-26]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Jadeite Cabbage has been called the "most famous masterpiece" of the entire National Palace Museum,&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt; and along with the [[Meat-shaped Stone]] and the [[Mao Gong Ding]], is today called one of the Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum, a redesignation from several less accessible, infrequently-displayed works.&lt;ref name="multiple1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.thu.edu.tw/~fineart/upfiles/news01167287663.doc |author=倪再沁 |title=神畫的形塑—論故宮三寶 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been chosen by the public as the most important item in the museum's entire collection.&lt;ref name="Ju"/&gt;

==Description==
The Jadeite Cabbage is a small sculpture. Measuring only {{convert|18.7|by|9.1|cm|in}} and is {{convert|5.07|cm|in}} thick,&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt; it is "hardly larger than a human hand".&lt;ref name="Hook"&gt;Leslie Hook. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118549131061379569 "The Jade Cabbage"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 27 July 2007. Retrieved 20 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruffled semi-translucent appearance of the leaves is due to the combination of various natural colors of the [[jade]] to recreate the color variations of a real cabbage.&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt;  The figure was carved from a single piece of half-white, half-green jadeite which contained numerous imperfections such as cracks and discolored blotches. These flaws were incorporated into the sculpture and became the veins in the cabbage's stalks and leaves.&lt;ref name="Ju"&gt;Sam Ju. [http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=2009109810083e.txt&amp;table=2&amp;h1=Art%20and%20Culture&amp;h2=Museums "The Crystallization of the Jadeite Cabbage."] Translated by David Smith. ''[[Taiwan Panorama]]''. October 2009. p. 83. Retrieved 20 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture has been considered an allegory of female virtue with the white stalk symbolizing purity, the leaves denoting fertility and abundance and locust and [[katydid]] representing children.&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt; However, further studies have proven that this interpretation is incorrect with regard to the katydid. There is a poem about an insect "zhongsi" in the Book of Poetry. This insect has been used metaphorically as an auspicious symbol for having many children and grandchildren in Chinese culture. Based on the interpretations of this poem and entomological analyses, this "zhongsi" is very likely a migratory locust.  The locust on the Jadeite Cabbage is too small to be positively identified as a migratory locust. However, this "katydid" is definitely a Chinese bush cricket (scientific name: Gampsocleis gratiosa ) which is not the "zhongsi" of the Book of Poetry. In fact, the Chinese bush cricket is a singing insect artificially raised and used during the Qing Dynasty to entertain guests at the palace banquet. Consequently, this insect cannot be used as a fertility symbol.&lt;ref name=Akey&gt;{{cite web|author=Akey C. F. Hung|title=The two insects on the Jadeite Cabbage|language=Chinese|url=https://anntw.com/articles/20140716-hkik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculptor of the Jadeite Cabbage is unknown.  It was first displayed in the [[Forbidden City]]'s Yonghe Palace, the residence of the [[Qing Empire]]'s [[Guangxu Emperor]]'s [[Consort Jin]] who probably received it as part of her dowry for her wedding to Guangxu, in 1889.&lt;ref name="Palace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook"/&gt; Following the fall of the Qing Empire in the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution of 1911]], the sculpture became part of the collection of the [[Palace Museum]] in the Forbidden City.  Along with a core of that collection, the piece survived the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] ([[World War II]]) and the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was eventually relocated to Taiwan's National Palace Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5594">'''Julián Ribera y Tarragó''' ([[Carcaixent]], [[Valencia]], 19 February 1858 &amp;ndash; 2 May 1934, [[La Pobla Llarga]], [[Valencia]]) was a Spanish Arabist and academic.

==Career==

Ribera studied under Prof. [[:es:Francisco Codera y Zaidín|Francisco Codera y Zaidín]] at Madrid from 1882 to 1885. In 1887 at age 29 he became ''catedrático'' (full professor) of Arabic at the [[Universidad de Zaragoza|University of Zaragoza]]. There Prof. Ribera founded the ''Revista de Aragón''. Later, in Madrid he co-founded (with [[Miguel Asín Palacios]]) the journal ''Cultura Española'' (1906–1909). He had transferred from Zaragoza to become ''catedrático'' of History at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], then of Literature in 1913. Prof. Ribera and his former student Prof. Asín collaborated on various academic projects. His career was celebrated by his peers in  his ''Jubilación'' of 1927. When Prof. Ribera retired, his chair was taken by Ángel González Palencia.&lt;ref&gt;Introductory notes by [[Emilio García Gómez]] in the 1985 reprint by Mayo de Oro, Madrid, of Ribera's ''La Música árabe y su influencia en la Española'' (Madrid 1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

Ribera's work focused on the Islamic culture of [[Al-Andalus]] and its legacy in [[Spain]]. He would eventually take several new approaches to [[Arabist|Arabic studies]], although he began following the lead of his mentor Prof. Codera. He wrote on [[education]]&lt;ref&gt;''La enseñanza entre los musulmanes españoles'' (1893); ''La superstición pedagógica'' (1910).&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[legal history]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Orígenes del Justicia de Aragón'' (Zaragoza: Comas 1897).&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-course Ribera was influenced by the spirit of the [[generation of '98|generación del 98]].&lt;ref&gt;Specifically his well-known articles signed with the anagram "Dr. Bráyer" in ''Revista de Aragón'' (1900-1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Later his interest was directed to investigating the rich heritage of [[Arabic music]] and [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] in Al Andalus, and the extent of its influence on subsequent [[Spanish literature]] and [[Spanish music|music]], as well as on that of other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Crowned by his ''La Música de las Cantigas'' (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; Subtle interconnections and relationships were revealed and discussed by Prof. Ribera. He was at the cutting edge of work in this area, which has since grown into a large corpus of academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;Asín Palacios, "Introducción" to Ribera, ''Disertaciones y Opúsculos'' (1928), at xv-cxvi; Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970), at Chapter VI, pages 151-173, i.e., "Julián Ribera y Tarragó"; Emilio García Gómez in the 1985 reprint published by Mayo de Oro, Madrid, of Ribera's ''La Música árabe y su influencia en la Española'' (Madrid 1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aloysius Martin Thesz''' (April 24, 1916 – April 28, 2002) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/08/sports/lou-thesz-86-skilled-pro-wrestler-dies.html|title=Lou Thesz, 86, Skilled Pro Wrestler, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=May 8, 2002|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A six time [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world champion]], he held the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions|three times]] for a combined total of 10 years, three months and nine days (3,749 days) – longer than anyone else in history. Thesz is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20130331/PC20/130339966/1131/mooneyham-column-pro-wrestling-books-worth-reading-x2018-the-voice-of-mid-atlantic-wrestling-x2019|title=Pro wrestling books worth reading; 'The Voice of Mid-Atlantic Wrestling'|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|date=March 31, 2013|website=[[The Post and Courier]]|access-date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/wrestlingframe.html|title=Wrestling History: 2002|website=[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many accomplishments in the sport, he is credited with inventing a number of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the [[German suplex|belly-to-back waistlock suplex]] (later known as the German suplex due to its association with [[Karl Gotch]]), the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Thesz press|Lou Thesz press]], [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|stepover toehold facelock]] (STF), and the [[Ganso bomb|original powerbomb]].

== Professional wrestling career ==
[[File:Wrestling. The Angel...Lou Thesz BAnQ P48S1P06188.jpg|thumb|left|Lou Thesz against [[The French Angel]] in the ring, 1940]]
Born in [[Banat, Michigan|Banat]], [[Michigan]] in 1916,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Thesz's family moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] when he was a young boy.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; His working-class immigrant parents Martin, a shoemaker of Hungarian and German descent, and Katherine Schultz, also of German descent, hailed from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Beginning in Thesz's early youth, his father personally gave him a tough and thorough education in [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], which provided the fundamentals for his later success. While in high school, he was a successful [[freestyle wrestling]] competitor on his school team; as he recalled many years later, he and a friend once "worked" a dramatic match against each other at a tournament, and were amused when nobody could see how much they were faking. As a teenager, he also trained in [[amateur wrestling]] with wrestler [[Ad Santel]]. Thesz made his [[professional wrestling]] debut in 1932, at the age of 16. He soon met [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]], the biggest wrestling star of the 1920s and renowned for his [[catch wrestling]] expertise, who taught a young Lou the art of "hooking" (the ability to stretch your opponent with painful holds), and the two formed a lasting friendship. By 1937, Thesz had become one of the biggest stars in the St. Louis territory, and on December 29 he defeated [[Everett Marshall]] for the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=awabos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/newengland/awa/ma-awa-h.html |title=AWA World Heavyweight Title (Boston) |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistoricalsociety.com/awa-boston-world-heavyweight-championship.html |title=Title Lineages: AWA (Boston) World Heavyweight Championship - The Home of Historical Wrestling |website=Prowrestlinghistoricalsociety.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of many [[world heavyweight titles]], which also made Thesz became the youngest world heavyweight champion in history, at the age of 21.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; Thesz [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to [[Steve "Crusher" Casey]] in [[Boston]] six weeks later. He won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship]] in 1939, once again defeating Marshall, and again in 1948, defeating [[Bill Longson]].

In 1948, the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) was formed, the purpose being to create one world champion for all the various wrestling territories throughout [[North America]]. [[Orville Brown]], the reigning Midwest World Heavyweight Championship holder, was named the first champion. Thesz, at the time, was head of a promotional combine that included fellow wrestling champions Longson, [[Bobby Managoff]], Canadian promoter [[Frank Tunney]] and [[Eddie Quinn]], who promoted in the St. Louis territory where NWA promoter [[Sam Muchnick]] was running opposition. Quinn and Muchnick ended their promotional war, and Thesz' promotion was absorbed into the NWA. Part of the deal was a [[Championship unification|title unification]] match between Brown and Thesz, who held the National Wrestling Association's World Heavyweight Championship. Unfortunately, just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]] and the NWA awarded the title to the No. 1 contender, Thesz. Thesz was chosen for his skill as a "hooker" to prevent double crosses by would-be [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shooters]] who would deviate from the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work|planned finish]] for personal glory.

Between 1949 and 1956, Thesz set out to unify all the existing world titles into the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship]]. In 1952, he defeated Baron Michele Leone in [[Los Angeles]] for the California World Heavyweight title and became the closest any wrestler had been to being [[Undisputed championship|undisputed]] world heavyweight wrestling champion since [[Danno O'Mahony]] in 1936. Thesz finally dropped the title to [[Whipper Billy Watson]] in 1956, and took several months off to recuperate from an [[ankle]] injury. He regained the title from Watson seven months later.

[[File:LouThesz.jpg|thumb|Thesz pictured in the 1950s]]
1957 was an important year for Thesz; on June 14, the first taint to Thesz' claim of undisputed champion occurred in a match with gymnast-turned-wrestling star, [[Edouard Carpentier]]. The match was tied at [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|two falls]] apiece when Thesz claimed a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] back injury and forfeit the last fall, thus Carpentier was declared the winner; however, the NWA chose not to recognize the title change, deciding a championship could not change hands due to injury. Despite the NWA's decision, there were some promotions who continued to recognize Carpentier's claim to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. That same year, Thesz became the first wrestler to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in [[Japan]], wrestling [[Rikidōzan]] in a series of 60-minute [[Draw (professional wrestling)|draws]]. Their bouts popularized professional wrestling in Japan, gaining the sport mainstream acceptance. Realizing he could make more money in the land of the rising sun, Thesz petitioned to the NWA promoters to regularly defend the [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] in Japan, but his request was turned down, and Thesz asked to drop the title to his own hand picked champion, [[Dick Hutton]], rather than Thesz's real-life rival and the more popular choice, [["Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. Thesz would embark on a tour of Europe and Japan, billing himself as the [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship|NWA International Heavyweight Champion]]; this title is still recognized as a part of [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]].

In 1963, Thesz came out of semi-retirement to win his sixth world heavyweight championship from [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] at the age of 46. He would hold the title until 1966 when, at the age of 49 when he lost it to [[Gene Kiniski]].

Thesz wrestled on a part-time basis over the next 13 years, winning his last major title in 1978, in [[Mexico]], becoming the inaugural [[UWA World Heavyweight Championship|Universal Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Champion]] at the age of 62, before dropping the championship to [[El Canek]] a year later. Thesz officially retired in 1979, after a match with [[Luke Graham (wrestler)|Luke Graham]], but he remained retired for the most part, before wrestling his last match on December 26, 1990 in [[Hamamatsu]], [[Japan]] at the age of 74, against his protégé, [[Masahiro Chono]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; This makes him one of the only male professional wrestlers, along with [[Abdullah The Butcher]], to wrestle in seven different decades.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Thesz was married three times. His first marriage to Evelyn Katherine Ernst in March 22, 1937.&lt;ref name="Kenyon 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenyon|first=Lou Thesz with Kit Bauman ; edited by J. Michael|title=Hooker|year=2011|publisher=Crowbar Press|location=Gallatin, Tenn.|isbn=978-0-9844090-4-4|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thesz was convalescing from a severe knee injury suffered in 1939 and from 1941 to 1944 and worked as a dog breeder and trainer for Dogs for Defense and later as a supervisor for the Todd Houston Shipyard.&lt;ref name="Kenyon 2011"/&gt; He divorced his first wife in 1944 and at the shipyard, Thesz met his second wife, Fredda Huddleston Winter, with whom he fathered three children: Jeff Thesz, Robert Thesz and Patrick Thesz.&lt;ref name="Kenyon 2011"/&gt; Thesz was drafted into the army in 1944 despite a legitimate injury to his knee and multiple medical deferments. He was placed into medic training and eventually teaching hand-to-hand combat defense for medics and was discharged in 1946.&lt;ref name="Kenyon 2011"/&gt; Thesz's second marriage came to an end in 1975.&lt;ref name="Kenyon 2011"/&gt; He married Charlie Catherine Thesz and remained with her for the rest of his life.

=== Later life and death ===
After retiring, Thesz became a [[Professional wrestling promotion|promoter]], [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[color commentator]], trainer and occasionally, a guest [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] for important matches. Some of the better-known matches he refereed include the following:
* [[Ric Flair]] versus [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, [[Kansas City Memorial Hall]], September 17, 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID%3D94E65419-53EB-4038-B3BCFBFDB94682E0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420000052/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=94E65419-53EB-4038-B3BCFBFDB94682E0 |archivedate=2006-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Antonio Inoki]] versus [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium]], September 19, 1985
* [[Big Van Vader]] versus [[Shinya Hashimoto]] in the tournament finals for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]], [[Tokyo Dome]], April 24, 1989
* Inoki and [[Seiji Sakaguchi]] versus Hashimoto and [[Masahiro Chono]], Tokyo Dome, February 10, 1990

In 1992, Thesz became the president of the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] (CAC), an organization recognizing and supporting retired wrestlers and actors who enjoyed an association with wrestling. He served as CAC's president until 2000. He became a trainer for the [[Union of Wrestling Force International]], and lent the promotion one of his old NWA championship belts, which they recognized as their own world title. As an announcer, Thesz was the color commentator for [[International World Class Championship Wrestling]]'s weekly television show. In 1999, his name was given to the [[George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] for professional wrestling stars with a successful amateur background at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], where he was an inaugural inductee. In October 1997, Thesz was honored by a ceremony at [[History of WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]]'s (WWF) [[Badd Blood: In Your House|Badd Blood]] as being both the youngest and oldest world heavyweight champion at ages 21 and 50, respectively&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; (technically, [[Verne Gagne]] holds the record for oldest champ, when he held the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in 1980 at age 54, which was tied by WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] in 1999; Thesz has since been supplanted as the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion by former champion [[Tim Storm]] (who was born on May 1, 1965), who won the title at age 51 by defeating [[Jax Dane]] on October 21, 2016).

Thesz lived in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] for much of his later life. He wrote an [[autobiography]], ''Hooker''. Undergoing [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple bypass surgery]] for an [[aortic valve]] replacement on April 9, 2002, he died due to complications weeks later on April 28 in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Alvarez|Alvarez, Bryan]]: "Figure Four Weekly Newsletter #358", page 1.

Thesz who would train Antonio Inoki and [[Giant Baba]] to model themselves like Thesz. There has never been another true undisputed world heavyweight champion since Thesz accomplished this feat by unifying all the major titles between the late 1940s and early 1950s. Thesz is strongly considered by many to be the greatest professional wrestler of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/personalities/thesz/ |title=Lou Thesz |website=Puroresu.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Thesz' passing, he was described as a "God" in Japan and the "[[Babe Ruth]]" of professional wrestling in America and "perhaps the last pure wrestler to ever exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/personalities/thesz/asahi.html |title=Lou Thesz lives on in the minds of Japanese - May 2, 2002 |website=Puroresu.com |date=2002-05-02 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, Thesz was called ''Tetsujin'' which means "Ironman" in respect for his speed, conditioning and vast array of amazing wrestling techniques. For a brief period, Thesz also trained Japanese [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] who would begin using some of the moves that Thesz innovated during his matches starting in the 1980s.

Thesz was the first wrestler to ever hold the NWA International Heavyweight Championship, which became a part of what is now the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship under All Japan Pro Wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/alljapan/int-h.html |title=NWA International Heavyweight Title (Japan) |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/alljapan/tc-h.html |title=Unified Triple Crown Heavyweight Title (Japan) |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thesz was also the first UWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct [[Universal Wrestling Association]] in Mexico, where he won the title after defeating [[Mil Máscaras]] on July 26, 1976. Thesz was the first ever TWWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct [[International Wrestling Enterprise]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/twwa-h.html |title=TWWA World Heavyweight Title (IWE) |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date=1968-01-24 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thesz and "The Outlaw" ([[Dory Funk Sr.]]) were the first ever NWA Pacific Coast (Vancouver) Tag Team Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/bc/bc-pc-t.html |title=Pacific Coast Tag Team Title (British Columbia) |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Thesz the most influential NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingNWA51/nwa_greatest.html |title=Nature Boy a natural choice: Experts pick Flair as greatest NWA champ |website=Canoe.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914213059/http://www.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingNWA51/nwa_greatest.html |archive-date=2016-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Thesz was named the second greatest professional wrestler of all time behind Ric Flair in the magazine article "100 Wrestlers of All Time" by John Molinaro, edited by [[Dave Meltzer]] and Jeff Marek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molinaro|first=John|year=2003|title=The Top 100 Wrestlers of All Time|isbn=1-55366-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Jack Brisco]] named Thesz his all-time favorite professional wrestler by saying that "Lou Thesz was my idol. He was a great wrestler, a great example, a class man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingChats/brisco_jack_oct01-can.html |title=SLAM! Wrestling - Jack Brisco Chat |website=Slam.canoe.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWE [[tag team]] known as [[The Vaudevillains]] have named Thesz as one of their influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/the-vaudevillains-talk-about-their-influences/ |title=The Vaudevillains Talk About Their Influences |publisher=411MANIA |date=2014-10-16 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE wrestler [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] named Thesz his "dream" tag team partner and said, "He [Thesz] personifies wrestling. He represents everything that I think it should be. He's a class act, and he was a workhorse for the company, while at the same time being a student of the game. He was completely legit. I would have loved a chance to go one-on-one with him or to work alongside him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/dream-tag-teams |title=9 Superstars pick their ultimate dream tag teams |publisher=WWE |date=2015-01-15 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thesz is an inaugural member of several professional wrestling [[Hall of fame|halls of fame]], including the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]], [[NWA Hall of Fame]], [[WCW Hall of Fame]], and the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame which is subsequently named after both one of his trainers along with Thesz himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nwhof.org/blog/pro-class/1999/ |title=1999 &amp;#124; National Wrestling Hall of Fame |website=Nwhof.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2016, Thesz was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as an inaugural member of the "Legacy" wing.

===Notes===
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Records are unclear as to where Thesz first won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and which promotion he was wrestling in when he won it.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nwa/world/nwa-h.html |title=NWA World Heavyweight Title |website=Wrestling-titles.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The World Heavyweight Championship of the National Wrestling Association existed from 1929 through 1949, when it was unified with the used by the National Wrestling Alliance.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Thesz's reigns with the title occurred prior to the NWA assuming control of it. In fact, he won the title before the NWA was created.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Thesz's also has two reigns with the title before the formation of the NWA and the title being renamed the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;/small&gt;

[[Image:Machinerysencyclopedia.jpg|thumb|''Machinery's Encyclopedia'', 1917]]
[[Image:Machinerysencyclopedia2.jpg|thumb|"Boiler", ''Machinery's Encyclopedia'', 1917]]

'''''Machinery's Handbook''''' ''for machine shop and drafting-room; a reference book on machine design and shop practice for the mechanical engineer, draftsman, toolmaker, and machinist'' (the full title of the 1st edition) is a classic reference work in [[mechanical engineering]] and practical [[workshop]] [[mechanic]]s in one volume published by [[Industrial Press]], New York, since 1914. The first edition was created by Erik Oberg (1881–1951) and [[Franklin D. Jones]] (1879–1967), who are still mentioned on the title page of the 29th edition (2012). Recent editions of the handbook contain chapters on mathematics, mechanics, materials, measuring, toolmaking, manufacturing, threading, gears, and machine elements, combined with excerpts from [[ANSI]] standards. 

In 1917, Oberg and Jones also published ''Machinery's Encyclopedia'' in 7 volumes. The handbook and encyclopedia are named after the monthly magazine ''Machinery'' (Industrial Press, 1894–1973), where the two were consulting editors.

Today, the phrases "machinist's handbook" or "machinists' handbook" are almost always imprecise references to ''Machinery's Handbook''. During the decades from [[World War I]] to [[World War II]], these phrases could refer to either of two competing reference books: [[McGraw-Hill]]'s ''[[American Machinists' Handbook]]'' or Industrial Press's ''Machinery's Handbook''. The former book ceased publication after the 8th edition (1945). (One short-lived spin-off appeared in 1955.) The latter book, ''Machinery's Handbook'', is still regularly revised and updated, and it continues to be a "bible of the metalworking industries" today.

''Machinery's Handbook'' is apparently the direct inspiration for similar works in other countries, such as Sweden's ''Karlebo handbok'' (1st ed. 1936).

==Background==
Richard Money was a shareholder in Ven-Lu-Ree Ltd, and on 9 November 1986 he agreed to sell his shares at valuation to the other shareholders. Both parties were each to appoint an accountant to set the value of the shares.

Unfortunately, there was no mechanism if the accountants could not agree to a valuation, such as an arbitration clause.

The matter ended up in the High Court where the judge said that it was implied that such a matter go to arbitration, and the judge referred this issue to arbitration.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision to refer the matter to arbitration. However, the court did say that even if the matter was not subject to arbitration, the agreement to sell at valuation was certain enough that the Court itself could have decided on the valuation.

The Privy Council later affirmed this decision.

'''Nencatacoa''' or '''Nem-catacoa''' was the [[deity|god]] and protector of the mantle makers, artists and festivities in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas; as much as the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Mayas]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] but other than the other three, they did not construct grand architecture. Their gold working however was well-known and respected which made Nencatacoa an important deity and protector.&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:BOG 04 2012 Museo de Oro 1177.JPG|thumb|260px|left|Golden mask in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ritual gold mask&lt;/small&gt;]]
Nencatacoa was represented in the form of a forest animal, made of gold and covered with a mantle. Nencatacoa looked most like a fox or a bear,&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/nencatacoa.html Description Nencatacoa] – Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; because as [[Pedro Simón]] noted, "an animal in that shape would appear multiple times".&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;

He was the protector god of the weavers, an industry that was very important among the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who used a great variety of materials but mostly cotton and [[fique]].&lt;ref name=p57/&gt;
[[File:Totuma con chicha.png|thumb|right|260px|''[[Chicha]]''; alcoholic drink from fermented maize, main ingredient of the festivities around '''Nencatacoa''']]
Nencatacoa was also the protector of artists and painters who realized their beautiful creations on the cloths, the [[Muisca economy#Ceramics|ceramics]], [[Muisca economy#Gold|gold metallurgy]], [[sculptures]] and [[petroglyph]]s with different [[anthropomorphic]], [[zoomorphic]] and [[ideogram]]atic figures.&lt;ref name=p58&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Nencatacoa was the god of festivities, drunkenness and dance. Traditions tell us that he partied with the people without caring about anything else. The Muisca drank ''[[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]'', a type of alcoholic drink based on the fermentation and cooking of maize. When the indigenous peoples were constructing their houses he helped them with lifting the heavy poles. Even during the construction of their houses (''bohíos'') and temples, the Muisca drank a lot of chicha.&lt;ref name=p58/&gt;

Also to celebrate the completion of temples, houses or roads and with the arrival of new ''[[cacique]]s'' the Muisca drank a lot of ''chicha''. At times of sowing and harvest, they celebrated with dancing, singing, music (with drums and flutes) and honoured the gods, in particular Nencatacoa.&lt;ref name=p60&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch. 9, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Nencatacoa thus appeared to be similar in style and association to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god [[Dionysus]] and the [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[Bacchus]]. [[List of Muisca scholars|Chronicler]] Pedro Simón described about the Muisca that when they were partying and dancing around the fire and the wind blew that was a sign that Nencatacoa was participating.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt;

'''Oakdale Workmen's Institute''' is a public building originally erected at [[Oakdale, Caerphilly]], Wales, in 1917 and now located at [[St Fagans National Museum of History]], [[Cardiff]].

The foundation stone of the Institute was laid on 3 July 1916, and it was officially opened on 10 September of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/stute/ National Museum of Wales – Laying foundations: Workmen's Institute]. Accessed 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Alfred S. Tallis, Managing Director of the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, which owned [[Oakdale Colliery]], represented them at the opening ceremony; the company had lent money to the local miners' organisations to enable them to build the "'Stute" as it became popularly known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/buildings/oakdale/ Historical Buildings – St Fagans: National History Museum – Oakdale Workmen's Institute]. Accessed 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative to found the Institute came from several local groups who met in the temporary workers' barracks that had been erected by the colliery owners. The new building soon became a focal point of the community, and included a library, billiards room and meeting hall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1f5dJDAwGbYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=oakdale+workmen's+institute&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K4dlboyUVm&amp;sig=PXwkYZIe3i9bHgkNdL0QKtDtRBU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ivpGUqW5OPCf7ga3vYHABQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=oakdale%20workmen's%20institute&amp;f=false ''Workmen's Halls and Institutes: Oakdale Workmen's Institute'' by Gerallt D.

The Institute was taken down in 1987, two years before the closure of Oakdale Colliery, and was relocated to St Fagans, where it was officially opened to the public in 1995 by [[Neil Kinnock]].

'''Outsourced document processing''' is a specialised area of [[business process outsourcing]] involving the [[outsourcing]] of [[document processing]], to a third-party [[service provider]] that is a specialist in that area. Document processing involves the conversion of typed and handwritten text on paper-based and electronic documents (e.g. scanned image of a document) into electronic information utilising one of, or a combination of, [[intelligent character recognition]] (ICR), [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and experienced [[data entry clerk]]s.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

[[Image:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 011.jpg|right|thumb|Tretyakov's portrait by [[Ilya Repin|Repin]] (1883).]]

'''Pavel Mikhaylovich Tretyakov''' ({{lang-ru|Па́вел Миха́йлович Третьяко́в}}; December 27, 1832 – December 16, 1898) was a [[Russia]]n businessman, patron of [[art]], collector, and [[philanthropist]] who gave his name to the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Tretyakov Drive]] in [[Moscow]]. His brother [[Sergei Tretyakov (arts patron)|Sergei Tretyakov]] was also a famous patron of art and a philanthropist.

==Childhood==

Tretyakov was taught at home. In the first half of 1850 he inherited his father's business and built up a profitable trade in [[flax]], [[linen]] processing and the sale of textiles.

Together with other Moscow businessmen he acted as the founder of the Moscow merchant bank (becoming one of its heads), the Moscow commercial and industrial company, some other large firms. He amassed a considerable fortune (4.4 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]]), consisting of real estate (5 houses in [[Moscow]]), securities, money and bills.

==Collecting art==

Tretyakov started to collect art in 1854 at the age of 22; his first purchase was 10 canvases by Old [[Netherlands|Dutch]] masters. He laid down for himself the aim of creating a Russian National Gallery. In his collection Tretyakov included the most valuable and remarkable products, first of all the contemporaries, from 1870 - mainly members of the society of circulating art exhibitions (''Tovarishchestvo peredvizhnyh hudozhestvennyh vystavok'' or [[Peredvizhniki]], Передвижники in Russian). He bought paintings at exhibitions and directly from artists' studios, sometimes he bought the whole series: in 1874 he acquired [[V.V. Vereschagin]]'s "Turkestan series" (13 pictures, 133 figures and 81 studies), in 1880 - his "Indian series" (78 studies). In his collection there were over 80 studies by [[Alexander Ivanov (painter)|Alexander Ivanov]]. In 1885 Tretyakov bought 102 studies by [[V.D. Polenov]] painted by the artist during journeys across [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He got also acquired [[Vasnetsov]]’s collection of the sketches made during work above lists in the [[Kiev]] [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]. Tretyakov had the fullest collection of such artists as: [[V.G. Perov]], [[I.N. Kramskoi]], [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[I.I. Levitan]], and [[Valentin Serov]]. Aspiring to show the beginnings and development of the domestic school of art , Tretyakov began to acquire pictures by masters of the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries and landmarks of Old Russian painting. He also conceived the creation of a "Russian [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]" - a portrait gallery of famous Russians. He commissioned especially for it portraits of figures of domestic culture from leading masters of this genre - [[Nikolai Ge|N.N. Ge]], Kramskoi, [[N.V. Nevrev]], Perov, Repin.

In 1870-80 Tretyakov also began to collect illustrations (471 by 1893), since 1890 he formed a collection of [[icon]]s. During his lifetime they were not included in an exhibition, being kept in the owner's study. He also collected [[sculpture]], however this part of his collection was small (9 sculptures by 1893).

At first the gallery was located in Tretyakov’s house in Lavrushenski pereulok. But as his collection expanded he decided to reconstruct his house for his collection. In 1870-1880 the house was repeatedly reconstructed by the architect [[Alexander Kaminsky|Kaminski]].

Tretyakov wanted to transfer the gallery to the city as discreetly as possible, without any noise; he didn’t want to be in the center of general attention and an object of gratitude. But it was not possible to do it and he was very dissatisfied.

From 1881 his gallery became popular (by 1885 it was visited by about 30 thousand people). In 1892 Tretyakov inherited a collection of Western European painting from his brother and placed it in two halls of the western school. The collection in Tretyakov’s gallery was equal in importance with the largest museums in Russia at that time, and became one of sights of [[Moscow]]. In August 1892 Tretyakov donated his collection and a private residence to Moscow. By then in the collection there were 1287 picturesque and 518 graphic products of Russian school, 75 pictures and 8 figures of the West-European school, 15 sculptures and collections of icons. [[Image:Tretyakovskaya gallery.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The [[Tretyakov Gallery]] with a statue of Tretyakov in front of it.]]

On August 15, 1893 the official opening of a museum under the name "Pavel and Sergey Tretyakov City art gallery" (nowadays [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) took place. By 1890 it was visited by up to 150 thousand people annually. Tretyakov continued to fill up his collection, for example, in 1894 he donated a gallery of 30 pictures, 12 figures and a marble statue “The Christian martyrs“ works by [[Mark Antokolski|M.M. Antokolski]]. He was engaged in studying the collection, and from 1893 issued its catalogue.

He took part in set of charitable certificates, all donations in the help to families of victims the soldier during the [[Crimean]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]. Tretyakov's grants were established in commercial schools - by Moscow and Alexandrovskoe. He never refused in the monetary help to artists and the other applicants, carefully cared of monetary business of painters who without fear entrusted to him their savings. Pavel Mikhailovich repeatedly lent money to the kind counselor and adviser I.N. Kramskoi, V.G. Khudyakov, K.A. Trutovski, M.K. Klodt and much helped disinterestedly to others.

Tretyakov's life and after his death.

In his will Tretyakov provided large sums for school of deaf-mutes. For pupils of school Tretyakov bought the big stone house with a garden. 150 boys and girls lived in this house. Here they were brought up to 16 year old and left receiving profession in this school. Tretyakov selected the best teachers, got acquainted with the methods of studying.

'''Personal Knowbase''' is a freeform notes database application for [[MS Windows]]. Personal Knowbase was first released in 1998 on the [[CompuServe Information Service]] and is an example of a [[personal knowledge base]].

Text articles are displayed in a flat, rather than tree-based, listing. Stored articles are retrieved using a scheme based on user-defined keywords. This type of keyword-based system was based on the keyword systems used by common research databases of the 1990s, such as [[ProQuest Dialog|Knowledge Index]] and CompuServe's file library, and is similar to the keywords Index for a MS Help file. In recent Internet usage, such keywords are now often referred to as metadata "tags". Articles are filtered using various criteria, including keywords, dates, and attachments.

A free read-only version of the program, called Personal Knowbase Reader, is available to allow for distribution of content in the Personal Knowbase format.

==Features==
*Boolean queries on keywords
*Hypertext links to external files and between articles

[[File:Picturesque America00a.jpg|thumb|Cover of Volume I of ''Picturesque America'']]
[[File:Picturesque America31.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Upper [[Yellowstone Falls]]&lt;br&gt;by [[Thomas Moran]]]]

'''''Picturesque America''''' was a two-volume set of books describing and illustrating the scenery of America, which grew out of an earlier series in ''[[Appleton's Journal]]''. It was published by [[D. Appleton and Company]] of New York in 1872 and 1874 and edited by the romantic poet and journalist [[William Cullen Bryant]] (1794-1878), who also edited the [[New York Evening Post]]. The layout and concept was similar to that of ''[[Picturesque Europe]]''. The work's essays, together with its nine hundred wood engravings and fifty steel engravings, are considered to have had a profound influence on the growth of tourism and the historic preservation movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liucedarswampcollection.org/template1/picturesque.html|title=LIU Cedar Swamp Historical Society Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
The preface described "the design of this publication to present full descriptions and elaborate pictorial delineations of the scenery characteristic of all the different parts of our country. The wealth of material for this purpose is almost boundless."

This two-volume set and others of the same genre, achieved great popularity in the nineteenth century. Their illustrations provided a tour of nineteenth century America, unspoilt and pastoral, its centres of commerce, ports, architecture and natural treasures. In a modern (2001) treatment of the work, Sue Rainey, who is a historian of American graphic arts and has a particular interest in the artists who drew landscapes and cityscapes for periodical and book illustrations,  wrote ''"As the first publication to celebrate the entire continental nation, it enabled Americans, after the trauma of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], to construct a national self-image based on reconciliation between North and South and incorporation of the West."'' (p. xiii) The volumes display both steel and wood engravings based on the paintings of some of the best American landscape painters of the nineteenth century, primarily [[Harry Fenn]] and his friend [[John Douglas Woodward (artist)|Douglas Woodward]], but also including [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[William Stanley Haseltine]], [[James David Smillie]], [[John William Casilear]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[A. C. Warren]], [[David Johnson (American artist)|David Johnson]], [[Granville Perkins]], [[Felix Octavius Carr Darley]], [[Albert Fitch Bellows]], [[James McDougal Hart]], [[Casimir Clayton Griswold]] (1834-1918), [[Worthington Whittredge]], [[Charles G. Rosenberg]] (1818 - 1879), [[William Ludwell Sheppard]] (1833-1912), [[Homer Dodge Martin]], [[Alfred Rudolph Waud]], [[William Hart (painter)|William Hart]], [[Robert Swain Gifford]], [[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]], [[William Hamilton Gibson]], and [[Thomas Cole]].

Engravers included [[Robert Hinshelwood]] (1812-1885), [[Edward Paxman Brandard]] (1819-1898), [[Samuel Valentine Hunt]] (1803-1893), [[William Wellstood]] (1819-1900), [[William Chapin]] (1802-1888), [[Henry Bryan Hall]] (1808-1884).
Robert Hinshelwood was born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1812 and emigrated to America in 1835 where he became renowned for his landscapes, etchings and engravings. His meticulous attention to detail was appreciated by publishing houses such as [[D. Appleton and Company|Appleton’s]] and [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]], and also by the [[Continental Bank Note Company]] who employed him to produce plates for the printing of currency. He died in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panteek.com/PicturesqueAmerica/index.htm|title=Antique prints from Picturesque America 1872|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the publication frequently appears in antiquarian book collections; sometimes in pristine collection, but more frequently in poor condition.  Lower-quality examples are frequently disassembled, their engravings removed and sold separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historical.ha.com/itm/books/non-fiction/appleton-s-picturesque-america-or-the-land-we-live-in-a-delineation-by-pen-and-pencil-of-the-mountains-rivers-lake-total-2-/a/635-25244.s|title=Appleton's Picturesque America Or, The Land We Live In. - Lot #25244|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Six Characters in Search of an Author''''' ({{lang-it|Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore}} {{IPA-it|ˈsɛi persoˈnaddʒi in ˈtʃerka dauˈtoːre|}}) is an Italian play by [[Luigi Pirandello]], written and first performed in 1921. An [[absurdist fiction|absurdist]] [[metatheatrical]] play about the relationship among authors, their characters, and theatre practitioners, it premiered at the [[Teatro Valle]] in [[Rome]] to a mixed reception, with shouts from the audience of "''Manicomio''!" ("Madhouse!") and "''Incommensurabile''!" ("Incommensurable!"), a reaction to the play's illogical progression. Reception improved at subsequent performances, especially after Pirandello provided for the play's third edition, published in 1925, a [[foreword]] clarifying its structure and ideas.

The play had its American premiere in 1922 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] and was performed for over a year [[off-Broadway]] at the Martinique Theatre beginning in 1963.

==Plot summary==
An acting company prepares to rehearse the play ''[[The Rules of the Game (play)|The Rules of the Game]]'' by Luigi Pirandello. As the rehearsal is about to begin, they are unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of six strange people. The Director of the play, furious at the interruption, demands an explanation. The Father explains that they are unfinished characters in search of an author to finish their story. The Director initially believes them to be mad, but as they begin to argue among themselves and reveal details of their story, he begins to listen. The Father and The Mother had one child together (The Son), but they have separated and Mother has had three children by another man - The Stepdaughter, The Boy and The Child (a girl). The Father attempted to buy sex from The Stepdaughter, claiming he did not recognize her after so many years, but The Stepdaughter is convinced he knew who she was the entire time. The Mother walked in on The Father and The Stepdaughter shortly after The Father's proposal and informs The Stepdaughter that he is her ex-husband; they both express their disgust and outrage. While The Director is not an author, he agrees to load it their story despite disbelief among the jeering actors.

After a 20-minute break, The Characters and The Company return to the stage to perform some of the story so far. They begin to perform the scene between The Stepdaughter and The Father in Madame Pace's shop, which the Director decides to call Scene I. The Characters are very particular about the setting, wanting everything to be as realistic as possible. The Director asks The Actors to observe the scene because he intends for them to perform it later. This sparks the first argument between The Director and The Characters over the acting of the play because The Characters had assumed that they would be performing it, seeing as they are The Characters already. The Director continues the play, but The Stepdaughter has more problems with the accuracy of the setting, saying she doesn't recognize the scene. Just as The Director is about to begin the scene once more, he realizes that Madame Pace is not with them. The Actors watch in disbelief as The Father lures her to the stage by hanging their coats and hats on racks, and Madame Pace follows, "attracted by the very articles of her trade".

The scene begins between Madame Pace and The Stepdaughter, with Madame Pace exhorting The Stepdaughter, telling her she must work as a prostitute to save The Mother's job. The Mother protests at having to watch the scene, but she is restrained. After The Father and The Stepdaughter act half of the scene, The Director stops them so that The Actors may perform what they have just done. The Characters break into laughter as The Actors try to imitate them. The Actors continue but The Stepdaughter cannot contain her laughter as The Actors use the wrong tones of voice and gestures. The Father begins another argument with The Director over the realism of The Actors compared to The Characters themselves. The Director allows The Characters to perform the rest of the scene and decides to have the rehearsals later.

This time, The Stepdaughter explains the rest of the scene during an argument with The Director over the truth on stage. The scene culminates in an embrace between The Father and The Stepdaughter, which is realistically interrupted by the distressed Mother. The line between reality and acting is blurred as the scene closes with The Director pleased with the first act.

The final act of the play begins in the garden. It is revealed that there was much arguing among the family members as The Father sent for The Mother, The Stepdaughter, The Child, The Boy, and The Son to come back and stay with him. The Son reveals that he hates the family for sending him away and does not consider The Stepdaughter or the others a part of his family. The scene ends with The Child drowning in a fountain, The Boy committing suicide with a revolver, and The Stepdaughter running out of the theater, leaving The Son, The Mother, and The Father on stage. The play ends with The Director confused over whether it was real or not, concluding that in either case he lost a whole day over it.

==Productions==

===Première===
The play was staged in 1921 by the ''Compagnia di Dario Niccodemi'' at the Valle theatre in Rome to mixed results. The public split into supporters and adversaries. The author, who was present at the presentation with his daughter Lietta, was forced to leave the theatre through a side exit in order to avoid the crowd of opponents. However, the play was a great success when presented in [[Milan]].

{{for|the wooden palace of Empress Elisabeth|Summer Palace (Rastrelli){{!}}Summer Palace}}

[[File:Вид на Летний сад с Прачечного моста.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The palace as seen from across the [[Fontanka River]] in August 2007.]]

The '''Summer Palace of Peter the Great''' was built between 1710–1714 in the northeast corner of the [[Summer Garden]] that sat on an island formed by the [[Fontanka River|Fontanka river]], [[Moyka River|Moyka river]], the Swan Canal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/rivers-and-canals/lebyazha-kanavka/|title=Swan Canal in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg|author=|date=|work=saint-petersburg.com|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[Winter Canal]]) and has the railings of its northern perimeter running along the left bank of the [[Neva River|Neva river]] across from the [[Cabin of Peter the Great]]  and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and was the first palace built in [[Saint Petersburg]], the second largest city in [[Russia]].

== Construction ==
The Summer Palace was first planned in 1710 by [[Peter the Great]] and built by the Swiss Italian architect [[Domenico Trezzini]], who elaborated the [[Petrine Baroque]] style of [[Russian architecture]], as a two-storied stone building with four-sloped roofing.

Compared with other European palaces of the time, the Summer Palace was a very modest building reminiscent of the style of houses for [[Dutch Burghers]] from the same period and during its construction was decorated with a frieze of 29 bas-reliefs by the German baroque sculptor and architect [[Andreas Schlüter]] that depicting scenes from ancient myths and victorious Russian battles in the [[Great Northern War]] and was the first palace built in Saint Petersburg and, also, was the first building in the city to have piped water.

Each of the Summer Palace’s two floors were built having seven rooms with a similar plan and were decorated by Russian architect [[Mikhail Zemtsov]], German baroque sculptor and architect [[Andreas Schlüter]] and Italian architect [[Nicola Michetti]] with most of the rooms having walls of red and green and oak panels and an innovative [[central heating]] system that featured solid fuel burning boilers with elaborate blue and white porcelain ductwork.

Of the rooms to be noted are: the reception room; the assembly room (grand hall); the jail where Peter personally prosecuted, locked up, and released prisoners; and Peter’s favorite room, his workshop.

The construction of the Summer Palace was completed in 1714.&lt;ref name="spalace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nevsky-prospekt.com/summer.html|title=The Summer Garden &amp; Palace of Peter I Nevsky Prospekt |last= |first= |publisher=Nevsky Prospekt |date= |website=nevsky-prospekt.com |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/summer-palace-of-peter-the-great// |title=Summer Palace of Peter the Great |last= |first= |publisher=Saint-Petersburg|date=2016 |website=saint-petersburg.com |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804004813?lc=en |title=Summer Palace of Peter the Great |last= |first= |publisher=Saint-Petersburg Encyclopedia|date=2016 |website=encspb.ru |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residence of Peter the Great ==
When the Summer Palace was completed in 1714, it became the residence of Peter the Great and his second wife [[Catherine I of Russia]] and many of their 12 children—with Peter occupying the first floor and Catherine, along with the children, occupying the second one, until Peter’s death in 1725.&lt;ref name="spalace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace2" /&gt;

=== Residence for Russian imperial family ===
After Peter the Great’s death, the Summer Palace was occupied for several years by members of the Imperial family and their courtiers.&lt;ref name="spalace2" /&gt;

=== 19th-century use ===
During part of the 1762–1796 reign of [[Catherine the Great]], the interior of the Summer Palace was altered for its use by court officials who used it during the summer months, in 1826, the Italian architect [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] turned it into the Coffee House, but by the end of the 19th century it had become vacant.&lt;ref name="spalace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace2" /&gt;

== Museum ==
Being used only to hold some exhibitions during the early 20th century, in 1934 the Summer Palace was turned into a museum featuring the daily life of Peter the Great with the original oak staircase surviving as well as the upper and lower kitchens along with Catherine's apartments on the upper floor that include the Green Drawing Room.&lt;ref name="spalace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spalace2" /&gt;

== World War II ==
During [[World War II]], heavy damage was inflicted on both the Summer Palace and Summer Gardens from bombing raid by [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi troops]].&lt;ref name="spalace" /&gt;

== 1960s reconstruction ==
In the early 1960s, a total reconstruction of the Summer Palace was started restoring its interiors, the carved oak panels in the lower lobby with images of Minerva, the unique Dutch tiles for its heating system and the fireplaces with stucco decorations.&lt;ref name="spalace2" /&gt;

== Present day ==
The current Summer Palace of Peter the Great Museum allows its visitors to have an opportunity to see Russian imperial court life as it was 300 years ago with opening hours from June to October daily starting at 10:00 (10 a.m.) and lasting to 18:00 (6  p.m.).&lt;ref name="spalace1" /&gt;

'''''Tenebrae''''' ({{literal translation|"darkness"}}, also known as '''''Tenebre''''') is a 1982 Italian ''[[giallo]]'' film written and directed by [[Dario Argento]]. The film stars [[Anthony Franciosa]] as American author Peter Neal, who – while in [[Rome]] promoting his latest murder-mystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by his novel. [[John Saxon]] and [[Daria Nicolodi]] co-star as Neal's agent and assistant, while [[Giuliano Gemma]] and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders. [[John Steiner]], [[Veronica Lario]] and [[Mirella D'Angelo]] also feature in minor roles. The film has been described as exploring themes of [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] and sexual aberration, and has strong [[metafiction]]al elements; some commentators consider ''Tenebrae'' to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work, most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women.

After Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977's ''[[Suspiria]]'' and 1980's ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'', ''Tenebrae'' represented the filmmaker's return to the ''giallo'' horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of ''Tenebrae''. The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted "to kill for nothing".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;

Shot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios, ''Tenebrae'' utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography [[Luciano Tovoli]], Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] provided ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.

''Tenebrae'' was a modest success in Italy; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes. However, in the United Kingdom, it was added to the infamous list of "[[video nasty|video nasties]]" and banned from sale until 1999. The film's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984, when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title '''''Unsane'''''. In its cut form, ''Tenebrae'' received a mostly negative critical reception, but the original, fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal; it is considered by some to be one of Argento's best thrillers. The film critic and author [[Maitland McDonagh]] has said that it is "in many respects&amp;nbsp;... the finest film that Argento has ever made".{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=157}}

Peter Neal, an [[United States|American]] writer of violent horror novels, visits Italy to promote his latest work, ''Tenebrae''. He is joined in [[Rome]] by his assistant Anne, and his literary agent Bullmer. Unbeknownst to Neal, his embittered fiancée Jane has vandalized his suitcase in [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] and followed him to Rome. Hours before Neal's arrival, young shoplifter Elsa is killed with a razor by an unseen assailant. Detective Giermani and Inspector Altieri question Neal because Elsa's mouth had been stuffed with pages of ''Tenebrae''. Neal receives an anonymous letter, deemed by Giermani a prelude to an impending killing spree. 

The film is punctuated hereafter by visions tormenting an unseen man. Implied to be flashbacks, they showcase a young woman flirting with several male youths in a beach. One of them slaps her and is then chased and held down by the others while she kicks and orally [[rapes]] him with red [[High-heeled shoe|high-heeled shoes]]. Later, unequivocally [[Point-of-view shot|POV shot]] flashbacks show him stabbing her to death in revenge. 

More killings and letters ensue in the present, confirming Giermani's prediction. Lesbian journalist and Neal acquaintance Tilde is murdered at her home, along with her lover Marion. Maria, the daughter of Neal's landlord, is axed to death after stumbling into the killer's lair. TV book reviewer Christiano Berti shows an intense fixation on Neal's work, as well as a bigoted prudishness much like that of the killer's letters. Following this hunch, and the fact that Maria's body was found in [[EUR, Rome|Berti's district]], Neal and his assistant Gianni spy on Berti, who is burning pictures and files identifying him as the killer. Gianni sees Berti telling someone "I killed them all!" and having his head split by an axe, but is unable to see the murderer. He finds Neal knocked unconscious on the lawn and they flee the scene. 

Neal has sex with Anne that night, a first in their six-year acquaintance. After Neal leaves Bullmer's office the next morning, his fiancée Jane comes out of an adjacent room and is revealed to be Bullmer's lover. Giermani calls Neal to the Berti crime scene after finding dossiers proving Berti's obsession with him, but is unaware of the burnt evidence. He thus believes the killer is still at large, and is comforted by Neal's intention to leave Rome. Jane receives a gift of red shoes like those prevalent in the seaside flashbacks. Bullmer is stabbed to death in a public square while waiting for Jane, who witnesses the aftermath and flees. Neal's plane leaves for Paris that evening. 

Meanwhile, Gianni is haunted by the significance of what he witnessed in Berti's house. He returns there and realizes that Berti's self-incriminating last words imply ''two'' murderers. Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone, he is garrotted to death in his car. A distraught Jane calls Anne to her place, and waits in her kitchen holding a pistol. An axe shatters the window and hacks off her forearm. Blood sprays over the walls and Jane falls to the floor, where several blows finish her off. Inspector Altieri enters and is also killed, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards. Held at gunpoint by Giermani, Neal tacitly confesses to killing Berti and everyone after him, then slits his throat. 

Giermani reports the incident from the car radio and comforts Anne. A final explanation takes form. The teenage murder flashbacks were Neal's. Berti's sadistic murder spree had unlocked a repressed memory in Neal, namely his murder of the girl who had humiliated him as a youth in [[Rhode Island]]. The memory inflamed Neal's previously suppressed bloodlust, driving him insane. It also fueled his plan to eliminate Jane and Bullmer, whose affair he knew of, by maintaining a semblance that the original killer had murdered Berti and was still active. Whether Berti destroyed his murder files at Neal's secret behest, or spontaneously, is left to speculation.

Giermani returns inside and is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits for Anne to return; when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.

==Analysis==

===Influences===
According to the film historian and critic [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]], ''Tenebrae'' is a typical example of the ''giallo'' film genre: "visually extremely stylish, with imaginative, sometimes stunning cinematography", it presents "mysterious, gruesome murders, often in picturesque locations; at the end, the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to terrify and surprise."&lt;ref name="avr"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/tenebrae.html|title=Tenebrae DVD Review|date=11 November 2005|accessdate=22 April 2006|first=Bill|last=Warren|publisher=Audio Video Revolution|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111054714/http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/tenebrae.html|archivedate=11 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narrative and visual strategies had been introduced years before Argento made his first thriller, 1970's ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]''&amp;mdash;most critics point to [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[La ragazza che sapeva troppo|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963) as the original ''giallo''.{{sfn|Olney|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Schneider|2003|p=136}}

By the time Argento made ''Tenebrae'', he had become the acknowledged master of the genre, to the point where he felt confident enough to be openly self-referential to his own past, referencing the "reckless driving humor" from ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1971) and the hero from ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage''.&lt;ref name="Lucas2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Tim|title=Review of ''Tenebrae'' Laserdisc|journal=[[Video Watchdog]]|date=January 1999|issue=49|pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which [[Veronica Lario]]'s character, Jane, returns home directly references ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'' with its large sculpture in the entrance hallway.&lt;ref name="c9"/&gt;

Warren and Alan Jones cite a scene where a character is killed in a public square as evoking the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]];&lt;ref name="c9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avr"/&gt; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]].&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt; The film critic and author [[Maitland McDonagh]] argues that Argento's influences for ''Tenebrae'' were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film as an example of "the most paranoid excesses of ''[[film noir]]''." McDonagh suggests that [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1956) ("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence&amp;nbsp;... is in fact guilty of the murder") and [[Roy William Neill]]'s ''[[Black Angel]]'' (1946) ("in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer") both use such a similar plot twist to ''Tenebrae'' that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=164}}

Kim Newman and Alan Jones suggest that the mysteries of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Rex Stout]] and [[Agatha Christie]] were all obvious influences on ''Tenebrae'', and there are many references to these authors throughout the film.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; One example is the use of a quote from [[Sherlock Holmes]] in Conan Doyle's novel ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]'' (1890): "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" A variation of this quote is delivered many times in ''Tenebrae''. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]], the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1901–1902).&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in that film.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;

===Themes===
Critics have identified various major [[Theme (literature)|themes]] in ''Tenebrae''. In interviews conducted during the film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in ''Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'', "...&amp;nbsp;Argento has never been more articulate and/or analytical than he was on the subject of ''Tenebrae''."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=162}} Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters "lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored".{{sfn|Hope|2005|p=119}} According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with ''Tenebrae'' Argento "explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, voyeurism, audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death."&lt;ref name="quiet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/10531-tenebrae-dario-argento-30-years-on|last=Gracey|first=James|date=31 October 2012|title=30 Years On: ''Tenebrae'' Revisited|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water.&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt; Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.&lt;ref name="r12"/&gt;

===Dark doubles===
[[File:Giermani to Neal.ogv|thumb|275px|alt=Head-on to the camera, Detective Giermani stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor. Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, previously unseen with their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot|The reveal of Peter Neal standing behind Detective Giermani emphasizes Argento's theme of "dark doubles", with the film constantly doubling or mirroring objects, locations, events and characters.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; This scene is one of many that sets up a character with his or her doppelgänger, on both a visual and narrative level.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt; The moment is also one of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s most stylistically influential; the reveal of a killer – previously silhouetted by another – has been copied and referenced in many subsequent thrillers,&lt;ref name="c11"/&gt; including [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Raising Cain]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="brian"/&gt;]]
According to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, ''Tenebrae'' is filled with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's exploration of "the dual nature of [the] two active murderers" using doubles, inversions, reflections and "re-reflections". Every major character has at least one double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions and events – major and minor.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths, aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves.&lt;ref name="r10"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri.&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt; McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: "Giermani&amp;nbsp;... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator&amp;nbsp;... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away." McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani "go away", virtually replacing him on screen "in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=181}} Earlier, Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience's surprise – was not Anne, but Altieri.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; ''Tenebrae'' itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with "lingering sexualized aggressiveness", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift and to the point.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt;

Kevin Lyon observes, "The plot revolves around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eofftv.com/review/t/tenebre_review.htm |title=Tenebre Review |date=11 September 2003 |accessdate=22 April 2006 |first=Kevin |last=Lyons |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film and Television |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020060441/http://www.eofftv.com/review/t/tenebre_review.htm |archivedate=20 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While noting that the device is "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely "warped" individuals. She suggests that "Neal and Berti&amp;nbsp;... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=180}} Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, "It was like a book&amp;nbsp;... a book!"{{Sfn|Gracey|2010|p=81}}

===Metafiction===
The moment in which the first half of the movie transitions into the second is punctuated by the rising score and [[camera pan]] to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins.&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt; Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, "clichéd and remote" ''giallo''. Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with "weight and meaning". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: "art that kills people".&lt;ref name="c9"/&gt; Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.&lt;ref name="r12"/&gt;

According to Gracey, a number of critics have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director.{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} Gracey refers to ''Tenebrae'' as a "reflexive commentary on [the director's] earlier work."{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=81}} The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that "[he] was a misogynist&amp;nbsp;... a criminal&amp;nbsp;... a murderer." Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into ''Tenebrae''.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; A scene in which a woman criticizes the lead character's books as "sexist", featuring "women as victims, cipers, male heroes [and] macho bullshit" echoes criticisms of Argento's own work.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene "essentially autobiographical",&lt;ref name="c3"/&gt; and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to "let it speak". With ''Tenebrae'' in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception.&lt;ref name="r6"/&gt; Newman agrees that Argento used ''Tenebrae'' to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as "sick and twisted" as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, "What if I were?"&lt;ref name="c9"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Aberrant" sexuality===
As in many of Argento's films, which tend to eroticize the murder of beautiful women,{{Sfn|Armstrong|Charity|Hughes|Winter|2007|page=25}} gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film.{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=254}} The fictional novel within the film is described as being "about human perversion and its effects on society".{{sfn|Gallant|2000|p=184}} Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as "filthy, slimy perverts".&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt; The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion.{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=170}} His "moral crusade" is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth."&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt; McDonagh also notes that ''Tenebrae'' expands on the themes of sexuality and [[transvestitism]] found in Argento's earlier films, ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'', ''The Cat o' Nine Tails'', ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1972), and ''[[Deep Red]]'' (1975), but believes that ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other ''gialli''."  She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that "''Tenebrae'' is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature."{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=170}} Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's "preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=82}}

McDonagh noted that two sexually charged flashbacks are key to understanding ''Tenebrae''. These distinct but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the film, usually immediately following a murder sequence. Although the flashbacks are never fully explained, the first reveals a beautiful young woman's sexual humiliation (though oral rape) of a teenage boy, presumed to be Peter Neal. The young woman is mostly topless during this first sequence, and she humiliates the young man by jamming the heel of one of her shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held down by a group of gleeful boys on a pale-white beach. The second flashback shows the vicious revenge-murder of the woman some time later. McDonagh notes that all of the [[Fetishism|fetishistic]] imagery of these flashbacks, combined with the sadistic details of the murder sequences in the main narrative, "set the parameters of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s fetishistic and fetishicized&lt;!-- sic? --&gt; visual vocabulary, couched in terms both ritualistic and orgiastically out of control&amp;nbsp;... Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and ''Tenebrae'' revels in them, inviting the spectator to join in; in fact, it dares the viewer not to do so."{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=173}}

===Vision impairment===
The protagonists in Argento's ''giallo'' films almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contamination.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/articles/tenebrae.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526111931/http://www.contamination.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/articles/tenebrae.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-26|date=Winter 1999–2000|title="Aberrant" Sexuality in Tenebrae|accessdate=22 April 2006|first=Paul|last=Flanagan|publisher=Contamination Horror Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is these characters' chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust.  Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno ([[Karl Malden]]) in ''The Cat o' Nine Tails'', who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his niece to solve a mystery.  In ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'', Sam Dalmas ([[Tony Musante]]) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not "miss" anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In ''Deep Red'', Marcus ([[David Hemmings]]) has a similar problem in both seeing and ''not'' seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to [[Douglas E. Winter]], creates "a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing".{{sfn|Golden|1992|pp=268–288}}

Flanagan observes that in ''Tenebrae'', Argento offers two characters who suffer from impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning to the scene of the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of [[Agatha Christie]], [[Mickey Spillane]], [[Rex Stout]], and [[Ed McBain]], but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

===An imaginary city===
In an interview that appeared in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Argento noted that the film was intended as near-[[science fiction]], taking place "about five or more years in the future&amp;nbsp;... ''Tenebrae'' occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember&amp;nbsp;... It isn't exactly my ''[[Blade Runner]]'', of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent."&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Alan|title=Argento |journal=[[Cinefantastique]] |date=August–September 1983|volume=13|issue=6|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] blast.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept "isn't apparent at all" and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film.{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=162}} The film critic and author [[Kim Newman]] countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen.&lt;ref name="c1"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes,&lt;ref name="c5"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Newman cites the on-screen use a [[videophone]] as an attempt by Argento to place ''Tenebrae'' in the near future.&lt;ref name="c8"/&gt;

While rejecting this thematic concern as unrealized by Argento, McDonagh noted that the result of the director's experiment is a strange "architectural landscape" that becomes the "key element in differentiating ''Tenebrae'' from Argento's earlier ''gialli''." Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual "hyper-realism" results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, "...&amp;nbsp;I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged [[Bauhaus]] apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=166}} The [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district of Rome, where much of ''Tenebrae'' was filmed, was built in preparation for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 World's Fair]], and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy [[Benito Mussolini]] to be a celebration of twenty years of [[fascism]]. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt;

==Production==

===Background===
[[File:Dario Argento 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A white male in his early 70s, grey hair receding, wearing a black jacket.|Director [[Dario Argento]] in 2014]]
After completing ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980), the second in his planned ''[[The Three Mothers|Three Mothers]]'' trilogy of supernatural horror films, Argento was expected to move straight into production of its concluding chapter. The first in the trilogy, ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977), had turned the director into what Alan Jones called "a horror superstar", but ''Inferno'' had proven a difficult follow-up. Argento had become unwell while writing the film, and his ill health continued into filming. In addition, Argento's relationship with ''Inferno''{{'}}s co-producer [[20th Century Fox]] had soured the director on "Hollywood politics", so when ''Inferno'' was not well-received upon release, Argento put the ''Three Mothers'' trilogy on hold.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dario Argento's ''Tenebrae'' (DVD booklet)|last=Jones|first=Alan|publisher=[[Arrow Films]]|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inferno'' also flopped commercially.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; According to James Gracey, Argento – under pressure and feeling "the need to once again defy expectations" – returned to the ''giallo'' genre and began work on ''Tenebrae''.{{sfn|Gracey|2010|pp=77–78}} Argento later stated that he wanted to "put on film a gory roller-coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders" and that he "shouldn't resist what [his] hardcore audience wanted".&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last ''giallo'' so many other directors had made films derivative of – and inferior to – his own genre-defining works.&lt;ref name="unsane" /&gt;

Argento said that ''Tenebrae'' was directly influenced by two distressing incidents that occurred 1980.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; On a break from filmmaking after ''Suspiria''{{'}}s surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly,{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} to talk about ''Suspiria''{{'}}s influence on him.&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt; According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing.&lt;ref name="unsane"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Waddell, Calum (Director) | date=2011 | title=The Unsane World of ''Tenebrae'': An Interview with Dario Argento | medium=Documentary | publisher=Arrow Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan claimed that he wanted "to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director's work had affected him",{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} and that because the director had "ruined his life", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying,{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=157}} and felt unable to write. At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were "symptomatic of that city of broken dreams" with its "celebrity stalkers and senseless crime". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at [[The Beverly Hilton]], where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: "To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today&amp;nbsp;... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in ''Tenebrae''."&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;

===Casting===
Argento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to [[Christopher Walken]], but eventually it went to [[Anthony Franciosa]].&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; According to Jones and [[Daria Nicolodi]], the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scream"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Waddell, Calum (Director) | date=2011 | title=Screaming Queen! Daria Nicolodi Remembers ''Tenebrae'' | medium=Documentary | publisher=Arrow Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of ''Suspiria''. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in ''Tenebrae''.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrow&amp;mdash;which ultimately went to [[Veronica Lario]].&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; Conversely, Thomas Rostock states that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress [[Eva Robin's]] was later hired to play the woman on the beach.&lt;ref name="r8"/&gt;

When the American actress who had been hired to play Anne dropped out just before the start of principal photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role.&lt;ref name="r8"/&gt; Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, who she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim.&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities.&lt;ref name="c3"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make sure their shared scenes "were an ordeal to endure".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, "leave my woman alone!"&lt;ref name="c6"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; She had been directed to scream only a little, but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise.&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; Nicolodi said the scene was her "cathartic release from the whole nightmare".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;

Although ''Tenebrae'' was an Italian production, most of the cast spoke their dialogue in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices.&lt;ref name="maniac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/Q-T/tenebrae.html|title=Tenebrae|last=Howarth|first=Troy|date=4 December 2002|accessdate=22 April 2006|publisher=DVD Maniacs|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060430094628/http://www.dvdmaniacs.net/Reviews/Q-T/tenebrae.html |archivedate = 30 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by [[Theresa Russell]], Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], and most of the female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta.&lt;ref name="c3"/&gt; [[Michele Soavi]] – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on ''Tenebrae'' and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene.&lt;ref name="c8"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Argento's collaborators, [[Fulvio Mingozzi]] cameoed as a hotel porter.&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own.&lt;ref name="c2"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, ''Tenebrae''.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Dune di Capocotta 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Sand dunes at a beach, surrounded by rough scrub|The first flashback scene was filmed at Capocotta beach, south of Rome.]]
Filming began on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; shot mostly on location in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of ''Tenebrae'' as unlike the one usually shown on television and in films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilized so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, "Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern."&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; Most of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s location shooting was carried out in Rome's [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] business and residential district.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first flashback scene was filmed at the [[Capocotta|Capocotta beach]], south of the city near [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]].&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoplifting scene near the beginning of ''Tenebrae'' was filmed on location at department store [[La Rinascente]], off Piazza Fiume.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called "''Le Terrazze''" in Rome's [[Casal Palocco]] residential neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="r9"/&gt; The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti,&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt; switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer.&lt;ref name="c7"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene at the beginning of the film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cinema Italiano: The Complete Guide from Classics to Cult|last=Hughes|first=Howard|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|date=2011|isbn=978-0-85773-044-2|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuseppe Bassan – a frequent Argento collaborator – was the film's production designer.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; The surroundings are given a bleached, "merciless" look, made from marble and stone façades, shiny metallic sculptures, with steel, water and glass surfaces. Some of the homes – specifically those of the lesbian couple and the first killer – are "cold, austere, brutalist" slabs of granite,&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds, with characters' wearing pale-coloured clothes against them – better, Newman felt, to contrast the blood once the violence started.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; The studio-set scenes were filmed at [[Elios Studios]] in Rome, unlike Argento's previous films in the city, which he had filmed at Incir De Paolis.&lt;ref name="c12"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not able to use Elios, as the director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], of whom he was a huge fan, was using the studio to film ''[[Identification of a Woman]]'' (1982) at the time.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and creation of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s special effects were supervised by Giovanni Corridori, who – with his brother Tonino – had a near-monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time.&lt;ref name="c8"/&gt; The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times. Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had,&lt;ref name="c10"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the "wound" across the white wall,&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; so the director had Corridori place an [[squib (explosive)|explosive squib]] in the prosthetic arm – a solution which apparently satisfied Argento.&lt;ref name="c10"/&gt;

Much of ''Tenebrae'' takes place during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings.{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=167}} The lighting and camerawork used in [[Andrzej Żuławski]]'s ''[[Possession (1981 film)|Possession]]'' (1981) was an influence on the film's look.{{sfn|Marriott|2012|p=385}} Although ''tenebr(a)e'' means "darkness" or "shadows" in [[Latin language|Latin]], Argento ordered cinematographer [[Luciano Tovoli]] to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a "cold, stark and semi-futuristic look".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=79}} Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the "realistic manner of lighting" used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting "a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of [[German Expressionism]]. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes&amp;nbsp;... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=167}} Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt; Tovoli used [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] 5247 film stock (125 [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled [[Exposure (photography)|overexposure]] of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be "crystal clear", and the night scenes to be awash with light.&lt;ref name="r6"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film scholar [[Richard Dyer]] highlights several intelligent devices used by Argento in the editing of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by "shots of pills and the sound of running water."{{sfn|Bayman|2011|p=151}} Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts in the latter part of the film are among cinema's "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism.{{Sfn|Hantke|2004|p=73}} Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of ''Tenebrae'' make it as much an example of [[art cinema]] as anything else.{{sfn|Hope|2005|p=119}} The initial murders are shot in a "clipped montage style",&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt; which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.&lt;ref name="r12"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crane shot====
{{Quote box|quote="The crane shot&amp;nbsp;... should be one of the most memorable moments in cinema&amp;nbsp;... The shot begins outside the lower apartment window, moves up to the second floor window, up and over the roof of the building, down the other side and to a window on the opposite side of the building. The shot lasts two and a half minutes without a pause, jerk or cut. If I was to be stuck on a desert island, I'd want ''Tenebrae'' just so I could watch this single shot&amp;nbsp;.. The shot stands out even more with the fact that the Luma [sic] camera used was new to the industry at the time, and was bulky and not as easy to use as it is now."|align=right|width=30em|style=padding:8px|source=—Patrick McAllister, 2004&lt;ref name="ironwolfe"/&gt;}} Gracey refers to the film's cinematography as "nothing short of astounding", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's "passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=79}} Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer,&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; one of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s main setpieces is the murder of the lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a [[Crane shot|Louma crane]] to film a several minutes-long [[tracking shot]]. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD|author=Argento, Dario|title=Tenebrae DVD Audio Commentary|publisher= Anchor Bay Entertainment|year=1999|ASIN=B00000IBRJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more.&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot.&lt;ref name="ironwolfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifilm.org/reviews2/tenebre.html|title=Reviews, TENEBRE (1982)|last=McAllister|first=Patrick|date=28 October 2004|accessdate=22 April 2006|publisher=Scifilm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130000841/http://www.scifilm.org/reviews2/tenebre.html |archivedate = 30 November 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France.{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=79}} According to Gracey, the camera performs "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=79}} Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, at the time it was "truly ground-breaking" in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint.&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt; Patrick McAllister of ''Scifilm'' said the sequence should be considered "one of the most memorable moments in cinema". According to McAllister, ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was "meaningless".&lt;ref name="ironwolfe"/&gt; Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it "meaninglessly brilliant".&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt;

===Title===
Some European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby card sets, advertised the film as ''Tenebre'', and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title.&lt;ref name="Felix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33592/tenebre/|title=Tenebrae|last=Felix |first=Justin|date=27 May 2008|accessdate = 26 April 2011|publisher=DVD Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, the title is clearly ''Tenebrae''. In addition, the title of Neal's latest book in the film is shown in closeup as being ''Tenebrae''. In a lengthy interview with Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of ''[[Fangoria]]'' in 1983 and 1984, the title was always referred to as "Tenebrae".&lt;ref name="Coxhead1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coxhead |first=Martin |journal=[[Fangoria]] |issue=33 |date=February 1983 |title=Europe's Master of Horror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coxhead2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coxhead |first=Martin |journal=Fangoria |issue=34 |date=March 1984 |title=The Italian Hitchcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in production, the film was referred to as ''Under the Eyes of the Assassin'', which was later used as one of the poster taglines. In Japan, the film was released as ''Shadows'',&lt;ref name="c5"/&gt; and in the United States it was titled ''Unsane'' in its initial – heavily edited – incarnation.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=161}}

==Soundtrack==
{{Main article|Tenebrae (soundtrack)}}
[[File:TenebraeCD.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A figure with dark hair and wearing a white shirt prone in a pool of blood. Above, "TENEBRE".|''Tenebrae'' CD cover]]
The Italian rock band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] had provided the scores for two of Argento's previous films, ''Deep Red'' (1975) and ''Suspiria'' (1977),{{Sfn|Spencer|2008|p=278}} but the director had employed English composer [[Keith Emerson]] for his foray outside of the ''giallo'' subgenre, 1980's ''Inferno''. Goblin had disbanded that year, but in 1982 Argento asked three of the band's former members – [[Claudio Simonetti]], [[Fabio Pignatelli]] and [[Massimo Morante]] – to work on ''Tenebrae''.&lt;ref name="Lucas3"/&gt; Owing to their history together, Simonetti felt it appropriate that Argento's return to ''giallo'' films should utilize the core members of Goblin.&lt;ref name="goblin"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Waddell, Calum (Director) | date=2011 | title=A Composition for Carnage: Claudio Simonetti on ''Tenebrae'' | medium=Documentary | publisher=Arrow Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Synthesizer|synth]]-driven score was credited to "Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante",{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=629}} as Goblin's former drummer owned the rights to use the band's name.&lt;ref name="goblin"/&gt;

''Tenebrae''{{'}}s score is very different to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for ''Tenebrae''. Simonetti described the score as an [[electronica]]/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So it would not be difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes.&lt;ref name="goblin"/&gt; Recording the score, Simonetti used the [[Roland Jupiter-8]], Roland [[Vocoder]] Plus and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the [[Oberheim DMX]] drum machine, the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, and [[Roland MC-4 Microcomposer|Roland MC-4]] music sequencer. Pignatelli played [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[Fretless guitar|fretless]] guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.&lt;ref name="Lucas3"/&gt;

While the soundtrack is not as well regarded as Goblin's earlier scores for ''Deep Red'', ''Suspiria'', or ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978), [[Tim Lucas]] felt it "...&amp;nbsp;so fused to the fabric of the picture that ''Tenebrae'' might be termed&amp;nbsp;... a ''giallo musicale''; that is, a ''giallo'' in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to occupy the same plane as the action and characters."&lt;ref name="Lucas3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Tim|title=Review of Tenebrae DVD|journal=Video Watchdog|date=June 2004|issue=108|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers David Kerekes and David Slater were also favorable to the score;  writing that the film "bristles with arresting imagery and a cracking musical score from ex-members of Goblin".{{sfn|Kerekes|Slater|2000|p=258}} Simonetti felt the score was good, but that it was only a "medium"-level success.&lt;ref name="goblin"/&gt; However, it did enjoy a second wave of popularity being remixed in clubs.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; The album has had multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on the Italian Cinevox label.{{sfn|Lucas|1994|pages=225–226}}

==Release==

===Original reception and censorship===
''Tenebrae'' had a wide theatrical release throughout Italy and mainland Europe, something the director very much needed after having suffered major distribution problems with his previous film, ''Inferno''.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=161}} Released on 28 October 1982,&lt;ref name="tooze"/&gt; ''Tenebrae'' saw modest success at the box office in Italy and Europe, but it did not perform as well as some of Argento's previous films.&lt;ref name="almar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dario Argento: il brivido, il sangue, il thrilling|last=Giovannini|first=Fabio|date=1986|publisher=Edizioni Dealo|isbn=978-88-220-4516-4|page=51|language=it}} "Non e un caso, infatti,che il film Tenebre abbia deluso almeno in parte il box-office, dopo alcuni mesi di indiscutibile successo."&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, ''Tenebrae'' had been released with a [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|VM18]] rating, meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen. Argento had desired a VM14 rating, both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film's chances of commercial success.&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; ''Tenebrae'' features scenes of female homosexuality; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time, and Argento said he wanted to "recount this subject freely and in an open manner, without interference or being ashamed". The VM18 rating upset him, as he believed it was a result of the sexual diversity on display rather than the film's violence.&lt;ref name="unsane"/&gt;

[[File:Tenebrae ribbon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Almost identical to the poster shot, except the blood has been covered with a tied ribbon around the woman's neck.|The [[London Underground]] poster campaign replaced the slashed neck with a red ribbon.]]
One of the film's most excessively violent scenes features the death of Neal's ex-wife, Jane (played by [[Veronica Lario]]). This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; The original scene featured Jane's arm being cut off at the elbow; blood sprays from the wound onto white walls until the character falls to the floor. After a back-and-forth between Argento and Italian censors (at the time a panel of judges), the scene was first trimmed from showing an "immense" spray to a small one, then a smaller one still. The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s,&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt; when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. According to Alan Jones, Berlusconi "did not want the public seeing [Lario] so explicitly murdered, even if it was in a film by his country's premier horror expert".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; For a few years, it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally, as prints were withdrawn altogether.&lt;ref name="c8"/&gt; A later DVD release did become available, with the scene restored.&lt;ref name="scream"/&gt;

Averaging a murder every ten minutes, ''Tenebrae'' ranks as one of Argento's bloodiest films.&lt;ref name="r8"/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of "sexualized violence" by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] prior to its theatrical release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/argento/|publisher=Senses of Cinema|first=Xavier|last=Mendik|title=Dario Argento|accessdate=22 April 2006|date=November 2003|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504230639/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/argento.html |archivedate = 4 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 May 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmdates.co.uk/films/1983-05-16/|title=UK Cinema Release Dates – May 1983|author=Staff|date=2013|accessdate=6 June 2015|publisher=Filmdates.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertising campaign for ''Tenebrae'' featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a woman with her throat cut, blood dripping from the wound.&lt;ref name="goblin"/&gt; According to Jones, who worked for ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s distributor at the time, in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the [[London Underground]] refused to run them. New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon.&lt;ref name="c4"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar change was made to the soundtrack sleeve.&lt;ref name="goblin"/&gt;

In the United States the film remained unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version under the title ''Unsane''.{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=161}} It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing nearly all of the film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of ''Tenebrae'' received nearly unanimously negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lucas, Tim|title=The Video Watchdog Book|publisher=Video Watchdog|year= 1992|isbn=978-0-9633756-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media and "video nasty" list===
''Tenebrae'' has been released on home media in many different versions in numerous territories. In 1983, when the VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom, it was short by about four seconds.&lt;ref name="censor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=382304|author=Staff|date=2 June 2014|title=''Tenebre (aka ''Tenebrae'')|publisher=Movie-Censorship.com|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film soon found itself included in a list of thirty-nine so-called "[[video nasty|video nasties]]" that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK video stores under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]].&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt; Deemed harmful to audiences, "video nasties" were strongly criticized for their violent content by the press, social commentators and various religious organizations. Speculating in 2011, Thomas Rostock said that the higher-than-usual murder count for an Argento film was partially responsible,&lt;ref name="r8"/&gt; while James Gracey believed it was perhaps "the highly sexualized presentation of its violent content". He went on to say, "Of all the titles placed on the video nasty list, ''Tenebrae'' is perhaps the most misunderstood and undeserving of the grimy status it gained through its association with the whole debacle."&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt; Kim Newman agreed that ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s reputation as a "video nasty" was unwarranted, saying that none of the on-screen deaths are as gory or lingering as those in Argento's previous films.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; He also believed ''Tenebrae'' would eventually be remembered on its own merits, rather than as part of the "video nasties" list.&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt; Nevertheless, the ban lasted until 1999, when ''Tenebrae'' was legally released on videotape with one second of footage removed in addition to the previously censored five. In 2003, the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it without any cuts.&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt; In Germany, the release was strongly cut, and reportedly seized by the authorities.&lt;ref name="censor"/&gt;

The film has since been released on DVD in the US, mostly uncut save for approximately twenty seconds of extraneous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2464|title=Tenebre AKA Tenebrae AKA Unsane (1982)|publisher=DVD Compare|accessdate=22 April 2006|author=Staff|date=13 November 2002|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060415025017/http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2464 |archivedate = 15 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tenebrae'' received an initial DVD release in March 1999 from [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], with a re-release in May 2008.&lt;ref name="tooze"/&gt; The Anchor Bay release, though presented as "uncut" was not the fully restored version of the film. A DVD German release by Raptor was also missing about one-and-a-half seconds of material.&lt;ref name="censor"/&gt; In June 2011, [[Arrow Films]] issued a special edition on DVD,&lt;ref name="tooze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film5/blu-ray_reviews_66/tenebre_blu-ray.htm|title=Tenebre Blu-ray|last=Tooze|first=Gary|publisher=DVD Beaver|date=March 2015|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but although the image quality was far better than in previous DVD releases, this version was "heavily lambasted" for carrying a transfer of the film that had visible [[noise (video)|noise]] and "distorted audio". In 2013, Arrow released a Blu-ray edition that corrected the audio and video problems. Additional corrections were made to the transfer and released by [[Synapse Films]] in 2016, as a steelbook edition limited to 3000 copies.&lt;ref name="mike"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3270915/best-worst-13-mike-pereiras-top-blu-rays-of-2013/|title=Best &amp; Worst '13: Mike Pereira's Top Blu-rays of 2013|last=Pereira|first=Mike|date=31 December 2013|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arrow &amp; Synapse DVD and Blu-ray releases are "completely uncut".&lt;ref name="censor"/&gt;

===Later reception===
''Tenebrae'' has come to be considered one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics, with some calling it his last great film.&lt;ref name="quiet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; [[AllMovie]] refers to the film as "one of Dario Argento's best thrillers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/tenebre-v51924/review |title=Tenebre - Review - AllMovie |last=Legare |first=Patrick |publisher=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |date=July 2012|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1994 book on the director, ''Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento,'' Maitland McDonagh maintains that ''Tenebrae'' is "in many respects&amp;nbsp;... the finest film that Argento has ever made."{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=157}} Richard Dyer, writing for the ''Directory of World Cinema: Italy'', describes the film as a "tease", one which is "perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction: being outwitted, wrong-footed, led up the garden path". Dyer believes that the degree of lighting used in the film is unsurpassed.{{Sfn|Bayman|2011|pages=150–151}} Ed Gonzalez of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' said that ''Tenebrae'' "is a riveting defense of auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=413|title=Tenebrae Review|date=2 February 2002|accessdate=22 April 2006|first=Ed|last=Gonzalez|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202222656/http://slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=413|archivedate=2 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Phipps of ''The A.V. Club'' noted "...&amp;nbsp;Argento makes some points about the intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the real reason to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/3034|title=Tenebre Review|date=29 March 2002|accessdate=22 April 2006|first=Keith|last=Phipps|publisher=A.V.

It may have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. We've got all the usual suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately seventy-two twists before all is revealed&amp;nbsp;... For fans of Argento's earlier ''giallo'', this is a must-see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/darioargento.php |date=27 May 2008 |title=Tenebrae |last=Sullivan |first=Gordon |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]] |accessdate=26 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231205356/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/darioargento.php |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the recent critical reaction to ''Tenebrae'' has been positive. [[Geoff Andrew]] of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' thought that the film was "unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Geoff|authorlink=Geoff Andrew|date=March 2013|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/tenebrae|title=Tenebrae|publisher=''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Kenneth Muir, author of ''Horror Films of the 1980s'', considers the film to be far inferior to ''Suspiria'', but acknowledges that it was so "unremittingly gory" that it justified its US title of "Unsane".{{Sfn|Muir|2012|p=629}} John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a "technically mesmeric" one, felt that thematically it was a "disappointingly retrograde step" for Argento.{{Sfn|Martin|2007|p=146}} [[Christopher Null]] of [[Filmcritic.com]] called it a "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tenebre/|title=Tenebre (Unsane)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dennis Schwartz]] of ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' dismissed it as "trash".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/tenebrae.htm|title=tenebrae|last=Schwartz|first=Dennis|authorlink=Dennis Schwartz|date=2 March 2002|website=Ozus' World Movie Reviews|access-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Johnson, editor of ''Images'', complained, "Not much of ''Tenebre'' makes much sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And these are some of the bloodiest murders of Argento's career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue08/reviews/argento/|date=June 2001|title=The Dario Argento Collection|accessdate=22 April 2006|first=Gary|last=Johnson|publisher=Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, "''Tenebre'' is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic&amp;nbsp;... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors".&lt;ref name="Lucas3"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Coming at the tail end of the ''giallo'' cycle, ''Tenebrae'' does not appear to have been as influential as Argento's earlier films. Douglas E. Winter, however, has commented that ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s Louma crane sequence has been stylistically influential, pointing to its use in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Golden|1992|pages=268–288}} In addition, towards the end of the film, with Neal supposedly dead, the camera faces Detective Giermani directly. When he stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor, Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot. Alan Jones cited ''Tenebrae'' as the first film to use this specific type of [[Blocking (stage)|camera blocking]], and believes it to have been copied and referenced deliberately by later filmmakers.&lt;ref name="c11"&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example, discussed as an unacknowledged "steal" from ''Tenebrae'', is De Palma's "surprise reveal" of [[John Lithgow]] standing behind a victim in ''[[Raising Cain]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="brian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2000/brian-de-palma/raising/ |title=The Key to De Palma's ''Raising Cain'' |last=Kakmi |first=Dmetri |publisher=''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' |date=May 2000|accessdate=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2440 |title=''Raising Cain'' - Film Review|last=Henderson |first=Eric |date=19 August 2006 |website=Slant Magazine |accessdate=6 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212000612/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2440 |archivedate=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000) also contains a similar moment, although Zemeckis has denied a familiarity with Italian movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=6844 |date=5 September 2000 |title=''What Lies Beneath'' Venice Festival Report |accessdate=22 April 2006 |first=Robert |last=Bernocchi |publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111556/http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=6844 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final death scene in ''Tenebrae'' – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a sculpture – is directly referenced in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s Hitchcockian murder mystery ''[[Dead Again]]'' (1991). Kim Newman maintains that Branagh's film imitates the sequence so entirely – with [[Derek Jacobi]] being pierced by the sculpture – that Branagh must have included the reference deliberately. The subsequent moment, where Nicolodi screams repeatedly in the rain, was cited by [[Asia Argento]] (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.&lt;ref name="c12"/&gt;
