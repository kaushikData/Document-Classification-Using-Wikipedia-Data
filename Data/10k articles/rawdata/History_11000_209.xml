[[American Journal of Archaeology]] (AJA 100, 638, 1996) reviewing Kalantar's volume writes:
"While Lehmann-Haupt and Marr are often credited with sparking investigations into the history and prehistory of  eastern Anatolia and
southern Transcaucasia, this compilation* of selected writings and photographs of Ashkharbek Kalantar (1884-1942) makes a persuasive case that it was he who most thoroughly shaped archaeology in the Armenian highlands."

"Kalantar's life and work provide a testimony to the enduring importance of the Armenian highlands to world history and prehistory..."

== Great Purge victim ==
On 19 March 1938 Kalantar was arrested in Yerevan by the regime, among other professors, as an ‘enemy of nation’ (‘the professors process’); the precise date and place of his death in Russia are unknown.&lt;ref name=taline&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ter Minassian|first1=Taline|title=Erevan : la construction d'une capitale à l'époque soviétique|date=2007|publisher=Presses universitaires de Rennes|location=Rennes|isbn=2753503699|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoslAQAAMAAJ|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle at Springmartin'''&lt;ref name=uvf101&gt;Cusack, Jim &amp; McDonald, Henry (1997). ''UVF''. Poolbeg. p.101&lt;/ref&gt; was a series of gun battles in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland on 13–14 May 1972. It involved the [[British Army]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).

The violence began when a [[car bomb]], planted by [[Ulster loyalist]]s, exploded outside a crowded [[public house]] in the mainly [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] and [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] district of [[Ballymurphy, Belfast|Ballymurphy]]. UVF snipers then opened fire on the survivors from an abandoned high-rise [[apartment|flat]]. This began the worst fighting in Northern Ireland since the suspension of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and the imposition of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] from London. For the rest of the night and throughout the next day, local IRA units fought gun battles with both the UVF and British Army. Most of the fighting took place along the [[interface area|interface]] between the Catholic Ballymurphy and [[Ulster Protestant]] [[Shankill Road|Springmartin]] housing estates, and the British Army base that sat between them.

Seven people were killed in the violence: five civilians (four Catholics, one Protestant), a British soldier and a member of the IRA Youth Section. Four of the dead were teenagers.

==Bombing of Kelly's Bar==
[[File:Ballymurphy garden.JPG|thumb|left|The dead commemorated in a republican Garden of Remembrance in [[Ballymurphy, Belfast]]]]
Shortly after 5:00 &lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; on Saturday 13 May 1972, a [[car bomb]] exploded without warning outside Kelly's Bar, at the junction of the [[Springfield Road, Belfast|Springfield Road]] and Whiterock Road. The [[public house|pub]] was in a mainly [[Irish Catholic]] and [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] area and most of its customers were from the area.&lt;ref name=lostlives183&gt;McKittrick, David (1999). ''Lost Lives''. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publications. p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguire&gt;McGuire, Maria. ''To Take Arms: My Year with the IRA Provisionals''. Viking Press, 1973. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the blast, the pub was crowded with men watching an [[association football]] match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] on colour television. Sixty-three people were injured, eight of them seriously.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; John Moran (19), who had been working at Kelly's as a part-time barman, died of his injuries on 23 May.&lt;ref name=troubles4344/&gt;&lt;ref name=cain&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1972.html Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1972], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the British Army claimed that the blast had been an "accident" caused by a Provisional IRA bomb. The [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[William Whitelaw]], told the House of Commons on 18 May that the blast was caused by a [[Provisional IRA]] bomb that exploded prematurely.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; However, locals suspected that the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) had planted the bomb.&lt;ref name=mcguire/&gt; Republican sources said that IRA volunteers would not have risked storing such a large amount of explosives in such a crowded pub.&lt;ref name=mcguire/&gt; It later emerged that the bomb had indeed been planted by loyalists.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt;

A memorial plaque on the site of the former pub names three members of staff who lost their lives as a result of the bomb and the gun battles that followed. It reads: "...here on 13th May 1972 a no warning Loyalist car bomb exploded. As a result, 66 people were injured and three innocent members of staff of Kelly's Bar lost their lives. They were: Tommy McIlroy (died 13th May 1972), John Moran (died from his injuries 23rd May 1972), Gerard Clarke (died from his injuries 6th September 1989)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/victims/memorials/static/photos/868.html Kelly's Bar Memorial Plaque], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gun battles==
===Saturday 13 May===
The night before the bombing, gunmen from the [[UVF West Belfast Brigade]] had taken up position along the second floor of an abandoned row of [[apartment|maisonette]]s (or flats) at the edge of the Protestant Springmartin estate. The flats overlooked the Catholic Ballymurphy estate. Rifles, mostly Second World War stock, were ferried to the area from dumps in the [[Shankill Road|Shankill]].&lt;ref name=uvf99&gt;Cusack, Jim &amp; McDonald, Henry (1997). ''UVF''. Poolbeg. pp. 99–100&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the explosion, the UVF unit opened fire on those gathered outside the wrecked pub, including those who had been caught in the blast.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; A British Army spokesman said that the shooting began at about 5:35 &lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, when 30 high-velocity shots were heard.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] Member of Parliament [[Gerry Fitt]] said that shots had been fired from the Springmartin estate only minutes after the bombing. [[William Whitelaw]], however, claimed that the shooting did not begin until 40 minutes after the blast.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; Ambulances braved the gunfire to reach the wounded, which included a number of children.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; Tommy McIlroy (50), a Catholic civilian who worked at Kelly's Bar, was shot in the chest and killed outright. He was the first to be killed in the violence.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt;

&lt;!-- A short time after the bombing, a series of gun battles broke out between the Provisional IRA and the UVF's West Belfast Battalion at the interface area separating the Catholic Ballymurphy and Protestant Springmartin housing estates.&lt;ref name=uvf99/&gt;&lt;ref name=troubles4344/&gt; --&gt;
Members of both the Provisional and [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official]] wings of the IRA "joined forces to return the fire", using [[Thompson submachine guns]], [[M1 carbine]]s and a [[Bren light machine gun]].&lt;ref name=mcguire/&gt; When British troops arrived on the scene, they too were fired upon by IRA units. Corporal Alan Buckley (22) of the [[1st Battalion The Kings Regiment]] was fatally shot by the Provisionals  on Whiterock Road.&lt;ref name=lostlives184&gt;McKittrick, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; A platoon of soldiers then gave covering fire while a medical officer tried to help him. Another soldier was also wounded in the gunfight. Following this, 300 members of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] were sent to back up the King's Own Scottish Borderers.&lt;ref name=lostlives184/&gt;

Over the next few hours there were 35 separate shooting incidents reported, making it the most violent night since the suspension of the Northern Ireland government and imposition of Direct Rule from London earlier that year.&lt;ref name=uvf99/&gt;&lt;ref name=troubles4344&gt;''The Troubles – a Chronology of the Northern Ireland conflict''. Glenravel Publications. Issue #13, May   1972 (pp. 43–44){{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA exchanged fire with both the British Army and with the UVF snipers on the Springmartin flats.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; Most of the IRA's fire was aimed at the Henry Taggart Army base—near the Springmartin flats—which was hit by over 400 rounds in the first 14 hours of the battle.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; Although most of the republican gunfire came from the Ballymurphy estate, British soldiers also reported shots being fired from the nearby mountain slopes.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; According to journalist [[Malachi O'Doherty]], a source claimed that the British Army had also fired into [[Belfast City Cemetery]] between the Whiterock and Springfield roads.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi O'Doherty, ''The Telling Year: Belfast 1972'', Dublin: Gill and Macmillan,  2007, p. 142&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more people were killed that night. The first was 15-year-old Michael Magee, a member of [[Fianna Éireann]] (the IRA youth wing), who was found shot in the chest at New Barnsley Crescent, near his home.&lt;ref name=lostlives184/&gt; He died shortly after he was brought to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. Two men who took him there claimed they were beaten by British soldiers who had just heard of Corporal Buckley's death.&lt;ref name=lostlives184/&gt; A death notice said that Magee was killed by the British Army but the republican publication ''Belfast Graves'' claimed he had been accidentally shot.&lt;!--by whom?--&gt;&lt;ref name=lostlives184/&gt; The other was a Catholic civilian, Robert McMullan (32), who was shot at New Barnsley Park, also near his home. Witnesses said there was heavy gunfire in the area at 8{{small|PM}} and then "a single shot rang out and Robert McMullan fell to the ground". It is thought that he was shot by soldiers firing from Henry Taggart base.&lt;ref name=lostlives184/&gt;

On the first night of the battle, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) arrested two young UVF members, [[Trevor King (loyalist)|Trevor King]] and William Graham. They were found at a house in Blackmountain Pass trying to fix a rifle that had jammed. During a search of the house, the RUC found three [[Steyr AUG|Steyr rifles]], ammunition and illuminating flares.&lt;ref name=uvf100&gt;Cusack &amp; McDonald, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunday 14 May===
The fighting between the IRA, UVF and British Army resumed the following day. According to the book ''UVF'' (1997), British soldiers were moved into the ground floor of the abandoned flats while the UVF snipers continued firing from the flats above them. The soldiers and UVF were both firing into Ballymurphy, and according to the book both were "initially unaware of each other".&lt;ref name=uvf99/&gt; However, according to a UVF gunman involved in the battle, there was collusion between the UVF and British soldiers. He alleged that a British foot patrol caught a UVF unit hiding guns in a bin but ignored their cache with a wink when the UVF member said the guns were "rubbish".&lt;ref name="uvf100"/&gt; According to Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald, [[Jim Hanna (loyalist)|Jim Hanna]] — who later became UVF Chief of Staff — was one of the snipers operating from Springmartin during the battle.&lt;ref name=uvf152&gt;Cusack &amp; McDonald, p. 152&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Hanna told journalist [[Kevin Myers]] that, during the clashes, a British Army patrol helped Hanna and two other UVF members get into Corry's Timber Yard, which overlooked the Catholic Ballymurphy estate.&lt;ref name=redhand&gt;Bruce, Steve. ''The Red Hand: Protestant Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland''. Oxford University Press, 1992. p. 210&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When a British Army Major heard of the incident he ordered his men to withdraw, but they did not arrest the UVF members, who were allowed to hold their position.&lt;ref name=redhand/&gt; The IRA's Ballymurphy unit was returning fire at an equal rate and some 400 strike marks were later counted on the flats.&lt;ref name=uvf99/&gt;

In the Springmartin estate, gunfire killed Protestant teenager John Pedlow (17) and wounded his friend.&lt;ref name=lostlives183/&gt; According to the book ''Lost Lives'', they had been shot by soldiers. His friend said that they had been walking home from a shop when there was a burst of gunfire, which "came from near the Taggart Memorial Army post and seemed to be directed towards Black Mountain Parade".&lt;ref name=lostlives186&gt;McKittrick, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malcolm Sutton's ''Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland'' states that he was killed by the IRA.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt; An inquest into Pedlow's death found that he had been hit by a .303 bullet, which was likely a [[ricochet]]. Pedlow was given a loyalist funeral, but police said there was nothing to link him with any "illegal organisation or acts".&lt;ref name=lostlives186/&gt;

UVF snipers continued to fire from the high-rise flats on the hill at Springmartin Road. About three hours after the shooting of Pedlow, a bullet fatally struck a 13-year-old Catholic girl, Martha Campbell, as she walked along Springhill Avenue.&lt;ref name=lostlives186/&gt; She was among a group of young girls and a witness said the firing must have been directed at himself and the girls, as nobody else was in the area at the time. Reliable loyalist sources say that the schoolgirl was shot by the UVF.&lt;ref name=lostlives186/&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the loyalist UDA used roadblocks and barricades to seal-off the [[Shankill Road|Woodvale]] area into a "no-go" zone, controlled by the UDA's B Company, which was then commanded by former British soldier [[Davy Fogel]].&lt;ref name=wood8&gt;Wood, Ian S.

{{campaignbox Fatah–Hamas conflict}}
The '''Battle of Gaza''', also referred to as '''Hamas' takeover of Gaza''', was a military conflict between [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], that took place in the [[Gaza Strip]] between the June 10 and 15, 2007. It was a prominent event in the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]], centered on the struggle for power, after Fatah lost the parliamentary elections of 2006. Hamas fighters took control of the Gaza Strip&lt;ref name="Hamas takes control of Gaza"&gt;Guardian, 15 June 2007, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/15/israel4 ''Hamas takes control of Gaza'']&lt;/ref&gt; and removed Fatah officials. The battle resulted in the dissolution of the [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|unity government]] and the ''de facto'' division of the [[Palestinian territories]] into two entities, the [[West Bank]] governed by the [[Palestinian National Authority]], and Gaza governed by [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Hamas]].

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] estimated that at least 118 people were killed and more than 550 wounded during the fighting in the week up to 15 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/220224/025f24b73a37ef712ad576eb84b22e84.htm Gaza-Westbank – ICRC Bulletin No. 22 / 2007], AlertNet. Retrieved 16 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)}}

===Palestinian Constitutional Contribution===
In 2003, the Basic Law of the Palestinian Authority (PA) was amended and a semi-presidential form of government was established, whereby a constitution creates a directly elected fixed-term president, plus a prime minister and cabinet collectively responsible to the legislature. While some writers do point to the potential advantages of semi-presidentialism, the academic consensus is largely unsupportive of this form of government. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... in January 2006, Hamas gained a majority at the legislative elections. This led to ‘cohabitation’ between a Fatah president and a Hamas prime minister and government and created ‘two competing centers of power’, which is said to be so damaging for fragile democracies with semi-presidential constitutions. Following the election, and in the context of an extremely difficult domestic and international situation, the Palestinian Authority (PA) descended into civil war. By June 2007, the PA had, in effect, split in two, with Hamas ruling the Gaza Strip and Fatah retaining authority over the West Bank. In the same month President Abbas declared a state of emergency and dismissed the Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniya, though Hamas maintains that this decision was unconstitutional and still considers Haniya to be the legitimate head of government. Whatever the legality of the situation, by this time the governance structures of the Basic Law had all but broken down.

It is very difficult to determine to what extent semi-presidentialism is responsible for the problems of governance in the PA in the period 2006–2007. Indeed, usually, the importance of institutions in shaping the behaviour of political actors in the Palestinian context is often neglected in favour of other factors, notably the inherently conflictual nature of the relationship between Fatah and Hamas. Moreover, the internal and external problems faced by the PA are greater than those faced by almost any other jurisdiction in the world and it would be naive to suggest that semi-presidentialism per se was anything other than a contributory factor to the problems faced by the Authority since January 2006.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;[http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2009/09/16/pa.gsp028.full.pdf+html ''The Impact of Semi-Presidentialism on Governance in the Palestinian Authority'' (pdf)], pp. 11-14. Francesco Cavatorta and Robert Elgie. Parliam Affairs (2009). [http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2009/09/16/pa.gsp028.full (Also in html version)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Palestinian Basic Law (2003) is by definition pertinent to the evaluation of the legality of actions of Palestinian parties in the aftermath of the 2006 Palestinian Legislature elections. President Abbas had very specific authorities under the Basic Law. Article 88 - If the president of the state or the prime minister, in case of necessity, suggest the dissolution of the Representative Council to the Council of Ministers, then its dissolution may be approved by a majority of two-thirds of its members. Under article 126 the President is the supreme head of the Palestinian national security forces which had to be headed by a 'cognizant minister' (appointed by the Prime Minister - article 137). Article 137 dictates that the Prime Minister forms the government of Palestine and speaks for it, is head of the Representative Council, and that he appoints ministers and senior positions. Article 153 forbids the formation of armed groups outside the network of national security forces. The police (article 154), on the other hand, form a civilian organisation, part of the Ministry of the Interior (appointed by the Prime Minister).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-permanent-constitution-draft|title=Palestinian Basic Law (2003)|publisher=Palestinian National Authority|year=2003| accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victors, Hamas, ruled this governing body in 2006/2007 via the Representative Council.

=== 2006 Palestinian legislative election and aftermath ===
The Addameer organisation recorded that, on 26 September 2005, during the lead-up to the 2006 elections, Israel launched a campaign of arrest against Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) members. 450 members of Hamas were detained, mostly involved in the 2006 PLC elections.&lt;ref name=Addameer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addameer.org/publications/arrest-and-detention-palestinian-legislative-council-members |title=The Arrest and Detention of Palestinian Legislative Council Members|author=Unnamed Addameer staff|publisher=Addameer|year=2009| accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2006 the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative election]], judged to be free and fair by international observers, took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2287.html |title=Palestinian Elections: Trip Report by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter|author=Jimmy Carter|publisher=The Carter Center|year=2006| accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in a Hamas victory, which surprised Israel and the United States which had expected their favoured partner, Fatah, to retain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/world/middleeast/rice-admits-us-underestimated-hamas-strength.html |title=Rice Admits U.S. Underestimated Hamas Strength|author=Steven Weisman|publisher=The New York Times|year=2006|quote=Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged Sunday that the United States had failed to understand the depth of hostility among Palestinians toward their longtime leaders.

Hamas rejected these conditions, saying that "the "unfair conditions would endanger the well-being of Palestinians". This view was echoed by Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia who believed that the international community are being "unreasonable". Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told reporters in Malaysia: "The European Union insisted on having elections in Palestine, and this is the result of what they asked for. Now to come around, and say [they] don't accept the will of the people that was expressed through democratic means, seems an unreasonable position to take." The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James Robbins, said the Quartet's response was chosen with care: "They did not demand a renunciation of violence or immediate recognition of Israel, but a commitment to these things in the future". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4664152.stm |title=Hamas rejects 'unfair' aid demand|author=Unnamed BBC staff|publisher=BBC|year=2006|quote="Hamas is immune to bribery, intimidation and blackmail," Khaled Meshaal, the movement's overall leader, wrote in the UK's Guardian newspaper. ...

Conal Urquhart, Guardian, 21 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interventions in the Election Outcome ===
[[Mahmoud Abbas]] was under pressure by the [[Quartet on the Middle East]], which considered Hamas' unacceptable as it was perceived to undermine decades of international efforts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Therefore, the international community decided to boycott the Hamas-led government by severing diplomatic ties and halting financial aid until Hamas would fulfill certain conditions. It was suggested that Abbas could use his constitutional powers to dismiss the government and call for new elections, which were intended to yield a different result and reinstall Fatah in power on the grounds that the Palestinian electorate would perceive Hamas as a failure. The threat of new elections was never carried out because it emerged that Hamas might in fact be returned to power despite its inability to implement its manifesto and because the movement itself strongly signalled that
calling new elections although a constitutional prerogative of the President, would amount to ‘a coup against Palestinian legitimacy and the will of the Palestinian people’&lt;ref name=impact/&gt;&lt;ref name=iiss_failed_state&gt;[http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/survival/sections/2007-f180/survival-global-politics-and-strategy-autumn-2007-edfe/49-3-03-sayigh-6f35 ''Inducing a Failed State in Palestine''], pp. 13-14.

The US and Israel attempted to undermine Hamas and force it from power while strengthening the position of President Abbas.&lt;ref name=nyt20060214&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/international/middleeast/14mideast.html U.S. and Israelis Are Said to Talk of Hamas Ouster.].

The new government clashed with President Abbas, who shared power with it based on the [[Palestinian National Covenant|Basic Law]]. Through presidential decrees, Abbas took exclusive presidential authority over several administrative powers and periodically made threats of dismissal.&lt;ref name=impact/&gt;

After refusing to accept the plan of the Hamas-led PA government to reform the security sector loyal to Abbas and Fatah, Abbas placed the security forces under his direct control and built up his own Presidential Guard. Hamas then created a parallel security force, which was made up of its own members of the [[al-Qassam Brigades]]. The two forces refused to cooperate. Hamas’ forces represented a tradition of armed resistance, whereas those of Fatah's were committed to the upholding of the [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref name=impact/&gt;

=== Preceding confrontations ===
By 2007, Hamas was unable to pay salaries or get recognition from European donor countries and international organisations. This led to the first fighting between Hamas and Fatah.&lt;ref name=bbc_20060218&gt;{{Cite news |date=18 February 2006 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22902880 |title=Palestinian split: Views from Hamas and Fatah, six years on |newspaper=bbc |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last month of 2006, factional fighting left 33 people dead. On 7 January 2007, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the Hamas-led Interior Ministry's paramilitary police force, the most powerful armed unit outside his control in the factional fighting, to be incorporated into the security apparatus loyal to him. The ministry responded with defiance, announcing plans to double the size of its force. The combative announcements raised the prospect of an intensified armed standoff. Abbas' only means of enforcing the order appeared to be coercive action by police and security units under his command, but they were relatively weak in the Gaza Strip, Hamas's stronghold.&lt;ref name=Boston_Globe&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2007/01/07/abbas_outlaws_hamass_paramilitary_executive_force/ ''Abbas outlaws Hamas's paramilitary Executive Force''].

=== External involvement ===
Documents published in [[Palestine Papers]] reveal the British intelligence [[MI6]], helped draw up a security plan for Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. The plan mentioned as objective "encourage and enable the Palestinian Authority (PA) to fully meet its security obligations under Phase 1 of the Roadmap". It proposes a number of ways of "degrading the capabilities of rejectionists", naming Hamas (the victorious party in the recently elected PA executive government), PIJ (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and the Fatah-linked al-Aqsa Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12283082|title=Palestinian papers: UK's MI6 'tried to weaken Hamas'|publisher=BBC|date=25 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was described by the Guardian as a "wide-ranging crackdown on Hamas".&lt;ref name="Guardian_crackdown"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/palestine-papers-mi6-hamas-crackdown ''Palestine papers reveal MI6 drew up plan for crackdown on Hamas'']. Ian Black and Seumas Milne, Guardian, 25 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the plan was passed to [[Jibril Rajoub]], a senior Fatah official of the PA. The bulk of the plan has since been carried out.&lt;ref name="Guardian_crackdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian_MI6_plan&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/mi6-palestinian-papers-rejectionists-plan ''Palestine papers: MI6 plan proposed internment – and hotline to Israelis''].

Its most controversial section recommended that ''"Degrading the capabilities of the rejectionists – Hamas, PIJ'' [Palestinian Islamic Jihad] ''and the'' [Fatah-linked] ''Al Aqsa Brigades – through the disruption of their leaderships' communications and command and control capabilities; the detention of key middle-ranking officers; and the confiscation of their arsenals and financial resources"''.

After 2006 elections, Hamas announced the formation of its own security service, the ''Executive Force'', appointing [[Jamal Abu Samhadana]], a prominent militant, at its head. Abbas had denounced the move as unconstitutional, saying that only the Palestinian president could command armed forces.&lt;ref name="sfgate2pages"/&gt; U.S. training program began after that.&lt;ref name=guardian_cable&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/81613 ''US embassy cables: Israel discusses Gaza and West Bank with US''].

Gen. Keith Dayton, the U.S. security coordinator "We are involved in building up the Presidential Guard, instructing it, assisting it to build itself up and giving them ideas. We are not training the forces to confront Hamas," adding that "Hamas is receiving money and arms from Iran and possibly Syria, and we must make sure that the moderate forces will not be erased,".&lt;ref name="sfgate2pages"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGIPMV3N61.DTL ''U.S. training Fatah in anti-terror tactics''], San Francisco Chronicle, 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The American effort was part of a broader international package proposed to the Quartet to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian security forces as Hamas threatens to increase its parallel Executive Force to 6,000 men. Training for Fatah ''Presidential Guard'' was provided by Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. Additional non-lethal equipment and fund for the purchase of arms were provided.

Israel's Security Agency supported President Abbas and the Presidential Guard, but was concerned about the weakness of Fatah. There was a plan to add the PLO's Jordan-based [[Badr Brigade in the Jordanian Army|Badr Brigade]] to the Presidential Guard.&lt;ref name=guardian_cable/&gt; As of October 2006, "while clashes between Hamas and elements of Fatah had been fierce", [[Israel Security Agency]] Director Yuval Diskin did not believe the Palestinians were on the verge of a civil war because neither side wanted one, but "should something happen to Haniyeh on the Hamas side, or Mohammed Dahlan or Rashid Abu Shabak on the Fatah side, anything could happen."&lt;ref name=guardian_cable/&gt;

According to the [[IISS]], the June 2007 escalation was triggered by Hamas' conviction that the PA's Presidential Guard, loyal to Mahmoud Abbas, was being positioned to take control of Gaza. The US had helped build up the Presidential Guard to 3,500 men since August 2006.&lt;ref name="IISS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081020132918/http://www.iiss.org/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=2571&amp;type=full&amp;servicetype=Attachment ''Hamas coup in Gaza'' (pdf)], International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Volume 13, Issue 5; June 2007.

=== Plan to replace government ===
The Hamas-led government met with Israeli opposition and Quartet sanctions, and President Abbas and the Fatah-dominated [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] developed a plan to replace the [[Palestinian Authority Government of March 2006|Hamas government]] with one acceptable to Israel and the international community. According to the plan, unveiled in Al Jazeera's [[Palestine Papers]], a national unity government or a government of technocrats would be formed by the end of November to prepare early presidential and legislative elections by mid-2007. If the establishment of a government meeting the [[Quartet]]'s conditions failed, President Abbas would announce a state of emergency, dismiss the government and form an emergency government, or call early elections. The developers of the plan were aware that an emergency government could legally govern only for 1 month without a vote of confidence by the PLC.  An "Action Plan Leading to Early Elections" envisioned a strong enlargement of Fatah's [[Palestinian National Security Forces|Presidential Guard]], internal reform of Fatah, empowering of presidential institutions, resumption of aid by the international community through the President’s Office, and end of withholding of taxes by Israel.&lt;ref name=PP_Vision&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/767.PDF ''Palestinian Vision for Resolving the Current PA Crisis (Draft #6'')]. The Palestine Papers, 30 October 2006. [http://thepalestinepapers.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/2012182245231783.html Here available]&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2006, the US administration, Israel, many Arab governments, and much of Fatah – including most of Abbas’ key advisors still held the view that if Hamas did not unambiguously accept the Quartet’s conditions, it should and could be forced out of power through early elections, its dismissal and appointment of an emergency government or a popular referendum seeking Palestinian agreement to the Quartet’s conditions. The plan had also been put forward by US President Bush in his meeting with Abbas on 20 September 2006.&lt;ref name=icg_report_58&gt;[https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/eastern-mediterranean/israelpalestine/arab-israeli-conflict-reach-lasting-peace ''The Arab-Israeli Conflict: To Reach a Lasting Peace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413235627/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Israel%20Palestine/58_the_arab_israeli_conflict___to_reach_a_lasting_peace.pdf |date=13 April 2016 }}, pp. 3-4.

The plan was largely carried out:
* In March 2007, a [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|national unity government]] was established after the [[Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process#February 2007 Mecca Agreement|February 2007 Mecca Agreement]].
* On 14 June 2007, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)#June 2007: split of government|announced the dissolution of the unity government and declared a state of emergency]].
* On 17 June 2007, Abbas established [[Palestinian Authority Governments of June–July 2007|an emergency government]] without the approval of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council|PLC]].
* Abbas-loyal troops were strengthened with international help and support from Israel.&lt;ref name="IISS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=csm/&gt;

Elections, however, did not take place.

== The battle ==
On June 10, 2007, the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]] culminated in clashes, between the Fatah-allied forces on one side and the Hamas-allied forces on the other side. Major Fatah forces were the [[Palestinian National Security Forces|National Security Forces]], particularly the "Presidential Guard". Main force of Hamas was the "Executive Force".

Hamas militants seized several Fatah members and threw one of them, Mohammed Sweirki, an officer in the elite Palestinian Presidential Guard, off the top of the tallest building in Gaza, a 15-story apartment building. In retaliation, Fatah militants attacked and killed the [[imam]] of the city's [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Great Mosque]], Mohammed al-Rifati. They also opened fire on the home of Prime Minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]]. Just before midnight, a Hamas militant was thrown off a 12-story building.&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz/Associated Press, 10 June 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100825164924/http://www.haaretz.com/news/palestinian-gunmen-target-haniyeh-s-home-in-gaza-1.222703 ''Palestinian gunmen target Haniyeh's home in Gaza'']. On web.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, the residences of both Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah's leader and the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority president]], and of [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|then-Prime Minister]] Ismail Haniya, of Hamas, were targeted with gun and shell fire.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Rabinovich, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070611232931/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C20867%2C21890067-601%2C00.html ''Deadly escalation in Fatah-Hamas feud'']. The Australian, 12 June 2007. On web.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, Hamas began attacking posts held by their Fatah faction rivals. Hundreds of Hamas fighters had moved on the positions after giving their occupants two hours to leave. A major Fatah base in the northern town of [[Jabaliya]] fell to Hamas fighters, witnesses told AFP news agency. Heavy fighting also raged around the main Fatah headquarters in Gaza City, with Hamas militants attacking with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons.&lt;ref name=bbchamas&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6744713.stm Hamas launches new Gaza attacks], BBC News Online, 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, Hamas seized the headquarters of the Fatah-controlled National Security Forces in northern Gaza. Gunmen fought for control of high-rise buildings serving as sniper positions and Hamas said it had bulldozed a Fatah outpost controlling Gaza's main north-south road. Also on that day, an explosion wrecked the [[Khan Younis]] headquarters of the Fatah-linked [[Preventive Security Service]], killing five people.&lt;ref name="bbc-battle"/&gt;

On June 14, Hamas gunmen completed the takeover of the central building of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service's headquarters in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas members took over vehicles and weapons in the compound, which was considered the Palestinian Authority's main symbol in the Strip. The Preventive Security Service cooperated with Israel in the past, and has been armed by the United States.&lt;ref name=pyrrhic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2104476,00.html|title=A pyrrhic victory|work=The Guardian|date=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been identified with Fatah powerhouse [[Mohammed Dahlan]], who has become a figure hated by the Islamists in Gaza.&lt;ref name=pyrrhic/&gt; The gunmen who entered the compound held a prayer there and waved a flag on the building's rooftop. At least 10 people were killed. Hamas TV broadcast a display of weapons inside the building, as well as jeeps, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shells and [[bulletproof vest]]s seized in the compound, which according to Hamas, were smuggled to Fatah by Israel and the Americans in the past few months through the border with [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3412813,00.html We'll execute Fatah leaders], Israel News, 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas members held a prayer in the compound, which they referred to as the "heresy compound." Hamas also changed the name of the neighborhood where the building is located from "[[Tel al-Hawa]]" to "Tel al-Islam."&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt;

On the afternoon of June 14, the [[Associated Press]] reported an explosion that rocked [[Gaza City]]. According to Fatah officials, security forces withdrew from their post and blew it up in order to not let Hamas take it over. The security forces afterwards repositioned to another location. Later on June 14, Hamas also took control of the southern Gaza Strip city [[Rafah]] which lies near an already closed border crossing with Egypt, which is monitored by [[Israel]]i, Palestinian and European Union security forces. The EU staff had, at that time, already been relocated to the Israeli city of [[Ashkelon]] for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/06/14/gaza/index.html Update], cnn.com.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, Abbas dissolved the Palestinian-Hamas unity government, on 15 June, Hamas completed the control over Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debka.com/article.php?aid=1282|title=DEBKAfile, Political Analysis, Espionage, Terrorism, Security|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged military coup ==
As a result of the battle, Hamas got complete control of Gaza. The pro-Fatah view is, that it was a plain [[Coup d'état|military coup]] by Hamas. The pro-Hamas view is, that  the US drew up a plan to arm Fatah cadres with the aim of forcefully removing Hamas from power in Gaza. According to the pro-Hamas view, Fatah fighters, led by commander [[Mohammed Dahlan]] with logistical support from the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], were planning to carry out a bloody coup against Hamas.&lt;ref name=Bombshell_falling&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2008/04/mideast-this-bombshell-took-a-year-falling/ ''This ‘Bombshell’ Took a Year Falling'']. Adam Morrow and Khaled Moussa al-Omrani, Inter Press Service, 2 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Then, Hamas pre-emptively took control over Gaza.

In an April 2008 article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine, the journalist [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]] published confidential documents, apparently originating from the US State Department, which would prove that the United States collaborated with the Palestinian Authority and Israel to attempt the violent overthrow of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and that Hamas pre-empted the coup. The documents suggest that a government with Hamas should meet the demands of the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Middle East Quartet]], otherwise President Mahmoud Abbas should declare a ''state of emergency'', which effectively would dissolve the current unity government, or the government should collapse by other means.&lt;ref&gt;1.

David Rose, Vanity Fair, April 2008. [http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/04/gaza200804 Original without links].&lt;/ref&gt; Rose quotes former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]’s chief Middle East adviser [[David Wurmser]], accusing the Bush administration of “engaging in a dirty war in an effort to provide a corrupt dictatorship [led by Abbas] with victory.” He believes that Hamas had no intention of taking Gaza until Fatah forced its hand. “It looks to me that what happened wasn’t so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen”&lt;ref name="The Gaza Bombshell"/&gt;

According to [[Alastair Crooke]], the then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] decided in 2003 to tie UK and EU security policy in the West Bank and Gaza to a US-led [[counter-insurgency]] against Hamas. This led to an internal policy contradiction that pre-empted the EU from mounting any effective foreign policy on the "peace process" alternative to that of the US. At a political level, the EU "talked the talk" of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, Palestinian state-building and democracy. At the practical level, the EU "walked the walk" of disruption, detention, seizing finances, and destroying the capabilities of one [Hamas] of the two factions and prevented the parliament from exercising any function.&lt;ref name=Crooke&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011125142614893217.html Blair's counter-insurgency "surge"]. Alastair Crooke, Aljazeera, 25 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Crooke, the Quartet conditions for engagement with Hamas, which the EU had endorsed after the 2006 elections, were conditions raised precisely in order to prevent Hamas from meeting them, rather than as guidelines intended to open the path for diplomatic solutions. Then, British and American intelligence services were preparing a "soft" coup to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.&lt;ref name=Crooke/&gt;

With the dissolution of the Hamas-led unity government, the territory controlled by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] was ''de facto'' divided into two entities: the Hamas-controlled [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|government of the Gaza Strip]], and the [[West Bank]], governed by the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name=nyt_divided&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamas Forces Seize Control Over Much of Gaza  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/world/middleeast/13cnd-mideast.htm | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | date=13 June 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community recognized the emergency government.

According to Muhammad Abdel-El of the Hamas-allied [[Popular Resistance Committees]], Hamas and its allies have captured quantities of foreign intelligence, including [[CIA]] files.

While Hamas collected most of the 15,000 weapons registered to the former security forces, it failed to collect more than a fraction of the 400,000 weapons that are in the hands of various clans, and said that it would not touch weapons used for fighting Israel, only those that might be used against Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/873736.html| title=Few Gazans turn in weapons as Hamas deadline for arms collection expires| agency=AP | publisher=[[Haaretz]]| date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5304">'''Birth certificates for Roman citizens''' were introduced during the reign of [[Augustus]] (27 BC–14 AD). Until the time of [[Alexander Severus]] (222–235 AD), it was required that these documents be written in [[Latin]] as a marker of "Romanness" ''(Romanitas)''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," ''Classical Quarterly'' 53.1 (2003), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 21 extant birth registration documents of Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Tim G. Old Age in the Roman World. Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8058-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard birth registration included the date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Schulz (jurist)|Schulz, Fritz]]. “Roman Registers of Births and Birth Certificates. Part II.” The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 33, Parts 1 and 2. 1943. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Completing birth registrations in Roman society were not compulsory. Whereas penalties for failure to register in the [[census]] existed, no known penalties existed in regard to birth registrations. In terms of [[Roman law]], individuals who did not register their birth were neither penalized nor disadvantaged: there are imperial rescripts (a written answer of a Roman emperor to a query or petition in writing) that state that the failure to register children should not deprive them or their right to legitimacy, and there are recorded statements of Roman Emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] that inform an individual that “It is a well-established rule of law that though a declaration of birth has been lost, your status is not adversely affected.”

Birth registrations could be used as proof of age; however, from historical evidence, it is clear that they were not regarded as sufficient proof in themselves. Oral and written evidence could be used as proof of age. For instance, the emperor [[Hadrian]] stated in a rescript that when the age of an individual was at issue, all proofs of age should be furnished and a decision reached based on the most credible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Dig. 22.3.13 (Ulpian).&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the Roman jurist Modestinus concluded that in order to prove one’s age for exemption of certain responsibilities, “age is proved either by notices of birth or by other customary (lawful) evidence.”&lt;ref&gt;Cod. Iust. 2.44.2.pr.-1 (=Cod. Theod. 2.17.1.pr.-1, A.D. 321)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Illegitimacy==
Roman society did not stigmatize [[illegitimacy]] to the extent of later Western societies. A freeborn person who was illegitimate enjoyed higher social status than a freedman. Illegitimate children did have some disadvantages under the law. Their birth could not be officially registered during the first 150 years when birth certificates existed. A law passed in 178 AD, however, gave illegitimate children the same right as legitimate children to share in their mother's property if she died without leaving a will. After the Empire had come under Christian rule, this right was taken away from those born outside wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "Children in the Roman ''Familia''," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

For illegitimate children, the date of birth was more complex and less authoritative since it was either as originally recorded or as copied from the public register.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, Fritz. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Egypt==
Two separate processes of birth registrations existed in Roman [[Egypt]]: one process for [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] citizens that was conducted in Latin, and another process for Greco-Egyptians that was conducted in Greek. These two processes were in legal terms, totally unrelated.

There are 34 available birth registration documents of Greco-Egyptian citizens that span some 270 years.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Tim G.. 175. Sanchez-Moreno Ellart, Carlos, "Notes on some New Issues concerning the Birth Certificates of Roman Citizens" Journal of Juristic Papyrology 34 (2004) 107 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the initiative of the father or another close relative, standard birth registrations included the name and current age of the individual concerned and was addressed to an official. 

Greco-Egyptian birth registrations were not compulsory and were more of a certification of status than proof of birth. The census eliminated the need of birth registrations because the information gathered from birth registrations merely supplemented the information from the census.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Tim G.. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Age was particularly important for determining who was liable to pay the [[Tax per head|poll tax]] at the age of 14 years. Birth registrations could provide the age of the individual; however, the census was held every 14 years to ensure that no one escaped the tax and also provided this information.&lt;ref&gt;Casarico, L. Il controllo della poplazione nell’Egitto romano. 1. Le denunce di morte. Azzaate. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The census was more efficient and thorough than the system of birth registrations in Greco-Egyptian society, and government officials relied on the information from the census far more than birth registrations.

[[File:Rybakov BA.jpg|thumb|Boris Rybakov.]]  
'''Boris Alexandrovich Rybakov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Бори́с Алекса́ндрович Рыбако́в, 3 June 1908, [[Moscow]] – 27 December 2001) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n historian who personified the anti-[[Normanist theory|Normanist]] vision of Russian history. He is the father of [[Indologist]] [[Rostislav Rybakov]].&lt;ref name=K&gt;{{cite news|title=Мастер гипотезы Борис Рыбаков|url=http://tvkultura.ru/article/show/article_id/36086/|agency=[[Russia-K|Kultura]]|date=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and works ==

Rybakov held a chair in Russian history at the [[Moscow University]] since 1939, was a deputy dean of the university in 1952-54, and administered the Russian History Institute for 40 years. His first groundbreaking monograph was the ''Handicrafts of Ancient Rus'' (1948), which sought to demonstrate the economic superiority of [[Kievan Rus]] to contemporary [[Western Europe]].

Rybakov led important excavations in [[Moscow]], [[Novgorod]], [[Zvenigorod]], [[Chernigov]], [[Pereyaslav]], [[Tmutarakan]] and [[Putivl]] and published his findings in numerous monographs, including ''Antiquities of Chernigov'' (1949), ''The Chronicles and [[Bylina]]s of Ancient Rus'' (1963), ''The First Centuries of Russian history'' (1964), ''The [[Tale of Igor's Campaign]] and Its Contemporaries'' (1971), ''Muscovite Maps of the 15th and early 16th Centuries'' (1974), and ''Herodotus' Scythia'' (1979). In the latter book he viewed the [[Scythians]] described by [[Herodotus]] as ancestors of modern Slavic nations.

In his older years, Rybakov attempted to reconstruct the pantheon and myths of [[Slavic paganism|Slavic religion]]. He outlined his ideas in ''Ancient Slavic Paganism'' (1981) and ''Ancient Paganism of Rus'' (1987). Some of these reconstructions have been heavily criticized as far-fetched.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Klejn]].

Many factors directly and indirectly caused the [[Great Recession]] (which started in 2007 with the US [[subprime mortgage crisis]]), with experts and economists placing different weights on particular causes.

Major causes of the initial subprime mortgage crisis and following recession include: International trade imbalances and lax lending standards contributing to high levels of developed country [[household debt]] and [[Real estate bubble|real-estate bubbles]] that have since burst; U.S. government housing policies; and limited regulation of non-depository financial institutions. Once the recession began, various responses were attempted with different degrees of success. These included fiscal policies of governments; monetary policies of central banks; measures designed to help indebted consumers refinance their mortgage debt; and inconsistent approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.

One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000–2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income [[securities]] increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $80 trillion by 2007. This "Giant Pool of Money" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by [[U.S. Treasury bonds]] sought alternatives globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money |title=NPR-The Giant Pool of Money-May 2008 |publisher=Thisamericanlife.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating [[Economic bubble|bubble]] after bubble across the globe.

While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the [[solvency]] of consumers, governments, and banking systems.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2011"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lewis| first = Michael| year = 2011| title = [[Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World]] | publisher = Norton | isbn = 978-0-393-08181-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this debt overhang is to slow consumption and therefore economic growth and is referred to as a "[[balance sheet recession]]" or [[debt-deflation]].&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/07/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=10 July 2014|publisher=|via=www.nybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall in asset prices (such as subprime [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]) during 2007 and 2008 caused the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the U.S., which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities. This system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt; Struggling banks in the U.S. and Europe cut back lending causing a [[credit crunch]]. Consumers and some governments were no longer able to borrow and spend at pre-crisis levels. Businesses also cut back their investments as demand faltered and reduced their workforces. Higher unemployment due to the recession made it more difficult for consumers and countries to honor their obligations. This caused financial institution losses to surge, deepening the credit crunch, thereby creating an adverse [[feedback loop]].&lt;ref name="frbsf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2009/0416.html|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions|title=Get the Report: Conclusions : Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|website=fcic.law.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:FCIC - Housing Bubbles in Multiple Countries 2002-2008.png|thumb|300px|right|Housing price appreciation in selected countries, 2002-2008]]
[[File:US Private Debt to GDP by Sector.png|thumb|300px|right|U.S. households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing (leverage) in the years leading up to the crisis]]

The immediate or proximate cause of the crisis in 2008 was the failure or risk of failure at major financial institutions globally, starting with the rescue of investment bank [[Bear Stearns]] in March 2008 and the failure of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008. Many of these institutions had invested in risky securities that lost much or all of their value when U.S. and European housing bubbles began to deflate during the 2007-2009 period, depending on the country. Further, many institutions had become dependent on short-term (overnight) funding markets subject to disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions|title=Get the Report: Conclusions : Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|website=fcic.law.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newleftreview.org/II/50/robin-blackburn-the-subprime-crisis|title=Robin Blackburn: The Subprime Crisis. New Left Review 50, March-April 2008.|website=newleftreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of these housing bubbles involves two major factors: 1) Low interest rates in the U.S. and Europe following the 2000-2001 U.S. recession; and 2) Significant growth in savings available from developing nations due to ongoing trade imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html?_r=0|title=Opinion - Revenge of the Glut|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors drove a large increase in demand for high-yield investments. Large investment banks connected the housing markets to this large supply of savings via innovative new securities, fueling housing bubbles in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="pri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/business/giant-pool-of-money.html|title=NPR-The Giant Pool of Money-May 2008|publisher=|access-date=2013-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523054013/http://www.pri.org/stories/business/giant-pool-of-money.html#|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many institutions lowered credit standards to continue feeding the global demand for mortgage securities, generating huge profits that their investors shared. They also shared the risk. When the bubbles developed, [[household debt]] levels rose sharply after the year 2000 globally. Households became dependent on being able to refinance their mortgages. Further, U.S. households often had [[adjustable rate mortgages]], which had lower initial interest rates and payments that later rose.  When global credit markets essentially stopped funding mortgage-related investments in the 2007-2008 period, U.S. homeowners were no longer able to refinance and defaulted in record numbers, leading to the collapse of securities backed by these mortgages that now pervaded the system.&lt;ref name="pri.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/hearings/testimony/first-public-hearing|title=First Public Hearing : Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|website=fcic.law.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure rates of subprime mortgages were the first symptom of a credit boom turned to bust and of a real estate shock. But large default rates on subprime mortgages cannot account for the severity of the crisis. Rather, low-quality mortgages acted as an accelerant to the fire that spread through the entire financial system. The latter had become fragile as a result of several factors that are unique to this crisis: the transfer of assets from the balance sheets of banks to the markets, the creation of complex and opaque assets, the failure of ratings agencies to properly assess the risk of such assets, and the application of fair value [[Accounting and the late 2000's financial crisis|accounting]]. To these novel factors, one must add the now standard failure of regulators and supervisors in spotting and correcting the emerging weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fratianni, M. and Marchionne, F. 2009. ''The Role of Banks in the Subprime Financial Crisis'' available on SSRN: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1383473&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Reserve Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] testified in September 2010 regarding the causes of the crisis. He wrote that there were shocks or triggers (i.e., particular events that touched off the crisis) and vulnerabilities (i.e., structural weaknesses in the financial system, regulation and supervision) that amplified the shocks. Examples of triggers included: losses on subprime mortgage securities that began in 2007 and a [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] that began in mid-2007, which adversely affected the functioning of money markets. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''private'' sector included: financial institution dependence on unstable sources of short-term funding such as [[repurchase agreements]] or Repos; deficiencies in corporate risk management; excessive use of leverage (borrowing to invest); and inappropriate usage of derivatives as a tool for taking excessive risks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''public'' sector included: statutory gaps and conflicts between regulators; ineffective use of regulatory authority; and ineffective crisis management capabilities. Bernanke also discussed "[[Too big to fail]]" institutions, monetary policy, and trade deficits.&lt;ref name="BernankeFCIC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm |title=Bernanke-Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists surveyed by the University of Chicago rated the factors that caused the crisis in order of importance. The results included: 1) Flawed financial sector regulation and supervision; 2) Underestimating risks in financial engineering (e.g., CDOs); 3) Mortgage fraud and bad incentives; 4) Short-term funding decisions and corresponding runs in those markets (e.g., repo); and 5) Credit rating agency failures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys-special/factors-contributing-to-the-2008-global-financial-crisis? IGM Forum-Factors Contributing to 2008 Global Financial Crisis-October 17, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority report of the U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (supported by six Democrat appointees without Republican participation) reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the
crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting
recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions |title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Report-Conclusions-January 2011 |publisher=Fcic.law.stanford.edu |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narratives==
[[File:U.S. Fixed Investment as Pct GDP.png|thumb|right|350px|U.S. residential and non-residential investment fell relative to GDP during the crisis]]
There are several "narratives" attempting to place the causes of the crisis into context, with overlapping elements. Five such narratives include:
#There was the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the [[shadow banking system]], which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities. This system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt; 
#The economy was being driven by a housing bubble. When it burst, private residential investment (i.e., housing construction) fell by nearly 4%. GDP and consumption enabled by bubble-generated housing wealth also slowed. This created a gap in annual demand (GDP) of nearly $1 trillion. Government was unwilling to make up for this private sector shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/robert-samuelson-wants-people-to-be-unemployed-the-economics-of-the-economics-of-the-great-recession|title=Robert Samuelson Wants People to Be Unemployed: The Economics of the Economics of the Great Recession - Beat the Press - CEPR|first=Dean|last=Baker|website=www.cepr.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/learned-macroeconomic-helplessness/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog+Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body|title=Learned Macroeconomic Helplessness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Record levels of household debt accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a "balance sheet recession" once housing prices began falling in 2006.

[[Image:Foreclosure Trend.png|thumb|right|Number of U.S. residential properties subject to foreclosure actions by quarter (2007-2009).]]

This ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/oct2008/pi20081017_950382.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story |title=The Financial Crisis Blame Game - BusinessWeek |publisher=Businessweek.com |author1=Ben Steverman  |author2=David Bogoslaw  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=October 18, 2008&lt;!--, 12:01AM EST --&gt;|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[housing bubble]] resulted in quite a few homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out [[second mortgage]]s secured by the price appreciation.

By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/CSHomePrice_Release_112555.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12470547 |title=Economist-A Helping Hand to Homeowners |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy credit, and a belief that house prices would continue to appreciate, had encouraged many subprime borrowers to obtain [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s. These mortgages enticed borrowers with a below market interest rate for some predetermined period, followed by market interest rates for the remainder of the mortgage's term. Borrowers who could not make the higher payments once the initial grace period ended would try to refinance their mortgages. Refinancing became more difficult, once house prices began to decline in many parts of the USA.  Borrowers who found themselves unable to escape higher monthly payments by refinancing began to default. During 2007, lenders had begun foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties, a 79% increase over 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. FORECLOSURE ACTIVITY INCREASES 75 PERCENT IN 2007 | date=2008-01-29 | publisher=RealtyTrac | url=http://www.realtytrac.com/ContentManagement/pressrelease.aspx?ChannelID=9&amp;ItemID=3988&amp;accnt=64847 | accessdate=2008-06-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426034654/http://www.realtytrac.com/ContentManagement/pressrelease.aspx?ChannelID=9&amp;ItemID=3988&amp;accnt=64847# | archive-date=2008-04-26 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased to 2.3 million in 2008, an 81% increase vs. 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realtytrac.com/ContentManagement/pressrelease.aspx?ChannelID=9&amp;ItemID=5681&amp;accnt=64847 |title=RealtyTrac Press Release 2008FY |publisher=Realtytrac.com |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68F2M58kk?url=http://www.realtytrac.com/content/press-releases/foreclosure-activity-increases-81-percent-in-2008-4551?accnt=64847# |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2008, 9.2% of all mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure.&lt;ref name="mbaa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm |title=MBA Survey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514124250/http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Economist]] described the issue this way: "No part of the financial crisis has received so much attention, with so little to show for it, as the tidal wave of home foreclosures sweeping over America. Government programmes have been ineffectual, and private efforts not much better." Up to 9 million homes may enter foreclosure over the 2009-2011 period, versus one million in a typical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145396|title=Can't pay or won't pay?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly U.S. $50,000 per foreclosure according to a 2006 study by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, 9 million foreclosures represents $450 billion in losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html|title=Foreclosures (2012 Robosigning and Mortgage Servicing Settlement)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subprime lending===
[[File:U.S. Home Ownership and Subprime Origination Share.png|thumb|right|U.S. Subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004-2006]]
{{Further|Sub-prime mortgage crisis}}
[[File:Total Market Mortgages - Prime, Sub-Prime, Government Insured.jpg|thumb|GAO Historical Data]]
Based on the assumption that [[sub-prime lending]] precipitated the crisis, some{{who|date=December 2013}} have argued that the Clinton Administration may be partially to blame. This GAO chart demonstrates that [[Subprime lending|sub-prime]] and [[Subprime lending|Alt-A]] loans peaked after 2003.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In addition to easy credit conditions, there is evidence that both competitive pressures and some government regulations contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis. Major U.S. [[investment banks]] and, to a lesser extent, [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s like [[Fannie Mae]] played an important role in the expansion of higher-risk lending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/outlook/28704 AEI-The Last Trillion Dollar Commitment]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822204816/http://www.aei.org/outlook/28704 |date=2011-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency’s ’04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt|first=Stephen|last=Labaton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05fannie.html|title=Pressured to Take More Risk, Fannie Reached Tipping Point|first=Charles|last=Duhigg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Subprime lending|subprime]]'' refers to the credit quality of particular borrowers, who have weakened credit histories and a greater risk of loan default than prime borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2001/pr0901a.html|title=FDIC: Press Release PR-9-2001 01-31-2001|website=www.fdic.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of U.S. subprime mortgages was estimated at $1.3 trillion as of March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = How severe is subprime mess? | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17584725 |  work = [[msnbc.com]] | agency = Associated Press | date = 2007-03-13 | accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 7.5 million first-[[lien]] &lt;!-- lien is not a misspelling - read the article --&gt;subprime mortgages outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = The Subprime Mortgage Market | author = [[Ben S.

Subprime mortgages remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they spiked to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005-2006 peak of the [[United States housing bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/publications/markets/son2008/son2008.pdf Harvard Report-State of the Nation's Housing 2008 Report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630164105/http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/publications/markets/son2008/son2008.pdf |date=2010-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A proximate event to this increase was the April 2004 decision by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to relax the [[net capital rule]], which encouraged the largest five investment banks to dramatically increase their financial leverage and aggressively expand their issuance of mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Subprime mortgage payment delinquency rates remained in the 10-15% range from 1998 to 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/fedletter/cflaugust2007_241.pdf|title=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; then began to increase rapidly, rising to 25% by early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20080505a.htm|title=Mortgage Delinquencies and Foreclosures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/69031.htm|title=Mortgage Bankers Association - National Delinquency Survey|publisher=|access-date=2013-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115024654/http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/69031.htm#|archive-date=2013-11-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mortgage underwriting====
In addition to considering higher-risk borrowers, lenders offered increasingly risky loan options and borrowing incentives.
[[Mortgage underwriting]] standards declined gradually during the boom period, particularly from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref name = "Simkovic"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of automated loan approvals let loans be made without appropriate review and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bank Systems &amp; Technology | url = http://www.banktech.com/story/featured/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=21401117 | accessdate = 2008-05-19 | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68F34dKHJ?url=http://www.banktech.com/business-intelligence/21401117 | archivedate = 2012-06-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 40% of all subprime loans resulted from automated underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lynnley Browning |title=The Subprime Loan Machine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/business/23speed.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin |work=nytimes.com |publisher= Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.|location=New York City |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2008-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = REALTOR Magazine-Daily News-Are Computers to Blame for Bad Lending? | url=http://www.realtor.org/rmodaily.nsf/f3c66d0c6457c1e1862570af000cb13b/b187c47b7d488dd8862572a7004ec179?OpenDocument | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association claimed that mortgage brokers, while profiting from the home loan boom, did not do enough to examine whether borrowers could repay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brokers, bankers play subprime blame game - Real estate - MSNBC.com | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18804054/ | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mortgage fraud]] by lenders and borrowers increased enormously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13view.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Tyler+Cowen&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin |title=So We Thought.

A study by analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that the average difference between subprime and prime mortgage interest rates (the "subprime markup") declined significantly between 2001 and 2007. The quality of loans originated also worsened gradually during that period. The combination of declining risk premia and credit standards is common to boom and bust [[credit cycle]]s. The authors also concluded that the decline in underwriting standards did not directly trigger the crisis, because the gradual changes in standards did not statistically account for the large difference in default rates for subprime mortgages issued between 2001-2005 (which had a 10% default rate within one year of origination) and 2006-2007 (which had a 20% rate). In other words, standards gradually declined but defaults suddenly jumped. Furthermore, the authors argued that the trend in worsening loan quality was harder to detect with rising housing prices, as more refinancing options were available, keeping the default rate lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2009/0509.cfm Demyanyk-Ten Myths About Subprime Mortgages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605034710/http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2009/0509.cfm |date=2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ssrn.com-1020396"&gt;

====Mortgage fraud====
In 2004, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] warned of an "epidemic" in mortgage fraud, an important credit risk of non-prime mortgage lending, which, they said, could lead to "a problem that could have as much impact as the S&amp;L crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/09/17/mortgage.fraud/|title=CNN.com - FBI warns of mortgage fraud 'epidemic'  - Sep 17, 2004|first=From Terry Frieden CNN Washington|last=Bureau|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel05/quickflip121405.htm FBI Press Release on "Operation Quickflip"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830053824/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel05/quickflip121405.htm |date=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/25/business/fi-mortgagefraud25|title=FBI saw threat of loan crisis|first=Richard B.|last=Schmitt|date=25 August 2008|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-k-black/the-two-documents-everyon_b_169813.html|title=The Two Documents Everyone Should Read to Better Understand the Crisis|first=William K.|last=Black|date=28 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Down payments and negative equity====
A [[down payment]] refers to the cash paid to the lender for the home and represents the initial homeowners' equity or financial interest in the home. A low down payment means that a home represents a highly leveraged investment for the homeowner, with little equity relative to debt. In such circumstances, only small declines in the value of the home result in [[negative equity]], a situation in which the value of the home is less than the mortgage amount owed. In 2005, the median down payment for first-time home buyers was 2%, with 43% of those buyers making no down payment whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Knox | first = Noelle | title = 43% of first-time home buyers put no money down |  publisher = [[USA Today]]| date = 2006-01-17  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/housing/2006-01-17-real-estate-usat_x.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, China has down payment requirements that exceed 20%, with higher amounts for non-primary residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgpropertypress.wordpress.com/2007/09/19/china-to-raise-downpayment-for-second-homes-sources/ |title=China Down Payment Requirements |publisher=Sgpropertypress.wordpress.com |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] wrote in Forbes in July 2009 that: "Home prices have already fallen from their peak by about 30%. Based on my analysis, they are going to fall by at least 40% from their peak, and more likely 45%, before they bottom out. They are still falling at an annualized rate of over 18%. That fall of at least 40%-45% percent of home prices from their peak is going to imply that about half of all households that have a mortgage—about 25 million of the 51 million that have mortgages—are going to be underwater with [[negative equity]] and will have a significant incentive to walk away from their homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/jobs-report-mortgages-unemployment-recession-opinions-columnists-nouriel-roubini.html|title=Brown Manure, Not Green Shoots|first=Nouriel|last=Roubini|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Stan Leibowitz]] argued in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that the extent of equity in the home was the key factor in foreclosure, rather than the type of loan, credit worthiness of the borrower, or ability to pay. Although only 12% of homes had negative equity (meaning the property was worth less than the mortgage obligation), they comprised 47% of foreclosures during the second half of 2008. Homeowners with negative equity have less financial incentive to stay in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124657539489189043|title=New Evidence on the Foreclosure Crisis|first=Stan|last=Liebowitz|date=4 July 2009|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''L.A. Times'' reported the results of a study that found homeowners with high credit scores at the time of entering a mortgage are 50% more likely to "[[strategic default|strategically default]]" - abruptly and intentionally pull the plug and abandon the mortgage — compared with lower-scoring borrowers. Such strategic defaults were heavily concentrated in markets with the highest price declines. An estimated 588,000 strategic defaults occurred nationwide during 2008, more than double the total in 2007. They represented 18% of all serious delinquencies that extended for more than 60 days in the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/news/la-fi-harney20-2009sep20,0,6741264,print.story|title=LA Times-Homeowners who strategically default a growing problem-September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Predatory lending====
Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, to enter into "unsafe" or "unsound" secured loans for inappropriate purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/docs/reports/predlend/occ.htm|title=Letter from the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Predatory Lending&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A classic [[bait-and-switch]] method was used by Countrywide, advertising low interest rates for home refinancing.  Such loans were written into mind-numbingly detailed contracts and then swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing.  Whereas the advertisement might have stated that 1% or 1.5% interest would be charged, the consumer would be put into an [[adjustable rate mortgage]] (ARM) in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid.  This created [[negative amortization]], which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated.

Countrywide, sued by California Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] for "Unfair Business Practices" and "False Advertising" was making high cost mortgages "to homeowners with weak credit, adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkdebtrelief.com/debt-relief-blog/money-news/bofa-modifies-64000-home-loans-as-part-of-predatory-lending-settlement/ BofA Modifies 64,000 Home Loans as Part of Predatory Lending Settlement | Debt Relief Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024100929/http://thinkdebtrelief.com/debt-relief-blog/money-news/bofa-modifies-64000-home-loans-as-part-of-predatory-lending-settlement/ |date=2009-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared.  This caused Countrywide's financial condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in a decision by the Office of Thrift Supervision to seize the lender.

Countrywide, according to Republican Lawmakers, had involved itself in making low-cost loans to politicians, for purposes of gaining political favors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicans.oversight.house.gov/media/pdfs/20090319FriendsofAngelo.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826093141/http://republicans.oversight.house.gov/media/pdfs/20090319FriendsofAngelo.pdf |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former employees from [[Ameriquest]], which was United States's leading wholesale lender,&lt;ref name="RoadToRuinMayANP09"/&gt; described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits.&lt;ref name="RoadToRuinMayANP09"/&gt; There is growing evidence that such [[mortgage fraud]]s may be a large cause of the crisis.&lt;ref name="RoadToRuinMayANP09"&gt;''[http://therealnews.com/id/3708/May13,2009/Road+to+Ruin%3A+Mortgage+Fraud+Scandal+Brewing Road to Ruin: Mortgage Fraud Scandal Brewing]'' May 13, 2009 by [[American News Project]] hosted by [[The Real News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed to the passage of the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] by the [[106th United States Congress|106th Congress]], and over-leveraging by banks and investors eager to achieve high returns on capital.

==Risk-taking behavior==
In a June 2009 speech, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] argued that a "culture of irresponsibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/06/17/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5093760.shtml|title=Obama On Fixing "Culture Of Irresponsibility"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an important cause of the crisis. He criticized executive compensation that "rewarded recklessness rather than responsibility" and Americans who bought homes "without accepting the responsibilities."  He continued that there "was far too much debt and not nearly enough capital in the system. And a growing economy bred complacency."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive consumer housing debt was in turn caused by the [[mortgage-backed security]], [[credit default swap]], and [[collateralized debt obligation]] sub-sectors of the [[finance industry]], which were offering irrationally low interest rates and irrationally high levels of approval to [[subprime mortgage]] consumers. Formulas for calculating aggregate risk were based on the [[gaussian copula]] which wrongly assumed that individual components of mortgages were independent. In fact the credit-worthiness of almost every new subprime mortgage was highly correlated with that of any other, due to linkages through consumer spending levels which fell sharply when property values began to fall during the initial wave of mortgage defaults.&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix|title=Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly 1–33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Catherine|author2=Paul Embrechts|title=The devil is in the tails: actuarial mathematics and the subprime mortgage crisis|journal=ASTIN Bulletin|date=January 4, 2010|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1–33|url=http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/preprints/2010-5.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt consumers were acting in their rational self-interest, because they were unable to audit the finance industry's opaque faulty risk pricing methodology.&lt;ref name="Bielecki 2011 437–456"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bielecki|first=Tomasz R.|title=Credit Risk Frontiers: Subprime Crisis, Pricing and Hedging, CVA, MBS, Ratings, and Liquidity|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|pages=437–456|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118531839.ch13/summary|author2=Damiano Brigo |author3=Fédéric Patras |editor=Tomasz R.

A key theme of the crisis is that many large financial institutions did not have a sufficient financial cushion to absorb the losses they sustained or to support the commitments made to others. Using technical terms, these firms were highly [[leverage (finance)|leveraged]] (i.e., they maintained a high ratio of debt to equity) or had insufficient [[financial capital|capital]] to post as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for their borrowing. A key to a stable financial system is that firms have the financial capacity to support their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12813430|title=Banks need more capital|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] and [[David Einhorn (hedge fund manager)|David Einhorn]] argued: "The most critical role for regulation is to make sure that the sellers of risk have the capital to support their bets."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/opinion/04lewiseinhornb.html|title=Opinion - How to Repair a Broken Financial World|first=Michael Lewis and David|last=Einhorn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer and household borrowing===
U.S. households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or [[financial leverage|overleveraged]] during the years preceding the crisis. This increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn.
*USA household debt as a percentage of annual [[disposable personal income]] was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990.&lt;ref name="The End of the Affair"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12637090 |title=The End of the Affair |publisher=Economist |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*U.S. home mortgage debt relative to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/05/27/news/mortgage.overhang.fortune/index.htm|title=The $4 trillion housing headache - May. 27, 2009|first=By Colin Barr, senior|last=writer|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several economists and think tanks have argued that [[income inequality]] is one of the reasons for this over-leveraging. The ''New York Times'' reported in October 2012 that research by the Brookings Institution, the I.M.F. and dozens of economists at top research universities indicated that starting in the 1970s, earnings were squeezed for low- and middle-income households. They borrowed to improve their standards of living, buying bigger houses than they could afford and using those houses as piggy banks. Research by [[Raghuram Rajan]] indicated that: "Starting in the early 1970s, advanced economies found it increasingly difficult to grow...the shortsighted political response to the anxieties of those falling behind was to ease their access to credit. Faced with little regulatory restraint, banks overdosed on risky loans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/business/economy/income-inequality-may-take-toll-on-growth.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Income Inequality May Take Toll on Growth|first=Annie|last=Lowrey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excessive private debt levels==
[[File:U.S. Household Debt Relative to Disposable Income and GDP.png|thumb|350px|U.S. household debt relative to disposable income and GDP.]]
To counter the 2000 Stock Market Crash and subsequent economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve eased credit availability and drove interest rates down to lows not seen in many decades. These low interest rates facilitated the growth of debt at all levels of the economy, chief among them private debt to purchase more expensive housing. High levels of debt have long been recognized as a causative factor for recessions.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Fisher The Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions "the above named factors have played a subordinate role as compared with two dominant factors, namely over-indebtedness to start with and deflation following soon after" and "I have, at present, a strong conviction that these two economic maladies, the debt disease and the price-level disease, are...more important causes then all others put together."&lt;/ref&gt; Any debt default has the possibility of causing the lender to also default, if the lender is itself in a weak financial condition and has too much debt. This second default in turn can lead to still further defaults through a [[domino effect]]. The chances of these follow-up defaults is increased at high levels of debt. Attempts to prevent this domino effect by bailing out Wall Street lenders such as AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac have had mixed success. The takeover is another example of attempts to stop the dominoes from falling.There was a real irony in the recent intervention by the Federal Reserve System to provide the money that enabled the firm of JPMorgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns before it went bankrupt. The point was to try to prevent a domino effect of panic in the financial markets that could lead to a downturn in the economy.

Excessive consumer housing debt was in turn caused by the [[mortgage-backed security]], [[credit default swap]], and [[collateralized debt obligation]] sub-sectors of the [[finance industry]], which were offering irrationally low interest rates and irrationally high levels of approval to [[subprime mortgage]] consumers because they were calculating aggregate risk using [[gaussian copula]] formulas that strictly assumed the independence of individual component mortgages, when in fact the credit-worthiness almost every new subprime mortgage was highly correlated with that of any other because of linkages through consumer spending levels which fell sharply when property values began to fall during the initial wave of mortgage defaults.&lt;ref name="Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly 1–33"/&gt; Debt consumers were acting in their rational self-interest, because they were unable to audit the finance industry's opaque faulty risk pricing methodology.&lt;ref name="Bielecki 2011 437–456"/&gt;

According to M.S. Eccles, who was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve by FDR and held that position until 1948, excessive debt levels were not a source cause of the Great Depression. Increasing debt levels were caused by a concentration of wealth during the 1920s, causing the middle and poorer classes, which saw a relative and/or actual decrease in wealth, to go increasingly into debt in an attempt to maintain or improve their living standards. According to Eccles this concentration of wealth was the source cause of the Great Depression. The ever-increasing debt levels eventually became unpayable, and therefore unsustainable, leading to debt defaults and the financial panics of the 1930s. The concentration of wealth in the modern era parallels that of the 1920s and has had similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;Aftershock The Next Economy and America's Future by Robert B. Reich 2010, Chapter 1 Eccles's Insight.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the causes of [[wealth concentration]] in the modern era are lower tax rates for the rich, such as Warren Buffett paying taxes at a lower rate than the people working for him,&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/01/warren-buffett-and-his-secretary-talk-taxes/  "I just feel like an average citizen. I represent the average citizen who needs a voice," said Bosanek. "Everybody in our office is paying a higher tax rate than Warren." {{Dead link |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; policies such as propping up the stock market, which benefit the stock owning rich more than the middle or poorer classes who own little or no stock, and bailouts which funnel tax money collected largely from the middle class to bail out large corporations largely owned by the rich.

The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reported in April 2012: "Household debt soared in the years leading up to the [[Great Recession]]. In advanced economies, during the five years preceding 2007, the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points, to 138 percent. In Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income. A surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. The concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable, which masked households’ growing exposure to a sharp fall in asset prices. When house prices declined, ushering in the global financial crisis, many households saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt, and, with less income and more unemployment, found it harder to meet mortgage payments. By the end of 2011, real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41% in Ireland, 29% in Iceland, 23% in Spain and the United States, and 21% in Denmark. Household defaults, underwater mortgages (where the loan balance exceeds the house value), foreclosures, and fire sales are now endemic to a number of economies. Household [[deleveraging]] by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries. It has been most pronounced in the United States, where about two-thirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/pdf/c3.pdf|title=IMF-Report Extract Chapter 3 – April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update|title=Page not found|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|access-date=2013-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307011351/http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update#|archive-date=2013-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home equity extraction===
This refers to homeowners borrowing and spending against the value of their homes, typically via a home equity loan or when selling the home. Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion over the period, contributing to economic growth worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200720/200720pap.pdf|title=Greenspan Kennedy Report - Table 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/33336-home-equity-extraction-the-real-cost-of-free-cash|title=Home Equity Extraction: The Real Cost of 'Free Cash'|first=Tim|last=Iacono|date=25 April 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2330071920070423|title=Spending boosted by home equity loans: Greenspan|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"/&gt;

Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] explained that the economy was highly dependent on this home equity extraction: "In the 1993-1997 period, home owners extracted an amount of equity from their homes equivalent to 2.3% to 3.8% GDP. By 2005, this figure had increased to 11.5% GDP."&lt;ref name="TCowen2011"&gt;{{cite book

===Housing speculation===
Speculative borrowing in residential real estate has been cited as a contributing factor to the subprime mortgage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = H. P. Minsky, 77, Economist Who Decoded Lending Trends | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/26/us/h-p-minsky-77-economist-who-decoded-lending-trends.html | author = Louis Uchitelle | authorlink = Louis Uchitelle  | publisher = New York Times | date = October 26, 1996| accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2006, 22% of homes purchased (1.65 million units) were for investment purposes, with an additional 14% (1.07 million units) purchased as vacation homes. During 2005, these figures were 28% and 12%, respectively. In other words, a record level of nearly 40% of homes purchases were not intended as primary residences. David Lereah, [[National Association of Realtors|NAR]]'s chief economist at the time, stated that the 2006 decline in investment buying was expected: "Speculators left the market in 2006, which caused investment sales to fall much faster than the primary market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/30/real_estate/speculators_fleeing_housing_markets/index.htm|title=Speculation statistics | work=CNN | date=2007-04-30 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first1=Les | last1=Christie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006, a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation. While homes had not traditionally been treated as investments subject to speculation, this behavior changed during the housing boom. Media widely reported condominiums being purchased while under construction, then being "flipped" (sold) for a profit without the seller ever having lived in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local10.com/news/4277615/detail.html|title=Speculative flipping|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926235236/http://www.local10.com/news/4277615/detail.html|archivedate=2011-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mortgage companies identified risks inherent in this activity as early as 2005, after identifying investors assuming highly leveraged positions in multiple properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtpages/20050321_tighterrules.htm|title=Speculation Risks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F2tIuVT?url=http://realtytimes.com/rtpages/20050321_tighterrules.htm|archivedate=2012-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2017 NBER study argued that real estate investors (i.e., those owning 2+ homes) were more to blame for the crisis than subprime borrowers: "The rise in mortgage defaults during the crisis was concentrated in the middle of the credit score distribution, and mostly attributable to real estate investors" and that "credit growth between 2001 and 2007 was concentrated in the prime segment, and debt to high-risk [subprime] borrowers was virtually constant for all debt categories during this period." The authors argued that this investor-driven narrative was more accurate than blaming the crisis on lower-income, subprime borrowers.&lt;ref name="NBER23740"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stefania |last=Albanesi |first2=Giacomo |last2=De Giorgi |first3=Jaromir |last3=Nosal |title=Credit Growth and the Financial Crisis: A New Narrative |work=NBER Working Paper No. 23740 |date=August 2017 |doi=10.3386/w23740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Fed study had a similar finding: "In states that experienced the largest housing booms and busts, at the peak of the market almost half of purchase mortgage originations were associated with investors. In part by apparently misreporting their intentions to occupy the property, investors took on more leverage, contributing to higher rates of default." The Fed study reported that mortgage originations to investors rose from 25% in 2000 to 45% in 2006, for Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada overall, where housing price increases during the bubble (and declines in the bust) were most pronounced. In these states, investor delinquency rose from around 15% in 2000 to over 35% in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FRBNY2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr514.pdf|title=FRBNY-Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and Klaauw-Real Estate Investors, the Leverage Cycle, and the Housing Market Crisis-September 2011-See page 18 and Figures 3 and 11|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicole Gelinas of the [[Manhattan Institute]] described the negative consequences of not adjusting tax and mortgage policies to the shifting treatment of a home from conservative inflation hedge to speculative investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2008/eon1029ng.html|title=Sheltering Speculation|date=23 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Robert Shiller]] argued that speculative bubbles are fueled by "contagious optimism, seemingly impervious to facts, that often takes hold when prices are rising. Bubbles are primarily social phenomena; until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them, they're going to keep forming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crook |first=Clive |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/housing |title=Shiller-Infectious Exuberance-The Atlantic |publisher=Theatlantic.com |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortgage risks were underestimated by every institution in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices given historical trends of rising prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reckless Optimism|last=Samuelson|first=Robert J.|journal=Claremont Review of Books|volume=XII|issue=1|year=2011|page=13|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1916/article_detail.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113222/http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1916/article_detail.asp|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kourlas|first=James|title=Lessons Not Learned From the Housing Crisis|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/brc/lessons-housing-crisis|date=April 12, 2012|publisher=The Atlas Society|accessdate=Nov 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misplaced confidence in innovation and excessive optimism led to miscalculations by both public and private institutions.

===Pro-cyclical human nature===
Keynesian economist [[Hyman Minsky]] described how speculative borrowing contributed to rising debt and an eventual collapse of asset values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/story/2787 |title=Does the Current Financial Crisis Vindicate the Economics of Hyman Minsky? - Frank Shostak - Mises Institute |publisher=Mises.org |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist [[Paul McCulley]] described how Minsky's hypothesis translates to the current crisis, using Minsky's words: "...from time to time, capitalist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which seem to have the potential to spin out of control. In such processes, the economic system's reactions to a movement of the economy amplify the movement--inflation feeds upon inflation and debt-deflation feeds upon debt deflation." In other words, people are momentum investors by nature, not value investors. People naturally take actions that expand the apex and nadir of cycles. One implication for policymakers and regulators is the implementation of counter-cyclical policies, such as contingent capital requirements for banks that increase during boom periods and are reduced during busts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.pimco-global.com/pdfs/pdf/GCB%20Focus%20May%2009.pdf?WT.cg_n=PIMCO-US&amp;WT.ti=GCB%20Focus%20May%2009.pdf|title=McCulley-PIMCO-The Shadow Banking System and Hyman Minsky's Economic Journey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate risk-taking and leverage===
[[File:Leverage ratios for major investment banks.svg|thumb|300px|Leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007.]]

The former CEO of [[Citigroup]] [[Charles O. Prince]] said in November 2007: "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance." This metaphor summarized how financial institutions took advantage of easy credit conditions, by borrowing and investing large sums of money, a practice called leveraged lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/citi-chief-on-buyout-loans-were-still-dancing/|title=DealBook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt taken on by financial institutions increased from 63.8% of U.S. [[gross domestic product]] in 1997 to 113.8% in 2007.&lt;ref name="newleftreview.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?getpdf=NLR28403&amp;pdflang=en|title=New Left Review 110|website=www.newleftreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Net capital rule]]====
A 2004 SEC decision related to the [[net capital rule]] allowed USA investment banks to issue substantially more debt, which was then used to help fund the housing bubble through purchases of mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's ’04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt, and Risk | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-10-03 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in regulation left the capital adequacy requirement at the same level but added a ''risk weighting'' that lowered capital requirements on AAA rated bonds and tranches. This led to a shift from first loss tranches to highly rated less risky tranches and was seen as an improvement in risk management in the spirit of the European [[Basel accords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Unintended Consequences| author=Edward Conard |year=2012 |publisher=Penguin |pages=145–155 |isbn=978-1470823573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004-07, the top five U.S. investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage (see diagram), which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock. These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of USA nominal GDP for 2007. [[Lehman Brothers]] was liquidated, [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] were sold at fire-sale prices, and [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] became commercial banks, subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation. With the exception of Lehman, these companies required or received government support.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

[[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], two U.S. [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s, owned or guaranteed nearly $5 trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into [[conservatorship]] by the U.S. government in September 2008.&lt;ref name="publications1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.28704/pub_detail.asp |title=AEI-The Last Trillion Dollar Commitment |publisher=Aei.org |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226211908/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.28704/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }} American Enterprise Institute is a conservative organization with a right- of-center political agenda .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=adr.czwVm3ws&amp;refer=home |title=Bloomberg-U.S. Considers Bringing Fannie &amp; Freddie Onto Budget |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525071928/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109 |archivedate=2010-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9 trillion in debt or guarantee obligations, an enormous concentration of risk, yet were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks.

In a May 2008 speech, [[Ben Bernanke]] quoted [[Walter Bagehot]]: "A good banker will have accumulated in ordinary times the reserve he is to make use of in extraordinary times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080513.htm|title=Liquidity Provision by the Federal Reserve|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this advice was not heeded by these institutions, which had used the boom times to increase their leverage ratio instead.

====[[Perverse incentive]]s====

The theory of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism suggests that financial institutions would be risk-averse because failure would result in [[liquidation]]. But the Federal Reserve's 1984 rescue of [[Continental Illinois]] and the 1998 rescue of the [[Long-Term Capital Management]] [[hedge fund]], among others, showed that institutions which failed to exercise [[due diligence]] could reasonably expect to be protected from the consequences of their mistakes. The belief that they [[too big to fail|would not be allowed to fail]] created a [[moral hazard]], which allegedly contributed to the late-2000s recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

However, even without the [[too big to fail]] syndrome, the short-term structure of [[Executive pay|compensation packages]] creates [[perverse incentive]]s for executives to maximize the short-term performance of their companies at the expense of the long term.  [[William K. Black]] developed the concept of [[control fraud]] to describe executives who pervert good business rules to transfer substantial wealth to themselves from shareholders and customers.  Their companies may report phenomenal profits in the short term only to lose substantial amounts of money when their [[Ponzi scheme]]s finally collapse.  Some of the individuals Black described were prosecuted for fraud, but many are allowed to keep their wealth with little more than a public rebuke that seems to have little impact on their future.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eileen Foster]] was fired as a Vice President of [[Bank of America]] for trying too hard to inform her managers of systematic fraud in their [[Bank of America Home Loans|home loans]] unit.

==Financial market factors==

In its "Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy," dated 15 November 2008, leaders of the [[G-20 major economies|Group of 20]] cited the following causes related to features of the modern financial markets:
{{quote|During a period of strong global growth, growing capital flows, and prolonged stability earlier this decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.&lt;ref name="Declaration of G20"/&gt;}}

===Financial product innovation===

[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|250px|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]
The term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]];&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;  and a form of credit insurance called [[credit default swaps]](CDS).&lt;ref name = "Secret Liens"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"], American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004|title=Betting on the Blind Side|first=Michael|last=Lewis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDO in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. Approximately $1.6 trillion in CDO's were originated between 2003-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2715|title=Robin Blackburn: The Subprime Crisis. New Left Review 50, March-April 2008.|website=www.newleftreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CDO essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool, from which the cash is allocated to specific securities in a priority sequence. Those securities obtaining cash first received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies. Lower priority securities received cash thereafter, with lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/11/24/magazines/fortune/eavis_cdo.fortune/index.htm|title=CDOs explained - Nov. 25, 2007|first=By Peter Eavis, senior|last=writer|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfolio.com/interactive-features/2007/12/cdo Portfolio-CDO Explained]&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of 735 CDO deals originated between 1999 and 2007 showed that subprime and other less-than-prime mortgages represented an increasing percentage of CDO assets, rising from 5% in 2000 to 36% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009-Cited by Michael Lewis in "The Big Short"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with this innovation or understand its impact on the overall stability of the financial system.&lt;ref name="Declaration of G20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html |title=Declaration of G20 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. The average recovery rate for "high quality" CDOs has been approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for mezzanine CDO's has been approximately five cents for every dollar. These massive, practically unthinkable, losses have dramatically impacted the balance sheets of banks across the globe, leaving them with very little capital to continue operations.&lt;ref name="TPMBLOG1"&gt;[http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php paulw's Blog | Talking Points Memo | The power of belief&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php |date=2009-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. In an article in Portfolio Magazine, [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] spoke with one trader who noted that "There weren’t enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors’ appetite for the end product." Essentially, [[investment banks]] and [[hedge funds]] used [[financial innovation]] to synthesize more loans using [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. "They were creating [loans] out of whole cloth. One hundred times over! That’s why the losses are so much greater than the loans."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael. (November 11, 2008).

Princeton professor Harold James wrote that one of the byproducts of this innovation was that MBS and other financial assets were "repackaged so thoroughly and resold so often that it became impossible to clearly connect the thing being traded to its underlying value." He called this a "...profound flaw at the core of the U.S. financial system..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63590/harold-james/fixing-global-finance|title=Fixing Global Finance|date=27 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example relates to [[AIG]], which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;  The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. U.S. taxpayers provided over $180 billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&amp;refer=home |title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525071928/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109 |archivedate=2010-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_859460.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=Business Week-Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] wrote that CDS enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage bonds and CDO's. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS insurance were betting that significant defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as [[AIG]]) bet they would not.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;  In addition, Chicago Public Radio and the ''Huffington Post'' reported in April 2010 that market participants, including a hedge fund called [[Magnetar Capital]], encouraged the creation of CDO's containing low quality mortgages, so they could bet against them using CDS. NPR reported that Magnetar encouraged investors to purchase CDO's while simultaneously betting against them, without disclosing the latter bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/yves-smith/rahm-emanuel-and-magnetar_b_535827.html|title=Rahm Emanuel and Magnetar Capital: The Definition of Compromised|first=Yves|last=Smith|date=13 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/405/inside-job|title=Inside Job - This American Life|date=9 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inaccurate credit ratings ===
{{Main article|Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis}}
[[Image:MBS Downgrades Chart.png|thumb|MBS credit rating downgrades, by quarter.]]

[[Credit rating agencies]] are under scrutiny for having given investment-grade ratings to [[Mortgage-backed security|MBS]]s based on risky subprime mortgage loans. These high ratings enabled these MBS to be sold to investors, thereby financing the housing boom. These ratings were believed justified because of risk reducing practices, such as credit default insurance and equity investors willing to bear the first losses.{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} However, there are also indications that some involved in rating subprime-related securities knew at the time that the rating process was faulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US House of Representatives Committee on Government Oversight and Reform |title=Committee Holds Hearing on the Credit Rating Agencies and the Financial Crisis |date=22 October 2008 |url=http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2250 |accessdate=23 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023033623/http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2250 |archivedate=October 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homeowners with bad credit and undocumented incomes (e.g., subprime or [[Alt-A]] mortgages) between 2002 and 2007. Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] stated: "I view the rating agencies as one of the key culprits...They were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies." Without the AAA ratings, demand for these securities would have been considerably less. Bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion as of September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s Bloomberg-Smith-Bringing Down Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603213309/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109 |date=2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ax3vfya_Vtdo Bloomberg-Smith-Race to Bottom at Rating Agencies Secured Subprime Boom, Bust]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603213309/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109 |date=2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings of these securities was a lucrative business for the rating agencies, accounting for just under half of [[Moody's]] total ratings revenue in 2007. Through 2007, ratings companies enjoyed record revenue, profits and share prices. The rating companies earned as much as three times more for grading these complex products than corporate bonds, their traditional business. Rating agencies also competed with each other to rate particular MBS and CDO securities issued by investment banks, which critics argued contributed to lower rating standards. Interviews with rating agency senior managers indicate the competitive pressure to rate the CDO's favorably was strong within the firms. This rating business was their "golden goose" (which laid the proverbial golden egg or wealth) in the words of one manager.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt; Author [[Upton Sinclair]] (1878–1968) famously stated: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/34069.html|title=The Quotations Page: Quote from Upton Sinclair|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000-2006, structured finance (which includes CDO's) accounted for 40% of the revenues of the credit rating agencies. During that time, one major rating agency had its stock increase six-fold and its earnings grew by 900%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/446/index.html|title=Credit and Credibility . NOW on PBS|first=NOW on|last=PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics allege that the rating agencies suffered from conflicts of interest, as they were paid by investment banks and other firms that organize and sell structured securities to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9769471 | title=Buttonwood &amp;#124; Credit and blame &amp;#124; Economist.com | publisher=Economist.com | date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] proposed rules designed to mitigate perceived conflicts of interest between rating agencies and issuers of structured securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SEC Proposes Comprehensive Reforms to Bring Increased Transparency to Credit Rating Process | publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-110.htm | accessdate=July 2008 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December 2008, the SEC approved measures to strengthen oversight of credit rating agencies, following a ten-month investigation that found "significant weaknesses in ratings practices," including conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-284.htm |title=SEC - Rating Agency Rules |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Q3 2007 and Q2 2008, rating agencies lowered the credit ratings on $1.9 trillion in [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]. Financial institutions felt they had to lower the value of their MBS and acquire additional capital so as to maintain capital ratios. If this involved the sale of new shares of stock, the value of the existing shares was reduced. Thus ratings downgrades lowered the stock prices of many financial firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/04/magazines/fortune/whitney_feature.fortune/index.htm | title=The woman who called Wall Street's meltdown | work=Fortune | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Jon | last=Birger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of transparency in the system and independence in financial modeling===

The limitations of many, widely used financial models also were not properly understood (see for example &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/the-financial-crisis-why-did-it-happen/ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304024927/http://moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/the-financial-crisis-why-did-it-happen/ | archivedate=2009-03-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felix1"&gt;{{Citation | last = Salmon | first = Felix | publication-date = 2009-02-23 | title = Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street | magazine = Wired Magazine | issue = 17.03 | url = https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant | accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[David X. Li|Li]]'s [[Gaussian copula]] formula assumed that the price of CDS was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage backed securities. Because it was highly tractable, it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of CDO and CDS investors, issuers, and rating agencies.&lt;ref name="Felix1" /&gt; According to one wired.com article:&lt;ref name="Felix1" /&gt; "Then the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of Li's formula hadn't expected. The cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008—when ruptures in the financial system's foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril... Li's Gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees."

As financial assets became more complex, less transparent, and harder and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that both international [[bond rating]] agencies and bank regulators, who came to rely on them, accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they turned out to be.&lt;ref name=RISKS1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/25assess.html?hp Floyd Norris (2008). ''News Analysis: Another Crisis, Another Guarantee'', The New York Times, November 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Soros]] commented that "The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. Similarly, the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products. It was a shocking abdication of responsibility." &lt;ref name=WORSTCRISIS&gt;{{Citation | last = Soros | first = George | author-link = George Soros | publication-date = January 22, 2008 | title = The worst market crisis in 60 years | newspaper = Financial Times | publication-place = London, UK | pages = | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24f73610-c91e-11dc-9807-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1 | accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-balance-sheet financing===

Complex financing structures called [[structured investment vehicles]] (SIV) or conduits enabled banks to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities, including unsold CDO's, off their books.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;  This had the effect of helping the banks maintain regulatory minimum [[capital requirement|capital ratios]]. They were then able to lend anew, earning additional fees. Author [[Robin Blackburn]] explained how they worked:&lt;ref name="newleftreview.org"/&gt; {{quote|Institutional investors could be persuaded to buy the SIV's supposedly high-quality, short-term [[commercial paper]], allowing the vehicles to acquire longer-term, lower quality assets, and generating a profit on the spread between the two. The latter included larger amounts of mortgages, credit-card debt, student loans and other receivables...For about five years those dealing in SIV's and conduits did very well by exploiting the spread...but this disappeared in August 2007, and the banks were left holding a very distressed baby.}} Off balance sheet financing also made firms look less leveraged and enabled them to borrow at cheaper rates.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;

Banks had established automatic lines of credit to these SIV and conduits. When the cash flow into the SIV's began to decline as subprime defaults mounted, banks were contractually obligated to provide cash to these structures and their investors. This "conduit-related balance sheet pressure" placed strain on the banks' ability to lend, both raising interbank lending rates and reducing the availability of funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/usmpf2008confdraft.pdf Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, Shin-Leveraged Losses-Paper-February 2008] {{Dead link |date=April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years leading up to the crisis, the top four U.S. depository banks moved an estimated $5.2 trillion in assets and liabilities [[off-balance sheet]] into these SIV's and conduits. This enabled them to essentially bypass existing regulations regarding minimum capital ratios, thereby increasing leverage and profits during the boom but increasing losses during the crisis. Accounting guidance was changed in 2009 that will require them to put some of these assets back onto their books, which significantly reduces their capital ratios. One news agency estimated this amount at between $500 billion and $1 trillion. This effect was considered as part of the stress tests performed by the government during 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=akv_p6LBNIdw&amp;refer=home Bloomberg-Banks $1 trillion purge]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8NdlMR?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=akv_p6LBNIdw&amp;refer=home |date=2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During March 2010, the bankruptcy court examiner released a report on [[Lehman Brothers]], which had failed spectacularly in September 2008. The report indicated that up to $50 billion was moved off-balance sheet in a questionable manner by management during 2008, with the effect of making its debt level (leverage ratio) appear smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/business/12lehman.html|title=Lehman Brothers Hid Borrowing, Examiner Says|first=Michael J. de la Merced and Andrew Ross|last=Sorkin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicated big banks mask their risk levels just prior to reporting data quarterly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304830104575172280848939898|title=Big Banks Mask Risk Levels|first1=Kate|last1=Kelly|first2=Tom|last2=McGinty|first3=Dan|last3=Fitzpatrick|date=9 April 2010|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory avoidance===

Certain financial innovation may also have the effect of circumventing regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks. For example, [[Martin Wolf]] wrote in June 2009: "...an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade – the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself – was to find a way round regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial sector concentration===

[[Niall Ferguson]] wrote that the financial sector became increasingly concentrated in the years leading up to the crisis, which made the stability of the financial system more reliant on just a few firms, which were also highly leveraged:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/215178|title=A Year After the Financial Crash by Niall Ferguson|date=10 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Between 1990 and 2008, according to Wall Street veteran Henry Kaufman, the share of financial assets held by the 10 largest U.S. financial institutions rose from 10 percent to 50 percent, even as the number of banks fell from more than 15,000 to about 8,000. By the end of 2007, 15 institutions with combined shareholder equity of $857 billion had total assets of $13.6 trillion and off-balance-sheet commitments of $5.8 trillion—a total leverage ratio of 23 to 1. They also had underwritten derivatives with a gross notional value of $216 trillion. These firms had once been Wall Street's "bulge bracket," the companies that led underwriting syndicates. Now they did more than bulge. These institutions had become so big that the failure of just one of them would pose a systemic risk.}}

By contrast, some scholars have argued that fragmentation in the mortgage securitization market led to increased risk taking and a deterioration in underwriting standards.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

===Failure to regulate non-depository banking===
The [[Shadow banking system]] grew to exceed the size of the depository system, but was not subject to the same requirements and protections. Nobel laureate [[Paul Krugman]] described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible – and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect."&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book

===Government deregulation as a cause===
In 1992, the Democratic-controlled [[102nd United States Congress|102nd Congress]] under the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration weakened regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the goal of making available more money for the issuance of home loans. The Washington Post wrote: "Congress also wanted to free up money for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgage loans and specified that the pair would be required to keep a much smaller share of their funds on hand than other financial institutions. Whereas banks that held $100 could spend $90 buying mortgage loans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could spend $97.50 buying loans. Finally, Congress ordered that the companies be required to keep more capital as a cushion against losses if they invested in riskier securities. But the rule was never set during the Clinton administration, which came to office that winter, and was only put in place nine years later."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last1 = Appelbaum | first1 = Binyamin | last2 = Leonnig | first2 = Carol D. | last3 = Hilzenrath | first3 = David S.  | author-link = | publication-date = September 14, 2008 | title = How Washington Failed to Rein In Fannie, Freddie | newspaper = The Washington Post | pages = A1 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/13/AR2008091302638_pf.html | accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomic conditions==
Two important factors that contributed to the [[housing bubble|United States housing bubble]] were low U.S. interest rates and a large U.S. trade deficit. Low interest rates made bank lending more profitable, while trade deficits resulted in large capital inflows to the U.S. Both made funds for borrowing plentiful and relatively inexpensive.

===Interest rates===
[[File:Fed Funds Rate &amp; Mortgage Rates 2001 to 2008.png|thumb|right|Federal Funds Rate and Various Mortgage Rates]]

From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the [[federal funds rate]] target from 6.5% to 1.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Federal Reserve Board: Monetary Policy and Open Market Operations | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] and of the [[September 11 attacks|September 2001 terrorist attacks]], and to combat the perceived risk of [[deflation]].&lt;ref name="WallStreetJournal"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article | url=http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010981 | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm|title=FRB: H.15 Release--Selected Interest Rates--Historical Data|website=www.federalreserve.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year [[adjustable-rate mortgage]] (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTUyM2MxMThkOWI2MzBmNTM2OGRiYTYwOTA1NzQ1NDE= National Review - Mastrobattista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221041012/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTUyM2MxMThkOWI2MzBmNTM2OGRiYTYwOTA1NzQ1NDE%3D |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates and it became riskier to speculate in housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/07/13/real_estate/buying_selling/risingrates/|title=What do rising rates mean for housing - Jul. 27, 2004|first=By Sarah Max, CNN/Money senior|last=writer|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_29/b3892064_mz011.htm Business Week-Is a Housing Bubble About to Burst?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304164956/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_29/b3892064_mz011.htm |date=March 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and Trade deficits===
[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit Dollars and % GDP.png|thumb|left|U.S. Current Account Deficit]]

Globalization and trade imbalances contributed to enormous inflows of money into the U.S. from high savings countries, fueling debt-driven consumption and the housing bubble. The ratio of household debt to disposable income rose from 77% in 1990 to 127% by 2007.&lt;ref name="The End of the Affair"/&gt; The steady entry into the world economy of new export-oriented economies began with Japan and the Asian tigers in the 1980s and peaked with China in the early 2000s, representing more than two billion newly employable workers. The integration of these high-savings, lower wage economies into the global economy, combined with dramatic productivity gains made possible by new information technologies and the globalization of corporate supply chains, decisively shifted the balance of global supply and demand. By 2000, the world economy was beset by excess supplies of labor, capital, and productive capacity relative to global demand. But the collapse of the consumer credit and housing price bubbles brought an end to this pattern of debt-financed economic growth and left the U.S. with the massive debt overhang.&lt;ref name="newamerica.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_way_forward|title=New America Foundation-The Way Forward-October 2011|publisher=|access-date=2013-04-11|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711200159/http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_way_forward#|archive-date=2012-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This globalization can be measured in growing trade deficits in developed countries such as the U.S. and Europe. In 2005, [[Ben Bernanke]] addressed the implications of the USA's high and rising [[current account]] deficit, resulting from USA imports exceeding its exports, which was itself caused by a [[global saving glut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Bernanke-The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1996 and 2004, the USA current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. Financing these deficits required the USA to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses, mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the USA) running a [[current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the USA to finance its imports. This created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend, either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China), or because of high oil prices. Bernanke referred to this as a "[[saving glut]]."&lt;ref name=Bernanke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070911a.htm |title=Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, At the Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, Germany September 11, 2007: Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects|publisher=Federalreserve.gov |accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "flood" of funds ([[Financial capital|capital]] or [[liquidity]]) reached the USA financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing USA [[Treasury bond]]s and thus avoided much of the direct impact of the crisis. USA households, on the other hand, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in [[mortgage-backed securities]]. USA housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12972083 |title=Economist-When a Flow Becomes a Flood |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roger C.

===Chinese mercantilism===

[[Martin Wolf]] has argued that "inordinately [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] currency policies" were a significant cause of the U.S. trade deficit, indirectly driving a flood of money into the U.S. as described above. In his view, China maintained an artificially weak currency to make Chinese goods relatively cheaper for foreign countries to purchase, thereby keeping its vast workforce occupied and encouraging exports to the U.S. One byproduct was a large accumulation of U.S. dollars by the Chinese government, which were then invested in U.S. government securities and those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, providing additional funds for lending that contributed to the housing bubble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63590/harold-james/fixing-global-finance Foreign Affairs-Fixing Global Finance by Martin Wolf-Review Essay by Harold James]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/fixing-global-finance-review|title=Review: Fixing Global Finance by Martin Wolf|first=Will|last=Hutton|date=1 February 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] also wrote similar comments during October 2009, further arguing that China's currency should have appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar beginning around 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/opinion/23krugman.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion|title=Opinion - The Chinese Disconnect|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various U.S. officials have also indicated concerns with Chinese exchange rate policies, which have not allowed its currency to appreciate significantly relative to the dollar despite large trade surpluses. In January 2009, [[Timothy Geithner]] wrote: "Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency...the question is how and when to broach the subject in order to do more good than harm."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aKJh_CcDrroE Bloomberg-Geithner Warning on Yuan May Renew U.S.-China Tension]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of a long wave===
The cause of the crisis can be seen also in principles of [[Technological change|technological development]] and in long economic waves based on technological revolutions. [[Daniel Šmihula]] believes that this crisis and stagnation are a result of the end of the long economic cycle originally initiated by the Information and telecommunications technological revolution in 1985-2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=6&amp;id=3827075e-0e06-4447-8d1c-f99c78126ba2|title=CEEOL - Error|first=ICB - InterConsult Bulgaria|last=Ltd.|website=www.ceeol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The market has been already saturated by new "technical wonders" (e.g. everybody has his own mobile phone) and – what is more important - in the developed countries the economy reached limits of [[productivity]] in conditions of existing technologies. A new  economic revival can come only with a new technological revolution (a hypothetical Post-informational technological revolution).  Šmihula expects that it will happen in about 2014-15.

===Paradoxes of thrift and deleveraging===
Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. This is called the [[paradox of thrift]].  Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.

During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: "Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."&lt;ref name="frbsf.org"/&gt;

==Capital market pressures==

===Private capital and the search for yield===
In a [[Peabody Award]] winning program, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] correspondents argued that a "Giant Pool of Money" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade, which were low due to low interest rates and trade deficits discussed above. Further, this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with the [[mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) and [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies. In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the U.S., with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans, to small banks that funded the brokers, to the giant investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted. However, continued strong demand for MBS and CDO began to drive down lending standards, as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;  Eventually, this speculative bubble proved unsustainable.&lt;ref name="NPR-The Giant Pool of Money"&gt;[http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html NPR-The Giant Pool of Money] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415153017/http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html |date=2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system==

===Significance of the parallel banking system===
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|350px|right|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis]]
In a June 2008 speech, U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]], then President and CEO of the NY Federal Reserve Bank, placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a "run" on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the [[shadow banking system]]. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities: "In early 2007, [[asset-backed commercial paper]] conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion." He stated that the "combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/tfg080609.html|title=Reducing Systemic Risk in a Dynamic Financial System - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK|website=www.newyorkfed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run on the shadow banking system===
Nobel laureate and liberal political columnist [[Paul Krugman]] described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible—and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect."&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009" /&gt; Some researchers have suggested that competition between GSEs and the shadow banking system led to a deterioration in underwriting standards.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

For example, investment bank [[Bear Stearns]] was required to replenish much of its funding in overnight markets, making the firm vulnerable to credit market disruptions. When concerns arose regarding its financial strength, its ability to secure funds in these short-term markets was compromised, leading to the equivalent of a bank run. Over four days, its available cash declined from $18 billion to $3 billion as investors pulled funding from the firm. It collapsed and was sold at a fire-sale price to bank [[JP Morgan Chase]] March 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/05/18/pm_streetfighters_q/ American Public Media-Kate Kelly-Streetfighters] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802161333/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/05/18/pm_streetfighters_q/ |date=2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgemonitor.com/globalmacro-monitor/252767/why_financial_history_repeats RGE Pollock - Why Financial History Repeats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616160901/http://www.rgemonitor.com/globalmacro-monitor/252767/why_financial_history_repeats |date=2008-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/features/45321/NY Magazine-Angry Bear] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American homeowners, consumers, and corporations owed roughly $25 trillion during 2008. American banks retained about $8 trillion of that total directly as traditional mortgage loans. Bondholders and other traditional lenders provided another $7 trillion. The remaining $10 trillion came from the securitization markets, meaning the parallel banking system. The securitization markets started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_1_credit.html |title=Nicole Gelinas-Can the Fed's Uncrunch Credit? |publisher=City-journal.org |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx Brookings Institution - U.S. Financial and Economic Crisis June 2009 PDF Page 14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093153/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx |date=2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, [[Ben Bernanke]] stated that securitization markets remained effectively shut, with the exception of conforming mortgages, which could be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090224a.htm|title=Bernanke|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' reported in March 2010: "Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were non-banks that were crippled by a silent run among panicky overnight "[[Repurchase agreement|repo]]" lenders, many of them money market funds uncertain about the quality of securitized collateral they were holding. Mass redemptions from these funds after Lehman's failure froze short-term funding for big firms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15770705|title=Shine a light|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortgage compensation model, executive pay and bonuses==
During the boom period, enormous fees were paid to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans, to small banks that funded the brokers, to the giant investment banks behind them. Those originating loans were paid fees for selling them, regardless of how the loans performed. Default or [[credit risk]] was passed from mortgage originators to investors using various types of [[financial innovation]].&lt;ref name="NPR-The Giant Pool of Money"/&gt; This became known as the "originate to distribute" model, as opposed to the traditional model where the bank originating the mortgage retained the credit risk. In effect, the mortgage originators were left with nothing at risk, giving rise to a [[moral hazard]] that separated behavior and consequence.

Economist [[Mark Zandi]] described [[moral hazard]] as a root cause of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. He wrote: "...the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan. As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined." He also wrote: "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The New York State Comptroller's Office has said that in 2006, Wall Street executives took home bonuses totaling $23.9 billion. "Wall Street traders were thinking of the bonus at the end of the year, not the long-term health of their firm. The whole system—from mortgage brokers to Wall Street risk managers—seemed tilted toward taking short-term risks while ignoring long-term obligations. The most damning evidence is that most of the people at the top of the banks didn't really understand how those [investments] worked."&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21nocera.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business|title=Fixing Wall Street Should Start With the Bonuses|first=Joe|last=Nocera|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment banker incentive compensation was focused on fees generated from assembling financial products, rather than the performance of those products and profits generated over time. Their bonuses were heavily skewed towards cash rather than stock and not subject to "claw-back" (recovery of the bonus from the employee by the firm) in the event the MBS or CDO created did not perform. In addition, the increased risk (in the form of financial leverage) taken by the major investment banks was not adequately factored into the compensation of senior executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/18pay.html?em|title=On Wall Street, Bonuses, Not Profits, Were Real|first=Louise|last=Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank CEO [[Jamie Dimon]] argued: "Rewards have to track real, sustained, risk-adjusted performance. Golden parachutes, special contracts, and unreasonable perks must disappear. There must be a relentless focus on risk management that starts at the top of the organization and permeates down to the entire firm. This should be business-as-usual, but at too many places, it wasn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124605726587563517|title=A Unified Bank Regulator Is a Good Start|first=Jamie|last=Dimon|date=29 June 2009|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and deregulation==
{{Further|Government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis}}
Critics have argued that the regulatory framework did not keep pace with [[financial innovation]], such as the increasing importance of the [[shadow banking system]], [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and off-balance sheet financing. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Several critics have argued that the most critical role for regulation is to make sure that financial institutions have the ability or capital to deliver on their commitments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3b94938c-1d59-11de-9eb3-00144feabdc0.html|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have also noted de facto deregulation through a shift in market share toward the least regulated portions of the mortgage market.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

Key examples of regulatory failures include:

*In 1999, the Republican controlled [[106th United States Congress|106th Congress]] U.S. Congress under the [[Clinton administration]] passed the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which repealed part of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/business/congress-passes-wide-ranging-bill-easing-bank-laws.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title =Congress Passes Wide-Ranging Bill Easing Bank Laws | author =Stephen Labaton | publisher =''[[New York Times]]'' | date =November 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repeal has been criticized for reducing the separation between [[commercial banks]] (which traditionally had a conservative culture) and [[investment banks]] (which had a more risk-taking culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/stiglitz200901|title=Joseph E.

*In 2004, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] relaxed the [[net capital rule]], which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. The SEC has conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html?em|title=SEC Concedes Oversight Flaws | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-09-27 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em|title=The Reckoning | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-10-03 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Financial institutions in the [[shadow banking system]] are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks, allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"/&gt; This was the case despite the [[Long-Term Capital Management]] debacle in 1998, where a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications.
*Regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as [[Citigroup]] to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called [[structured investment vehicles]], masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of [[financial leverage|leverage]] or risk taken. One news agency estimated that the top four U.S. banks will have to return between $500 billion and $1 trillion to their balance sheets during 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=akv_p6LBNIdw&amp;refer=home|title=Bloomberg-Bank Hidden Junk Menaces $1 Trillion Purge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=a6dgIOAfMIrI Bloomberg-Citigroup SIV Accounting Tough to Defend]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221121617/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039 |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-balance sheet entities were also used by [[Enron scandal|Enron]] as part of the scandal that brought down that company in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Paul M. &amp; Palepu, Krishna G.: "The Fall of Enron", Journal of Economics Perspectives, Volume 17, Number 2.

*The U.S. Congress allowed the self-regulation of the derivatives market when it passed the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]]. Derivatives such as [[credit default swaps]] (CDS) can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion.

Author [[Roger Lowenstein]] summarized some of the regulatory problems that caused the crisis in November 2009:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"1) Mortgage regulation was too lax and in some cases nonexistent; 2) Capital requirements for banks were too low; 3) Trading in derivatives such as credit default swaps posed giant, unseen risks; 4) Credit ratings on structured securities such as collateralized-debt obligations were deeply flawed; 5) Bankers were moved to take on risk by excessive pay packages; 6) The government’s response to the crash also created, or exacerbated, moral hazard. Markets now expect that big banks won’t be allowed to fail, weakening the incentives of investors to discipline big banks and keep them from piling up too many risky assets again."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=ag6XVCM_C.j4 Lowenstein-Banking Fix Made Easy with Six Simple Steps-Bloomberg-November 2009]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114151943/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=ag6XVCM_C.j4 |date=2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A 2011 documentary film, [[Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?]] argues that deregulation led to the crisis, and is geared towards a general audience.&lt;ref name="Truthout"&gt;{{cite news|last=Karlin|first=Mark|title=Who Stole the American Dream in Broad Daylight?|url=http://truth-out.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=6979:who-stole-the-american-dream-in-broad-daylight|newspaper=Truthout|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts of interest and lobbying==

A variety of [[conflicts of interest]] have been argued as contributing to this crisis:
*Credit rating agencies are compensated for rating debt securities by those issuing the securities, who have an interest in seeing the most positive ratings applied. Further, changing the debt rating on a company that insures multiple debt securities such as [[AIG]] or [[MBIA]], requires the re-rating of many other securities, creating significant costs. Despite taking on significantly more risk, AIG and MBIA retained the highest credit ratings until well into the crisis.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/opinion/04lewiseinhorn.html|title=Opinion - The End of the Financial World as We Know It|first=Michael Lewis and David|last=Einhorn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is a "revolving door" between major financial institutions, the Treasury Department, and Treasury bailout programs. For example, the former CEO of [[Goldman Sachs]] was [[Henry Paulson]], who became President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary. Although three of Goldman's key competitors either failed or were allowed to fail, it received $10 billion in [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) funds (which it has since paid back) and $12.9 billion in payments via AIG, while remaining highly profitable and paying enormous bonuses. The first two officials in charge of the TARP bailout program were also from Goldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqGP3Oc5MOI|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is a "revolving door" between major financial institutions and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), which is supposed to monitor them. For example, as of January 2009, the SEC's two most recent Directors of Enforcement had taken positions at powerful banks directly after leaving the role. The route into lucrative positions with banks places a financial incentive on regulators to maintain good relationships with those they monitor. This is sometimes referred to as [[regulatory capture]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Banks in the U.S. lobby politicians extensively. A November 2009 report from economists of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) writing independently of that organization indicated that:
*Firms that lobby aggressively are more likely to engage in risky securitization of their loan books, have faster-growing mortgage loan portfolios as well as poorer share performance and larger loan defaults;
*Thirty-three legislative proposals that would have increased regulatory scrutiny over banks were the targets of intense and successful lobbying;
*US business spends $4.2 billion over the four-year election cycle on "targeted political activity", with finance, insurance and real estate ("FIRE") firms accounting for 15% of that total ($479,500 per firm) in 2006; and
*The "lobbying intensity" of the FIRE sector also "increased at a much faster pace relative to the average lobbying intensity over 1999-2006."

The study concluded that: "the prevention of future crises might require weakening political influence of the financial industry or closer monitoring of lobbying activities to understand better the incentives behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/04/imf-study-links-lobbying-high-risk-lending|title=IMF study links lobbying by US banks to high-risk lending|first=Nick|last=Mathiason|date=4 January 2010|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2009/arc/pdf/igan.pdf|title=Study-A Fistful of Dollars-Lobbying and the Financial Crisis-November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Globe reported during that during January–June 2009, the largest four U.S. banks spent these amounts ($ millions) on lobbying, despite receiving taxpayer bailouts: Citigroup $3.1; JP Morgan Chase $3.1; Bank of America $1.5; and Wells Fargo $1.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/09/27/bailed_out_banks_battle_to_reshape_bills/|title=Bailed-out banks lobby hard to stave off limits|first1=Michael|last1=Kranish|first2=Alan|last2=Wirzbicki|date=27 September 2009|publisher=|via=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in April 2010: "An analysis by Public Citizen found that at least 70 former members of Congress were lobbying for Wall Street and the financial services sector last year, including two former Senate majority leaders (Trent Lott  and Bob Dole), two former House majority leaders (Richard A. Gephardt and Dick Armey) and a former House speaker (J. Dennis Hastert). In addition to the lawmakers, data from the Center for Responsive Politics counted 56 former Congressional aides on the Senate or House banking committees who went on to use their expertise to lobby for the financial sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/business/14lobby.html|title=Minting Bank Lobbyists on Capitol Hill|first=Eric|last=Lichtblau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported in January 2011 that "...from 1998 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-Conclusions-January 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304020317/http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf |date=2011-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of business leaders ===
A 2012 book by [[Hedrick Smith]], ''[[Who Stole the American Dream?]]'', suggests that the [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell Memo]] was instrumental in setting a new political direction for US business leaders that led to "America’s contemporary economic malaise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Other factors==

===Commodity price volatility===
{{Main article|2000s commodities  boom}}
A commodity price bubble was created following the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $140 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/CO/M|title=Light Crude Oil (Pit) Monthly Commodity Futures Price Chart : NYMEX|website=futures.tradingcharts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts debate the causes, which include the flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities to speculation and monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2790539/George-Soros-rocketing-oil-price-is-a-bubble.html|title=George Soros: rocketing oil price is a bubble|first=Edmund Conway, Economics|last=Editor|date=25 May 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/story/2999|title=The Oil-Price Bubble - Frank Shostak|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=28 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has also been proposed as a causal factor in the financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50923|title=Was Volatility in the Price of Oil a Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis? - Resilience|website=www.energybulletin.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inaccurate economic forecasting===

A cover story in ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_17/b4128026997269.htm?chan=top+news_economics+subindex+page_economics|title= Businessweek Magazine |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm;jsessionid=a830ee2a1f18c5f62020347bf11442669617?articleid=2234 Why Economists Failed to Predict the Financial Crisis - Knowledge@Wharton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913044548/http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm%3Bjsessionid%3Da830ee2a1f18c5f62020347bf11442669617?articleid=2234 |date=2010-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in the New York Times informs that economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html?pagewanted=all ]"Dr. Doom", By Stephen Mihm, August 15, 2008, New York Times Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Guardian]], Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him "Dr. Doom".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/24/nouriel-roubini-credit-crunch] Emma Brockes, "He Told Us So," The Guardian, January 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;"Recession in America," The Economist, November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Berner, "Perfect Storm for the American Consumer," Morgan Stanley Global Economic Forum, November 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kabir Chibber, "Goldman Sees Subprime Cutting $2 Trillion in Lending," Bloomberg.com, November 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to forecast the "[[Great Recession]]" has caused a lot of soul searching in the economics profession. The [[Elizabeth II|Queen of England]] herself asked why had nobody noticed that the credit crunch was on its way, and a group of economists—experts from business, the City, its regulators, academia, and government—tried to explain in a letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/archive/forum-economy.cfm British Academy-The Global Financial Crisis Why Didn't Anybody Notice?-Retrieved July 27, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707135349/http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/archive/forum-economy.cfm |date=July 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over-leveraging, credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations as causes===
[[File:Public debt percent gdp world map (2007).svg|thumb|Public debt as a percent of GDP (2007).]]
[[File:Public debt percent gdp world map.PNG|thumb|Public debt as a percent of GDP (2009/2010).]]

Another probable cause of the crisis—and a factor that unquestionably amplified its magnitude—was widespread miscalculation by banks and investors of the level of risk inherent in the unregulated [[Collateralized debt obligation]] and [[credit default swap]] markets. Under this theory, banks and investors systematized the risk by taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow tremendous sums of money that they could only pay back if the housing market continued to increase in value.

According to an article published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', the risk was further systematized by the use of [[David X. Li]]'s [[Gaussian copula model]] function to rapidly price [[Collateralized debt obligation]]s based on the price of related [[credit default swap]]s.&lt;ref name="wired1703"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant|title=Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street|last=Salmon|first=Felix|date=2009-02-23|publisher=Wired|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was highly tractable, it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of CDO and CDS investors, issuers, and rating agencies.&lt;ref name="wired1703"/&gt; According to one wired.com article: "Then the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of Li's formula hadn't expected. The cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008—when ruptures in the financial system's foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril...Li's Gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees."&lt;ref name="wired1703"/&gt;

The pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. It has been estimated that the "from late 2005 to the middle of 2007, around $450bn of CDO of ABS were issued, of which about one third were created from risky mortgage-backed bonds...[o]ut of that pile, around $305bn of the CDOs are now in a formal state of default, with the CDOs underwritten by Merrill Lynch accounting for the biggest pile of defaulted assets, followed by UBS and Citi."&lt;ref name="TPM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|title=The power of belief|date=2009-03-02|publisher=TPM|accessdate=2009-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|archivedate=2009-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average recovery rate for high quality CDOs has been approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for mezzanine CDO's has been approximately five cents for every dollar. These massive, practically unthinkable, losses have dramatically impacted the balance sheets of banks across the globe, leaving them with very little capital to continue operations.&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt;

===Credit creation as a cause===
Austrian economics argue that the crisis is consistent with the [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]], in which credit created through the policies of [[central bank]]ing gives rise to an artificial [[boom and bust|boom]], which is inevitably followed by a [[Boom and bust|bust]]. This perspective argues that the [[monetary policy]] of central banks creates excessive quantities of cheap credit by setting [[interest rate]]s below where they would be set by a free market. This easy availability of credit inspires a bundle of [[malinvestment]]s, particularly on long term projects such as housing and capital assets, and also spurs a consumption boom as incentives to save are diminished. Thus an unsustainable boom arises, characterized by malinvestments and overconsumption.

But the created credit is not backed by any real savings nor is in response to any change in the real economy, hence, there are physically not enough resources to finance either the malinvestments or the consumption rate indefinitely. The bust occurs when investors collectively realize their mistake. This happens usually some time after interest rates rise again. The [[liquidation]] of the malinvestments and the consequent reduction in consumption throw the economy into a recession, whose severity mirrors the scale of the boom's excesses.

Austrian economists argue that the conditions previous to the crisis of the late 2000s correspond to the scenario described above. The central bank of the United States, led by Federal Reserve Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], kept interest rates very low for a long period of time to blunt the recession of the early 2000s. The resulting malinvestment and over-consumption of investors and consumers prompted the development of a housing bubble that ultimately burst, precipitating the financial crisis. The resulting devaluation of investors' share portfolio reduced consumption even further and aggravated the consequences of the bursting of the bubble, since in the post-Bretton Woods finance-led model of capitalism the stock market had transformed from a mechanism that used to finance the supply side of the economy into a mechanism that financed the consumption side;&lt;ref&gt;Masouros, Pavlos E., "Corporate Law and Economic Stagnation: How Shareholder Value and Short-termism Contribute to the Decline of the Western Economies" Eleven International Publishing (2013), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; thus, consumers' purchasing power evaporated together with the value of their stock portfolio. This crisis, together with sudden and necessary [[Leverage (finance)|deleveraging]] and cutbacks by consumers, businesses and banks, led to the recession. Austrian Economists argue further that while they probably affected the nature and severity of the crisis, factors such as a lack of regulation, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]], and entities such as [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] are insufficient by themselves to explain it.&lt;ref&gt;Short article written by Lawrence H. White and David C. Rose describing the downturn from an Austrian perspective https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9901&lt;/ref&gt;

A positively sloped [[yield curve]] allows Primary Dealers (such as large investment banks) in the Federal Reserve system to fund themselves with cheap short term money while lending out at higher long-term rates. This strategy is profitable so long as the yield curve remains positively sloped. However, it creates a liquidity risk if the [[yield curve]] were to become inverted and banks would have to refund themselves at expensive short term rates while losing money on longer term loans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The narrowing of the [[yield curve]] from 2004 and the inversion of the yield curve during 2007 resulted (with the expected 1 to 3-year delay) in a bursting of the housing bubble and a wild gyration of commodities prices as moneys flowed out of assets like housing or stocks and sought safe haven in commodities. The price of oil rose to over $140 per barrel in 2008 before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008.

Other observers have doubted the role that the yield curve plays in controlling the business cycle. In a May 24, 2006 story CNN Money reported: "...in recent comments, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke repeated the view expressed by his predecessor Alan Greenspan that an inverted yield curve is no longer a good indicator of a recession ahead."{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

An empirical study by [[John B. Taylor]] concluded that the crisis was: (1) caused by excess monetary expansion; (2) prolonged by an inability to evaluate counter-party risk due to opaque financial statements; and (3) worsened by the unpredictable nature of government's response to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~johntayl/FCPR.pdf |title=The Financial Crisis and the Policy Responses: An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~johntayl/How_Government_Created_the_Financial_Crisis-WSJ-2-9-09.pdf |title=How Government Created the Financial Crisis |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil prices===
{{Further|Peak oil}}
Economist [[James D. Hamilton]] has argued that the increase in oil prices in the period of 2007 through 2008 was a significant cause of the recession. He evaluated several different approaches to estimating the impact of oil price shocks on the economy, including some methods that had previously shown a decline in the relationship between oil price shocks and the overall economy. All of these methods "support a common conclusion; had there been no increase in oil prices between 2007:Q3 and 2008:Q2, the US economy would not have been in a recession over the period 2007:Q4 through 2008:Q3."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, James D. "Oil prices and the economic recession of 2007–08." ''Voxeu.org''. 16 June 2009. http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3664&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton's own model, a time-series econometric forecast based on data up to 2003, showed that the decline in GDP could have been successfully predicted to almost its full extent given knowledge of the price of oil. The results imply that oil prices were entirely responsible for the recession.&lt;ref name=bruno032008&gt;{{cite news |title=Oil Rally May Be Economy's Undoing |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-03-08-3190491488_x.htm |author=Bruno, Joe Bel |date=8 March 2008 |agency=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Overproduction===
It has also been debated that the root cause of the crisis is [[overproduction]] of goods caused by [[globalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Walden |last=Bello |url=http://focusweb.org/afterthoughts-a-primer-on-the-wall-street-meltdown.html?Itemid=92 |title=Afterthoughts : A primer on the Wall Street meltdown |publisher=Focus on the Global South |date=18 October 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072126/http://focusweb.org/afterthoughts-a-primer-on-the-wall-street-meltdown.html?Itemid=92# |archive-date=2008-12-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and especially vast investments in countries such as [[China]] and [[India]] by western [[multinational companies]] over the past 15–20 years, which greatly increased global industrial output at a reduced cost). Overproduction tends to cause [[deflation]] and signs of deflation were evident in October and November 2008, as commodity prices tumbled and the Federal Reserve was lowering its target rate to an all-time-low 0.25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Willis |first=Bob |author2=Schlisserman, Courtney |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601205&amp;sid=a73N6LrkY5zo |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100312121142/http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3D20601205%26sid%3Da73N6LrkY5zo |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 12, 2010 |title=U.S. Economy: Consumer Prices, Housing Starts Slide |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=December 16, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] suggests that it is not actually an economic crisis, but rather a crisis of [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|exceeding growth beyond sustainable ecological limits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nate |last=Hagens |url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4617 |title=Herman Daly on the Credit Crisis, Financial Assets, and Real Wealth |publisher=The Oil Drum |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects a claim made in the 1972 book [[The Limits to Growth|''Limits to Growth'']], which stated that without major deviation from the policies followed in the 20th century, a permanent end of economic growth could be reached sometime in the first two decades of the 21st century, due to gradual depletion of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Turner (2008).

Today, Chiyou is honored and worshipped as the God of War and one of the three legendary founding fathers of China.

==Description==

===Individual===
According to the Song dynasty history book ''[[Lushi (book)|Lushi]]'', Chiyou's surname was [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] (姜), and he was a descendant of [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]].&lt;ref name="lushi"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Luo Mi]] (罗泌)|title=Lushi|location=后记四：蚩尤传}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, Chiyou had a [[bronze]] head with a metal [[forehead]].&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt; He had 4 eyes and 6 arms, wielding terrible sharp weapons in every hand.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;王恆偉. (2005) (2006) 中國歷史講堂 #1 遠古至春秋. 中華書局. {{ISBN|962-8885-24-3}}. p 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In some sources, Chiyou had certain features associated with [[:Category:Mythological bovines|various mythological bovines]]: his head was that of a [[bull]] with two [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], although the body was that of a human.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; He is said to have been unbelievably fierce, and to have had 81 brothers.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; Historical sources often described him as 'cruel and greedy',&lt;ref name="lushi" /&gt; as well as 'tyrannical'.&lt;ref name="shiji"&gt;{{cite book|title=史记|last=司马|first=迁|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=五帝本纪|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have asserted that the figure 81 should rather be associated with 81 clans in his kingdom.&lt;ref name="Yapo" /&gt; Chiyou knows the constellations and the ancients spells for calling upon the weather. For example, he called upon a fog to surround Huangdi and his soldiers during the [[Battle of Zhuolu]].

===Tribe===
Chiyou is regarded as a leader of the Nine Li tribe (九黎, [[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]] {{lang-mww|Cuaj Li Ntuj}}) by nearly all sources.&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt; However, his exact ethnic affiliations are quite complex, with multiple sources reporting him as belonging to various tribes, in addition to a number of diverse peoples supposed to have directly descended from him.

Some sources from later dynasties, such as the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu book]]'', considered Chiyou's Li tribe to be related to the ancient [[Miao people|San miao tribe]] (三苗).&lt;ref&gt;(國語·楚語下)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ancient [[Zhuolu Town]] is a statue of Chiyou commemorating him as the original ancestor of the [[Hmong people]].&lt;ref name="indig"&gt;De la Cadena, Marisol. Starn, Orin. Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. [2007] (2007). Indigenous experience today. Berg Publishers, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84520-519-5}}. pg 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The place is regarded as the birthplace of the San miao / Miao people,&lt;ref name="indig" /&gt; the Hmong being a subgroup of the Miao. In sources following the Hmong view, the "nine Li" tribe is called the "Jiuli" kingdom,&lt;ref name="Yapo" /&gt; Jiuli meaning "nine Li". Modern [[Han Chinese]] scholar Weng Dujian considers Jiuli and San Miao to be [[Nanman|Man]] southerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schein |first= Louisa |year=2000 |title= Minority rules: the Miao and the feminine in China's cultural politics |publisher= Duke University Press |isbn= 978-0-8223-2444-7 |page= 42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiyou has also been counted as part of the [[Dongyi]].&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt;

==Epic battles==
{{main|Battle of Zhuolu}}
[[File:Huang Di.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the location of the Battle of Zhuolu and Chiyou's tribe]]
When the [[Yan emperor]] was leading his tribe and conflicts with Nine Li tribes led by Chiyou,&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt; the Yan emperor stood no chance and lost the fight. He escaped, and later ended up in [[Zhuolu Town|Zhuolu]] begging for help from the [[Yellow Emperor]].&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt; At this point the epic battle between Chiyou and the Yellow Emperor's forces began. The battle last for 10 years with Chiyou having the upper hand. 
During the Battle of Zhuolu, Chiyou breathed out a thick fog and obscured the sunlight.&lt;ref name="big5chariot"&gt;Big5.china.com.cn. "[http://big5.china.com.cn/aboutchina/zhuanti/lddw/2007-10/15/content_9059220.htm Big5.china.com.cn]." ''黃帝大戰蚩尤與指南車.'' Retrieved on 2010-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle dragged on for days while the emperor's side was in danger.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; Only after the Yellow Emperor invented the [[south-pointing chariot]], did he find his way out of the battlefield.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5chariot" /&gt; Chiyou then conjured up a heavy storm. The Yellow Emperor then called upon the drought demon [[Nüba]] (女魃), who blew away the storm clouds and cleared the battlefield.&lt;ref name="big5chariot" /&gt; Chiyou and his army could not hold up, and were later killed by the Yellow Emperor.&lt;ref name="tonsi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; After this defeat, the Yellow Emperor is said to become the ancestor of all [[Huaxia]] Chinese.&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; The Hmong were forced to live in the mountains and leave their Li kingdom.&lt;ref name="indig" /&gt; After Chiyou's death, it is said that it rained blood for some time.

==Societal influence==
According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [[Qin Shi Huang]] worshiped Chiyou as the God of War, and [[Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] [[Ancestor worship|worshiped]] at Chiyou's shrine before his decisive battle against [[Xiang Yu]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The mythical title God of War was given to Chiyou because the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor could not defeat Chiyou alone.  Altogether, Chiyou won 9 major battles including 80 minor confrontations.  On the 10th and final war, both emperors combined their forces and conquered Chiyou.

In one mythical episode, after Chiyou had claimed he could not be conquered,&lt;ref name="JLAS"/&gt; the goddess [[Nüwa|Nuwa]] dropped a stone tablet on him from [[Mount Tai]]. Chiyou failed to crush the stone, but still managed to escape. From then on, the 5-finger-shaped stone tablet, inscribed "Mount Tai ''[[shigandang]]''" (泰山石敢當) became a [[Chinese spiritual world concepts#Objects|spiritual weapon]] to ward off evil and disasters.&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JLASC"&gt;Lee, James. [2006] (2006). James Lee Astrology guide 2006 Chinese edition. World publishing co. {{ISBN|962-432-502-2}}. p 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to notes by the [[Qing Dynasty]] painter [[Luo Ping]]: "Yellow Emperor ordered his men to have Chiyou beheaded... seeing that Chiyou's head was separated from his body, later sages had his image engraved on sacrificial [[Zun|vessels]] as a warning to those that would covet power and wealth."&lt;ref name="Brnz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Bronzes: Ferocious Beauty|author1=Wangheng Chen |author2=Various |publisher=Asiapac Books Pte Ltd|year=2001|isbn=978-981-229-020-5|url=http://www.google.ca/books?id=6yCq-NEdKeUC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hundun+taotie|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tale of Heike]] mentions a [[comet]] "of the type called Chiyou's Banner or Red Breath."&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{Cite book |translator=Burton Watson |title=The Tales of the Heike |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2006 |ISBN=9780231138031 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

According to the controversial Korean history book ''[[Hwandan Gogi]]'', compiled by Uncho Gye Yeon-su in 1911, and later published in 1979, Chiyou was also an ancestor of the Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;http://zh.wikisource.org/zh/桓檀古記/三聖記&lt;/ref&gt; He is listed there as the 14th (out of 18) head of the [[State of Shinshi]] (or 'Baedal'), with the Korean form of his name, ''Jaoji Hwanung of Baedal''. In this account, rather than being killed or defeated in the Battle of Zhuolu, Chiyou is victorious and captures the Chinese Emperor Hwang Di alive, rendering him subject to Shinshi.

A recently published [[Korean language|Korean]] novel, entitled "Chiyou, the King of Heaven" (Chinese: 蚩尤天皇; Korean: 치우천왕기), also claims that Chiyou was an ancestral leader of Koreans in the "old country" (Joo Shin, 주신 in Korean), and that he defeated the Yellow Emperor at the Battle of Zhuolu (탁록, ''Takrok'' in Korean).&lt;ref name="sohu1"&gt;News.sohu.com.

[[Image:Fiennes de Clinton.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln|Edward Fiennes de Clinton]], 1st [[Earl of Lincoln]], wearing the Collar of the [[Order of the Garter]] (c. 1575).]]
A '''collar''' is an ornate [[chain]], often made of [[gold]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and set with precious stones, which is worn about the neck as a symbol of membership in various [[chivalric orders]]. It is a particular form of the [[livery collar]], the grandest form of the widespread phenomenon of [[livery]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]]. Orders which have several grades often reserve the collar for the highest grade (usually called the [[Grand Cross]]). The links of the chain are usually composed of symbols of the order, and the [[badge]] (also called "decoration", "cross" or "jewel") of the order normally hangs down in front. Sometimes the badge is referred to by what is depicted on it; for instance, the badge that hangs from the chain of the [[Order of the Garter]] is referred to as "the George".

==History==
The first of the [[Orders of Knighthood]] were the [[Military order (society)|military order]]s of [[crusaders]] who used red, green or black crosses of velvet on their [[Mantle (vesture)|mantles]], to distinguish their brotherhoods. Later the members of knightly orders used rings, embroidred dragons and even garters as the symbol of their order. In the late [[Middle Ages]] the knights wore their insignia ever more prominently and medaillons, crosses and jewels in the shape of animals began to be worn on chains around the neck, known as livery collars. After the 17th century the heyday of the collar was over. They were worn only on ceremonial occasions and replaced in daily life by stars pinned to the breast, and badges suspended from ribbons. Many orders retained their collars and when orders were divided into several ranks or grades the collar was usually reserved for the highest rank. The notable exception is [[Portugal]]. 

[[Image:Charles VIII de france.jpg|thumb|[[Charles VIII of France]], wearing the collar of the [[Order of Saint Michael]].]]

Collars of various devices are worn by the knights of some of the European [[orders of knighthood]]. The custom was begun by [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]], who gave his [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knights of the Golden Fleece]], badges depicting a [[golden fleece]] hung from a collar of flints, steels and sparks.&lt;!--what on earth are "flints, steels and sparks"?--&gt; Following this new fashion, [[Louis XI of France]], when instituting his [[Order of St. Michael]] in 1469, gave the knights collars composed of scallop shells linked on a chain. The chain was doubled by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], and the pattern underwent other changes before the order lapsed in 1830. 

At the end of the 18th century most of the European orders had only one rank; that of Knight and although they usually had collars, the cross or badge was now worn on a ribbon around the neck or over the right shoulder. When the orders became more democratic several ranks were introduced and only the highest grade, the "Grand Commanders" or "Grand Crosses", wore collars. The [[Netherlands]] never had collars but several [[Belgian]], most of the [[Austria]]n and [[Prussia]]n orders, and several [[Portugal|Portuguese]] orders had collars. In Portugal all the members of these orders of knighthood wear a collar but the collars of the Grand Cross are more elaborate.

Sometimes the collar is used as the insignia of office of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the order. For instance, the [[President of France]] wears the collar of the Order of the [[Legion of Honour]]. In other countries such as [[Brazil]] the collar is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved for the president and foreign heads of state. [[Napoleon I]] introduced the ''Grand aigle'' (Grand Eagle) to replace the Grand Cross as the highest rank in his [[Legion of Honour]]. Napoleon dispensed 15 such golden collars of the Legion among his kinsmen and the highest of his ministers. This collar did not survive his downfall and was abolished in 1815. 

[[Image:Robert Dudley Leicester.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]], his arms at left are surrounded by the Collar of the [[Order of St Michael]].]]

Until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the [[Order of the Garter]], most ancient of the great knightly orders, had no collar. But the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] king wished to match the continental sovereigns in all things, and the present collar of the Garter knights, with its golden knots and its buckled garters enclosing [[tudor rose|white roses set on red roses]], has its origin in the Tudor age. Most of the British orders of knighthood have collars and they are still worn on special occasions (see [[Collar day]]s). The [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Order of Merit]], the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] and the [[Imperial Service Order]] are the exceptions.

==Heraldry==
In [[heraldry]], most members of orders are permitted to display the collar of their order on their [[coat of arms]] (if they are in fact entitled to wear the collar). There are often very strict rules as to how exactly the collar is to be displayed. Normally it will entirely encircle the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield), or the collar may be partially hidden by it. Sometimes, only a part of the collar and the badge will extend below the escutcheon.

Collars of different orders are often depicted in the [[heraldic achievement]] of various monarchs, encircling the escutcheon. Though the standard achievement used most often may depict specific collars, this does not preclude the use of or substitution with other collars to which someone may be entitled to. Some achievements depict multiple collars while others depict only one; The coat of arms of the Norwegian monarch only depicts the collar of the [[Order of St. Olav]] encircling the shield while that of Denmark's depicts the collars of the nation's two chivalric orders: the [[Order of the Elephant]] and the [[Order of Dannebrog]]. In the greater arms of Sweden, the collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]] is used. The collar of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] is also depicted in the national arms of Belgium.

==Death of recipient==
When a member of an order dies, they are not usually buried with the collar, but it may be displayed on a pillow placed on the coffin (along with other decorations that the member may have) during the funeral. Many orders require that after the death of a member of the order, the collar and perhaps other insignia be returned to the issuing authority. Often, the requirement is that a male relative personally return the award to the order.

==Orders with Collar as a separate (highest) rank==
Many orders also do have a chain as an ornament that is worn at more official ceremonial occasions (worn by knights of a single class order or members of the highest class of a multi-class order). However, in some orders Collar is a separate rank above that of Grand Cross, i.e.:

&lt;!--Article not linked within: {{Marxism}}--&gt;

'''Communization''' (or '''communisation''' in [[British English]]) mainly refers to a contemporary [[communist]] theory in which there is a "mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the [[Left communism|communist ultra-left]], post-[[Autonomism|autonomists]], anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly ‘communizing’ currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste''. "Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process..."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the big differences in perception and usage. Some groups start out from an activist voluntarism (''Tiqqun'', ''Invisible Committee''), while others derive communization as an historical and social result emerging out of capital's development over the last decades (''Endnotes'', ''Théorie Communiste''). ''Endnotes'' totally distinguishes itself from the mixing of all sorts of meanings of the word ''communization'' and explicitly refers to the different reception in the Anglophone world as opposed to the original French milieu from which it emerged as a critique.&lt;ref&gt; "It has thus become necessary to make the distinction: the 'communization theory' now spoken of in the English-speaking world is largely an imaginairy entity, an artefact of the Anglophone reception of various unrelated works...For us communization does not signify some general positive process of 'sharing' or 'making common'. It signifies the speficic revolutionairy undoing of the relations of property constitutive of the capitalist class relation. " e.g. [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 Endnotes "What are we to do?" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

In [[communist]] political theory, communization is the process of abolishing [[ownership]] of the [[means of production]], which, in societies dominated by the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], are owned by individual capitalists, [[Sovereign state|states]], or other collective bodies. In some versions of communist theory, communization is understood as the transfer of ownership from [[Privately held company|private]] capitalist hands to the collective hands of producers, whether in the form of [[co-operative enterprises]] or [[communes]], or through the mediation of a state or federation of [[workers' councils]] on a local, national, or global scale. In other programs, such as those of some [[left communists]] (e.g. [[Gilles Dauvé]], [[Jacques Camatte]]), [[autonomism|autonomists]] (e.g., [[Mario Tronti]]), and [[libertarian communists]] (e.g. [[Peter Kropotkin]]), communization means the abolition of [[property]] itself along with any state-like institutions claiming to represent a given subset of humanity. In these accounts humanity as a whole, directly or indirectly, would take over the task of the production of goods for use (and not for exchange). People would then have free access to those goods rather than exchanging labor for money, and distribution would take place according to the maxim "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]."

== History ==

=== Origins and precedents ===
The term communization was not used by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], but it was employed in the above sense by early Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1887/policy.htm William Morris "The Policy of Abstention"] (1887)  and  [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bax/1888/06/impera.htm E. Belfort Bax "Et Impera"] (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; Communization in this sense is equivalent to the establishment of the "higher phase" of communist society described by Marx in ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. In ''[[State and Revolution]]'', [[Vladimir Lenin]] referred to the lower phase, organized around the principle "[[To each according to his contribution]]", as "socialism", with the higher phase as "complete communism", or "full communism", as [[Joseph Stalin]] would later put it. Thus both Lenin and Stalin gave grounds for thinking of communization not as a transition from capitalism to communism, but as a transition from socialism to communism, a transition that would take place after the working class had seized power, and which may last a long time (in the 1930s Stalin conceived of "full communism" as still a long way off&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Stalin’s “Economic Problems of Socialism of the U.S.S.R.” (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus the interval between the two transitions came to be seen as a necessary "period of transition" between the workers' revolution and communism.

It appears that within so-called "communist" regimes the demand for "communization" was associated with an impatience with the "period of transition" and a desire to break with the remaining capitalist forms (e.g., money, wage labor) still in place in those regimes.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. some [[Chinese Ultra-Left]] tendencies during the so-called "[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Those pushing for a move toward "communizing" in this sense were typically denounced as "[[ultra-left]]", with their suggestions dismissed as impractical and [[utopian]], but they were able to point to the historical examples of the [[Paris Commune]] and the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Spanish Revolution]], where more radical measures of popular collectivization had been taken than in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian]] and [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese]] revolutions, as well as to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] and the [[Biennio Rosso|Italian councils movement of 1919-1920]] in which the historic "[[left communist]]" tendencies had been formed.

=== Late 20th century ===
The association of the term communization with a self-identified "[[ultra-left]]" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' states: “insurrection and communisation are intimately linked.  There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality.  The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself.” This vision was opposed to the [[statism]] and [[vanguardism]] of the [[Leninist]] conception of revolution, but it also identified the perceived failure of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian]] and [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese]] revolutions (carried out on the Leninist politico-military model) with the insufficiency of measures taken to abolish capitalist social relations (e.g. lack of direct collectivization, persistence of monetary relations). It also reversed the supposed "pragmatism" of the Leninist focus on the state, arguing that the final goal of the "[[withering away of the state]]" could hardly be advanced by the seizure of state power and the establishment of a "revolutionary" bureaucracy, but that the most practical means to achieve this goal would rather be the abolition of the capitalist relations (money, capital, wages) on which state power depends. Thus La Banquise writes:
{{quote|"one can foresee that a movement of communisation that destroys the State, undermines the social base of the enemy, and spreads under the effect of the irresistible appeal arousing the birth of new social relations between men, will bond together the revolutionary camp far better than any power which, while waiting to conquer the world before communising it, would behave no differently than... a State."&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/the-story-of-our-origins-la-banquise "The Story of Our Origins"]''La Banquise'' No. 2 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within this 1970s French tendency "communization" thus came to represent the absence of a period of transition and a conception of revolution as the application of communist measures throughout the economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;For an historical account see: Endnotes [http://endnotes.org.uk/articles/8 "Bring Out Your Dead"], Endnotes no. 1 (2008). Although they do not use the term a very similar conception can be found in the early works of [[Antonio Negri]], e.g. the chapter ‘Communism and Transition’ in his ''Marx Beyond Marx'' (1978), as well as in the 1980s works of the insurrectionist anarchist [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency.

In collaboration with other left communists such as [[François Martin (political theorist)|François Martin]] and [[Karl Nesic]], Dauvé has attempted to fuse, critique, and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with [[Amadeo Bordiga]] (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (journal)|Invariance]]''), German-Dutch [[council communism]], and the French perspectives associated with ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left."[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past - La Banquise]&lt;/ref&gt; He has focused on theoretical discussions of economic issues concerning the controversial failure of [[Second International]] [[Marxism]] (including both [[Social Democracy]] and [[Leninist]] "Communism"), the global revolutionary upsurge of the 1960s and its subsequent dissolution, and on developments in global [[capitalist accumulation]] and [[class struggle]].

=== Early 21st century ===
In the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities – from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing" – that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process." Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212804/http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion" — setting up spaces and practices that are held to be partially autonomous from capitalism — is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of "communization" see "[http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call Reflexions Around Call] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181348/http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call |date=September 12, 2011 }}" Letters Journal #3. See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite "Un Appel et une Invite"].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in US [[anarchist]] circles it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed in US anarchist and "[[insurrectionist]]" communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009-2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ "After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126222020/http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ |date=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "More recently its ideas have been elaborated and extended in discussions with like-minded groups including the English language ''Endnotes'' and the Swedish journal ''Riff Raff''. Together these collectives have recently collaborated to produce ''Sic – an international journal of communisation'' (issue number one was published in 2011)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/communisation-theory-question-fascism-cherry-angioma |title="Communisation theory and the question of fascism" by Cherry Angioma |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talon''': The TALON transmits in color, black and white, infrared, and/or night vision to its operator, who may be up to 1,000 m away. It can run off lithium-ion batteries for a maximum of 7 days on standby independently before needing recharging. It has an 8.5 hour battery life at normal operating speeds, 2 standard lead batteries providing 2 hours each and 1 optional Lithium Ion providing an additional 4.5 hours. It weighs less than 100&amp;nbsp;lb (45&amp;nbsp;kg) or 60&amp;nbsp;lb (27&amp;nbsp;kg) for the Reconnaissance version. Its cargo bay accommodates a variety of sensor payloads. The robot is controlled through a two-way radio or a Fiber-optic link from a portable or wearable Operator Control Unit (OCU) that provides continuous data and video feedback for precise vehicle positioning. The (IED/EOD) TALON Carries sensors and a robotic manipulator, which is used by the U.S. Military for explosive ordnance disposal and disarming improvised explosive devices.

'''Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV)''': SUGVs are lightweight, rugged, specialized systems suitable for military applications in congested urban settings to give users the ability to see around corners and into tight spaces.

'''Packbot''': The [[PackBot]] is a series of [[military robot]]s by [[iRobot]].

'''Throwbots''': Throwbots (from "throwable robot") are rugged, highly portable, and instantly and easily deployable [[reconnaissance]] robots.

==Soldier worn protection==

'''Body Armor''': Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines have a large assortment of wearable protection against the effects of blasts and shrapnel. There have been many advancements made in ergonomics, blast resistant material and infection prevention over the last couple decades. Currently there are many options available for dismounted troops to protect them from all types of danger. Below are a few of the currently fielded systems and what is to come.

The CVRJ system accomplishes its primary mission by jamming each threat's transmitted RF signals. The secondary purpose of the CVRJ system is to add the capability to combine multiple internal RF signals and external RF inputs from other systems, and serve as the conduit for transmitting those RF signals while maintaining system interoperability. It accomplishes both missions via 15 waveform programmable RF channels. The system is software controlled to meet specific threats. Indicators on the CVRJ front panel and Remote Control Unit (RCU) allow the operator to observe system health and diagnostic messages. Built-In-Test (BIT) routines run during system initialization and operation that notify the operator of system faults by illuminating indicators referred to as "annunciators" and by displaying text messages on the RCU display. The system is highly automated which reduces operator interaction. The system draws up to 36 amps of vehicle power, weighs approximately 69&amp;nbsp;lbs, and measures 13"H x 14"W x 19"D.

'''Vehicle Jammer System STAR V''':  Protective modular jamming system STAR V 740 is intended for a protection against RCIED. The system either prevents the activation of RCIED or it can significantly reduce the distance for a bomb activation. The system is used to protect the special EOD teams or for a convoy protection.
The jamming is performed by random frequency sweeping in a few frequencies sub-bands at the same time. Each sub-band has a possibility to set up to two communication windows for mutual radio communication. The jamming system is equipped with 8 wideband transmitters, 3 low pass filters, 1 combiner, 6 Omni-directional antennas and 8 wide-band digital exciters. The higher level of jamming efficiency is accomplished by using more parallel subsystems and digital technology.
The jamming system is intended as a mobile system which is installed in the vehicle. It is equipped with the Omni-directional antennas that are part of the system. The output power of the jammer is up to 740 W. The jamming system is easily controlled and the failures are easily diagnosed. It is controlled on the front panel. The operator can switch on/off particular transmitting systems and subsystems, set up to three jamming sub-bands in each. Dwell time in each sub-band can also be modified. Jammer is equipped with IP, RS 485 and USB interface. System is also equipped with special SW which can be installed on a notebook or a PC. Special remote control box is also included. The system's voltage is from 22 V to 30 Volts.

==Unmanned Systems intended for Counter-IED==
[[File:Aerostat in Afghanistan (PTDS).JPG|thumb|Current version of PTDS, a widely used Aerostat in combat operations.]]

===Aerostats===
[[Aerostat]]s are balloons equipped with stabilized electro optical, infrared, and radar sensors which are manned 24 hours a day. The Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) is the largest and most capable Aerostat ever used in combat. First used in 2004 (Camp Slayer, Iraq). It can sit for months thousands of feet above a base. Known as the "unblinking eye", Aerostats provide real-time High Definition imagery of the surrounding area, day or night, and are strategically placed for surveillance purposes. They enhance situational awareness and improve force protection. Aerostats can be used to reconnoiter routes before friendly forces travel them and to provide over watch for dismounted troops or convoys. They can also serve as a communications and Full Motion Video (FMV) relay platform to extend the range and disseminate situational awareness. They are linked with several ground-based sensors, including acoustic sensors that detect and locate weapon fire or blasts.

=== Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) ===

The Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) is a large helium-filled lighter than air system designed by Lockheed Martin to provide soldiers long range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and communication assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army-technology.com|title=Army Technology - The leading site for news and procurement in the defence industry|website=Army Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Civil War, when Union Soldiers utilized hot air balloons to serve as a surveillance platform, airship technology has been a part of the Army's inventory. As U.S. forces began a troop surge in Afghanistan while maintaining security in Iraq, the need to provide soldiers with a persistent view of the battlefield was critical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/82551/army_accepts_last_persistent_threat_detection_system_aerostat|title=Army accepts last Persistent Threat Detection System aerostat|work=www.army.mil|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Lockheed Martin engineers began updating existing naval aerostats with durable materials capable of achieving lift while carrying larger payloads of sensors, cameras and audio equipment. New tethers—lined with a mix of copper wires and fiber-optic cables—transmitted data to a ground control station, which then disseminated near real-time information of hostile activity to operational forces.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/ptds.html|title=Sentinels of the Sky: The Persistent Threat Detection System|website=Lockheed Martin|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aerostats are reconnaissance tool, gathering intelligence from 100 miles in every direction, 24 hours a day, for weeks on end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a special need for enhanced surveillance, especially in the attempt to counter improvised explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afcea.org/content/Article-researchers-stimulate-state-art-persistent-surveillance|title=Researchers Stimulate State-of-the-Art Persistent Surveillance|date=2015-12-30|work=SIGNAL Magazine|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] developed and then mounted PTDS with an acoustic-sensor array, known as the Unattended Transient Acoustic MASINT Sensor (UTAMS). The technology detects, locates, and cues a collocated imager to transient sounds, such as enemy mortar, rocket launches, and IED attacks, and calculates the ground location of the threat source. Adding this airborne detection – localization – cueing capability provides accurate intelligence to PTDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Unattended+Transient+Acoustic+MASINT+Sensor+(UTAMS)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk5antksLbAhVCwVkKHR8uDLgQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Unattended%20Transient%20Acoustic%20MASINT%20Sensor%20(UTAMS)&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160942310|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTDS is compatible with other technology developed by the Army Research Laboratory, such as Serenity Payload and FireFly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first PTDS was deployed by the US Army in 2004 and 37 PTDS units were acquired by 2010. Lockheed Martin delivered the final PTDS to the US Army in May 2012, bringing the total number of systems procured by the US Army to 66.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)===
A '''UGV''' is a vehicle kit system that advances perception, localization and motion planning to protect from IED threats and increase performance in autonomous missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLE|url=http://oshkoshdefense.com/technology-1/unmanned-ground-vehicle/|publisher=Oshkosh Defense|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically are adaptable to any tactical wheeled vehicle for the purpose of supervised [[Vehicular automation|autonomous navigation]] in either a lead or follow role. UGVs are multi-sensor systems which use registration techniques to provide accurate positioning estimates without needing to rely on continuous tracking through a lead vehicle or GPS signals. When equipped with a UGV, each vehicle is capable of navigation to the objective independently.

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''The Arnolfini Wedding'' (1434).]]
Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. In that case the dog could reflect wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, "Sexuality and social standing in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini double portrait", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', volume 43, issue 2, p. 270, Summer 1990, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2862365 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|150px|left|Coats of arms of the [[House of Tudor]]]]
[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the [[Royal Humane Society]], granting him a medal and access to food.&lt;ref name=newfoundlandart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newfoundland in Art &amp; Literature|url=http://www.ncanewfs.org/history/pages/landseer2.html|publisher=Newfoundland Club of America|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newfoundlanders with white patches are now recognized as a breed of their own,  as a "[[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=George M.|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-5887-4|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C61rTpmOOcu38QOQ4vEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was described by ''[[The Art Journal]]'' 1838 as being "one of the best and most interesting publications of the year", and "Mr Thomas Landseer's first great effort in this department of the art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Journal|year=1839|publisher=The Art Union|location=London|page=173|volume=I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7TlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K6drToKMMsju-gbVsZDMCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th century copy of the painting by [[George Cole (artist)|George Cole]] was sold by auctioneers [[Bonhams]] for £7,200 in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot Details: A Distinguished Member of The Humane Society|url=http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/14971/lot/12/|publisher=Bonhams|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized.

[[Pablo Picasso]] frequently included his canine companions in his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dogs in art|url=http://www.petcentric.com/read/articles/dogs-in-art.aspx?articleid=e2548d41-256f-4ff7-be93-968b1d2f7aa8|publisher=[[Nestlé Purina PetCare Company|Purina]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly well known and often featured in his work was a [[Dachshund]], named [[Lump (dog)|Lump]], who actually belonged to [[David Douglas Duncan]] but lived with Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Picasso's Dogs|url=http://moderndogmagazine.com/articles/picassos-dogs/20275|first=Stanley|last=Coren|accessdate=23 November 2013|publisher=Modern Dog Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of dogs have been extended as well to the artform of [[photography]], a noted example being the work of photographer [[Elliott Erwitt]].

[[File:PSM V51 D102 Slate tablet from davenport.jpg|thumb]]
'''The Davenport Tablets''' are three inscribed slate tablets found in mounds near [[Davenport, Iowa]].

==Discovery==
The first two tablets were discovered on January 10, 1877 by a local clergyman, the Reverend Jacob Gass, while engaged in an emergency excavation (due to the imminent transfer of the access rights) at the site known as Cook's Farm. In an excavation a year later (the access rights having been restored), Charles Harrison, the president of the Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences, while excavating there with Gass, found a third tablet. They are often associated in discussions with a pipe found by Gass and another Lutheran minister, the Reverend Ad Blumer in 1880 in a separate group of mounds, referred to as the 'elephant pipe' by Gass. Blumer gave the pipe to the Academy and shortly after his donation, the Academy acquired a similar pipe from Gass which he reported had been found by a farmer in Louisa County, Iowa. Charles Putnam wrote a vindication of the artifacts in 1885.

== Interpretations==

Initially, the authenticity of the Davenport artifacts was not questioned, and even received good reviews from people like [[Spencer Baird]], of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and businessman Charles E. Putnam. However, as the debate escalated from the pages of minor scholarly journals to the foremost news in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', eventually the tablets’ authenticity fell under the criticism of the new [[Smithsonian]] spokesman, [[Cyrus Thomas]]. Thomas lambasted them as “anomalous waifs,” that had absolutely no supporting, or contextual, evidence to aide in their authenticity.

[[University of Iowa]] Professor, Marshall McKusick, now refers to the find and the circumstances surrounding it as “The Davenport Conspiracy”. McKusick suggested that the tablets were modified roof tiles stolen off the Old Slate House, a house of prostitutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pinsky|first1=Randy|title=The Davenport Conspiracy: Revisited and Revised|url=http://pseudoarchaeology.org/a05/a05-pinsky.htm|website=Psuedoarchaeology|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, even though Gass described finding them in a burial mound on the Cook family farm.

McKusick suggested that the contextual ambiguity of the tablets – along with questions of Gass' honesty as an archaeologist, and even rumors of a plot by envious colleagues to plant the pseudo-artifacts in an effort to discredit and to expel the foreign-born Gass from his recently awarded post at the Davenport Academy – discredit the credibility of the Davenport Tablets.

In his 1991 book, ''The Davenport Conspiracy Revisited'', Professor Marshall McKusick asserts that Gass may have been the victim of an ill-advised joke played on him by fellow Davenport Academy members, who were possibly motivated by their jealousy of a foreign-born outsider in their midst. In 1874 Gass had made important discoveries of beautiful and complex [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] art at the Cook farm, such as copper axes. The level of technical ability and artistic craftsmanship by ancient Native Americans was evident in these artifacts. At a time when people digging along the [[Mississippi River]] in Iowa and Illinois were turning up nothing, Gass had the luck of hitting a genuine archaeological jackpot. After that date it is questionable as to what the motives of his academic rivals and relatives were.

Another explanation for the dubious origins of the artifacts might involve the credibility of Gass himself. It is believed that Gass dealt in fake Native American effigy pipes, such as the many examples illustrated in ''The Davenport Conspiracy Revisited''. Genuine effigy pipes are a testament to the creative abilities of the ancient Native American Indians, but their [[counterfeit]]s are of poor quality. Made of shale, clay, and limestone, these frauds were often traded amongst Gass and his colleagues, many ending up in the Davenport Academy museum. However, it is possible that Gass himself was not the perpetrator of these fakes, but was again under the influence of people who were jealous of his abilities and luck in selecting excavation sites. This time though, it was his own relatives, Edwin Gass and Adolph Blumer that persuaded him to take these fakes seriously and trade them.

"'''Duck and cover'''" is a method of personal protection against the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|effects of a nuclear explosion]]. Ducking and covering is useful at conferring a degree of protection to personnel situated outside the radius of the [[Nuclear weapon yield|nuclear fireball]] but still within sufficient range of the [[nuclear explosion]] that standing upright and uncovered is likely to cause serious injury or death. In the most [[literal and figurative language|literal]] interpretation, the focus of the maneuver is primarily on protective actions one can take during the first few crucial seconds-to-minutes after the event, while the film by the same name and a full encompassing of the advice, also caters to providing protection up to weeks after the event.

The countermeasure is intended as an alternative to the more effective [[A Day Called X|target/citywide emergency evacuation]] when these [[CRP-2B|crisis relocation programs]] would not be possible due to travel and time constraints. Maneuvers similar, but not identical, to ''Duck and Cover'' are also taught as the response to other sudden destructive events, the maneuvers that are advisable in an [[earthquake]] or [[tornado]], in the comparable situation where preventive [[emergency evacuation]] is similarly not an option, again, due to time constraints. In these analogously powerful events, ''Drop, Cover and Hold on'' likewise prevents injury or death if no other safety measures are taken.

As a [[countermeasure]] to the lethal effects of nuclear explosions, ''Duck and Cover'' is effective in both the event of a surprise nuclear attack,&lt;ref group="note" name="external"&gt;Although at the time that the advice first began to reach a large audience, in 1951 with the ''Duck and Cover'' film, the advent of [[Warning system|early warning RADARs]], such as the [[Pinetree Line]] of the era, increasingly made a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|successful surprise attack]] far less likely; however, numerous [[window of vulnerability|windows of vulnerability]] still remain, such as [[nap of the earth]] flying and the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]]&lt;/ref&gt; and during a nuclear attack of which the [[Civil defense siren|public has received some warning]], which would [[four minute warning|likely be about a few minutes]] prior to the [[nuclear weapon]] arriving.

==Procedure==

===During a surprise nuclear attack===
{{quote|Dropping immediately and covering exposed skin provide[s] protection against blast and thermal effects ... Immediately drop facedown. A log, a large rock, or any depression in the earth's surface provides some protection. Close eyes. Protect exposed skin from heat by putting hands and arms under or near the body and keeping the helmet on. Remain facedown until the blast wave passes and debris stops falling. Stay calm, check for injury, check weapons and equipment damage, and prepare to continue the mission.|[[US Army]] [[field manual]] FM 3–4 Chapter 4.&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Protection Field Manual (FM 3-4)|publisher=[[US Department of Defense]]|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Nuclear Protection|chapter-url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/army/fm/3-4/Ch4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313223255/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/army/fm/3-4/Ch4.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 March 2013|publication-date=21 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately after one sees the [[Bhangmeter#Description|first flash]] of intense heat and light of the developing nuclear fireball, one should stop, get under some cover and drop/duck to the ground. There, one should assume a [[Prone position|prone-like position]], lying face-down, and to afford protection against the [[Bhangmeter#Description|continuing heat of the explosion]] further cover exposed skin and the back of one's head with one's clothes; or, if no excess cover or cloth is available, one should cover the back of one's head and neck with one's hands.

Similar instructions, as presented in the ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]] '' film, are contained in the British 1964 [[public information film]] ''[[Civil Defence Information Bulletin]] No. 5''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqhaZmPFRg|title=Civil Defence Bulletin – No. 5|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=25 December 2006|accessdate=11 March 2013|type=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1980s ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' public information [[Film series|series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6U9T3R3EQg&amp;t=28m27s|title=''Protect and Survive: Action After Warnings'' 28:27–28:50 (part 10)|type=video|series=10|publisher=[[YouTube]]|publication-date=9 December 2012|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children in the [[Soviet Union]] likewise received almost identical classes on countermeasures, according to ''Inside the Kremlin's Cold War'' authors [[Lionel Gelber Prize|Zubok and Pleshakov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nHFCKmo2PH8C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Broken-Backed%20War#v=snippet&amp;q=inkwell&amp;f=false|title=One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture|first=Kenneth D.|last=Rose|date=1 May 2004|publisher=NYU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780814775233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. Army training, soldiers are taught to fall down immediately and cover their face and hands in much the same way as is described above.&lt;ref name="FM" /&gt;

In the classroom scene of the [[Duck and Cover (film)|film]], the rapid employment of [[school desk]]s, as an improvised shelter following the awareness of the initial light flash, is a countermeasure primarily to offer protection from potential ballistic window glass [[lacerations]] when the slower moving blast wave arrived. However, in higher [[effects of nuclear weapons|blast pressure zones]], where partial-to-total [[building collapse]] may occur, it would also serve a similar role to that borne out from experience in [[urban search and rescue]], where voids under the debris of collapsed buildings are common places for survivors to be found. More rigid examples of void-forming-tables to shelter under include the "[[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|Morrison indoor shelter]]", which was widely distributed by the millions in Britain as a protective measure against [[building collapse]], brought about by blast pressures generated during the [[Strategic bombing|conventional bombing]] of cities in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/history-of-the-battle-of-britain/air-raid-shelter-protection.aspx|title=Air Raid Shelter Protection - History of the Battle of Britain - Exhibitions &amp; Displays - Research - RAF Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWmorrisonshelter.htm|title=Morrison Shelters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/07/24/wwii-backyard-bunkers/|title=How families lived in their WWII backyard bomb bunkers|first=Alex|last=Arbuckle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/air-raid-shelters.htm|title=Air Raid Shelters: A short history of British air-raid shelters WW1 and WW2|date=1 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The building in which the table/Morrison shelter is situated was advised to be as free from combustible materials as possible, as the potential of a fire in the debris, post-collapse, would be fatal to those sheltering inside.&lt;/ref&gt;

====When warning is given====
Under the conditions where some warning is given, one is advised to find the nearest [[bomb shelter]], or if one could not be found, any well-built building to stay and [[shelter in place]]. Sheltering is, as depicted in the film, also the final phase of the "duck and cover" countermeasure in the surprise attack scenario.

===Cursory analysis===
The "duck and cover" countermeasure could save thousands. This is because people, being naturally inquisitive, would instead run to windows to try to locate the source of the immensely bright flash generated at the instant of the explosion. During this time, unbeknownst to them, the slower moving [[blast wave]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |title=The Nuclear Matters Handbook |accessdate=2013-11-30 |year=1991 |publisher=[[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs]] |quote=""Initially, this blast wave moves at several times the speed of sound, but it quickly slows to a point at which the leading edge of the blast wave is traveling at the speed of sound, and it continues at this speed as it moves farther away from ground zero" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302091606/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |archivedate=2013-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocw.nd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.nd.edu/physics/nuclear-warfare/notes/lecture-14 |title=Nuclear Warfare Lecture 14 by Professor Grant J.

===During earthquakes and tornadoes===
Similar advice to "duck and cover" is given in many situations where structural destabilization or flying debris may be expected, such as during an [[earthquake]] or [[tornado]]. At a sufficient distance from a [[nuclear explosion]], the [[blast wave]] produces similar results to these natural phenomena, so similar countermeasures are taken. In areas where earthquakes are common, a countermeasure known as "Drop, Cover, and Hold On!" is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shakeout.org/dropcoverholdon/|title=Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drills - Drop, Cover, and Hold On|accessdate=15 April 2015|website=ShakeOut|publisher=Southern California Earthquake Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthquakecountry.info/dropcoverholdon/|title=How to Protect Yourself During an Earthquake...

However despite having these few seconds of relatively unique warning, he did not stay on the ground for long enough after the ''flash'' subsided, and received some translational injuries due to prematurely standing-up again, at which point the slower moving blast wave swept past him and carried him with it for a few meters.&lt;ref name="nukefallout.com"/&gt;

Many people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died while searching the skies, curious to locate the source of the brilliant flash.&lt;ref name="Robert Trumbull pg 25,28"/&gt;

When people are indoors, running to windows to investigate the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash.

==Background==

The United States' monopoly on [[nuclear weapon]]s was broken by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1949 when it tested its first nuclear explosive, the [[RDS-1]]. With this, many in the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]], as well as many citizens, perceived that the United States was more vulnerable than it had ever been before. In 1950, during the first big Civil Defense push of the [[Cold War]]—and coinciding with the ''Alert America!'' initiative to educate Americans on nuclear preparedness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conelrad.com/books/folio.php?id=P382|title=ALERT AMERICA!|accessdate=15 April 2015|website=CONELRAD|publisher=CONELRAD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adult-orientated [[Survival Under Atomic Attack]] was published. It contains "duck and cover" or more accurately, cover and then duck advice without using those specific terms in its ''Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks'' section. ''1. Try to Get Shielded 2. Drop Flat on Ground or Floor 3. Bury Your Face in Your Arms ("crook of your elbow")''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/survivalunderato00bost|title=Survival under atomic attack|first=|last=Boston (Mass.

[[Image:SurvivalUnderAtomicAttack.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The adult-orientated ''[[Survival Under Atomic Attack]]'' issued in 1950, pre-dated the release of ''Duck and Cover'' in 1951-52. The booklet was accompanied by a companion film by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/0838_Survival_Under_Atomic_Attack_E01425_11_23_59_18 Survival Under Atomic Attack 1951 ''film'']&lt;/ref&gt;]] "Duck and cover" exercises quickly became a part of [[Civil Defense]] drills that every US citizen, from children to the elderly,{{dubious|date=August 2015}} was encouraged to practice{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} so that they could be ready in the event of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

Education efforts on the effects of nuclear weapons proceeded with stops-and-starts in the US due to competing alternatives. In a once classified, 1950s era, US [[Military simulation|war game]] that looked at varying levels of war escalation, warning and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education.&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb480/docs/doc+10A+1963.pdf|title=National Security Archive - 30+ Years of Freedom of Information Action|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time however the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as lesser in effectiveness, in [[cost-benefit analysis]] than a [[ballistic missile defense]] ([[Nike Zeus]]) system, and as the Soviet adversary was believed to be rapidly increasing their [[nuclear stockpile]], the [[efficacy]] of both would begin to enter a [[diminishing returns]] trend.&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"/&gt; When more became known about the cost and limitations of the [[Nike Zeus]] system, in the early 1960s the [[United States Secretary of Defense|head of the department of defense]] under president [[John F.

[[Robert McNamara]], determined the ineffectiveness of the Nike-Zeus system, especially in its [[benefit-cost ratio]] compared to other options. For instance, [[fallout shelter]]s would save more Americans for far less money.{{sfn|Yanarella|2010|p=87}}

===Blast effects===

====Outdoors====
To elucidate the effects on lying flat on the ground in attenuating a weapons [[Explosion|blast]], Miyoko Matsubara, one of the [[Hiroshima maidens]], when recounting the bombing in an interview in 1999, said that she was outdoors and ''less than 1 mile'' from the [[hypocenter]] of the [[Little Boy]] bomb.

Position of the body can have a considerable influence in protection from blast effects. Lying [[Prone position|prone]] on the ground will often materially lessen direct blast effects because of the protective [[defilade]] effects of irregularities in the ground surface. Ground also tends to deflect some of the blast forces upward. Standing close to a wall, even on the side from which the blast is coming, also lessens some of the effect. Orientation of the body also affects severity of the effect of blast. [[Anterior]] exposure of the body may result in lung injury, [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] position may result in more damage to one ear than the other, while minimal effects are to be anticipated with the [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] surface of the body (feet) toward the source of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/woundblstcs/chapter2.htm|title = Wound Ballistics in World War&amp;nbsp;II – Supplemented by Experiences in the Korean War|chapter = II: Ballistic Characteristics of Wounding Agents|editor-last = Coates, Jr.|editor-first = James Boyd|editor-last2 = Beyer|editor-first2 = James C.|publisher = The Historical Unit, United States Army Medical Service|lccn = 62-60002|year = 1984|location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body is more resistant to sheer overpressure than most buildings, however, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure, as in a [[hurricane]], are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing debris at high velocity, both with lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings.&lt;ref name="The Nuclear Matters Handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf |title=1) Effects of blast pressure on the human body |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Sumiteru Taniguchi]] recounts that, while clinging to the [[earthquake|tremoring]] road surface after the [[Fat Man]] detonation, he witnessing another child being blown away, the destruction of buildings around him and stones flying through the air.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/peoplescentury/episodes/fallout/taniguchitranscript.html |title= Interview with Sumiteru Taniguchi Japanese Citizen, Nagasaki |accessdate=2007-08-13 |date= 1999-06-15 |website= People's Century: Fallout |publisher= PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Akihiro Takahashi and his classmates were blown by the blast of [[Little Boy]] by a distance of about 10 meters, having survived due to not colliding with any walls etc. during his flight through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111hiroshima.html |title=Hiroshima Survivors' Testimony, Reformatted from the Original Electronic Text at Voice of Hibakusha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Katsuichi Hosoya had a near identical testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/hibakusha/english/shimen/happened/happened-01.html |title='What Happened On This Date' It's hot!

====Indoors====
In the testimony of Dr. Hiroshi Sawachika, although he was sufficiently far away from the [[Hiroshima bomb]] himself and not behind a [[Flat glass|pane of window glass]] when the blast wave arrived, those in his company who were had serious [[blast injury]] wounds, with broken glass and pieces of wood stuck into them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111hiroshima.html|title = Hiroshima Survivors' Testimony – Testimony of Hiroshi Sawachika, 1986|accessdate = 15 April 2015|publisher = [[Hanover College]] History Department|last = Sawachika|first = Hiroshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1946 book ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'' and other books which cover both bombings,&lt;ref name="Robert Trumbull pg 25,28" /&gt; in the days between the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], some survivors of the first bombing went to [[Nagasaki]] and told others what they had done to survive after the initial ''flash'' and informed them about the particularly dangerous threat of [[implosion (mechanical process)|imploding]] window glass. As a result of this timely warning, a number of lives were saved in the initial blast at [[Nagasaki]]. However these informed people were the exception and in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki many died while searching the skies, curious to locate the source of the brilliant flash.&lt;ref name="Robert Trumbull pg 25,28" /&gt;

When people are indoors, running to windows to investigate the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash. Thus, although the advice to duck and cover is over half a century old, ballistic glass [[laceration]]s caused the majority of the 1000 human injuries following the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] [[air burst]] of February 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="Heintz"/&gt;

The dangers of viewing explosions behind window glass was known of before the [[Atomic Age]] began, being a common source of injury and death from [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|large chemical explosions]]. In the accidental [[Halifax Explosion]] of 1917, an ammunition ship exploded with the force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]],&lt;ref name="Ruffman 1994, p.276"/&gt; and injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who looked out of their windows after seeing a bright flash. Every window in the city of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], was shattered.&lt;ref name="Chryssa N 1917"/&gt;

During the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] explosion, a fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 children from potentially life-threatening ballistic window glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks when she saw the flash. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's blast wave arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/world/europe/russians-seek-clues-and-count-blessings-after-meteor-blast.html?_r=1&amp; |title=After Assault From the Heavens, Russians Search for Clues and Count Blessings |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up study of the effects of the meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a [[Overpressure|blast overpressure]] are those of school buildings, which tend to be [[pressure|large in area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cams.seti.org/index-chelyabinsk.html|title=Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated that the urban [[area]] of glass breakage is nearly 16 times greater than the area of significant structural/building damage, although improved building codes since then may contribute to better building survival, there would be a higher likelihood of glass breakage and therefore potential injury/death for people near windows because many modern buildings have larger windows.&lt;ref name="nae.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/19804/19920.aspx |title= Reducing the Consequences of a Nuclear Detonation: Recent Research Author: Brooke Buddemeier, 2010 NAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike report said 30,200&amp;nbsp;ft, the official history said 31,600&amp;nbsp;ft, Commander Parson's log entry was 32,700&amp;nbsp;ft, and the navigator's log was 31,060&amp;nbsp;ft—the latter possibly an error transposing two digits. A later calculation using the indicated atmospheric pressure arrived at the figure of 32,200&amp;nbsp;ft. &lt;br&gt;Similarly, several values have been reported as the altitude of the Little Boy bomb at the moment of detonation. Published sources vary in the range of {{convert|1800|to|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the city. The device was set to explode at {{convert|1885|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but this was approximate. Malik (1985) uses the figure of {{convert|1903|ft|m|abbr=on}} plus or minus 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15 m), determined after data review by Hubbell ''et al.'' (1969). Radar returns from the tops of multistory buildings near the hypocenter may have triggered the detonation at a somewhat higher altitude than planned. Kerr ''et al.'' (2005) found that a detonation altitude of {{convert|600|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, plus or minus {{convert|20|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, gave the best fit for all the measurement discrepancies.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While not designed for those faced with low-yield [[neutron bomb]]s or for those who are, in general, so close to the nuclear fireball that prompt/initial radiation would be [[LD50|life-threatening in the short-medium term]], ducking and covering would nevertheless slightly reduce exposure to the ''initial'' [[gamma ray]]s, specifically the portion emitted after the first flash of visible light.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details/AssetMain?iaid=C1271982 |title=The advantage of lying prone in reducing the dose of gamma rays from an airburst atomic... &amp;#124; The National Archives |publisher=Discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial gamma rays are defined as those emitted from the fireball &amp; following mushroom cloud which can reach personnel on the ground for a total of approximately 1 minute, at which point the intensity of the radiation has diminished and the atmosphere itself is thick enough to act as full shielding.&lt;ref name="acq.osd.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |title=The Nuclear Matters Handbook |quote="For surface and low-air bursts, the fireball will rise quickly, and within approximately one minute, it will be at an altitude high enough similar that none of the gamma radiation produced inside the fireball will have any impact to people or equipment on the ground.

As approximately half of these gamma rays are emitted in the first second and the other half, over the following 59&lt;ref&gt;[''Desert Rock VI Exercise: "The Atom Soldier" 1955 US Army; The Big Picture TV-308'' circa 15 mins 30 secs]&lt;/ref&gt; alongside gamma rays being mostly emitted in a straight line, people laying on the ground will more likely have obstacles serving as [[radiation protection]] such as building walls, foundations, car engines, etc. between their bodies and the radiation emitted from both the fireball and the accompanying lower levels of radiation that continue to arrive at the ground for about 1 minute, during the mushroom cloud phase, which is termed "[[cloudshine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remm.nlm.gov/nuclearexplosion.htm|title=Nuclear Detonation: Weapons, Improvised Nuclear Devices  - Radiation Emergency Medical Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also give protection from the even smaller fraction of radiation that changes direction and is randomly [[Compton scattering|reflected and scattered]] by the air/"[[skyshine]]".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=opAklHndAy8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22fukuryu+maru%22+ash|title=Structure shielding against fallout gamma rays from nuclear detonations|first1=Lewis Van Clief|last1=Spencer|first2=Arthur B.|last2=Chilton|first3=Charles|last3=Eisenhauer|first4=Center for Radiation|last4=Research|first5=United States National Bureau of|last5=Standards|first6=University of Illinois at|last6=Urbana-Champaign|date=1 January 1980|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately "One and one half inches"/37&amp;nbsp;mm of [[steel]] will reduce gamma dose by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjHriyuzDz4 |title=Big Picture: Individual Protection Against Atomic Attack - National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 2569661 / Local Identifier 111-TV-393 - DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Unlike the relatively [[TNT equivalent|low-yield]], or low explosive energy "[[A-bomb]]s" dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which did result in a sizable proportion of injuries from prompt radiation, higher yield "[[hydrogen bomb]]s" ([[thermonuclear]] weapons) are not expected to result in very many such injuries&amp;nbsp;– as the range at which the [[ionizing radiation]] from higher yield devices is of primary concern, is already well inside the hyper-lethal blast and flash burn areas.&lt;ref name="Mock up"/&gt;&lt;ref name = negligible/&gt;

Apart from the intrinsic "prompt effects" of nuclear detonations, that of thermal flash, blast and initial radiation releases, if any part of the fireball of the nuclear detonation contacts the ground, in what is known as a [[surface burst]], another, comparatively slowly increasing, radiation hazard will also begin to form in the immediate area.&lt;ref name="nuchandb"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAUYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=65#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |title=Nuclear handbook for medical service personnel|author=United States.

Putting aside the possibility of the detonation occurring during an already established heavy rain-storm, the formation of this life-threatening "[[nuclear fallout|delayed nuclear radiation]]" manifests only when the altitude, or "[[airburst|height of burst]]" of the explosion, is such that both the fireball and the [[buoyant]] updrafts it creates, sufficiently heats and lifts the [[soil]] that was below it into the core of the mushroom cloud. Once there, the very hot [[radioactive isotope]] products of the [[nuclear reaction]]s that produced the explosion, begin to [[:wikt:coalesce|coalesce]] with the cooler and denser soil. Upon cooling, this mixture begins to locally ''[[nuclear fallout|fall-out]]'' or [[precipitate]]-out of the [[mushroom cloud]], falling back to the surface of the earth, near to the point of detonation, over the next few minutes and hours.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-unexpected-return-of-duck-and-cover/68776/|title=The Unexpected Return of 'Duck and Cover'|first=Glenn Harlan|last=Reynolds|website=The Atlantic|date = 4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the duck and cover countermeasure, in its most basic form, offers a small to negligible protection against [[fallout]], the technique assumes that after the effects of the blast and initial radiation subside, with the latter of which being no longer a threat after about "twenty seconds" to 1 minute post detonation,&lt;ref name="acq.osd.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; a person who ducks and covers will realize when it is wise to cease ducking and covering (after the blast and initial radiation danger has passed) and to then seek out a more sheltered area, like an established or improvised [[fallout shelter]] to protect themselves from the ensuing potential [[nuclear fallout|local fallout]] danger, as depicted in the [[Duck and Cover (film)|film]].

After all, "Duck and Cover" is a first response countermeasure only, in much the same way that "Drop, Cover and Hold On" is during an earthquake, with the advice having served its purpose once the earthquake has passed, and possibly other dangers—like a [[tsunami]] or fallout—may be looming, which then require movement to high ground and radiation protection, respectively.

However, if such a shelter is unavailable, the person should then be advised to follow the [[Shelter in Place]] protocol, or if given, [[emergency evacuation]] advice. Evacuation orders would entail exiting the area completely by following a path [[perpendicular]] to the [[wind direction]], and therefore perpendicular to the path of the fallout [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/prep_nuclear_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Nuclear Attack |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |accessdate=|date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking upper atmospheric winds into account, surface winds alone are not to be depended upon as indicative of the direction of fallout movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Radiolog1961 radiological defense 1961 ''c 12 minutes'']&lt;/ref&gt; "Sheltering in place" is staying indoors, in a preferably [[airtight|sealed tight]] basement, or internal room, for a number of hours, with the oxygen supply available in such a scenario being more than sufficient for 3+ hours in even the smallest average room, under the assumption that the improvised seal is perfect, until [[carbon dioxide]] levels begin to reach [[Hypercapnia|unsafe values]] and necessitate room unsealing for a number of minutes to create a room [[Air changes per hour|air change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orise.orau.gov/csepp/documents/planning/reports/misc-reports/paperSIP010406.pdf |title=Journal of Hazardous Materials A119 (2005) 31–40 Effectiveness of expedient sheltering in place in a residence, James J.

In the era the advice was originally given, the most common nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US [[Fat Man]] and Soviet [[Joe-1]] in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as [[airburst]]s, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from [[fallout]]. This is due to the fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an [[airburst]] is the preferred [[proximity fuze|nuclear fuzing]] height,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years, 1943-1945|last1 =Hoddeson|first1 = Lillian|last2 = Henriksen|first2 = Paul W. |last3 = Meade|first3 = Roger A.|last4 = Westfall|first4= Catherine|date = 1993|pages=183–184|url = https://books.google.com/?id=kBBu7lTJc4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9780521441322|publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hawkins|1961|pp=98–99}} as it exploits the [[Blast wave#Mach Stem Formation|mach stem]] phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected.

However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris is dispersed into the [[stratosphere]], with a great [[Radiation shielding#Shielding design|column of air]] therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/[[fission products|fission reaction products]] and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it [[fallout|falls out]] of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion. This "delayed fallout" is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a [[surface burst]].&lt;ref name="fourmilab.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/ |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Operation Crossroads]] tests of 1946 on [[Bikini Atoll]], using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker (a near surface shallow underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.

Widespread radioactive fallout itself was not recognized as a threat among the public at large before 1954, until the widely publicized story of the 15-megaton surface burst of the experimental test shot [[Castle Bravo]] on the [[Marshall Islands]]. The explosive yield of the [[Castle Bravo]] device ''the Shrimp'' was unexpectedly high, and therefore correspondingly higher amounts of local fallout were produced. When this arrived at their location carried by the wind, this caused the 23 crew members on a Japanese fishing boat known as the [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]] to come down with [[acute radiation sickness]] with varying degrees of seriousness&lt;ref name="massburns"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=%22beta+burns%22&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beta%20burns%22&amp;f=false |page=248|title=Mass burns: proceedings of a workshop, 13–14 March 1968|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

It is, however, unlikely that a well-funded [[belligerent]] with nuclear weapons would waste their weapons with fuzing to explode below or on the surface, as both test [[Operation Crossroads|shot Baker]], and [[Castle Bravo]] were respectively. Instead, to maximize the range of city blast destruction and immediate death, an air burst is preferred,&lt;ref name="fourmilab.ch"/&gt; as the ≈500 meter explosion heights of the only nuclear weapons used on cities, [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]] also attest to.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Nichols|Nichols, K. D.]] "The Road to Trinity" pages 175, 198, 223 (1987, Morrow, New York) {{ISBN|0-688-06910-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with air bursts the total amount of radiation contained in the fallout, in units of activity/[[becquerel]], is somewhat less than the total that would be released from a surface or subsurface burst, as in comparison, depending on the height of burst, little to no [[neutron activation]] or neutron induced gamma activity of soil occurs from air bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disaster Medicine |edition = 2nd |year = 2007 |editor-first = David E. |editor-last = Hogan|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hgLccSb8DIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page = 384 |chapter = Nuclear Detonations: Evaluation and Response|last = Fong|first = Fun H., Jr.|isbn = 9780781762625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the initial danger from concentrated local/'early' [[fallout]] (which takes on the color of the soil around the fireball, commonly with a dusty [[pumice]] or [[wood ash|ash]]-like appearance, as experienced by the crew of the [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]) remains low in a global nuclear war scenario. Instead the fallout most likely to be encountered by most survivors in this scenario is expected to be the less dangerous but widely spread global/'late' [[fallout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/ |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, chapter IX |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An air burst at optimum height will produce a negligible amount of early fallout.&lt;ref&gt;Fong (2007), pp. 384 &amp; 385&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable comparison to underline this is found when one compares the 50 megaton air-burst [[Tsar Bomba]], which produced no concentrated local/early fallout, and thus no known deaths from radiation, with the surface burst of the 15 megaton [[Castle Bravo]], which in comparison, due to the local fallout produced, was implicated in the death of 1 of 23 crew on the [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]] and made the entire [[Bikini Atoll]] unfit for further nuclear testing until enough time elapsed and the intensity of the radiation field had [[radioactive decay|decayed]] to acceptable levels.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By 1958, a total of 23 nuclear devices were exploded on or near the atoll,{{cite web|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/BIKINICORALS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195238/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/BIKINICORALS.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }} with the majority occurring after the 1954 [[Operation Castle]] series, resulting in a total of about 42 megatons of pure [[fission product]] fallout being generated around the atoll. This made permanent above ground habitation without [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] unwise for a decade or so; it was thus resettled in 1968. The inhabitants lived there again from 1968 to 1978, abandoning the atoll in 1978. As of 2014, the atoll has had infrequent inhabitants since the 1990s, mainly for tours&amp;nbsp;– a return to permanent safe habitation would require locally produced and consumed plant food to be grown with fertilizer, or alternatively, only imported plant food to be eaten.[http://www-ns.iaea.org/appraisals/bikini-atoll.asp] [http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/Paradise-With-An-Asterisk.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, regardless of if a nuclear attack on a city is of the surface or air-burst variety or a mixture of both, the advice to [[shelter in place]], in the interior of well-built homes, or if available, [[fallout shelter]]s, as suggested in the film ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'', will drastically reduce one's chance of absorbing a hazardous dose of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1184.html |title=Radiological and Nuclear Incidents |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316000711/http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1184.html |archivedate=2013-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A real-world example of this occurred after the [[Castle Bravo]] test where, in contrast to the crew of the [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]], the firing crew that triggered the explosion safely sheltered in their firing station until after a number of hours had passed and the radiation levels outside fell to dose rate levels safe enough for an evacuation to be considered.&lt;ref name="Dr. John C.

The minimum typical protection factor of the [[fallout shelter]]s in US cities is 40 or more.

A protection factor of at least 40 means that the [[radiation shielding]] provided by the shelter reduces the radiation dose experienced by at least 40 times that which would be experienced outside the shelter with no shielding. "Protection factor" is equivalent to the modern term "dose reduction factor".&lt;ref name="Planning Guidance"/&gt;

During the first hour after a nuclear explosion, radioactivity levels drop precipitously. Radioactivity levels are further reduced by about 90% after another 7 hours and by about 99% after 2 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; An accurate rule of thumb, applicable in the time-period of days to a few weeks post-detonation which approximates the radioactive dose rate generated by the decay of the myriad of isotopes present in nuclear fallout, is the "[[Nuclear fallout#The Seven Ten Rule|7/10 rule]]".&lt;ref name="radiological defense 1961"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Radiolog1961 radiological defense 1961]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The rule states that for each 7-fold increase in time the dose rate drops by a factor of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_Warfare_9.pdf |title=Radiation Effects of a Nuclear Bomb |publisher=3.nd.edu |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, assuming the fallout process has ended 24 hours post detonation and the dose rate would be lethal if a few hours of exposure occurred, 50 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] per hour, then 7 days after detonation the dose rate will be 5 R/hr and 49 days after detonation (7×7 days) the dose rate will be 0.5 R/hr at which point no special precautions would need to be taken and venturing outside into that dose rate for an hour or two would pose a close to negligible health hazard,&lt;ref name="radiological defense 1961"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nikealaska.org/nuke/fallout.html |title=Understanding Radioactive Fallout |publisher=Nikealaska.org |date=2006-01-07 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus permitting an evacuation to be done with acceptable safety to a known contamination free zone. Following a surface-burst nuclear detonation, approximately 80 percent of the fallout would be deposited on the ground during the first 24 hours.&lt;ref name="ready1"/&gt;

Some agencies that promoted "evacuate immediately" guidance as a response to potentially lethal fallout arriving, advice which may have been influenced by these agencies assuming simplistic single wind-driven [[cigar]]/[[Gauss]]ian shaped fallout contours would be representative of reality, have since retracted this advice. This can actually result in higher radiation exposures as it would put people outdoors and in harm's way when the radiation levels would be highest. The Modeling and Analysis Coordination Working Group (MACWG)&amp;nbsp;– which was set up to resolve conflicting advice given by various agencies, has reaffirmed that the best blanket advice that would reduce the number of casualties by the greatest amount is: "Early, adequate sheltering followed by informed, delayed evacuation."&lt;ref name="nae.edu"/&gt;

Expert advice published in the 2010 document ''Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation'' is to [[shelter in place]], in an area away from building fires, for at least 1 to 2 hours following a nuclear detonation and fallout arriving,&lt;ref name="Planning Guidance"/&gt;  and the greatest benefit, assuming personnel are in a building with a high protection factor, is sheltering for no less than 12 to 24 hours before evacuation.&lt;ref name="Planning Guidance"/&gt; Therefore, sheltering for the first few hours can save lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remm.nlm.gov/nuclearexplosion.htm |title=Nuclear Detonation: Weapons, Improvised Nuclear Devices - Radiation Emergency Medical Management |publisher=Remm.nlm.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, death and injury from local fallout is regarded by experts as the most preventable of all the effects of a nuclear detonation, being simply dependent on if personnel know how to identify an adequate shelter when they see one and enter one quickly, with the number of potential people saved being cited as in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChZUuM-uJ0E |title=Reducing consequences of nuclear detonation |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttv1NLf6Cs4 |title=Brooke Buddemeier, Nuclear Detonation in a Major City |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prod.sandia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2011/119092.pdf |title=Analysis of Sheltering and Evacuation Strategies for a National Capital Region Nuclear Detonation Scenario, SANDIA REPORT, SAND 2011-9092 Unlimited Release Published December 2011.

If a building with a PF of 20 or more is nearby, such as the fallout shelters depicted in the [[Duck and Cover (film)|film]], in the vast majority of fallout circumstances, it would not be advisable to leave it until 3+ hours have elapsed following the initial arrival of the local fallout.&lt;ref name="prod.sandia.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urban Nuclear Detonation Scenario 2009"/&gt;

Following a single IND (improvised nuclear device) detonation in the US, the [[National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center]] (NARAC) would, within minutes to at most hours, after the detonation have a reliable prediction of the fallout plume size and direction. When armed with this prediction they would then begin attempting to corroborate this with readings from radiation [[survey meter]] equipment that would [[nap of the earth|fly over close to the ground]] in the affected area by means of helicopter or drone ([[UAV]]) aircraft on [[Materials MASINT|material intelligence]] gathering missions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Radiolog1961 radiological defense 1961.

Once a general outline and direction of the fallout is determined, disseminating this information to citizens sheltering-in-place would soon follow, by means of [[loudspeaker]], radio, cell phone etc., with a "Fallout App" containing maps for [[smart phone]]s being regarded as an area of interest so that survivors don't inadvertently evacuate downwind further into harm's way.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/19804/19892.aspx |title= A Nuclear Explosion in a City or an Attack on a Nuclear Reactor Author: Richard L.

===Nuclear electromagnetic pulse, non-lethal===
{{See also|National Response Scenario Number One}}
In respect to the other non-lethal weapon effects from an IND detonated on or near the surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid [[Power outage|blackout]] due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/[[electrical load]], while the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so [[cell phone]] towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; But if [[Communication during the September 11 attacks#General public|communications during the 9/11 attacks]] or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone [[cell tower|network towers]] survive, the service would be overloaded (a [[mass call event]]) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and [[emergency responders]] are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service.

The Civil Defense (CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality. They contained amongst other things, at least one ruggedized [[Civil Defense Geiger counters#Type CDV-715|CDV-715]] radiation survey meter and one [[CONELRAD|CD emergency radio receiver]] which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help though if communications continued, the radio receiver was to inform them of the outside situation as it developed.

The dubious assumption that "only the [[cockroach]]es" would survive the post-war fallout environment was frequently used in an attempt to criticize ''Duck and Cover'' during the height of the cold war, contextually at a time when discussion of a [[total war]] involved the much greater US-Soviet arsenal of nuclear weapons that were [[Megatons to Megawatts Program|then in existence]].

In material terms, the primary life-threatening risk survivors and [[downwinders]] could face in the long-term after a nuclear explosion or war, is the "[[nuclear famine]]" issue, the potential continuation of hostilities by [[conventional warfare]] and [[radioactive contamination]] of the food and water supplies, disrupting the normal distribution and consumption, of these vital goods.

Cold-War [[continuity of government]] planners and civil defense organizations in general have always had this disruption, or "nuclear famine" issue in mind, as widespread infrastructure destruction producing starvation conditions was also seen during and after [[WWII]]. Papers such as ''On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3764.html|title=On Reorganizing After Nuclear Attack|date=1 January 1968|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Survival of the relocated population of the U.S. after a nuclear attack'' by Nobel Prize winner, [[Eugene Wigner]], detail the thought and attention that went into long-term survival, relocation and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1976/3445600218921.pdf Survival of the relocated population of the U.S. after a nuclear attack 1976. full PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207061152/http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1976/3445600218921.pdf |date=2017-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who have approached the problem from a far more extreme view, assuming far worse events such as [[comet impact]]s, as discussed in the book ''[[Feeding Everyone No Matter What]]'', have suggested; [[natural-gas]]-digesting bacteria the most well known being [[Methylococcus capsulatus]], that is presently used as a feed in [[Fish farming]],&lt;ref&gt;- [http://www.unibio.dk/] "UniBio A/S – turns NG to fish food"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bark bread]] a long-standing [[famine food]] utilizing the edible [[Phloem|inner bark]] of trees once a part of Scandinavian history during the [[Little Ice Age]] and the expansion of [[leaf protein concentrate]] and larger scale [[Wood-decay fungus|wood digesting]] [[fungiculture]] for [[fungal protein]], with the most common of which being [[shittake mushroom]]s and [[honey fungi]], as they do not need sunlight or soil to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Hazeltine, B. &amp; Bull, C. 2003 ''Field Guide to Appropriate Technology''. San Francisco: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced techniques mentioned, that are not presently economical also include variations of wood or [[cellulosic biofuel]] production, which typically already creates edible [[sugar]]s/[[xylitol]] from inedible cellulose, as an intermediate product before the final step of alcohol generation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plant.ca/general/biofuel-process-to-develop-sugar-substitute-cellulose-ethanol-304/ Biofuel process to develop sugar substitute, cellulose ethanol.

==Historical and psychological assessment==
Some [[historian]]s and filmmakers, exemplified by the 1982 ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'', have thus far sought to dismiss civil defense advice as mere propaganda, despite, as other historians have found, detailed scientific research programs laying behind the much-mocked government civil defense pamphlets of the 1950s and 1960s, including the prompt advice of ducking and covering.&lt;ref name="Journals.cambridge.org"/&gt;

In U.S. Army training, soldiers are taught to immediately fall down, covering face and hands in much the same way as is described by the advice to duck and cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/army/fm/3-4/Ch4.htm#para1 |title=field manual FM 3-4 Chapter 4. "Dropping immediately and covering exposed skin provide[s] protection against blast and thermal effects."..."Immediately drop facedown. A log, a large rock, or any depression in the earth's surface provides some protection. Close eyes. Protect exposed skin from heat by putting hands and arms under or near the body and keeping the helmet on. Remain facedown until the blast wave passes and debris stops falling. Stay calm, check for injury, check weapons and equipment damage, and prepare to continue the mission."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercises of Cold War [[civil defense]] are seen by historian Guy Oakes in 1994, as having less practical use than psychological use: to keep the danger of nuclear war high on the public mind, while also attempting to assure the American people that something could be done to defend against nuclear attack.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Guy. ''The Imaginary War: Civil Defense and Cold War Culture''. 1994, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-509027-6}}, pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to contemporary Cold War civil defense pamphlets, like ''[[Protect and Survive|Civil Defence: Why we need it]]'' released in 1981, civil defense countermeasures were presented as analogous to [[seat belt]]s, and that the suggestion that knowing what steps to take in the "slight" possibility that a nuclear explosion occurs in your region, keeps such calamities high on the public mind, is "like saying people who wear seat belts are expecting to have more crashes than those who do not", and as with a seat belt, there is never a suggestion that if the countermeasure were implemented, it would save everyone.

Moreover, civil defense was not solely a US-UK or [[nuclear club]] phenomenon; countries with long histories of neutrality, such as [[Switzerland]], are "foremost in their civil defence precautions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomica.co.uk/cdwhy.htm |title=CIVIL DEFENCE why we need it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_world | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornadoes==
{{see also|Tornado drill}}
[[File:Tornado drill.jpg|thumb|Students participate in a tornado drill, lining up along an interior wall and covering their heads. Tornado drills are an important element in [[tornado preparedness]]. Similar to other [[evidence based]] safety drills, they teach effective countermeasures and therefore increase survival rates if/when a tornado hits.]]
Ducking and covering does have certain applications in other, more natural disasters. In states prone to [[tornado]]es, school children are urged to "duck and cover" against a solid inner wall of a school, if time does not permit seeking better shelter—such as a [[storm cellar]]—during a [[tornado warning]]. The tactic is also widely practiced in schools in states along the [[West Coast of the United States]], where [[earthquakes]] are commonplace. Ducking and covering in either scenario would theoretically afford significant protection from falling or flying debris.

==Earthquakes==
{{see also|Nuclear bunker buster}}
In an [[earthquake]], which are generally of a natural [[tectonic plate]] origin (although they can be artificially generated by the detonation of a nuclear explosive device in which sufficient energy is transmitted into the ground, with an extreme case to serve as an example of this phenomenon being the [[Operation Grommet]] ''[[Cannikin]]'' test of the 5 megaton [[W71]] warhead [[Underground nuclear testing|exploded deep underground]] on [[Amchitka]] Island in 1971, which produced a [[seismic shock]] quake of 7.0 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]) people are encouraged, regardless of the cause of the quake, to "drop, cover, and hold on": to get underneath a piece of furniture, cover their heads and hold on to the furniture. This advice also encourages people not to run out of a shaking building, because a large majority of earthquake injuries are due to broken bones from people falling and tripping during shaking. While it is unlikely that "drop, cover and hold on" will protect against a building collapse, in earthquake-prone areas in the United States [[building code]]s require that buildings withstand quakes up to an expected magnitude enough to allow evacuation after shaking stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13962-tornado-safety-building-codes.html |title=Why Aren't There Tornado Safety Building Codes?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mceer.buffalo.edu/infoservice/Reference_Services/usCodes.asp#3 |title=Directory of Building Codes &amp; Regulations: City &amp; State Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mceer.buffalo.edu/infoservice/Reference_Services/USInternationalCodes.asp |title=U.S. &amp; International Seismic Codes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nehrp.gov/library/guidance_new.htm |title=National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program - Comparison of U.S. and Chilean Building Code Requirements and Seismic Design Practice 1985-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus a building collapse of these structures (even during an earthquake) is rare. "Drop, cover and hold on" may not be appropriate for all locations or building types, but the [[Red Cross]] advises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/static/file_cont164_lang0_71.pdf |title=Drop, Cover, and Hold On – American Red Cross drill (pdf file) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316024324/http://www.redcross.org/static/file_cont164_lang0_71.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the appropriate emergency response to an earthquake in the United States.

This region stretched from the south of [[Basra]] along the [[Persian Gulf]] coast and included the regions of [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Al-Hasa]], [[Qatif]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], [[Basra Governorate|Southern Iraq]], and [[Musandam Governorate|Northern Oman]]. The entire [[coastal strip]] of Eastern Arabia was known as “Bahrain” for ten centuries.&lt;ref name="maj"/&gt;

Until very recently, the whole of Eastern Arabia, from [[southern Iraq]] to the [[Al Hajar Mountains|mountains of Oman]], was a place where people moved around, settled and married unconcerned by national borders.&lt;ref name="maj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;dq|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001|pages=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Eastern Arabia shared a [[Marine (ocean)|culture based on the sea]]; they are [[seafaring]] peoples.&lt;ref name="maj"/&gt;

==Etymology==
In Arabic, ''Bahrayn'' is the [[dual form]] of ''bahr'' (“sea”), so ''al-Bahrayn'' means "the Two Seas". However, which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; The term appears five times in the [[Quran|Qur'an]], but does not refer to the modern island{{mdash}}originally known to the Arabs as “Awal”{{mdash}}but rather to the oases of [[al-Katif]] and [[Hadjar]] (modern [[al-Hasa]]).&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam,'' Vol. I. “Bahrayn”, p. 941. E.J. Brill (Leiden), 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when the term began to refer exclusively to the Awal islands, but it was probably after the 15th century. Today, Bahrain's “two seas” are instead generally taken to be the bay east and west of the coast,&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA45 Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites]''. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2248-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the seas north and south of the island,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground.&lt;ref name="Faroughy"&gt;Faroughy, Abbas. ''The Bahrein Islands (750–1951): A Contribution to the Study of Power Politics in the Persian Gulf.'' Verry, Fisher &amp; Co. (New York), 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wells, there are places in the sea north of Bahrain where fresh water bubbles up in the middle of the salt water, noted by visitors since antiquity.

An alternate theory offered by Al-Hasa was that the two seas were the [[Great Green Ocean]] and a peaceful lake on the mainland;{{which|date=September 2011}} still another provided by [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari|al-Jawahari]] is that the more formal name ''Bahri'' (lit. “belonging to the sea”) would have been misunderstood and so was opted against.&lt;ref name="Faroughy"/&gt; The term "Gulf Arab" solely refers, geographically, to inhabitants of eastern Arabia.&lt;ref name="east"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEC9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q|title=Eastern Arabia Historic Photographs: Kuwait, 1900-1936|work=Ahmad Mustafa Abu-Hakima|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Khaleejis" is often misused to identify all the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="east"/&gt;

== Population ==
{{main|Culture of Eastern Arabia}}
The inhabitants of Eastern Arabia's Gulf coast share similar cultures and music styles such as [[fijiri]], [[sawt (music)|sawt]] and [[liwa (music)|liwa]]. The most noticeable cultural trait of Eastern Arabia's Gulf Arabs is their [[Seafaring|orientation and focus towards the sea]].&lt;ref name="an"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsU798UPaeYC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq|title=Iranians in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates|work=Eric Andrew McCoy|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sea|Maritime]]-focused life in the small Gulf Arab states has resulted in a [[Seafaring|sea-oriented society]] where livelihoods have traditionally been earned in [[Marine Industries|marine industries]].&lt;ref name="an"/&gt;

The Arabs of Eastern Arabia speak a dialect known as [[Gulf Arabic]]. Most Saudis do not speak Gulf Arabic because most Saudis do not live in Eastern Arabia.&lt;ref name="ksa"/&gt; There are approximately 2 million Gulf Arabic speakers in Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref name="ksa"/&gt; mostly in the coastal [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|eastern region]].&lt;ref name=ksa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA38&amp;d&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TOzdUePFGYzLtAaZmYGwBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Volume 1 |work= William Frawley |date= 2003 |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/sa/languages Languages of Saudi Arabia] ''[[Ethnologue]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC was formed in 1981]], the term "Khaleeji" was solely used to refer to the [[Eastern Arabia#Population|inhabitants of Eastern Arabia]].&lt;ref name="east"/&gt;

==History==
In pre-Islamic times, the population of Eastern Arabia consisted of [[Arab Christians|partially Christianized Arabs]], Arab [[Zoroastrians]], [[Mizrahi Jews|Jews]]&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7942/1/7942_4940.PDF?+UkUDh:CyT|title=Social and political change in Bahrain since the First World War|pages=46–47|work=[[Durham University]]|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aramaic]]-speaking agriculturalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR24&amp;dq|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001|pages=XXIV-XXVI|quote=Thus the elements in the pre-Islamic ethno-linguistic situation in eastern Arabia appear to have been a mixed tribal population of partially Christianised Arabs of diverse origins who probably spoke different old Arabian vernaculars; a mobile Persian-speaking population, possibly of traders and administrators, with strong links to Persia, which they maintained close contact; a sedentary, non-tribal community of Aramaic-speaking agriculturalists; a Persian clergy, who we know for certain, used Syriac as a language of liturgy and writing more generally, probably alongside Persian as a spoken language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="om"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8glrgh87kEC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq|title=Tradition and Modernity in Arabic Language And Literature|work=J R Smart|year=2013|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq|title=E.J.

===Dilmun===
{{Main|Dilmun}}
[[Image:Near East in 1000bc (en).jpg|thumb|300px|Dilmun and its neighbors in the 10th century BC.]]
Dilmun appears first in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] clay tablets dated to the end of fourth millennium BC, found in the temple of goddess [[Inanna]], in the city of [[Uruk]]. The adjective '''Dilmun''' is used to describe a type of axe and one specific official; in addition there are lists of rations of wool issued to people connected with Dilmun.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;''Dilmun and Its Gulf Neighbours'' by Harriet E. W. Crawford, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilmun was mentioned in two letters dated to the reign of [[Burna-Buriash II]] (c. 1370 BC) recovered from [[Nippur]], during the [[Kassites|Kassite]] dynasty of [[Babylon]]. These letters were from a provincial official, [[Ilī-ippašra]], in Dilmun to his friend Enlil-kidinni in Mesopotamia. The names referred to are [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. These letters and other documents, hint at an administrative relationship between Dilmun and [[Babylon]] at that time. Following the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, Mesopotamian documents make no mention of Dilmun with the exception of Assyrian inscriptions dated to 1250 BC which proclaimed the Assyrian king to be king of Dilmun and [[Meluhha]]. Assyrian inscriptions recorded tribute from Dilmun. There are other Assyrian inscriptions during the first millennium BC indicating Assyrian sovereignty over Dilmun.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=50-51}} Dilmun was also later on controlled by the [[Kassite dynasty]] in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6KeP3v79MQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq|title=Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500 BC to 300 AD|work= Harriet Crawford, Michael Rice |year= 2000 |pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early sites discovered in Bahrain indicate that [[Sennacherib]], king of Assyria (707–681 BC), attacked northeast Persian Gulf and captured Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"&gt;{{cite book|title=Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography|last=Mojtahed-Zadeh |first=Pirouz |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Curzon |location=Richmond, Surrey |isbn=0700710981}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=May 2017}} The most recent reference to Dilmun came during the [[Neo-Babylon]]ian dynasty. Neo-Babylonian administrative records, dated 567 BC, stated that Dilmun was controlled by the king of Babylon. The name of Dilmun fell from use after the collapse of Neo-Babylon in 538 BC.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=50-51}}

There is both literary and archaeological evidence of extensive trade between [[Ancient Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (probably correctly identified with the land called ''[[Meluhha]]'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of [[Harappa]] were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indus Valley seals have turned up at [[Ur]] and other Mesopotamian sites.

The “Persian Gulf” types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun, that appear at [[Lothal]] in [[Gujarat]], India, and [[Failaka]], as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known: timber and precious woods, [[ivory]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[gold]], and luxury goods such as [[carnelian]] and glazed stone beads, [[pearl]]s from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for [[silver]], [[tin]], woolen textiles, olive oil and grains. [[Copper]] ingots from Oman and [[bitumen]] which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were in fact identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia.

:“''the ships of Dilmun, from the foreign land, brought him wood as a tribute''”.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=33}}

Mesopotamian trade documents, lists of goods, and official inscriptions mentioning Meluhha supplement Harappan seals and archaeological finds. Literary references to Meluhhan trade date from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Isin]]-[[Larsa]] Periods (c. 2350 – 1800 BC), but the trade probably started in the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2600 BC). Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports, but by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade. The [[Bahrain National Museum]] assesses that its "Golden Age" lasted from c. 2200 BC to 1600 BC. Discoveries of ruins under the Persian Gulf maybe of Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/09/ancient_dilmun_garden_eden_gulf_lost_civilisation/  The UK Register, Science, Lost ancient civilisation's ruins lie beneath Gulf, By Lewis Page Science, December 9, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mesopotamian [[epic poetry|epic poem]] [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], [[Gilgamesh]] had to pass through Mount [[Mashu]] to reach Dilmun, Mount Mashu is usually identified with the whole of the parallel [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon]] and [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon]] ranges, with the narrow gap between these mountains constituting the tunnel.&lt;ref name="UnwinUnwin1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. T. H. Unwin|author2=Tim Unwin|title=Wine and the Vine: An Historical Geography of Viticulture and the Wine Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6XRp6gY8ucC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=18 June 1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-14416-2|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilmun, sometimes described as “the place where the sun rises” and “the Land of the Living”, is the scene of some versions of the [[Sumerian creation myth]], and the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, [[Utnapishtim]] ([[Ziusudra]]), was taken by the gods to live forever. [[Thorkild Jacobsen]]'s translation of the Eridu Genesis calls it ''"Mount Dilmun"'' which he locates as a ''“faraway, half-mythical place”''.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thorkild Jacobsen|title=The Harps that once--: Sumerian poetry in translation, p. 150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-BI0h41yCEC|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=23 September 1997|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilmun is also described in the [[Epic poetry|epic]] story of [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag]] as the site at which the [[Creation myth|Creation]] occurred. The promise of Enki to Ninhursag, the Earth Mother:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Dilmun, the land of my lady's heart, I will create long waterways, rivers and canals, whereby water will flow to quench the thirst of all beings and bring abundance to all that lives.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Enki and Ninhursag]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ninlil]], the Sumerian goddess of air and south wind had her home in Dilmun. It is also featured in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

However, in the early epic ''“[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]”'', the main events, which center on [[Enmerkar]]'s construction of the [[ziggurat]]s in [[Uruk]] and [[Eridu]], are described as taking place in a world "before Dilmun had yet been settled".

===Gerrha===
{{Main|Gerrha}}
[[Image:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Gerrha and its neighbors in 1 AD.]]
'''Gerrha''' ({{lang-ar|جرهاء}}), was an ancient city of Eastern [[Arabia]], on the west side of the [[Persian Gulf]]. More accurately, the ancient city of Gerrha has been determined to have existed near or under the present fort of [[Uqair]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This fort is 50 miles northeast of [[Al-Hasa]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]. This site was first proposed by [[R E Cheesman]] in 1924.

Gerrha and Uqair are archaeological sites on the eastern coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] only 60 miles from the ancient burial grounds of [[Dilmun]] on the island of [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;Potts (1990), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bibby, pp. 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Gerrha, the area belonged to the [[Dilmun]] civilization, which was conquered by the [[Assyrian Empire]] in 709 BC.  Gerrha was the center of an Arab kingdom from approximately 650 BC to circa 300 AD. The kingdom was attacked by [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 205-204 BC, though it seems to have survived. It is currently unknown exactly when Gerrha fell, but the area was under [[Sassanid]] Persian control after 300 AD.

Gerrha was described by [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;Strabon, Geography, i6. 4. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; as inhabited by [[Chaldea]]n exiles from [[Babylon]], who built their houses of salt and repaired them by the application of salt water. [[Pliny the Elder]] (lust. Nat. vi. 32) says it was 5 miles in circumference with towers built of square blocks of salt.

Gerrha was destroyed by the Qarmatians in the end of the 9th century where all inhabitants were massacred (300,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last=Yaqut|title=Mujam Buldan|url= |isbn=9004082689 |quote= Hagar is the name of Bahrain and its capital Hagar destroyed by Qarmatians}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was 2 miles from the Persian Gulf near current day [[Hofuf]]. The researcher Abdulkhaliq Al Janbi argued in his book&lt;ref&gt;Gerrha, The Ancient City Of International Trade {{rtl-lang|ar|جره مدينة التجارة العالمية القديمة}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gerrha was most likely the ancient city of Hajar, located in modern-day [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Al Ahsa]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Al Janbi's theory is the most widely accepted one by modern scholars, although there are some difficulties with this argument given that Al Ahsa is 60&amp;nbsp;km inland and thus less likely to be the starting point for a trader's route, making the location within the archipelago of islands comprising the modern [[Bahrain|Kingdom of Bahrain]], particularly the main island of Bahrain itself, another possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Curtis (1983). Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other identifications of the site have been attempted, [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] choosing [[Qatif]], [[Carsten Niebuhr]] preferring Kuwait and C Forster suggesting the ruins at the head of the bay behind the islands of Bahrain.

===Tylos===
[[Image:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Asia in 600 CE, showing the Sassanid Empire before the Arab conquest.]] 
[[Bahrain]] was referred to by the Greeks as '''Tylos''', the centre of pearl trading, when [[Nearchus]] came to discover it serving under [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient Society By Curtis E. Larsen p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; From the 6th to 3rd century BC Bahrain was included in [[Persian Empire]] by [[Achaemenian]]s, an [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"/&gt;{{rp|119}} The Greek admiral [[Nearchus]] is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit this islands, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: “That in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is mostly confined to India, but extends also to Arabia.”&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches Into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian, [[Theophrastus]], states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees as their major economic activity and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ares]] was also worshipped by  the Greek discoverers.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ares]], Ares in the Arabian Peninsula section&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether Bahrain was part of the [[Seleucid Empire]], although the archaeological site at [[Qalat Al Bahrain]] has been proposed as a Seleucid base in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Classical Greece: Ancient histories and modern archaeologies, Ian Morris, Routledge, p184&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf with Greek colonists, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Tylos was very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ward, Bahrain: A Travel Guide, Oleander Press p68&lt;/ref&gt; Tylos even became the site of Greek athletic contests.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Fisher et al. The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press 1968 p40&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic, Tilmun (from [[Dilmun]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Francois Salles in Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500BC-300AD in Michael Rice, Harriet Crawford Ed, IB Tauris, 2002 p132&lt;/ref&gt; The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy’s]] ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' when the inhabitants are referred to as ‘Thilouanoi’.&lt;ref name="Jean Francois Salles p132"&gt;Jean Francois Salles p132&lt;/ref&gt; Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era, for instance, the residential suburb of Arad in [[Muharraq]], is believed to originate from “Arados”, the ancient Greek name for Muharraq island.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis E. Larsen. ''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society'' University Of Chicago Press, 1984 p13&lt;/ref&gt;

With the waning of [[Seleucid]] Greek power, Tylos was incorporated into [[Characene]] or Mesenian, the state founded in what today is [[Kuwait]] by [[Hyspaosines]] in 127 BC. A building inscriptions found in Bahrain indicate that Hyspoasines occupied the islands, (and it also mention his wife, Thalassia).

===Parthian and Sassanid===
From the 3rd century BC to arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, Eastern Arabia was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties of [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanids]].

By about 250 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] lost their territories to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], an Iranian tribe from [[Central Asia]]. The Parthian Arsacid dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"&gt;Bahrain By Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century AD, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the rise of Islam four centuries later.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"/&gt; [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]], the first ruler of the Sasanian dynasty, marched forward Oman and Bahrain and defeat Sanatruq &lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

===Beth Qatraye===
The Christian name used for the region encompassing north-eastern Arabia was Beth Qatraye, or "the Isles".&lt;ref name="adias"&gt;[http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/hellyer01b.pdf "Nestorian Christianity in the Pre-Islamic UAE and Southeastern Arabia"], Peter Hellyer, ''Journal of Social Affairs'', volume 18, number 72, winter 2011, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The name translates to 'region of the Qataris' in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. Though it must be pointed out that Qatar is today expanded to include Bahrain just as India was supposed to include the land from Afghanistan till Philippines during those times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aub.edu.lb/communications/media/Documents/May_2011/grant-syriac-EN.pdf|title=AUB academics awarded $850,000 grant for project on the Syriac writers of Qatar in the 7th century AD|publisher=American University of Beirut|date=31 May 2011|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included Bahrain, [[Tarout Island]], Al-Khatt, [[Al-Hasa]], and Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kozah|first1=Mario|last2=Abu-Husayn|first2=Abdulrahim|last3=Al-Murikhi|first3=Saif Shaheen|title=The Syriac Writers of Qatar in the Seventh Century|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|year=2014|page=24|isbn=978-1463203559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 5th century, Beth Qatraye was a major centre for [[Nestorian Christianity]], which had come to dominate the southern shores of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="brookes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis E. Larsen. Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society University Of Chicago Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the [[Byzantine Empire]], but eastern Arabia was outside the Empire's control offering some safety. Several notable Nestorian writers originated from Beth Qatraye, including [[Isaac of Nineveh]], [[:fr:Dadicho Qatraya|Dadisho Qatraya]], [[:de:Gabriel von Qatar|Gabriel of Qatar]] and Ahob of Qatar.&lt;ref name="brookes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kozah, Abu-Husayn, Abdulrahim. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity was blunted by the arrival of Islam in Eastern Arabia by 628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Allen James Fromherz |last= Fromherz|first= Allen|date= 13 April 2012|title= Qatar: A Modern History|publisher= Georgetown University Press|pages=43|isbn= 978-1-58901-910-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 7 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 676, the bishops of Beth Qatraye stopped attending synods; although the practice of Christianity persisted in the region until the late 9th century.&lt;ref name="brookes"/&gt;

The dioceses of Beth Qatraye did not form an [[ecclesiastical province]], except for a short period during the mid-to-late 7th century.&lt;ref name="brookes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.brookes.ac.uk/downloads/abu-dhabi-collections.pdf|title=Christianity in the Gulf during the first centuries of Islam|publisher=Oxford Brookes University|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instead subject to the Metropolitan of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]].

In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the church in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Francois Salles, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the site eastern Arabia of worship of a Bull deity called [[Awal]]. Worshippers reputedly built a large statue to Awal in Muharraq, although it has now been lost, and for many centuries after Tylos, the islands of Bahrain were known as ‘Awal’.

===Islam===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
From the time when Islam emerged in the 7th century until the early 16th century, the term '''Bahrain''' referred to the wider historical region of eastern Arabia stretching from [[Basrah]] to the [[Strait of Hormuz]] along the Persian Gulf coast.

Eastern Arabians were amongst the first to embrace Islam. The [[Prophet Mohammed]] ruled eastern Arabia through one of his representatives, [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadhrami]]. Eastern Arabia embraced Islam in 629 (the seventh year of hijra).  During the time of Umar I the famous companion of Mohammad, Abu Hurayrah, was the governor of eastern Arabia.  Umar I also appointed Uthman bin Abi Al Aas as governor of the area.  [[Al Khamis Mosque]], founded in 692, was one of the earliest [[mosque]]s built in eastern Arabia, in the era of [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]].

The expansion of Islam did not affect eastern Arabia's reliance on trade, and its prosperity continued to be dependent on markets in India and Mesopotamia. After [[Baghdad]] emerged as the seat of the [[caliph]] in 750 and the main centre of Islamic civilization, eastern Arabia greatly benefited from the city's increased demand for foreign goods especially from China and South Asia.

Eastern Arabia, specifically Bahrain, became a principal centre of knowledge for hundreds of years stretching from the early days of Islam in the 6th century to the 18th century. Philosophers of eastern Arabia were highly esteemed, such as the 13th-century mystic, Sheikh [[Maitham Al Bahrani]] (died in 1299). (The mosque of Sheikh Maitham and his tomb can be visited in the outskirts of the capital, [[Manama]], near the district of [[Mahooz]].).

===The Qarmatian Republic===
{{Main|Qarmatians}}
In the end of the 3rd [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] century, Abu Sa'id al-Hasan al-Janaby led the [[Revolution of al-Qaramita]], a rebellion by a [[messiah|messianic]] [[Ismaili]] sect originating in [[Kufa]] in present-day Iraq. Al-Janaby took over the city of Hajr, Bahrain's capital at that time, and [[al-Hasa]], which he made the capital of his republic. Once in control of the state he sought to create a [[utopian]] society.

The Qarmatians' goal was to build a society based on reason and equality. The state was governed by a council of six with a chief who was a first among equals.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A History of Medieval Islam'', Routledge 1978 p130&lt;/ref&gt; All property within the community was distributed evenly among all initiates. The Qarmatians were organized as an [[esoteric]] society but not as a secret one; their activities were public and openly propagated, but new members had to undergo an initiation ceremony involving seven stages. The Qarmatian world view was one where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again, a concept similar to the cycle of life and Karma.

For much of the 10th century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, controlling the coast of Oman, and collecting tribute from the [[Abbasid]] caliph in Baghdad and from the rival Ismaili [[Fatimid]] caliph in Cairo, whom they did not recognize. The land they ruled over was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash:

{{cquote|The Qarmatian state had vast fruit and grain estates both on the islands and in Hasa and Qatif. Nasiri Khusru, who visited Hasa in 1051, recounted that these estates were cultivated by some thirty thousand Ethiopian slaves. He mentions that the people of Hasa were exempt from taxes. Those impoverished or in debt could obtain a loan until they put their affairs in order. No interest was taken on loans, and token lead money was used for all local transactions. The Qarmathian state had a powerful and long-lasting legacy. This is evidenced by a coin known as Tawila, minted around 920 by one of the Qarmathian rulers, and which was still in circulation in Hasa early in the 20th century, 1100 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Nakash, Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, Princeton 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Qarmatians were defeated in battle in 976 by the [[Abbasids]], which encouraged them to look inward to build their utilitarian society. Around 1058, a revolt on the island of Bahrain led by two Shi'a members of the Abd al-Qays tribe, [[Abu al-Bahlul al-Awwam|Abul-Bahlul al-'Awwam]] and Abu'l-Walid Muslim,&lt;ref name="Farhad Daftary 1990, p221"&gt;Farhad Daftary, ''The Ismāı̄lı̄s: Their History and Doctrines'', Cambridge University Press 1990, p221&lt;/ref&gt; precipitated the waning of Qarmatian power and eventually the ascendancy to power of the Uyunids, an Arab dynasty belonging to the [[Abdul Qays]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Clifford Bosworth 2004, p95"&gt;Clifford Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties: A Genealogical and Chronological Manual'', Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uyunid dynasty===
The '''Al Uyuni''', Uyunids ({{lang-ar|العيوني و العيونيون}}), were an [[Arab]] dynasty that ruled eastern Arabia for 163 years, from the 11th to the 13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''A Thirteenth Century Poet from Bahrain'', Safa Khulusi, '''Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies''', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; They were the remnants of Bani [[Abdul Qays]] tribe and seized the country from the [[Qarmatians]] with the military assistance of [[Great Seljuq Empire]] in the year 1077-1078 AD.&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties'', (Columbia University Press, 1996), 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; It then fell to the [[Usfurids]] of [[Banu Uqayl]] in 651 AH (1253 AD). The famous poet [[Ali bin al Mugrab Al Uyuni]] is a descendant of the Uyunids.

===Usfurids dynasty===
The '''Usfurids''' were an Arab dynasty that in 1253 gained control of eastern Arabia, They were a branch of the [[Banu Uqayl]] tribe of the [[Banu Amir]] group, and are named after the dynasty's founder, Usfur ibn Rashid. They were initially allies of the [[Qarmatians]] and their successors, the [[Uyunids]], but eventually overthrew the latter and seized power themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Meri, ''Medieval Islamic Civilization'', Taylor and Francis, 2006,  p95&lt;/ref&gt; The Usfurids' takeover came after Uyunid power had been weakened by invasion in 1235 by the Salgharid Atabeg of Fars.

The Usfurids had an uneasy relationship with the main regional power at the time, the Persian princes in [[Ormuz|Hormuz]], who took control of Bahrain and [[Qatif]] in 1320. However, the Hormuzi rulers did not seem to have firm control of the islands, and during the 14th century Bahrain was disputed as numerous neighbours sought tribute from the wealth accumulated from its pearl fisheries. In the 15th century another branch of the Banu Amir emerged, the [[Jabrids]], who built a more stable polity in eastern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis E. Larsen. ''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society'' University Of Chicago Press, 1984 pp66-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jarwanid dynasty===
The '''Jarwanid Dynasty''' was a [[Shia]] dynasty that ruled eastern Arabia in the 14th century. It was founded by Jerwan I bin Nasser and was based in [[Qatif]]. The dynasty was a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Ormus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntarP5hrza0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=jarwanid&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=jarwanid&amp;f=false Sacred space and holy war: the politics, culture and history of Shi'ite Islam, By Juan Ricardo Cole, pg.35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5000_24_15.html Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222053120/http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5000_24_15.html |date=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jarwanids belonged to the clan of [[Bani Malik (tribe)|Bani Malik]]. It is disputed whether they belonged to the [[Banu Uqayl]]—the tribe of their predecessors the [[Usfurids]] and their successors the [[Jabrids]]—or to the [[Banu Abdul Qays]], to whom the [[Uyunids|Uyunid]] dynasty (1076–1235) belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Abdulkhaliq Al-Janbi, an online article on the history of eastern Arabia (Arabic)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.rasid.com/print.php?id=6965 عبدالخالق الجنبي، جروان الأحساء غير جروان القطيف] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220080501/http://www.rasid.com/print.php?id=6965 |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jarwanids came to power some time in the 14th century, after expelling the forces of Sa'eed ibn Mughamis, the chief of the [[Muntafiq]] tribe based in the [[Iraq]]i city of [[Basrah]].

Contemporary sources such [[Ibn Battuta]] and Ibn Hajar&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani]], al-Durar al-Kamina fi A'yan al-mi'a al-Thamina []&lt;/ref&gt; describe the Jarwanids as being “extreme [[Rafidha|Rawafidh]],” a term for [[Shi'ites]] who rejected the first three [[Rashidun Caliphs|Caliphs]], while a 15th-century [[Sunni]] scholar from [[Egypt]] describes them as being “remnants of the [[Qarmatians]].”  Historian [[Juan Cole]] concludes from this that they were [[Isma'ilis]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=163353|title=Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300-1800|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=19|issue=2|pages=177–203|last1=Cole|first1=Juan R. I.|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Twelver Shi'ite]] sect was promoted under their rule, and Twelver scholars held the judgeships and other important positions, including the chief of the ''[[hisbah|hisba]]''.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  Also, unlike under the [[Qarmatians]], Islamic prayers were held in the mosques under Jarwanid rule, and prayer was called under the Shi'ite formula.  A Twelver scholar of the 14th century, Jamaluddeen Al-Mutawwa', belonged to the house of Jarwan.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Ali b. Hasan

===Jabrids===
The '''Jabrids''' ({{lang-ar|'''الجبريون''' ,'''الدولة الجبرية''', or '''الجبور'''}}) were a dynasty that dominated eastern [[Arabia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries.  They were descendants of the tribe of [[Uqayl]], a branch of [[Bani 'Amir]].

Their most prominent ruler was [[Ajwad ibn Zamil]], who died in 1507.  He was described by his contemporaries as having been “of Najdi origin.”  Ajwad's elder brother had earlier established the dynasty in the early 15th century by deposing and killing the last [[Jarwanid]] ruler in [[Qatif]]. At their height, the Jabrids controlled the entire Arabian coast on the Persian Gulf, including the islands of Bahrain, and regularly led expeditions into central Arabia and [[Oman]]. One contemporary scholar described Ajwad ibn Zamil as “the king of al-Ahsa and Qatif and the leader of the people of Najd.”  Following his death, his kingdom was divided among some of his descendants, with [[Migrin ibn Zamil]] (possibly his grandson) inheriting [[al-Hasa]], [[Qatif]], and [[Bahrain]].  Migrin fell in battle in [[Bahrain]] in a failed attempt to repel an invasion of Bahrain by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1521.

The Jabrid kingdom collapsed soon afterwards on the mainland, after an invasion of [[al-Hasa]] by [[Muntafiq]] tribe of [[Basrah]], and later by the [[Ottoman Turks]]. One branch of the Jabrids remained active in Oman, however, for nearly another three centuries. It is unknown for sure what became of the non-Omani Jabrids. Some believe they left to Iraq, while others believe they are identical with the [[Jubur]] section of the [[Bani Khalid]] confederation, who eventually took control of the region after the Jabrids.

===Bani Khalid Emirate===

===First Khalidi Emirate===
The main branches of the tribe are the Al Humaid, the Juboor, the Du'um, the Al Janah, the Grusha, the Al Musallam, the 'Amayer, the Al Subaih and the Mahashir.&lt;ref name="Al-Jassir"&gt;Al-Jassir&lt;/ref&gt;  The chieftainship of the Bani Khalid has traditionally been held by the clan of Al Humaid. The Bani Khalid dominated the deserts surrounding the Al-Hasa and [[Al-Qatif]] oases during the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Mandaville, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Barrak ibn Ghurayr]] of the Al Humaid, the Bani Khalid were able to expel Ottoman forces from the cities and towns in 1670 and proclaim their rule over the region.&lt;ref&gt;Fattah, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibn Agil, p. 78"&gt;Ibn Agil, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn Ghurayr made his capital in [[Al-Mubarraz]], where remnants of his castle stand today. According to Arabian folklore, one chief of the Bani Khalid attempted to protect the prized desert [[bustard]] (''[[Arabian bustard|habari]]'') from extinction by prohibiting the [[bedouin]] in his realm from poaching the bird's eggs, earning the tribe the appellation of "protectors of the eggs of the habari", an allusion to the chief's absolute supremacy over his realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnykhaled.com/arabic/ شبكة قبيلة بني خالد&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104121040/http://www.bnykhaled.com/arabic/ |date=2006-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chieftain of the “Khawalid” was Haddori.{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

==Religion==

Like a vast majority of their subject people, in time the Khalidis adopted [[Shia]] Islam if they were not already so at the time of their ascendency. This led to a lasting animosity between them and the staunchly anti-Shia [[Wahhabis]] and the House of [[Saud]], from the mid-18th century to the present.

===Fall to the Saudis===
The Bani Khalid of eastern Arabia maintained ties with members of their tribe who had settled in [[Nejd]] during their earlier migration eastwards, and also cultivated clients among the rulers of the Nejdi towns, such as the Al Mu'ammar of [[al-Uyayna]].  When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town.  The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring [[Dir'iyyah]], where he joined forces with the [[Al Saud]].  The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the [[Saudis]] and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and [[Diriyyah]] in an effort to stop Saudi expansion.  Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed the Al 'Ura'yir in 1793.

===Return and fall from power===
When the [[Egyptians]] under [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]] invaded Arabia and deposed the [[Al Saud]] in 1818, they reoccupied al-Hasa and al-Qatif and reinstated members of the Al 'Uray'ir as governors of the region on their behalf.  The Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the [['Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], the [[Dawasir]], [[Subay']], and [[Mutayr]] began encroaching on the Bani Khalid's desert territories.  They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership.  Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the [['Anizzah]] tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with the [[Al Saud]], who had reestablished their rule in [[Riyadh]] in 1823.  A battle with an alliance led by the [[Mutayr]] and [[Ajman (tribe)|'Ajman]] tribes in 1823,&lt;ref&gt;Meglio&lt;/ref&gt; and another battle with the [[Subay']] and the [[Al Saud]] in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close.  The Ottomans appointed a governor from Bani Khalid over al-Hasa once more in 1874, but his rule also was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Rasheed, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Qumran calendrical texts}}
The '''Enoch calendar''' is an ancient [[calendar]] described in the [[pseudepigrapha]]l [[Book of Enoch]].  It divided the year into four seasons of exactly 13 weeks each. Each such season consisted of two 30-day months followed by one 31-day month, with the 31st day ending the season, so that Enoch's Year consisted of exactly 364 days. 

There is some evidence that the group whose writings were found at [[Qumran]] used a variation of the Enoch calendar (see [[Hebrew_calendar#The_Qumran_calendar|Qumran calendar]]).

The Enoch calendar was purportedly given to Enoch by the angel Uriel. Four named days, inserted as the 31st day of every third month, were named instead of numbered, which "placed them outside the numbering". The Book of Enoch gives the count of 2,912 days for 8 years, which divides out to exactly 364 days per year. This specifically excludes any periodic intercalations.

Calendar expert John Pratt wrote that "The Enoch calendar has been criticized as hopelessly primitive because, with only 364 days, it would get out of sync with the seasons so quickly: in only 25 years the seasons would arrive an entire month early.  Such a gross discrepancy, however, merely indicates that the method of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] has been omitted."&lt;ref&gt;John Pratt, Review of ''Mapping Time:, The Calendar and Its History'', by E. G. Richards, ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', volume 107, number 1, January, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Pratt pointed out that by adding an extra week at the end of every seventh year (or [[Shmita|Sabbatical year]]), and then adding two extra weeks to every fourth Sabbatical year (or every 28 years), the calendar could be as accurate as the [[Julian calendar]].

'''Erbil''', also spelt '''Arbil''' or '''Irbil''', locally called '''Hawler/Hewler''' by the [[Kurds]] is the capital of legal government of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan]] region and the most populous city in the Kurdish inhabited areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_yVxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;dq=rudaw.net+kurdistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PJ_S8pnDIU&amp;sig=TnsWKt3xa-kV5vaMW4wpa9L54ek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLiNzy-JDeAhWHJsAKHeXABOQQ6AEwCHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rudaw.net%20kurdistan&amp;f=false|title=Federalism, Secession, and International Recognition Regime: Iraqi Kurdistan|last=Danilovich|first=Alex|date=2018-10-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780429827655|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located approximately {{convert|350|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of neighboring [[Baghdad]] Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/asia/iraq-political-geography/baghdad|title=Baghdad {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 850,000 inhabitants,{{r|population}} and [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil governorate]] has a permanent population of 2,009,367 {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/turkish/kurdistan/0409201511 |title=İşte Kürdistan Bölgesi’nin nüfusu… |publisher=Rudaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human settlement at Erbil can be dated back to possibly [[5th millennium BC]], and it is one of the [[oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited areas]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Novice"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novice|first1=Karel|title=Research of the Arbil Citadel, Iraq, First Season|journal=Památky Archaeological|date=2008|issue=XCIX|pages=259–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of the city is the ancient [[Citadel of Erbil]]. The earliest historical reference to the region dates to the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] of [[Sumer]], when King [[Shulgi]] mentioned the city of Urbilum. The city was later settled by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].&lt;ref name=villard&gt;{{harvnb|Villard|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Hamblin'&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hamblin|first=William J.|authorlink=William J.

Erbil became an integral part of the kingdom of [[Assyria]] by at least the [[21st century BC]] through to the end of the seventh century BC, after it was captured by the [[Gutians]], and it was known in Assyrian annals variously as ''Urbilim'', ''Arbela'' and ''Arba-ilu''. After this it was part of the geopolitical province of Assyria under several empires in turn, including the [[Median Empire]], the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ([[Achaemenid Assyria]]), [[Macedonian Empire]], [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Parthian Empire]], [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Assyria]] and [[Sasanian Empire]] ([[Asōristān]]), as well as being the capital of the tributary state of [[Adiabene]] between the mid-second century BC and early second century AD.

Following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], it no longer remained a unitary region, and during the [[Middle Ages]], the city came to be ruled by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Erbil's archaeological museum houses a large collection of [[ancient Near East|pre-Islamic]] artefacts, particularly the [[art of Mesopotamia]], and is a centre for archaeological projects in the area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The city was designated as Arab Tourism Capital 2014 by the Arab Council of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cabinet.gov.krd/a/d.aspx?l=12&amp;a=45887 Erbil named 2014 Arab Tourism Capital]. Retrieved 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/23122013 "Erbil: Kurdish City, Arab Capital"], Rudaw. Retrieved 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the Citadel of Arbil was inscribed as a [[World Heritage site]].

The city has an ethnically diverse population of [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]] (the majority ethnic group), [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Arabs]], [[Iraqi Turkmens]], [[Yezidis]], [[Shabakism|Shabakis]] and [[Mandaeans]]. It is equally religiously diverse, with believers of [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shia Islam]], [[Christianity]] (mainly followed by Assyrians and Armenians), Yezidism, [[Yarsanism]], Shabakism and [[Mandaeism]] extant in and around Erbil.

==Etymology==
The name ''Erbil'' was mentioned in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] holy writings of third millennium BC as ''Urbilum'', ''Urbelum'' or ''Urbillum'',&lt;ref name='Hamblin'/&gt; which appears to originate from ''Arbilum''&lt;ref name=Khan2&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Khan|title=A grammar of neo-Aramaic: the dialect of the Jews of Arbel, Part 1, Volume 47|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11510-1|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=we7Q1AxbiOYC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Akkadian language|Akkadians]] and Assyrians by a folk etymology rendered the name as ''arba'ū ilū'' to mean (''four gods'').&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt; The city became a centre for the worship of the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian goddess]] [[Ishtar]]. In classical times the city became known as ''Arbela'' ({{lang-grc-koi|Ἄρβηλα}}), from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] form of the name. In [[Old Persian]], the city was called Arbairā.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arbela-assyrian-arbailu-old |title=Iranica: Arbela |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the modern Kurdish name of the city, ''Hewlêr'', appears to be a corruption of the name ''Arbel'' by a series of [[metathesis (linguistics)|metatheses]] of consonants.&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt; The nicknames of Arbil include: Cradle of Iraqi civilization, old as history, cradle of humankind, defeater of Hulaku and mirror of Kurdistan´s beauty.

===Ancient history===

The region in which Erbil lies was largely under [[Sumer]]ian domination from c. 3000 BC, until the rise of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC) which united all of the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of [[Mesopotamia]] under one rule. Today the [[Assyrian people]], a Syriac-speaking community who [[Assyrian continuity|claim descent from Akkadian speakers]], endure as a minority in northern Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and north west Iran, their population is estimated to be 3.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Statistics |title=UNPO: Assyria |url=http://unpo.org/members/7859 |website=unpo.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of Erbil in literary sources' comes from the archives of the east [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] speaking kingdom of [[Ebla]]. They record two journeys to Erbil (Irbilum) by a messenger from Ebla around 2300 BC. Later, [[Erridupizir]], king of the [[language isolate]] speaking kingdom of [[Gutium]], captured the city in 2150 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erbilcitadel.org/arbil/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=696 Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814010854/http://www.erbilcitadel.org/arbil/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=696 |date=14 August 2014 }} ErbilCitadel.orq&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Sumerian]] ruler of [[Ur]], [[Amar-Sin]], sacked ''Urbilum'' in his second year, c. 1975 BC&lt;ref name=Hamblin/&gt;

Erbil was an integral part of [[Assyria]] from around 2050 BC, becoming a relatively important city during the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (1975–1750 BC), [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1050 BC) and the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC), until the last of these empires fell between 612–599 BC, however it remained part of Assyria under Persian, Greek, Parthian, Roman and Sassanid rule until the first half of the 7th century AD.

Under the [[Median Empire]], [[Cyaxares]] ''might'' have settled a number of people from the [[Ancient Iranian peoples|Ancient Iranian]] tribe of [[Sagartians]] in the Assyrian cities of Arbela and [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), probably as a reward for their help in the capture of [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asagarta-sagartia-asagartiya-sagartian-old-persian-elamite-as-s-kar-ti-ia-babylonian-kursa-ga-ar-ta-a-a-greek-s|title=ASAGARTA (Sagartia) – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|work=iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian emperor [[Cyrus the Great]] occupied Assyria in 547 BC and established it as an [[Achaemenid]] satrapy called in Old Persian ''[[Achaemenid Assyria|Aθurā]] ([[Athura]])'', with Arbela as the capital.&lt;ref&gt;E. Herzfeld, The Persian Empire, ed. G. Walser, Wiesbaden, 1968, pp. 304–07&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Gaugamela]], in which [[Alexander the Great]] defeated [[Darius III of Persia]] in 331 BC, took place approximately {{convert|100|km}} west of Erbil. After the battle, Darius managed to flee to the city, and, somewhat inaccurately, the confrontation is sometimes known as the "Battle of Arbela". Subsequently, Arbela was part of Alexander's Empire. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Arbela became part of the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]].

Erbil became part of the region disputed between Rome and Persia under the [[Sasanids]]. The ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] kingdom of [[Adiabene]] (the Greek form of the Assyrian Ḥadyab) had its centre at Erbil, and the town and kingdom are known in Jewish Middle Eastern history for the conversion of the royal family to Judaism.&lt;ref name=lissner&gt;[http://www.khazaria.com/adiabene/lissner1.html Adiabene, Jewish Kingdom of Mesopotamia] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090712112109/http%3A//www.khazaria.com/adiabene/lissner1.html |date=12 July 2009 }}, Jonah Gabriel Lissner&lt;/ref&gt; During the Parthian era to early Sassanid era, Erbil became the capital of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] state of [[Adiabene]].

Its populace then gradually converted from the [[Mesopotamian religion]] between the 1st and 4th centuries to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]] (and to a lesser degree to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]), with [[Pkidha]] traditionally becoming its first bishop around 104 AD, although the ancient Assyrian religion did not die out entirely in the region until the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/arbela_02_text.htm |title=HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF ADIABENE UNDER THE PARTHIANS AND THE SASSANIDS |author= MŠIHA-ZKHA |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|title=A history of the Jews in Babylonia, Volume 2|year=1969|publisher=Brill Archive|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitanate of Ḥadyab]] in Arbela ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: {{lang|syc|ܐܪܒܝܠ}} ''Arbel'') became a centre of eastern [[Syriac Christianity]] until late in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=British Institute of Persian Studies|title=Iran, Volumes 19–21|year=1981|publisher=the University of Michigan|pages=15, 17|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rNdtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=adiabene+syriac+metropolitanate&amp;q=adiabene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval history===
As many of the [[Eastern Aramaic]]-speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] who had converted to [[Christianity]] adopted Biblical (including Jewish) names, most of the early bishops had Eastern Aramaic or Jewish/Biblical names, which does not suggest that many of the early Christians in this city were converts from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, Ian and Hans-Joachim Klimkeit. ''Christians in Asia before 1500''. (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1999) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the seat of a [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. From the city's Christian period come many church fathers and well-known authors in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

Following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the [[Sassanian Empire|Sasanid]] province of [[Assuristan]], of which Erbil made part of, was dissolved, and from the mid 7th century AD the region saw a gradual influx of [[Muslim]] peoples, predominantly [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and [[Turkic peoples]].

The most notable Kurdish tribe in the region were the Hadhbani, of which several individuals also acted as governors for the city from the late 10th century until the 12th century when it was conquered by the Zengids and its governorship given to the Turkic Begtegenids, who retained the city during the Ayyubid era &lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky. Studies in Caucasian History III, Prehistory of Saladin. Cambridge University Press. 208 pp. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nováček, K., Amin, N., &amp; Melčák, M. (2013). A Medieval City Within Assyrian Walls: The Continuity of the Town of Arbīl in Northern Mesopotamia. Iraq, 75, 1-42. doi:10.1017/S0021088900000401&lt;/ref&gt; Yaqut al-Hamawi further describes Erbil as being mostly Kurdish-populated in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;B. James.

When the Mongols [[Mongol Empire#Middle East|invaded]] the Near East in the 13th century, they attacked Arbil for the first time in 1237. They plundered the lower town but had to retreat before an approaching Caliphate army and had to put off the capture of the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1977|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] to [[Hulagu Khan|Hülegü]] and the Mongols in 1258, the last Begtegenid ruler surrendered to the Mongols, claiming the Kurdish garrison of the city would follow suit; they refused this however, therefore the Mongols returned to Arbil and were able to capture the citadel after a siege lasting six months.&lt;ref name=novacek261&gt;{{harvnb|Nováček|Chabr|Filipský|Janiček|2008|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. von Hammer-Purgstall. 1842. Geschichte der Ilchane, das ist der Mongolen in Persien, Volume 1. P. 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Hülegü then appointed an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christian]] governor to the town, and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] was allowed to build a church.

As time passed, sustained persecutions of Christians, Jews and Buddhists throughout the [[Ilkhanate]] began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of [[Oïrat]] amir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nauruz]], which affected the indigenous Assyrian Christians greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; This manifested early on in the reign of the [[Ilkhan]] [[Ghazan]]. In 1297, after Ghazan had felt strong enough to overcome Nauruz's influence, he put a stop to the persecutions.

During the reign of the Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]] the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christian]] inhabitants retreated to the citadel to escape persecution. In the Spring of 1310, the [[Malik|Malek]] (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the Kurds. Despite the Turkic bishop [[Yahballaha III|Mar Yahballaha]]'s best efforts to avert the impending doom, the citadel was at last taken after a siege by Ilkhanate troops and Kurdish tribesmen on 1 July 1310, and all the defenders were massacred, including many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town.&lt;ref name=sourdel&gt;{{harvnb|Sourdel|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the city's [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic-speaking]] Assyrian population remained numerically significant until the destruction of the city by the forces of [[Timur]] in 1397.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Munsell Bliss]], ''Turkey and the Armenian Atrocities'', (Chicago 1896) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], Erbil was ruled successively by the [[Umayyads]], the [[Abbasids]], the [[Buwayhids]], the [[Seljuks]] and then the Atabegs of Erbil (1131–1232), under whom it was a Turkmen state; they were in turn followed by the [[Ilkhanids]], the [[Jalayirids]], the [[Kara Koyunlu]], the [[Timurids]] and the [[Ak Koyunlu]]. Erbil was the birthplace of the famous 12th and 13th century Kurdish historians and writers [[Ibn Khallikan]] and [[Ibn al-Mustawfi]]. Erbil and all of Iraq passed into the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]] in the 16th century. Erbil was part of the [[Musul Vilayet]] in [[Ottoman Empire]] for 400 years until [[World War I]], when the Ottomans and their Kurdish and Turcoman allies were defeated by the [[British Empire]], with the aid of the Assyrians and Armenians, and the Ottoman Turks ejected.

===Modern history===
[[File:Postcard of the city of Erbil, 1900.jpg|alt=A postcard showing the city of Erbil in 1900|thumb|A postcard showing the city of Erbil in 1900]]
The modern town of Erbil stands on a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] topped by an Ottoman [[fort]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], Erbil became a major trading centre on the route between [[Baghdad]] and [[Mosul]], a role which it still plays today with important road links to the outside world.
[[File:Erbil mail square.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Erbil Mail Square]]

Today, Erbil is both multi-ethnic and multi-religious, with the [[Kurds]] forming the largest ethnic group in the city, with smaller numbers of [[Arabs]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]], [[Armenians]], [[Yazidis]], [[Shabaks]], [[Circassians]], [[Kawliya]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] and [[Mandeans]] also extant.

The parliament of the [[Kurdistan Autonomous Region]] was established in Erbil in 1970 after negotiations between the Iraqi government and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP) led by [[Mustafa Barzani]], but was effectively controlled by [[Saddam Hussein]] until the Kurdish uprising at the end of the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. The legislature ceased to function effectively in the mid-1990s when fighting broke out between the two main Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK). The city was captured by the KDP in 1996 with the assistance of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The PUK then established an alternative Kurdish government in [[Sulaimaniyah]]. KDP claimed that on March 1996 PUK asked for Iran's help to fight KDP. Considering this as a foreign attack on Iraq's soil, the KDP asked the Iraqi government for help.

The Kurdish Parliament in Erbil reconvened after a peace agreement was signed between the Kurdish parties in 1997, but had no real power. The Kurdish government in Erbil had control only in the western and northern parts of the autonomous region. During the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], a [[United States]] special forces task force was headquartered just outside Erbil. The city was the scene of celebrations on 10 April 2003 after the fall of the [[Ba'ath]] regime.

During the [[Multi-National_Force_–_Iraq|coalition forces]] occupation of Iraq, sporadic attacks hit Erbil. Parallel bomb attacks against [[Eid al-Adha|Eid]] celebrations [[2004 Irbil bombings|killed 109 people on 1 February 2004]].&lt;ref name=arab-2-feb-2004&gt;{{cite news |last1=Al-Nahr|first1=Naseer |title=Twin Bombings Kill 56 in Irbil |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/243882 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |work=Arabnews.com |date=2 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility was claimed by the [[Ansar al-Sunnah]],&lt;ref name=arab-2-feb-2004/&gt; and stated to be in solidarity with [[Ansar al-Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A [[2005 Erbil bombing|suicide bombing on 4 May 2005]] killed 60 civilians and injured 150 more outside a police recruiting centre.&lt;ref name=nyt-5-may-2005&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jaff|first1=Warzer |last2=Oppel Jr.|first2=Richard A. |title=60 Kurds Killed by Suicide Bomb in Northern Iraq |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/05/international/middleeast/05iraq.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=11 May 2015 |work=The New York Times|date=5 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Erbil International Airport]] opened in the city in 2005. In 2015, the Christian Nestorian Church has moved its seat from Chicago to Erbil.

There are international flights from Erbil such as to countries; Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Turkey, Jordan and many more flights elsewhere around the world. There are occasionally seasonal flights from Erbil international airport. Erbil International Airport was briefly closed to international commercial flights in September 2017 by the Iraqi government in retaliation for the Kurdish independence vote but reopened in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blockade by Iraq |title=Iraqi govt enforces international flight ban in Kurdistan region |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170929-iraq-foreigners-ban-international-flights-airports-kurdistan-independence-referendum-yes-vo |work=France 24 |date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=International Flight Return |title=Erbil International Airport |url=https://erbilairport.com/INFO06/F_INFO06_01_02.aspx?articleId=436&amp;page=1 |website=erbilairport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Kurdistan's transportation is with [[Taxicab|local Taxis]], that are operated by private companies and also managed by the government of Kurdistan. Hawler Taxi, also known as Kurd Taxi, will be the first and only taxi service in Erbil to offer app-based taxi bookings in the Erbil area and eventually across the Kurdistan region. Currently Kurd Taxi/Hawler Taxi is only available in Erbil, but once the application is fully launched, there is hope to also launch Duhok Taxi and Slemani Taxi in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/business/18012018|title=Erbil prepares to launch first app-based taxi service|work=Rudaw|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citadel of Erbil===
The [[Citadel of Arbil]] is a tell or occupied mound in the historical heart of Erbil, rising between {{convert|25|and|32|m}} from the surrounding plain. The buildings on top of the tell stretch over a roughly oval area of {{convert|430|x|340|m}} occupying {{convert|102,000|sqm}}. It has been claimed that the site is the oldest continuously inhabited town in the world.&lt;ref name='UN'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5479/|title=Erbil Citadel |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence for occupation of the citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC and possibly earlier. It appears for the first time in historical sources during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III]] period and gained particular importance during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (10th to 7th centuries BC) period. West of the citadel at Ary Kon quarter, a chamber tomb dating to the Neo-Assyrian Empire period has been excavated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] period and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Erbil was an important centre for [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christianity]] and the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. After the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] captured the citadel in 1258, Erbil's importance began to decline.

During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the [[building restoration|restoration]] of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, [[archaeology|archaeological]] research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in co-operation with local specialists, and many areas remain off-limits to visitors due to the danger of unstable walls and infrastructure. The government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated.

The only religious structure that currently survives in the citadel is the [[Mulla Effendi|Mulla Afandi]] Mosque. When it was fully occupied, the citadel was divided in three districts or ''[[mahalla]]s'': from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of [[dervish]]es, which are called ''takyas''; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. Other sights to visit in the citadel include the bathing rooms (''[[Turkish bath|hammam]]'') built in 1775 located near the mosque and the Textile Museum.&lt;ref&gt;'Erbil Citadel' Brochure, High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR). www.erbilcitadel.org&lt;/ref&gt; Erbil citadel has been inscribed on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014 .

===Other sights===
* The covered Erbil [[Qaysari Bazaars]], lying below the main entrance to the citadel and stocking mainly household goods and tools.
* The {{convert|36|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Mudhafaria Minaret]], situated in Minaret Park several blocks from the citadel, dates back to the late 12th century AD and the Governor of Erbil, in the reign of [[Saladin]], Muzaffar Al-Din Abu Sa’eed Al-Kawkaboori ([[Gökböri]]), who had entered in the obedience of Salahuddin without war and married his sister. It has an octagonal base decorated with two tiers of niches, which is separated from the main shaft by a small balcony, also decorated. Another historical minaret with turquoise glazed tiles is nearby.
* [[Sami Rahman Park]]
* [[Franso Hariri Stadium]]
* The Mound of Qalich Agha lies within the grounds of the Museum of Civilization, {{convert|1|km|mi}} from the citadel. An excavation in 1996 found tools from the [[Tell Halaf|Halaf]], [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] and [[Uruk period]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;'Directorate Antiquities of Erbil's Guide' Brochure produced by General Directorate of Antiquities, KRG, Ministry of Tourism&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kurdish Textile Museum]]

===Sports===

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

==Discovery==
[[Image:Pigen, der finder guldhornet (1906) harald slott-møller.jpg|thumb|''The Girl Who Finds The Gold Horn'' (1906) by [[Harald Slott-Møller]].]]
[[File:Gallehus Journal des Savants 1678.png|thumb|A description of the first horn was published in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]'' in 1678.]]
[[File:Paulli 1734 title page illustration.png|thumb|Title page illustration of the 1734 treatise on the second horn by Richard Joachim Paulli]]
[[File:Guldhorn paulli.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Depiction of the horn found AD 1734 on 21 April near the village of Gallehus, in Schackenborg county, not far from the town of Tønder as a peasant was digging, at nearly the same place as a similar one was found AD 1639. It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the '''history of Croatia''' since the end of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

== Tuđman: peacetime presidency (1995–1999) ==
[[File:Tuđman i Ana Havel.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Franjo Tuđman]] in 1997]]

In November 1995 the war in Croatia ended. Around 20,000 people were killed in the war, while official figures on wartime damage published in Croatia in 1996 specify 180,000 destroyed housing units, 25% of the Croatian economy destroyed, and US$27&amp;nbsp;billion of material damage.&lt;ref name="Darko Zubrinic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Darko Zubrinic|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et112.html|title=Croatia within ex-Yugoslavia|publisher=Croatianhistory.net|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Europe Review 2003/04'' estimated the war damage at US$37&amp;nbsp;billion in damaged infrastructure, lost [[Output (economics)|economic output]], and refugee-related costs, while GDP dropped 21% in the period.&lt;ref name="Europe-Review-2003"&gt;[[#Europe Review|Europe Review (2003)]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; 15 percent of housing units and 2,423 cultural heritage structures, including 495 sacral structures, were destroyed or damaged.&lt;ref name="Vjesnik-Damage-2010"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper= Vjesnik | publisher= Narodne Novine d.d. | url = http://limun.hr/main.aspx?id=629117&amp;Page=1 | title = Beskrajna obnova od rata |trans-title=Endless reconstruction after the war | language= Croatian | author= Maja Sajler Garmaz | date = December 21, 1991 | accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war imposed an additional economic burden of very high military expenditures. By 1994, as Croatia rapidly developed into a de facto war economy, the military consumed as much as 60 percent of total government spending.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Commonwealth|Commonwealth (1999), p. 280]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the war, [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1995|parliamentary elections]] were held in 1995, which resulted in a victory of the ruling [[Croatian Democratic Union]]. [[Zlatko Mateša]] became the new Prime Minister of Croatia, replacing [[Nikica Valentić]], and formed the first [[Cabinet of Zlatko Mateša|peacetime government of independent Croatia]]. Elections for the Zagreb Assembly were held at the same time, which were won by the opposition. This led to the [[Zagreb crisis]] since the president refused to provide formal confirmation to the opposition parties proposed [[Mayor of Zagreb]]. In 1996 mass demonstrations were held in Zagreb in response to revoking broadcasting license to [[Radio 101 (Croatia)|Radio 101]], a radio station that was critical towards the ruling party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poslovni.hr/61642.aspx "Jedanaest godina nezavisnosti Radija 101" at poslovni.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995-97 and improved economic conditions.&lt;ref name=Benczes&gt;Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Real GDP growth in 1995 was 6,8%, in 1996 5,9% and in 1997 6,6%.&lt;ref name=unstats&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/introduction.asp National Accounts Main Aggregates Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a Ministry of Privatization was established with Ivan Penić as its first minister.&lt;ref&gt;William Bartlett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VFiFAgAAQBAJ Europe's Troubled Region: Economic Development, Institutional Reform, and Social Welfare in the Western Balkans], Routledge, 2007, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Privatization in Croatia]] had barely begun when war broke out in 1991 and its transformation from a [[planned economy]] to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady. The ruling party was criticised for transferring enterprises to a group of privileged owners connected to the party.&lt;ref&gt;William Bartlett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VFiFAgAAQBAJ Europe's Troubled Region: Economic Development, Institutional Reform, and Social Welfare in the Western Balkans], Routledge, 2007, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatia became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] on 6 November 1996. President of Croatia [[Franjo Tuđman]] won the [[Croatian presidential election, 1997|1997 presidential elections]] with 61.4% of the votes and was re-elected to a second five-year term. [[Marina Matulović-Dropulić]] became the Mayor of Zagreb having won the 1997 local elections, which formally ended the Zagreb crisis.

The remaining part of former [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], areas adjacent to [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]], negotiated a peaceful reintegration process with the Croatian Government. The so-called [[Erdut Agreement]] made the area a temporary protectorate of the [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]]. The area was formally re-integrated into Croatia on 15 January 1998. On 3 October 1998 Pope [[John Paul II]] beatified Cardinal [[Alojzije Stepinac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=hr&amp;id=oFXdiS25N78C|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|location=[[Cambridge]], England|page=277|isbn=978-1-139-48750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Račan government (2000–2003) ==
[[File:Racan facingleft.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ivica Račan]]]]
[[File:StipeMesic1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Stjepan Mesić]]]]

Tuđman died in 1999 and in the early [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]], the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) government was replaced by a center-left coalition, with [[Ivica Račan]] as prime minister. At the same time, [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]] were held which were won by a moderate, [[Stjepan Mesić]].

The new Račan government amended the Constitution, changing the political system from a [[semi-presidential system]] to a [[parliamentary system]], transferring most executive presidential powers from the president onto the institutions of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, the President remained the [[Commander-in-Chief]], and notably used this power in response to the [[Twelve Generals' Letter]].

Economic growth picked up in 2000 following the recession.&lt;ref name=Benczes2/&gt; The new government started several large building projects, including state-sponsored [[house|housing]] and the building of the vital [[Zagreb]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] Highway, today's [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]. Economic growth in the 2000s was stimulated by a credit boom led by newly privatized banks, capital investment, especially in road construction, a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable.&lt;ref name=IBP&gt;International Business Publications: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qND3Dii7qjIC Croatia Investment and Trade Laws and Regulations Handbook], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html CIA Factbook - Croatia]&lt;/ref&gt;
The country rebounded from a mild [[recession]] in 1998/1999 and achieved notable economic growth during the following years. The unemployment rate would continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started falling. Return of refugees accelerated as many homes were rebuilt by the government; most Croats had already returned (except for some in [[Vukovar]]), whereas only a third of the Serbs had done so, impeded by unfavorable property laws as well as ethnic and economic issues.

The Račan government is often credited with bringing Croatia out of semi-isolation of the Tuđman era. Croatia became a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a [[Stabilization and Association Agreement]] (SAA) with the [[European Union]] in October 2001, and applied for membership in February/March 2003.

== Sanader government (2003–2009) ==

[[File:Svecanost podizanja NATOve zastave Zagreb 77.jpg|thumb|right|Flag hoisting ceremony at [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]] in Zagreb, marking joining of the [[NATO]] in 2009]]
In late 2003, [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|new parliamentary elections]] were held and a reformed HDZ party won under leadership of [[Ivo Sanader]], who became prime minister. After some delay caused by controversy over extradition of army generals to the [[ICTY]], in 2004 the [[European Commission]] finally issued a recommendation that the accession negotiations with Croatia should begin. Its report on Croatia described it as a modern democratic society with a competent economy and the ability to take on further obligations, provided it continued the reform process.

The country was given EU applicant status on 18 June 2004 and a negotiations framework was set up in March 2005. Actual negotiations began after the capture of general [[Ante Gotovina]] in December 2005, which resolved outstanding issues with the ICTY in the Hague. However, numerous complications stalled the negotiating process, most notably during [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] from December 2008 until September 2009.

In August 2007, Croatia experienced a tragedy when during the [[2007 Croatian coast fires|fires that ravaged its coast]], 12 firemen died as a result of a fire on Kornat island.

Sanader was reelected in the closely contested [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]].

The October 2008 [[assassination of Ivo Pukanić]] was one of several prominent murders in Croatia at the time which were attributed to [[organized crime]] and associated by the media with an increased occurrence of crime in Zagreb in 2008.&lt;ref name=ekath&gt;{{cite web

In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, leaving scarce explanation for his actions, and rumours of involvement in various criminal cases became increasingly rampant.

== Kosor government (2009–2011) ==
[[File:Croatia EU flags.jpg|thumb|right|Croatia gained [[European Union]] membership in 2013]]
[[Jadranka Kosor]] assumed the head of the government following Sanader's resignation. Kosor introduced [[austerity]] measures to counter the economic crisis and launched an anti-corruption campaign aimed at public officials.

Jadranka Kosor signed an agreement with [[Borut Pahor]], the premier of [[Slovenia]], in November 2009, that ended [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] and allowed [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian EU entry negotiations]] to proceed.

In the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|first round of the 2010 presidential election]] the HDZ candidate [[Andrija Hebrang (son)|Andrija Hebrang]] achieved an embarrassing 12% claiming third place, the lowest result for an HDZ presidential candidate ever. [[Ivo Josipović]], the candidate of the largest opposition party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], won a landslide victory in the resulting [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|runoff on 10 January]].

Ivo Sanader tried to come back in [[HDZ]] in early 2010, but was then ejected, charged for corruption by authorities, and later arrested in Austria.

In June 2010, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business friendly, in order to foster economic growth. The proposed new labour law would have set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. After that, the workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/06/25/nb-13 Croatian unions collect enough signatures for referendum]&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of the labour law was greatly opposed by five [[trade union]]s: a petition demanding a referendum gathered 813,016 signatures, far more than the required 449,506 signatures (10 percent of all voters in Croatia), in the first successful popular referendum attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Croat-unions-win-right-to-referendum-on-labour-law-2010-06-24T161805Z-UPDATE-2 | title=Croat unions win right to referendum on labour law | date=24 June 2010 | work=Forexyard.com | accessdate=24 June 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020904/http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Croat-unions-win-right-to-referendum-on-labour-law-2010-06-24T161805Z-UPDATE-2 | archivedate=11 July 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/sindikati--imamo-505-000-potpisa--ne-zanimaju-nas-vladini-prijedlozi/841620/ | title=Sindikati objavili: Imamo 720.078 potpisa za referendum! | date=24 June 2010 | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/za-referendum-zor-u-prikupljeno-813-016-potpisa-clanak-162000 | title=Za referendum o ZOR-u prikupljeno 813.016 potpisa | date=1 July 2010 | work=vecernji.hr | language=Croatian | accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polling was done for the prospective referendum: an Ipsos Puls for Nova TV poll of 8 July 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/eksluzivno-gradzani-ipak-ne-znaju-zasto-su-potpisali-peticiju.html&lt;/ref&gt; at a sample of 646 indicated 64% would support the referendum, 15% would be against, and 21% were undecided.
CRO Demoskop also polled on the matter on 1 and 2 July&lt;ref&gt;http://www.promocija-plus.com/javno_mnijenje/index_javno_mnijenje.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at a sample of 1300, and found 88.6% of the polled would support it.

After the Ministry of Administration completed its examination of the signatures, the Croatian Government first hinted that of all submitted signatures, no more than 330 thousand are valid, which would be insufficient for starting a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novilist.hr/2010/09/03/vlada-rusi-referenduma-o-zakonu-.aspx Vlada ruši referendum o Zakonu o radu!]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a public backlash, they nevertheless passed the signatures on to the Parliament. The government then decided to withdraw the reform proposals on 3 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/09/05/nb-07&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Croatian Parliament]] could not decide conclusively whether this rendered the referendum proposal moot or not, and instead passed the judgement on to the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/odluka-o-referendumu-prebacena-na-ustavni-sud/889339/ | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | title = Sabor: Ustavni sud odlučivat će o referendumu o ZOR-u | date = 2010-09-24 | accessdate = 2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided on 20 October 2010 that there was no longer any need to hold the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/10/20/nb-08&lt;/ref&gt; It ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year.

The government and labour unions later agreed that there would be a different referendum instead, asking the question "Do you agree that a referendum must be called if so requested by 200,000 registered voters, and that the time for the collection of the required number of voters' signatures should be 30 days?". It was planned to be held at the same time as the EU accession referendum,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/11/24/nb-11&lt;/ref&gt; but did not happen.

== Milanović government (2011–2016) ==

[[File:Croatian Armed Forces cadets, Military Parade, Zagreb, 4-8-2015.JPG|thumb|right|2015 military parade of the [[Croatian Armed Forces]] in honour of the [[Victory Day (Croatia)|Victory Day]]]]
The [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]] was held on 4 December 2011, and the [[Kukuriku coalition]] won. [[Zoran Milanović]] became the prime minister of the coalition government.

In January  2012, the new government organized a [[Croatian European Union membership referendum, 2012|referendum for EU membership]] that passed with 66.27%. After the referendum, the Sabor ratified the accession treaty, the [[Treaty of Accession 2011]].

The Milanović cabinet endured a major change when the first deputy prime minister [[Radimir Čačić]] resigned in November 2012, having been convicted of vehicular manslaughter in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/sabor-potvrdio--pusic-je-nova-potpredsjednica-vlade--vrdoljak-ministar-gospodarstva--a--anka-mrak-taritas-ministrica-graditeljstva-/1066792/ | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | title = U sjeni presude - Sabor potvrdio treću promjenu u Vladi: Žestoki sukob Lesara i Milanovića! | date = 2012-11-16 | accessdate = 2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trial of Gotovina et al]], following an initial guilty verdict in April 2011, [[Ante Gotovina]] and [[Mladen Markač]] were ultimately acquitted in November 2012. [[Mirjan Damaška]], a law professor at the [[University of Yale]] stated for the occasion that the theory about the "[[joint criminal enterprise]]" would have caused historical, political and law complications for Croatia, but that, as a result of the appeal, Croatia's founding has been internationally recognized as legal via its [[Operation Storm]] offensive.&lt;ref name=JureskoKero&gt;{{cite news|title=Damaška: Poručite generalima da sam presretan jer su na slobodi! |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/damaska-porucite-generalima-da-sam-presretan-jer-su-slobodi-clanak-476314 |last=Jureško-Kero |first=Jadranka |newspaper=[[Večernji list]] |date=16 November 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the successful ratification of its accession treaty in all existing EU member states, Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.

Shortly after joining the European union a question of extradition of [[Josip Perković]] arose. A member of Yugoslavian secret service UDBA, Germany accused Perković of murder of a Croat citizen [[Stjepan Đureković]] ( who is suspected to have stolen 200 million dollars from INA petrol company and has subsequently fled to [[Germany]] ).
At first Croatia was unwilling to extradite Perković under the justification that its constitution prohibited it ( all political crimes fall barred after 2002 ). However, when threatened with sanctions in case of non compliance, the parliament quickly voted to change the constitution to allow the extradition. Finally, the law is to come into effect on January the first 2014.

On December the first 2013, Croatia held its third referendum since becoming independent. The referendum question was ''Do you define marriage as a union between a man and a woman'', 65% of Croats voted yes, however, with a significantly low turnout of only 38% of eligible voters. The referendum was organized by the ultra-conservative group "In the name of family"'. The Catholic Church urged people to vote yes, while the government, 88 civil society organizations and local celebrities advised citizens to vote no. The referendum has raised much controversy and increase of violence against LGBT people in Croatian for this and following years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tematska sjednica saborskog Odbora za ravnopravnost spolova – Suzbijanje nasilja nad LGBT osobama u Republici Hrvatskoj|url=http://www.zagreb-pride.net/hr/tematska-sjednica-saborskog-odbora-za-ravnopravnost-spolova-suzbijanje-nasilja-nad-lgbt-osobama-u-republici-hrvatskoj|date=23 October 2017 |language=Croatian |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Same-sex registered partnership]] was introduced the following year, granting same-sex couples equal rights to marriage, except the [[LGBT adoption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Campaigners Celebrate Victory in Croatia |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/gay-campaigners-celebrate-victory-in-croatia|date=14 July 2014 |language=English|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth presidential election since independence took place in 2014 and 2015, with a first round held on 28 December 2014 between four candidates: the incumbent [[Ivo Josipović]] in office since 2010 and supported by the ruling coalition, former [[foreign minister]] and [[NATO]] official [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] nominated by the opposition [[HDZ]], [[Živi zid]] activist [[Ivan Sinčić]] and right-wing populist [[Milan Kujundžić]]. Josipović and Grabar-Kitarović won the most votes, but fell short of the required 50% + 1 vote needed to win outright and proceeded to the second round held on 11 January 2015. In the second round Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was elected the first female [[president of croatia]],  winning with 50,74% of the vote and receiving 32.509 votes more than Josipović, thus making the latter the first Croatian president not to succeed in being reelected to office and also resulting in the narrowest margin of victory in any presidential election to date in Croatia.

In 2015, after Hungary built a fence along its border with Serbia, over 17000 refugees crossed the border into Croatia.  They are seeking an alternative route into the [[Schengen area]], as part of the [[refugee crisis]], with most refugees fleeing the [[Syrian civil war]] and [[Iraq War (2014–present)]]. As the Croatian Prime minister [[Zoran Milanović]] stated that Croatia could not become a "[[refugee camp]]" and that it had become overwhelmed by the number of refugees entering the country, it was decided that Croatia would stop registering them and that a certain number of refugees be let into [[Hungary]] and [[Slovenia]], attempts were made, however, by the authorities of those countries to obstruct the passage of refugees. The [[refugee crisis]] and [[immigration]] may also, for the first time in Croatia's history, become a subject of [[political debate]] during the [[next Croatian parliamentary election]] to be held in 2015.

The '''information industry''' or '''information industries''' are [[industry|industries]] that are [[information]] intensive in one way or the other. It is considered one of the most important [[economic sector]]s for a variety of reasons. 

There are many different kinds of information industries, and many different ways to classify them. Although there is no standard or distinctively better way of organizing those different views, the following section offers a review of what the term "information industry" might entail, and why. Alternative conceptualizations are that of [[knowledge]] industry and information-related occupation. The term "information industry" is mostly identified with [[computer programming]], system design, telecommunications, and others.  

==Information products==

First, there are companies which produce and sell information in the form of goods or services. [[Mass media|Media]] products such as [[television]] programs and [[movies]], published books and periodicals would constitute probably among the most accepted part of what information goods can be. Some information is provided not as a tangible commodity but as a service. Consulting is among the least controversial of this kind. However, even for this category, disagreements can occur due to the vagueness of the term "information." For some, information is knowledge about a subject, something one can use to improve the performance of other activities—it does not include arts and entertainments. For others, information is something that is mentally processed and consumed, either to improve other activities (such as production) or for personal enjoyment; it would include artists and architects. For yet others, information may include anything that has to do with sensation, and therefore information industries may include even such things as restaurant, amusement parks, and prostitution to the extent that food, park ride, and sexual intercourse have to do with senses. In spite of the definitional problems, industries producing information goods and services are called information industries.

==Information services==

Second, there are [[information processing]] services. Some services, such as [[legal]] services, [[banking]], [[insurance]], [[computer programming]], [[data processing]], testing, and market research, require intensive and intellectual processing of information. Although those services do not necessarily provide information, they often offer expertise in making decisions on behalf of clients. These kinds of service industries can be regarded as an information-intensive part of various industries that is externalized and specialized. 

==Information distribution==

Third, there are industries that are vital to the dissemination of the information goods mentioned above. For example, [[telephone]], [[broadcasting]] and book retail industries do not produce much information, but their core business is to disseminate information others produced. These industries handle predominantly information and can be distinguished from wholesale or retail industries in general. It is just a coincidence, one can argue, that some of those industries are separately existing from the more obvious information-producing industries. For example, in the United States, as well as some other countries, broadcasting stations produce very limited amount of programs they broadcast. But this is not the only possible form of division of labor. If legal, economic, [[cultural]], and [[historical]] circumstances were different, the broadcasters would have been the producers of their own programs. Therefore, in order to capture the information related activities of the economy, it might be a good idea to include this type of industry. These industries show how much of an economy is about information, as opposed to materials. It is useful to differentiate production of valuable information from processing that information in a sophisticated way, from the movement of information. 

==Information devices==

Fourth, there are manufacturers of information-processing devices that require research and sophisticated decision-making. These products are vital to information-processing activities of above mentioned industries. The products include computers of various levels and many other microelectronic devices, as well as software programs. Printing and copying machines, measurement and recording devices of various kinds, electronic or otherwise, are also in this category. The role of these tools are to automate certain information-processing activities. The use of some of these tools may be very simple (as in the case of some printing), and the processing done by the tools may be very simple (as in copying and some calculations) rather than intellectual and sophisticated. In other words, the specialization of these industries in an economy is neither production of information nor sophisticated decision-making. Instead, this segment serves as an infrastructure for those activities, making production of information and decision-making services will be a lot less efficient. In addition, these industries tend to be "[[high-tech]]" or research intensive - trying to find more efficient ways to boost efficiency of information production and sophisticated decision-making. For example, the function of a standard calculator is quite simple and it is easy to how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users. 

==Research industries==

Fifth, there are very [[research|research-intensive]] industries that do not serve as infrastructure to information-production or sophisticated decision-making. Pharmaceutical, food-processing, some apparel design, and some other "high-tech" industries belong to this type. These products are not exclusively for information production or sophisticated decision-making, although many are helpful. Some services, such as medical examination are in this category as well. One can say these industries involve a great deal of sophisticated decision-making, although that part is combined with manufacturing or "non-informational" activities. 

==Infrastructure==

Finally, there are industries that are not research intensive, but serve as [[infrastructure]] for information production and sophisticated decision-making. Manufacturing of office furniture would be a good example, although it sometimes involves research in ergonomics and development of new materials. 

As stated above, this list of candidates for information industries is not a definitive way of organizing differences that researchers may pay attention to when they define the term. Among the difficulties is, for example, the position of advertising industry.

==Importance==

Information industries are considered important for several reasons. Even among the experts who think industries are important, disagreements may exist regarding which reason to accept and which to reject.

First, information industries is a rapidly growing part of economy. The demand for information goods and services from consumers is increasing. In case of consumers, media including music and motion picture, personal computers, video game-related industries, are among the information industries. In case of businesses, information industries include computer programming, system design, so-called FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industries, telecommunications, and others. When demand for these industries are growing nationally or internationally, that creates an opportunity for an urban, regional, or national economy to grow rapidly by specializing on these sectors. 

Second, information industries are considered to boost innovation and productivity of other industries. An economy with a strong information industry might be a more competitive one than others, other factors being equal. 

Third, some believe that the effect of the changing economic structure (or composition of industries within an economy) is related to the broader social change. As information becomes the central part of our economic activities we evolve into an "[[information society]]", with an increased role of mass media, digital technologies, and other mediated information in our daily life, leisure activities, social life, work, politics, education, art, and many other aspects of society.

'''Iosif Davidovich Amusin''' ({{Lang-ru|Ио́сиф Дави́дович Аму́син}}; French: ''Joseph Amoussine'', 29 November 1910, [[Vitebsk]] – 12 June 1984, Leningrad) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[historian]], [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[hebraist]] and [[papyrology]]st, was specialist in the history of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Qumran]] studies. &lt;!--Doctor ''honoris causa'' of historical sciences (1965) - how does it sound in Russian? does not make any sense--&gt;

Amusin was twice (in 1928 and 1938) arrested and sentenced for [[Zionist]] connections and "[[anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]]" activity (acquitted posthumously in 1989). Graduated from the Historical Faculty of [[St. Petersburg University|Leningrad University]] (1935–1941). Served as a medical officer during the [[Second World War]].

After 1945, Amusin taught [[ancient history]] at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute and the Leningrad University until the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] campaign against the so-called "[[Rootless cosmopolitan|cosmopolitanism]]," when he lost his job and, after a long period of unemployment, began lecturing at the [[Ulianovsk]] Pedagogical Institute (1950–1954).

Upon returning in Leningrad in 1954, Amusin became a research fellow at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] and the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] in Leningrad. From the late 1950s, he published about 100 works on the [[Qumran]] and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

'''Joseph-Marie-Bruno-Constantin, Baron Kervyn de Lettenhove''' (17 August 1817 &amp;ndash; 3 April 1891) was a Belgian historian and politician.

He was a member of the Catholic Constitutional party and sat in the [[Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives|Belgian Chamber of Deputies]] as member for [[Eeklo]]. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the cabinet of [[Jules Joseph d'Anethan]] as minister of the interior. However his official career was short. The cabinet appointed as governor of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] one Decker, who had been entangled in the financial speculations of Langand-Dumonceau by which the whole clerical party had been discredited, and which provoked riots. The cabinet was forced to resign, and thereafter Kervyn de Lettenhove devoted himself entirely to literature and history.

He had already become known as the author of a book on [[Jean Froissart]] ([[Brussels]], 1855), which was crowned by the French Academy. He was also a correspondent of foreign [[Science|scientific]] societies, and preëminent in his own country as an investigator of the national antiquities. He made translations of some of [[John Milton|Milton's]] shorter poems (1839) and edited the ''Lettres et négociations de [[Philippe de Commines]]'' (1867).

He edited a series of chronicles: ''Chroniques relatives a l'histoire de la Belgique sous la domination des ducs de Bourgogne'' (Brussels, 1870–1873), and ''Relations politiques des Pays Bas et de l'Angleterre sous le regne de Philippe II'' (Brussels, 1882–1892). He wrote a history of ''Les Hugenots et les Gueux'' (Bruges, 1883–1885) in the spirit of a violent [[Roman Catholic]] partisan, but with much industry and learning. Other works include:

*''Histoire de la [[Flanders|Flandre]]'' (1847–50)
*''[[Jacob van Artevelde|Jacques de Artevelde]]'' (1863)
*''Histoire et croniques de Flandre'' (1879–80)
*''Marie Stuart'' (1889)

He died at Sint-Michiels near [[Bruges]] in 1891, the community in which he was born in 1817. One of his children was art historian [[Henri Kervyn de Lettenhove]].

"Karmic Debts" is a 2013 [[novel]], the eight book by the [[Estonia]]n author Inga Raitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-21|title=Inga Raitar|url=https://et.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inga_Raitar&amp;oldid=4676793|journal=Vikipeedia, vaba entsüklopeedia|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of three entwined stories that takes the readers to a journey from a secluded [[Tibetan people|Tibetan Monastery]] in the 16th century, through the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1800s, all the way to present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://legend.eu/toode/karmavolad/|title=Karmavõlad - Kirjastus Legend|work=Kirjastus Legend|access-date=2017-07-28|language=et-EE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Karma|karmic]] threads start to twist and intertwine between the stories leaving you questioning - why does the fateful karma interfere with our lives and how far does it reach? How do we end up in the relationships that we have? What is the thing bringing them forward?

The book was translated to English in 2017, and can be found as a [[Kindle Store|Kindle e-book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Karmic-Debts-Three-lives-destinies-ebook/dp/B0748LDBFQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501233394&amp;sr=1-1|title=Karmic Debts: Three lives. Three destinies. Three eras.|last=Raitar|first=Inga|date=2017-07-25|publisher=Legend Kirjastus|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview and linking themes ==
It would appear as if there are three distinct tales unraveling in this novel – one taking place long ago in a Tibetan monastery, another during the Great Famine in Ireland and the third somewhere in the present day. The book is presented by the main characters point of view and the stories are linked to one another in a way that makes it seem, as if time does not flow in a linear way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poltsamaaraamat.blogspot.com/2013/12/karmavolad.html|title=Põltsamaa Raamatukogu|last=nurmek|first=Postitaja:|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each story, the characters are looking for answers to questions about real love, and how or why does it come to our life? Why do you feel at times that you have known certain people for a lifetime before you even really meet? .

The [[book]] was originally published as a series of short-stories in the Estonian biggest [[List of women's magazines|women's magazine]] "Naised", but it was never finished. The author wanted to add an extra dimension to the story and stopped writing to the magazine each month.

Karmic Debts" is a romantic [[Romance novel|love story]] and, at the same time, an exciting [[Fantasy|fantasy tale]] about the mysterious strings of karma that are hidden behind all of our relationships.

== Plot ==
Iris, a young and successful woman, meets a stranger on a business trip, who is far from her “type”. Nonetheless, a spark ignites that turns her life as she knows it, upside down.

The beautiful bastard daughter of an Irish lord, Irene, falls in love with a poor farmers boy. This will determine the life of the whole village and set her fate.

A devotee named Ikaro bears witness to his best friend’s foul secret. The boy must choose, whether to betray everything he believes holy or acknowledge what he truly wants.

'''Kinelarty''' ({{etymology|ga|Cineál Fhaghartaigh|Faghartach's kindred}}&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt;) is a former [[Túath|Irish district]] and [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="PRONI"/&gt; It lies east of the centre of the county, and is bordered by five other baronies: [[Iveagh Upper, Lower Half]] to the west; [[Lecale Upper]] to the south and south-east; [[Lecale Lower]] to the west; [[Castlereagh Upper]] to the north; and [[Iveagh Lower, Upper Half]] to the north-west.&lt;ref name="PRONI"/&gt;

==History==
Kinelarty derives its name from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''Cineál Fhaghartaigh'', which means Faghartach's (Fogarty's) kindred.&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt; This was the name of an [[Túath|Irish district]], the chiefs of which were the ''Mac Artáin'' (MacCartan).&lt;ref name="Names2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A. D.|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2003|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t40.e12032|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mac Artáin descend from Artán, grandson of Fagartaigh of [[Uí Echach Cobo]] (anglicised as [[Iveagh (territory)|Iveagh]]). The Mac Artáin, as is professed throughout the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' and in parts the ''Annals of Innisfallen'' reigned supreme as High Kings for considerable periods of history further positioning themselves as lords of Iveagh.

By 1177, the [[Normans|Norman]] [[John de Courcy]] had arrived in Ulster and set about conquering most of eastern Ulster, forming the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. The only clans who were able to exist independently in eastern Ulster during this time were in the interior away from the sea-coast, where the [[Uí Tuirtre]], north of Lough Neagh, and the Uí Echach Cobo.&lt;ref name="Duibhin"/&gt;

During the 14th century the Normans in Ulster faded as a result of the [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Bruce Invasion]], with this period seeing the Mac Aonghusa and Mac Artáin clans emerge and expand from Uibh Echach, with their respective territories becoming the basis of the future baronies of Iveagh and Kinelarty.&lt;ref name="Duibhin"/&gt; With the fall of Norman power in Ulster, the ''Clann Aodha Bhuidhe'' (Clandeboy) branch of the O'Neills took control of north Down, with the chiefs of Kinelarty eventually becoming their tributaries.&lt;ref name="Duibhin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Names"/&gt;

Early mentions in regards to Kinelarty and the MacCartans include: 

*1004 or 1005, Flaithbheartach gained a victory over the Uí Echach and Ulaid at Loch Bricrenn, where Artán, heir of Uí Echach was killed.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;
*1011, Muircheartach, son of Artán, the heir of Uí Echach, was killed in the "Battle of the Mullachs".&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;
*1157, "Kenel Fagartay" and "Kenelfagarthay" are recorded by the Normans in the Newry Charter.&lt;ref name="Placenames"/&gt;
*1165, a Diarmait Mac Artáin head of ''Clainne-Fogartaigh'' and all Uí Echach died.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;
*1178, Cinaeth Mac Cartain is mentioned as head of ''Ceneil Fogartaigh''.&lt;ref name="Placenames"/&gt;
*1370-5, Mac Artain ''uirrí'' (sub-king) of ''Cenel Fhagartoigh'', was killed by his own kinsman, Mac Gilla Ternaind.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Placenames"/&gt;

By the [[Elizabethan era]], Kinelarty was simultaneously known under variations of "MacCarton's country", and during the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]] simultaneously under variations of "Killenarten", before once again becoming simply known as variations of Kinelarty.&lt;ref name="Placenames"/&gt;

'''Leopold Łabędź''' (22 January 1920 – 22 March 1993) was an [[anti-communist]] [[English people|Anglo]]-[[Poland|Polish]] commentator on the [[Soviet Union]].

Łabędź was born to a Polish Jewish doctor in Russia. The family soon returned to [[Warsaw]] and the young Łabędź decided to follow his father into the medical profession. He studied medicine in [[Paris]]. In 1939, he fled to the Soviet zone of occupation and was imprisoned by the Soviets in the [[Gulag]].

He left the Soviet Union in 1942 as part of the [[Polish Army]] led by General [[Władysław Anders]]. After the war he studied at [[Bologna]] University before settling in [[London]], where he studied at the [[London School of Economics]]. Strongly [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], Łabędź edited ''Survey'' journal and headed the London office of [[Workers' Defence Committee|Committee for the Defense of Workers]] known by its Polish abbreviation as [[Komitet Obrony Robotników|KOR]].

Łabędź often campaigned for the ''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]'' union in Poland, and for political prisoners in the Soviet Union. Łabędź was one of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s principal champions in the West and often defended the Russian writer against the charge of [[anti-semitism]].

[[File:Materialism-and-Empirio-Criticism.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front cover of the first edition of Lenin's ''Materialism and Empirio-criticism,'' published in Moscow in 1909 under the pseudonym "Vl. Ilyin."]]
'''''Materialism and Empirio-criticism''''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Материализм и эмпириокритицизм, Materializm i empiriokrititsizm'') is a philosophical work by [[Vladimir Lenin]], published in 1909. It was an obligatory subject of study in all institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]], as a seminal work of [[dialectical materialism]], a part of the curriculum called "Marxist–Leninist Philosophy". Lenin argued that human perceptions correctly and accurately reflect the objective external world.

Lenin formulates the fundamental philosophical contradiction between idealism and materialism as follows:
"Materialism is the recognition of 'objects in themselves' or objects outside the mind; the ideas and sensations are copies or images of these objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) says: the objects do not exist, outside the mind '; they are 'connections of sensations'."&lt;ref&gt;W. I. Lenin: '' Materialism and empirio-criticism. Critical remarks about a reactionary philosophy ''. Publisher for foreign language literature, Moscow 1947. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The book, whose full title is ''Materialism and Empirio-criticism. Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy'', was written by Lenin from February through October 1908 while he was exiled in [[Geneva]] and [[London]] and was published in [[Moscow]] in May 1909 by Zveno Publishers. The original [[manuscript]] and preparatory materials have been lost.

Most of the book was written when Lenin was in Geneva, apart from the one month spent in London, where he visited the library of the [[British Museum]] to access modern philosophical and natural science material. The index lists in excess of 200 sources for the book.

In December 1908, Lenin moved from Geneva to [[Paris]], where he worked until April 1909 on correcting the proofs. Some passages were edited to avoid tsarist censorship. It was published in [[Imperial Russia]] with great difficulty. Lenin insisted on the rapid distribution of the book and stressed that "not only literary but also serious political obligations" were involved in its publication.

The book was written as a reaction and criticism to the three-volume work ''Empiriomonism'' (1904–1906) by [[Alexander Bogdanov]], his political opponent within the [[Bolsheviks|Party]]. In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated at a Bolshevik mini-conference in Paris and expelled from the Central Committee, but he still retained a relevant role in the Party's left wing. He participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] and after 1917, he was appointed director of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences.

''Materialism and Empirio-criticism'' was republished in Russian in 1920 with an introduction attacking Bogdanov by [[Vladimir Nevsky]]. It subsequently appeared in over 20 languages and acquired canonical status in Marxist–Leninist philosophy.

== Chapters summary ==

In Chapter I: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism I, Lenin then discusses the "solipsism" of Mach and Avenarius.

In Chapter II: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism II, Lenin, Tschernow and Basarov confront the views of Ludwig Feuerbach, Joseph Dietzgen and Friedrich Engels and comment on the criterion of practice in epistemology.

In Chapter III: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism III, Lenin seeks to define "matter" and "experience" and addresses the questions of causality and necessity in nature as well as "freedom and necessity" and the "principle of the economy of thought".

In Chapter IV: The philosophical idealists as collaborators and successors of empirio-criticism, Lenin deals with left and right Kant criticism, with the philosophy of immanence, Bogdanov's empiri-monism, and the critique of Hermann von Helmholtz on the "theory of symbols."

In chapter V: The latest revolution in science and philosophical idealism, Lenin deals with the thesis that "the crisis of physics" "has disappeared matter". In this context he speaks of a "physical idealism" and notes (on p. 260): "For the only" property "of matter to whose acknowledgment philosophical materialism is bound is the property of being objective reality, outside of our consciousness." 

In Chapter VI: Empiriocriticism and Historical Materialism, Lenin discusses authors such as Bogdanov, Suvorov, Ernst Haeckel and Ernst Mach.

In an addition to Chapter IV, Lenin addresses the question: "From what side did N. G. Chernyshevsky criticize Kantianism?"

'''Maxime Steinberg''' was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] historian, described as "Belgium’s principal Holocaust historian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After Many Years, Belgium Begins Looking at Its Wartime Complicity |url=https://www.jta.org/2004/10/22/archive/after-many-years-belgium-begins-looking-at-its-wartime-complicity |accessdate=12 September 2018 |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=22 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maxime Steinberg was born into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 13 December 1936. His father had immigrated from [[Poland]] in 1930. During [[World War II]], his parents were arrested and deported to [[Nazi concentation camps]]. His mother was killed.  Maxime and his brother were hidden in rural [[Walloon Brabant]].&lt;ref name=Ceges/&gt;

Steinberg studied at the [[Free University of Brussels]] (ULB) under [[Jean Stengers]], initially interested in the history of the Belgian far-left. He worked as a teacher. A [[communism]], Steinberg was also active in Belgium's public sector [[trade union]]. In 1982, he returned to ULB to work as an [[associate professor]] at the Institute for the Study of Judaism (''Institut d'Etudes du Judaïsme''). He completed his doctoral thesis on the Holocaust in Belgium in 1987 under Stenger's supervision.

Steinberg is best-known for his [[magnum opus]] on the Holocaust in Belgium, published as ''L'Étoile et le Fusil'' ("The Star and the Rifle") between 1983 and 1987, which "revolutionised historiography on the persecution of the Jews in Belgium".&lt;ref name=Ceges&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saerens |first1=Lieven |title=Decease of Maxime Steinberg, historian of the persecution of the Jews in Belgium |url=http://www.cegesoma.be/cms/archivage2010_en.php?article=1486 |website=[[Cegesoma]] |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in three tomes (four volumes), representing the first scholarly narrative on the subject.&lt;ref name=Ceges/&gt; According to Lieven Saerens, ''L'Étoile et le Fusil''
{{quote|analysed in minute detail the steps taken by the Germans to further isolate the Jews and the devastating role which the 'policy of the lesser evil' of the Belgian authorities had played here. He analysed what he described as the 'xenophobic paradox of the Endlösung'. He described how the occupier had taken the xenophobia of the Belgian authorities into account in the execution of the 'Endlösung'. Steinberg did not conceive this xenophobia as a manifest, omnipresent hatred of aliens, but as the historical fact that the Belgian authorities did not feel responsible for the aliens who resided on the Belgian territory. Only when the Jews who had been naturalised as Belgians were concerned did a formal protest from the Belgian authorities follow. The responsibility of the Association of Jews in Belgium, founded by the occupier, was given due attention. But just as much did he do justice to the non-Jewish helpers.&lt;ref name=Ceges/&gt;}} 

Steinberg was also known as a [[public historian]]. He was a historical expert called during the much-publicised trial of [[Kurt Asche]] (1980-81) and in designing the exhibition of [[Kazerne Dossin – Memorial|Museum of the Deportation and Resistance]] in [[Mechelen]], Belgium.

'''Moshe "Misha" Lewin''', pronounced "Luh-VENE" (7 November 1921 – 14 August 2010), was a scholar of [[History of Russia|Russian]] and [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet history]]. He  was a major figure in the school of Soviet studies which emerged in the 1960s.

==First 40 years==

Moshe Lewin was born in 1921 in [[Wilno]], [[Poland]] (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), the son of ethnic [[Jewish]] parents who later died in the [[Holocaust]]. Lewin lived in Poland for the first 20 years of his life, fleeing to the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941 just ahead of the invading [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] army.&lt;ref name="LampertX"&gt;Nick Lampert, "Preface" to Nick Lampert and Gábor Rittersporn, ''Stalinism: Its Nature and Aftermath: Essays in Honour of Moshe Lewin.'' Basingstoke, England: Macmillan, 1992, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the next two years, Lewin worked as a [[collective farm]] worker and as a [[blast furnace]] operator in a metallurgical factory.&lt;ref name="LampertX" /&gt; In summer 1943, he enlisted in the [[Soviet army]] and was sent to officers' training school. He was promoted on the last day of the [[World War II|war]].&lt;ref name="LampertX" /&gt;

In 1946, Lewin returned to Poland before emigrating to [[France]]. A believer in [[Labor Zionism]] from his youth, in 1951 Lewin emigrated again, this time to [[Israel]], where he worked for a time on a [[kibbutz]] and as a [[journalist]]. In his thirties, he took up academic studies,&lt;ref name="LampertX" /&gt; receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Tel Aviv University]],  in 1961.&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;Kaiyi Chen, [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/lewinm.html Finding Aid for the Moshe Lewin Papers], University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Lewin was awarded a research scholarship to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]], where he studied the [[collectivization]] of Soviet agriculture.&lt;ref name="LampertXI"&gt;Nick Lampert, "Preface," p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964, he gained his [[Ph.D]] there.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

==Academic career and major publications==

Newly qualified with his doctorate, Lewin was named Director of Study at l'[[École des hautes études]], Paris, where he served from 1965 to 1966.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt; During this time he converted his Sorbonne dissertation into a book, published in French in 1966 and in English two years later as ''Russian Peasants and Soviet Power''.

===''Russian Peasants and Soviet Power'' (1968)===
This [[monograph]] dealt with the [[Soviet grain procurement crisis of 1928]] and the associated political battle, a bitter fight which resulted in a decision to forcibly [[collectivization|collectivize]] Soviet agriculture. 

In this work, Lewin emphasized collectivization as a practical (albeit extreme) solution to a real world problem facing the Soviet regime, one out of several potential solutions to a crisis situation.  Rather than an inevitable and predestined action, collectivization was cast as a brutal manifestation of ''[[realpolitik]]'' — a view in marked contrast to the traditionalist [[historiography]] of the day. ''Russian Peasants and Soviet Power'' was initially projected as the first part of a long study of the [[social history]] of Soviet Russia down to 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, "Author's Foreword" to ''Russian Peasants and Soviet Power: A Study of Collectivization'', London: George Allen and Unwin, 1968, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; although the project seems to have been abandoned, perhaps as duplicative of the work of British historians [[E.H. Carr]] and [[Robert William Davies|R.W. Davies]].

===''Lenin's Last Struggle'' (1968)===
Lewin's other 1968 publication, ''Lenin's Last Struggle'', was an extended essay that charted the evolution of [[V.I. Lenin|Lenin's]] thinking about the growing bureaucracy of Soviet Russia. In it, Lewin additionally chronicled the politics of the post-Lenin succession struggle during the time of Lenin's final illness, emphasizing "lost" alternatives to the actual path of historical development. 

In this book Lewin again offered a perspective in marked contrast to the voluminous writings of the [[totalitarianism|totalitarianist school]] that then dominated academic writing about the Soviet Union, casting the USSR as a monolithic and fundamentally unchanging structure.

===''Political Undercurrents in Soviet Economic Debates'' (1974)===
From 1967 to 1968, Lewin was a senior fellow at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt; Upon completion of his Columbia fellowship, he took a post as a research professor at [[Birmingham University]], [[England]] from 1968 until 1978.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

During this period Lewin published ''Political Undercurrents in Soviet Economic Debates: From Bukharin to the Modern Reformers,'' which, along with the work of [[Princeton University]] professor [[Stephen F. Cohen]], helped to restore the name and ideas of [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to the academic debate concerning the Soviet 1920s. Lewin noted that many of the same criticisms which Bukharin leveled against Stalin during the political battles of 1928 and 1929 in the USSR were later "adopted by current reformers as their own," thereby adding a contemporary importance to the study of the historical past.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, "Introduction" to ''Political Undercurrents in Soviet Economic Debates: From Bukharin to the Modern Reformers'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1974, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Birmingham, Lewin returned to the United States. He took up a professorship at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he remained until his retirement in 1995.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

===''The Making of the Soviet System'' (1985)===
Although regarded as a doyen of [[social history]] and a godfather of the so-called "[[historical revisionism|revisionist]]" movement of young social historians who came to the fore in Soviet studies during the 1970s and 1980s, Lewin's own work largely centered on the relationship between [[political history|high politics]] and economic policy. 

One notable exception came with the publication in 1985 of a collection of Lewin's essays and lectures entitled ''The Making of the Soviet System.'' In this work, Lewin visited a number of key topics of social history such as rural social [[mores]], popular [[religion]], [[customary law]] in rural society, the social structure of the Russian peasantry, and social relations within Soviet industry. He emerged as a critic of the politicized "What are they up to?" orientation of Soviet studies, favoring a more apolitical perspective that attempted to answer the question, "What makes the Russians tick?"&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, "Introduction" to ''The Making of the Soviet System: Essays in the Social History of Interwar Russia'', New York: Pantheon, 1985, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Soviet Century'' (2005)===
Lewin's final works attempted to analyze the rise of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and his brief efforts at top-down reform of the communist system, and to set the rise and fall of Soviet communism in historical perspective. 

In his last book, ''The Soviet Century'' (2005), Lewin argued that the political and economic system of the former Soviet Union constituted a sort of "bureaucratic absolutism" akin to the [[Prussia]]n bureaucratic monarchy of the 18th Century which had "ceased to accomplish the task it had once been capable of performing" and therefore given way.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, ''The Soviet Century'', London: Verso, 2005, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1992, Lewin was honored with a ''[[Festschrift]]'' edited by historians Nick Lampert and Gábor Rittersporn entitled ''Stalinism: Its Nature and Aftermath: Essays in Honour of Moshe Lewin.''&lt;ref&gt;Nick Lampert and Gábor Rittersporn, ''Stalinism: Its Nature and Aftermath: Essays in Honour of Moshe Lewin.'' Basingstoke, England: Macmillan, 1992. Published in the United States by M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors to the volume included economic historians [[Alec Nove]] and [[R.W. Davies]] as well as key social historians such as Lewis Siegelbaum and [[Ronald Grigor Suny]], among others.

In the Lewin ''Festschrift,'' co-editor Lampert summarized Lewin's work in the following manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The scope of Lewin's explorations has been very wide, dealing with a panorama of social classes and groups, with the lower depths of society as well as the bosses, with informal social norms as well as formal law, with popular religion as well as established [[ideology]]. The range of his intellectual debts is also broad, owing as much to [[Max Weber|Weber]] as to [[Karl Marx|Marx]], emphasising as much the power of ideologies and myths in human behaviour as the weight of economic structure. The key thing is the perception of society as a socio-cultural whole, though Lewin always remained open to new pathways that might appear in the course of research, always [[eclecticism|eclectic]] in the best sense, always eschewing the pursuit of a grand theory for all history — a pursuit which only leads you away from the rich canvas of concrete human experience."&lt;ref name="LampertXI" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moshe Lewin died on 14 August 2010 in [[Paris]]. His papers are housed at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

The '''Ndogboyosoi War''', also known as the '''Bush Devil War''', was an episode of political violence that occurred in 1982 between supporters of the [[All People's Congress]] (APC) and the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP) in [[Sierra Leone]]. The violence was centered in [[Pujehun District]], especially in the Soro-Gbema chiefdom. It was triggered by the ruling APC party's alleged electoral manipulation and the intervention of a special squad of customs police against supporters of the SLPP candidate.

There was no process of reconciliation following the violence. Children of those killed in the fighting or of those who died in detention were among the first to join the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), a rebel group which began a [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] in eastern and southern Sierra Leone nine years later.

'''Non-circulating legal tender''' (NCLT) refers to coins that are theoretically [[legal tender]] and could circulate but do not because their issue price, and/or their melt value at the time of issue is significantly above the arbitrary legal tender value placed thereon.  They are sold to collectors and investors with no intention that they be used as money.  Notable examples would include [[Commemorative coin|commemoratives]], [[Proof coinage|proofs]], [[bullion coin]]s, presentation sets, [[Pattern coin|pattern]]s and the like.&lt;ref&gt;''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of Coins'' Pp 704, 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Some coins intended as NCLT have historically circulated such as the 1893 [[Columbian half dollar|World's Columbian Exposition Half Dollars]]&lt;ref&gt;''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of Coins'' P 582&lt;/ref&gt; which was a commemorative and the 1856 [[Flying Eagle cent]]&lt;ref&gt;''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of Coins'' Pp 214-215&lt;/ref&gt; which was a pattern.

Private issues are not NCLT because they are not legal tender and are properly viewed as medals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5584">'''Petras Stankeras''' (born 29 June 1948 in [[Trakai]], [[Lithuania]]) is a Lithuanian historian specializing in [[World War II]].

==Biography==
In 1972, Stankeras graduated from the Faculty of History of [[Vilnius Pedagogical Institute]]. He worked as a senior research fellow of the [[Lithuanian Central State Archive]] in 1973–1977 and an engineer of road construction in 1977–1982. In March 1982, Stankeras joined the [[Ministry of the Interior (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior]]. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. From 2000 to 25 November 2010, he was a career public employee of the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;Stankeras Petras. Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija. T. XXII. – Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos centras, 2012, 448 psl.&lt;/ref&gt; Member of Lithuanian police veterans association.

==Historian==
From the age of fifteen, Stankeras took a great interest in the history of [[World War II]], [[German National Socialism]], [[Italian Fascism]], and the Lithuanian police. He put together a catalog of 20,000 personnel files of various war criminals and an archive of 100,000 photos.&lt;ref name="slaptai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slaptai.lt/politines-intrigos/3761-istorikas-petras-stankeras-mano-publikacija-simono-vyzentalio-centrui-uzkliuvo-greiciausiai-siekiant-pragmatisku-tikslu.html |title=Istorikas Petras Stankeras: "Mano publikacija Simono Vyzentalio centrui užkliuvo greičiausiai siekiant pragmatiškų tikslų" |date=2010-11-30 |first=Gintaras |last=Visockas |publisher=Slaptai.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Stankeras defended his Ph.D. dissertation ''Lithuanian Police during the Nazi Occupation in 1941–1944 (Organizational Structure and Personnel)'' at [[Vytautas Magnus University]]. The work was published by the [[Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania]] in 1998. Another book on the same topic was published in 2008 and partially translated into Russian in 2009. In 2014, Stankeras published ''Pralaimėta Adolfo Hitlerio kova'' (''The Lost Struggle of Adolf Hitler'') in which he translated and annotated large excerpts from Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mintis.eu/istorine-literatura/1117-pralaimeta-adolfo-hitlerio-kova.html Pralaimėta Adolfo Hitlerio kova. Petras Stankeras]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Stankeras coauthored 12 scientific books, published 250 articles in scientific and popular magazines in Lithuania, Poland and the United States, presented both at national and international academic conferences. Stankeras is a board member of the Lithuanian Military History Society.

==Controversy==
On 8 November 2010, magazine ''[[Veidas]]'' published his article about the [[Nuremberg trials]], in which the following sentence was printed: ''It is important as well that the Nuremberg process provided a legal basis for the legend of about 6 million supposedly murdered Jews even though in fact the court did not have a single document signed by Hitler ordering to exterminate Jews (this document, if it exists, has not been found, even though a million dollar reward has been promised)''. The sentence caught attention on 23 November and was interpreted to express [[Holocaust denial|denial of the Holocaust]]. [[Leonidas Donskis]] published a blog post&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donskis.lt/v/lt/1/1_/1143 L. Donskio blogas. Kur toji riba?]&lt;/ref&gt; while seven ambassadors (Great Britain, Estonia, Netherlands, Norway, France, Finland and Sweden) sent a letter to the Minister of Interior [[Raimundas Palaitis]]. Stankeras was forced to resign on 25 November 2010.&lt;ref name=slaptai/&gt; In a subsequent interview Stankeras explained that he intended only to question the six-million figure,&lt;ref name=slaptai /&gt; while editor-in-chief of ''Veidas'' admitted that the location of the word ''supposedly'' was a copy-editing error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/gsarafinas-kritikos-del-sakinio-apie-zydu-naikinima-sulaukes-istorikas-neneigia-holokausto.d?id=38987877 G.Sarafinas: kritikos dėl sakinio apie žydų naikinimą sulaukęs istorikas neneigia holokausto]&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators pointed out that the overall article was sympathetic to the Nazis on trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141016101956/http://www.archyvas.tst.bernardinai.lt/straipsnis/2010-12-06-justinas-zilinskas-neigimo-banalybe/54031/comments Justinas Žilinskas.

The interregnum is said to have lasted a decade according to [[Paul the Deacon]], but all other sources&amp;mdash;the ''[[Fredegarii Chronicon]]'', the ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', the ''[[Chronicon Gothanum]]'', and the Copenhagen continuator of [[Prosper Tiro]]&amp;mdash;accord it twelve.

After his death the Langobards had no king for ten years but were under dukes, and each one of the dukes held possession of his own city, Zaban of Ticinum, Wallari of Bergamus, Alichis of Brexia, Euin of Tridentum, Gisulf of Forum Julii. But there were thirty other dukes besides these in their own cities. In these days many of the noble Romans were killed from love of gain, and the remainder were divided among their "guests" and made tributaries, that they should pay the third part of their products to the Langobards. By these dukes of the Langobards in the seventh year from the coming of Alboin and of his whole people, the churches were despoiled, the priests killed, the cities overthrown, the people who had grown up like crops annihilated, and besides those regions which Alboin had taken, the greater part of Italy was seized and subjugated by the Langobards.&lt;ref&gt;Paul the Deacon, Book 2, XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Origo'' gives a shorter version of the same events:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rest of the Langobards set over themselves a king named, Cleph, of the stock of Beleos, and Cleph reigned two years and died. And the dukes of the Langobards administered justice for twelve years and after these things they set up over themselves a king named Autari the son of Cleph. And Autari took as his wife Theudelenda, a daughter of Garipald and of Walderada from Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'': Reliqui langobardi levaverunt sibi regem nomine cleph de beleos, et regnavit cleph annos duos, et mortuus est. Et iudicaverunt duces langobardorum annos duodecim; posthaec levaverunt sibi regem nomine autarine, filio claffoni; et accepit autari uxorem theudelenda, filia garipald et walderade de baiuaria.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lombards had entered the Italian peninsula in 568 under [[Alboin]]. Under Alboin's successor, [[Cleph]], they continued to expand at the expense of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Cleph's reign was short and his rule hard. Upon his death, the Lombards did not elect another leader-king, leaving the territorial dukes the highest authorities in Lombard territories. According to Fredegar, they were forced to pay tribute to the [[Franks]], and this lasted until the accession of [[Adaloald]].&lt;ref name=Everette&gt;Everett (2003), 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dukes were unable to organise themselves under a single leader capable of continuing their successes against the Byzantines. When they invaded Frankish [[Provence]] (584/5), the Frankish kings [[Guntram]] and [[Childebert II]] counter-invaded northern Italy, took [[Trento|Trent]], and opened negotiations with the emperor [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius II]], sovereign of the hard-pressed [[exarchate of Ravenna]]. Finally, tired of disunion, fearing a pincer action from a Byzantine–Frankish alliance, and lacking the leadership necessary to withstand combined military forces, the dukes elected as king [[Authari]]. They ceded to him the old capital of [[Pavia]] and half of their ducal demesnes, though the fidelity to their oath with which this last promise was carried out is suspect. With the election of a king and the payment of tribute, the last Frankish troops still in Italy left.&lt;ref name=Everette/&gt;

Among the known reigning dukes of the times were:
*[[Zotto]], [[duke of Benevento]]
*Vallari, duke of [[Bergamo]]
*Alagis I, duke of [[Brescia]]
*[[Gisulf I of Friuli|Gisulf I]], [[duke of Friuli]]
*[[Zaban]], duke of [[Pavia]]
*[[Faroald I]], [[duke of Spoleto]]
*[[Euin]], [[Duchy of Tridentum|duke of Trent]]
*Aimone, duke of [[Turin]]

'''Souk Al Asr''' ({{lang-ar|سوق العصر}}; English: Era market) is one of the [[Souks of Tunis|souks]] of [[Tunis]], specialized in selling antique products. The souk is mainly intended for the middle class and poor.

== Location ==
It is located behind [[Bab Al Gorjani]], one of the [[Medina of Tunis|medina]]'s doors and near three neighbourhoods inhabited by poor people of Tunis, i.e. Mellassine, Saida Manoubia and Helal City.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|author=Yousra Ouannes|title=Tunisie : " Souk al-Asr ", la brocante des pauvres|url=http://aa.com.tr/fr/mode-de-vie/tunisie-souk-al-asr-la-brocante-des-pauvres/72945|website=aa.com.tr|date=21 February 2015|access-date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The souk didn't exist before the [[Husainid Dynasty|Husainid era]] (1705-1957), while other souks emerged under the [[Hafsid dynasty]] (1228-1537).&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt; It was a tiny souk that stood between prayers of the afternoon and the sunset (third and fourth prayers of the day).&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

== Products ==
Souk Al Asr is totally the opposite of its own name as it solds only old products like household utensils, antique furniture and other rare items. This market is full of items that can be particularly useful and rare, that are not likely to be found elsewhere.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

==Notes==
*{{note label|Note1|a|a}} From August 26 to November 9, 1942, 15 convoys from [[Occupied France|France]] and a few from [[Belgium]] underwent a selection for a work detail at Kosel before arrival at [[Auschwitz]]; about 3,000 healthy men were taken, of whom about 2,000 were still alive on April 1, 1944, the day they were registered at Auschwitz.  Only 377 were still alive in 1945, constituting the largest group of survivors from those deported in 1942, not including 256 survivors from the first six convoys, which arrived in Auschwitz before gas chambers operations were begun in July 1942.
*{{note label|Note2|b|b}} The numbers of the convoys of December 7 and 17, 1943 were inverted by the [[Gestapo]]; we have maintained that order.
*{{note label|Note3|c|c}} In addition to the 73,853 total, the following are added:
:*Jews deported to Auschwitz from [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] and [[Pas-de-Calais]] (in France) through Belgium (about 1,000)
:*Jews married to prisoners of war and deported to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] with their children (257)
:*Jews deported from [[Noé, Haute-Garonne|Noé]], [[Saint-Sulpice-la-Pointe]], and [[Toulouse]] to [[Buchenwald]] on July 30, 1944 (at least 350) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/hsv/source_view.php?SourceId=30550 |website=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |title= Four name lists collected from various sources pertaining to the July 30, 1944 deportation from Toulouse, France to the Buchenwald (ID: 30550) |accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urbanization''' refers to the population shift from rural to urban residency, the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas, and the ways in which each society adapts to this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urbanization|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2014/MB_cgi?term=Urbanization|website=MeSH browser|publisher=National Library of Medicine| quote=The process whereby a society changes from a rural to an urban way of life. It refers also to the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas.|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urbanization in 2013|url=http://demographicpartitions.org/urbanization-2013/|website=demographic partitions|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two concepts are sometimes used interchangeably, urbanization should be distinguished from urban growth: urbanization is "the proportion of the total national population living in areas classed as urban", while urban growth refers to "the absolute number of people living in areas classed as urban".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urbanisation, rural-urban migration and urban poverty|last=Tacoli|first=Cecilia|date=2015|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|others=McGranahan, Gordon, Satterthwaite, David|isbn=9781784311377|location=London|pages=|oclc=942419887}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] projected that half of the [[World population|world's population]] would live in urban areas at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Growing-Cities.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209221745/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Growing-Cities.php|archivedate=9 February 2009|title=UN says half the world's population will live in urban areas by end of 2008|agency=Associated Press|date= 26 February 2008|publisher=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the [[developing world]] and 86% of the [[developed world]] will be urbanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21564998-cities-are-turning-vast-data-factories-open-air-computers |title=Urban life: Open-air computers |publisher=The Economist |date=27 October 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/urbanization|title=Urbanization|work=UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2017 to 2030 will be absorbed by cities, about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Urbanization, City Growth, and the New United Nations Development Agenda | author = Barney Cohen| publisher = Cornerstone, The Official Journal of the World Coal Industry| volume = 3| issue = 2| pages = 4–7| date = 2015| url = http://cornerstonemag.net/urbanization-city-growth/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbanization is relevant to a range of disciplines, including [[urban planning]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307|title = Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks| journal=Urban Geography| volume=39| issue=5| pages=655–666|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has been closely linked to [[modernization]], [[industrialization]], and the sociological process of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Gries, T. and Grundmann, R., 2018. Fertility and modernization: the role of urbanization in developing countries. Journal of International Development, 30(3), pp.493-506.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization can be seen as a specific condition at a set time (e.g. the proportion of total population or area in cities or towns) or as an increase in that condition over time. So urbanization can be quantified either in terms of, say, the level of urban development relative to the overall population, or as the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] at which the urban proportion of the population is increasing. Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the “potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.”&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

Urbanization is not merely a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and historic transformation of human [[Social network|social roots]] on a global scale, whereby predominantly [[rural culture]] is being rapidly replaced by predominantly [[urban culture]]. The first major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of [[hunter-gatherers]] into villages many thousand years ago. Village culture is characterized by common bloodlines, intimate relationships, and communal behavior, whereas urban culture is characterized by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations, and competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of people is forecast to continue and intensify during the next few decades, mushrooming cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago. As a result, the world urban population growth curve has up till recently followed a quadratic-hyperbolic pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/22215616/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Secular_Cycles_and_Millennial_Trends ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS, 2006; Korotayev A.

Today, in Asia the urban agglomerations of [[Keihanshin|Osaka]], [[Karachi]], [[Jakarta]], [[Mumbai]], [[Shanghai]], [[Manila]], [[Seoul]] and [[Beijing]] are each already home to over 20 million people, while [[Delhi]] and [[Tokyo]] are forecast to approach or exceed 40 million people each within the coming [period that the author forgot to add]. Cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Istanbul]], [[Mexico City]], [[São Paulo]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Lagos|Los Angeles ,]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Cairo]] are, or soon will be, home to over 10 million people each.

==History==
From the development of the earliest cities in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the vast majority of the population who engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] in a rural context, and small centres of populations in the towns where economic activity consisted primarily of trade at [[Market (place)|market]]s and manufactures on a small scale. Due to the primitive and relatively stagnant state of agriculture throughout this period, the ratio of rural to urban population remained at a fixed equilibrium. However, a significant increase in the percentage of the global urban population can be traced in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/26447633/The_Urbanization_and_Political_Development_of_the_World_System_A_comparative_quantitative_analysis The Urbanization and Political Development of the World System: A comparative quantitative analysis.

With the onset of the [[British Agricultural Revolution|British agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution]] in the late 18th century, this relationship was finally broken and an unprecedented growth in urban population took place over the course of the 19th century, both through continued migration from the countryside and due to the tremendous [[Demographic transition|demographic expansion]] that occurred at that time. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the proportion of the population living in cities with more than 20,000 people jumped from 17% in 1801 to 54% in 1891. Moreover, and adopting a broader definition of urbanization, we can say that while the urbanized population in England and Wales represented 72% of the total in 1891, for other countries the figure was 37% in [[France]], 41% in [[Prussia]] and 28% in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="urbanization"&gt;{{Cite conference |title=Trends in urbanisation |year=1993|author=Christopher Watson|editor1=K.B.

As labourers were freed up from working the land due to higher agricultural productivity they converged on the new industrial cities like [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]] which were experiencing a boom in commerce, trade and industry. Growing trade around the world also allowed cereals to be imported from [[North America]] and [[Dunedin (ship)|refrigerated meat]] from [[Australasia]] and [[South America]]. Spatially, [[urban sprawl|cities also expanded]] due to the development of [[public transport|public transport systems]], which facilitated commutes of longer distances to the city centre for the [[working class]].

Urbanization rapidly spread across the Western world and, since the 1950s, it has begun to take hold in the [[developing world]] as well. At the turn of the 20th century, just 15% of the world population lived in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Annez|first1=Patricia Clarke|last2=Buckley|first2=Robert M.|chapter=Urbanization and Growth: Setting the Context |chapter-url=http://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/finklerm/chapter1urban.pdf|title=Urbanization and Growth|editor1-last=Spence|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Annez|editor2-first=Patricia Clarke|editor3-last=Buckley|editor3-first=Robert M.|isbn=978-0-8213-7573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations|UN]], the year 2007 witnessed the turning point when more than 50% of the world population were living in cities, for the first time in human history.&lt;ref name="urbanization"/&gt;

Urbanization occurs either organically or planned as a result of individual, collective and state action. Living in a city can be culturally and economically beneficial since it can provide greater opportunities for access to the labor market, reduce the time and expense of commuting and transportation better education, housing and safety conditions. Condition like density, proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition are elements of an urban environment that deemed positive. However, there are also negative social phenomena that arise, alienation, stress, increased cost of living, and mass marginalization that are connected to an urban way of living. [[Suburbanization]], which is happening in the cities of the largest developing countries, may be regarded as an attempt to balance these negative aspects of urban life while still allowing access to the large extent of shared resources.

In cities, money, services, wealth and opportunities are centralized. Many rural inhabitants come to the city to seek their fortune and alter their social position. Businesses, which provide jobs and exchange capital, are more concentrated in urban areas. Whether the source is trade or tourism, it is also through the ports or banking systems, commonly located in cities, that foreign money flows into a country.

Many people move into cities for the economic opportunities, but this does not fully explain the very high recent urbanization rates in places like China and India. [[Rural flight]] is a contributing factor to urbanization. In rural areas, often on small family farms or collective farms in villages, it has historically been difficult to access manufactured goods, though the relative overall [[quality of life]] is very subjective, and may certainly surpass that of the city. Farm living has always been susceptible to unpredictable environmental conditions, and in times of [[drought]], [[flood]] or pestilence, survival may become extremely problematic.

{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=left|qalign=left |quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;Thai farmers are seen as poor, stupid, and unhealthy. As young people flee the farms, the values and knowledge of rice farming and the countryside are fading, including the tradition of long kek, helping neighbors plant, harvest, or build a house.

In a New York Times article concerning the acute migration away from farming in Thailand, life as a farmer was described as "hot and exhausting". "Everyone says the farmer works the hardest but gets the least amount of money". In an effort to counter this impression, the Agriculture Department of Thailand is seeking to promote the impression that farming is "honorable and secure".&lt;ref name="NYT Thai Farm"/&gt;

However, in Thailand, urbanization has also resulted in massive increases in problems such as obesity. Shifting from a rural environment to an urbanized community also caused a transition to a diet that was mainly carbohydrate based to a diet higher in fat and sugar, consequently causing a rise in obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jitnarin|first=Nattinee|last2=Kosulwat|first2=Vongsvat|last3=Rojroongwasinkul|first3=Nipa|last4=Boonpraderm|first4=Atitada|last5=Haddock|first5=Christopher K.|last6=Poston|first6=Walker S.

Examples of this were the [[2011 Thailand floods]] and [[2007 Jakarta flood]]. Urban areas are also far more prone to [[violence]], [[drugs]], and other urban social problems. In the United States, [[Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[agriculture]] has negatively affected the economy of small and middle-sized farms and strongly reduced the size of the rural labour market.

Particularly in the developing world, conflict over land rights due to the effects of [[globalization]] has led to less politically powerful groups, such as farmers, losing or forfeiting their land, resulting in obligatory migration into cities. In China, where land acquisition measures are forceful, there has been far more extensive and rapid urbanization (54%) than in India (36%), where peasants form militant groups (e.g. [[Naxalites]]) to oppose such efforts. Obligatory and unplanned migration often results in rapid growth of slums.   
This is also similar to areas of violent conflict, where people are driven off their land due to violence. [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] is one example of this.

Cities offer a larger variety of services, including specialist services not found in rural areas. These services requires workers, resulting in more numerous and varied job opportunities. Elderly people may be forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can cater for their health needs. Varied and high quality educational opportunities are another factor in urban migration, as well as the opportunity to join, develop, and seek out social communities.

Urbanization also creates opportunities for women that are not available in rural areas. This creates a gender-related transformation where women are engaged in paid employment and have access to education. This may cause fertility to decline. However, women are sometimes still at a disadvantage due to their unequal position in the labour market, their inability to secure assets independently from male relatives and exposure to violence.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/urbanization-gender-and-urban-poverty |title=Urbanization, gender and urban poverty:Paid work and unpaid carework in the city |year=2012 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in cities are more productive than in rural areas. An important question is whether this is due to [[Economies of agglomeration|agglomeration effects]] or whether cities simply attract those who are more productive. Economists have recently shown that there exists a large productivity gain due to locating in dense agglomerations.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. (2013) [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/juecon/v73y2013i1p94-110.html Geographic Clustering and Productivity: An Instrumental Variable Approach for Classical Composers], Journal of Urban Economics, 73(1): 94–110&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus possible that agents{{clarify|date=August 2015}} locate in cities in order to benefit from these agglomeration effects.

==Dominant conurbation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
{{see also|List of largest cities throughout history}}
{{see also|Primate city}}

The dominant [[conurbation]](s) of a country can benefit to a greater extent from the same things cities offer, making them magnets for not just the non-urban population, but also urban and suburban population from other cities. Dominant conurbations are quite often [[primate city|primate cities]], but do not have to be. For instance [[Greater Manila]] is rather a conurbation than a city: its 20 million overall population (over 20% national population) make it very much a primate city, but Quezon City (2.7 million), the largest municipality in Greater Manila, and Manila (1.6 million), the capital, are not. A conurbation's dominance can be measured by output, wealth, and especially population, each expressed as a percentage of an entire country. Greater Seoul is one conurbation with massive dominance over South Korea, it is home to 50% of the entire national population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kosis.kr/abroad/abroad_01List.jsp?parentId=A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826055149/http://kosis.kr/abroad/abroad_01List.jsp?parentId=A|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Greater Busan-Ulsan (15%, 8 million) and Greater Osaka (14%, 18 million) exhibit strong dominance in their respective countries, they are losing population to their even more dominant rivals, Seoul and Tokyo respectively.

==Economic effect==
[[File:Crowded BTS skytrain Bangkok.jpg|thumb|Crowded people on [[Siam BTS Station]] on the rush hour in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]
As cities develop, effects can include a dramatic increase and change in costs, often pricing the local [[working class]] out of the market, including such functionaries as employees of the local municipalities. For example, Eric Hobsbawm's book ''The age of revolution: 1789–1848'' (published 1962 and 2005) chapter 11, stated "Urban development in our period [1789–1848] was a gigantic process of class segregation, which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government and business and the newly specialized residential areas of the bourgeoisie. The almost universal European division into a 'good' west end and a 'poor' east end of large cities developed in this period." This is likely due the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/may/12/blowing-wind-cities-poor-east-ends|title=Blowing in the wind: why do so many cities have poor east ends?|first=Leo|last=Benedictus|date=12 May 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar problems now affect the developing world, rising inequality resulting from rapid urbanization trends. The drive for rapid urban growth and often efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development. Think tanks such as the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have proposed policies that encourage labor-intensive growth as a means of absorbing the influx of low-skilled and unskilled labor.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Ursula (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1969&amp;title=opportunity-exploitation-urban-labour-markets Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One problem these migrant workers are involved with is the growth of [[slums]]. In many cases, the rural-urban low skilled or unskilled migrant workers, attracted by economic opportunities in urban areas, cannot find a job and afford housing in cities and have to dwell in slums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Todaro |first=Michael P. |title=A Model of Labor Migration and Urban Unemployment in Less Developed Countries |journal=The American Economic Review |year=1969 |volume=59 |issue=1 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban problems, along with infrastructure developments, are also fueling suburbanization trends in developing nations, though the trend for core cities in said nations tends to continue to become ever denser. Urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend, but there are positives in the reduction of expenses in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Glaeser, Edward|title=Are Cities Dying? |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1998 |pages=139–60 |doi=10.1257/jep.12.2.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brand&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.me.com/stewartbrand/DISCIPLINE_footnotes/2_-_City_Planet.html |title=Whole Earth Discipline – annotated extract |author=Brand, Stewart |accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/089124249701100101 |title=Neighborhood Initiative and the Regional Economy| journal = Economic Development Quarterly| volume = 11| pages = 3–10| year = 1997| last1 = Nowak | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Using the Gall-Peters Projection it is estimated that come 2015 the worlds urban population is set to exceed 4 billion, most of this growth is expected in Africa and Asia and China to be 50% urbanized.&lt;/ref&gt; While cities have a greater variety of markets and goods than rural areas, infrastructure congestion, monopolization, high overhead costs, and the inconvenience of cross-town trips frequently combine to make marketplace competition harsher in cities than in rural areas.

In many developing countries where economies are growing, the growth is often erratic and based on a small number of industries. For young people in these countries barriers exist such as, lack of access to financial services and business advisory services, difficulty in obtaining credit to start a business, and lack of entrepreneurial skills, in order for them to access opportunities in these industries. Investment in human capital so that young people have access to quality education and infrastructure to enable access to educational facilities is imperative to overcoming economic barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swop |title=State of the World Population 2014 |year=2014 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
The existence of [[urban heat island]]s has become a growing concern over the years. An urban heat island is formed when industrial and urban areas produce and retain heat. Much of the solar energy that reaches rural areas is consumed by evaporation of water from vegetation and soil. In cities, where there is less vegetation and exposed soil, most of the sun's energy is instead absorbed by buildings and asphalt; leading to higher surface temperatures. Vehicles, factories and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units release even more heat.&lt;ref&gt;Park, H.-S. (1987).

Ibaraki, Japan: Environmental Research Center, The University of Tsukuba.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, cities are often 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8 to 5.4&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than surrounding landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ "Heat Island Effect"]. Epa.gov (17 November 2010). Retrieved on 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Impacts also include reducing soil moisture and a reduction in reabsorption of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heating Up: Study Shows Rapid Urbanization in China Warming the Regional Climate Faster than Other Urban Areas |url=http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/china-climate.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Whole Earth Discipline]]'', Stewart Brand argues that the effects of urbanization are primarily positive for the environment. First, the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate, and keeps falling, reducing environmental stresses caused by population growth. Secondly, emigration from rural areas reduces destructive subsistence farming techniques, such as improperly implemented [[slash and burn]] agriculture.

In July 2013 a report issued by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/2843WESS2013.pdf "World Economic and Social Survey (WESS) 2013"] World Economic and Social Affairs. July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; warned that with 2.4 billion more people by 2050, the amount of food produced will have to increase by 70%, straining food resources, especially in countries already facing food insecurity due to changing environmental conditions. The mix of changing environmental conditions and the growing population of urban regions, according to UN experts, will strain basic sanitation systems and health care, and potentially cause a humanitarian and environmental disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Auber, Tamar (17 July 2013) [http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/climate-change-and-rapid-urban-expansion-in-africa-threaten-childrens-lives/ "Climate change and rapid urban expansion in Africa threaten children’s lives."] UNEARTH News. Retrieved 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water Quality ===
The occurrence of eutrophication in bodies of water is another effect large urban populations have on the environment. When rain occurs in these large cities, the rain filters down the pollutants such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other green house gases in the air onto the ground below. Then, those chemicals are washed directly into rivers, streams and oceans, causing a decline in water quality and damaging marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Leiwen|last2=Hoepf Young|first2=Malea|last3=Hardee|first3=Karen|year=2008|title=Population, Urbanization, And The Environment|url=|journal=World Watch|volume=21|issue=5|pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eutrophication is a process which causes hypoxic water conditions and algal blooms that may be detrimental to the survival of aquatic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/eutrophication-and-hypoxia/about-eutrophication|title=About Eutrophication {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Harmful algal bloom]]s, which produce dangerous toxins, thrive in eutrophic environments that are also rich in nitrogen and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms|title=Harmful Algal Blooms {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these ideal conditions, they overtake surface water, making it difficult for other organisms to receive sunlight and nutrients.  Overgrowth of algal blooms causes a decrease in overall water quality and disrupts the natural balance of aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, as algal blooms die, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is produced,  causing a more acidic environment, a process known as acidifacation.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrientchallenge.org/sites/default/files/documents/files/FINAL%20Ocean%20Acidification%20policy%20brief%20spread_press%20quality_print.pdf|title=Eutrophication and Ocean Acidification|last=Ramesh|first=R|last2=Lakshmi|first2=A|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Purvaja|first3=R|last4=Costanzo|first4=S.D|last5=Kelsey|first5=R.H|last6=Hawkey|first6=J|last7=Datta|first7=A|last8=Dennison|first8=W.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oceans surface also has the ability to absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the earths atmosphere as emissions increase with the rise in urbanization. In fact, it is reported that the ocean absorbs a quarter of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by humans.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/ocean-acidification|title=National Climate Assessment|website=National Climate Assessment|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been useful to the environment by decreasing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases, but also further perpetuates acidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feely|first=Richard A.|last2=Alin|first2=Simone R.|last3=Newton|first3=Jan|last4=Sabine|first4=Christopher L.|last5=Warner|first5=Mark|last6=Devol|first6=Allan|last7=Krembs|first7=Christopher|last8=Maloy|first8=Carol|date=August 2010|title=The combined effects of ocean acidification, mixing, and respiration on pH and carbonate saturation in an urbanized estuary|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S027277141000185X|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|volume=88|issue=4|pages=442–449|doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2010.05.004|issn=0272-7714|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in pH inhibit the proper formation of calcium carbonate, a crucial component for many marine organisms to maintain shells or skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-ocean-acidification|title=Understanding Ocean Acidification {{!}} NOAA Fisheries|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|date=2018-09-09|website=www.fisheries.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  This is especially true for many species of mollusks and coral.

Besides landfilling, this paper examines the advantages of introducing onsite composting and anaerobic digestion for the environmental recycling of UFW and the lowering of handling cost. For Asia and Africa, these solutions for UFW could reduce the mass of MSW by 43% and 55%, respectively, thus help there cities manage almost all of their MSW. For North America and Europe, such practice could reduce earth warming trends. - Inderscience Publishers - linking academia, business and industry through research|website=www.inderscience.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Bijaya K.|last2=Barrington|first2=Suzelle|last3=Martinez|first3=José|date=2006-10|title=Predicted growth of world urban food waste and methane production|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research: The Journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA|volume=24|issue=5|pages=421–433|doi=10.1177/0734242X06067767|issn=0734-242X|pmid=17121114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Bijaya K.|last2=Barrington|first2=Suzelle F.|last3=Martinez|first3=Jose|date=2009|title=Urban Food Waste generation: challenges and opportunities|journal=International Journal of Environment and Waste Management|language=en|volume=3|issue=1/2|pages=4|doi=10.1504/ijewm.2009.024696|issn=1478-9876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food waste is the disposal of food products that can no longer be used due to unused products, expiration, or spoilage.

=== Habitat Fragmentation ===
Urbanization can have a large effect on biodiversity by causing a division of habitats and thereby alienation of species, a process known as [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urbanization, habitat loss, biodiversity decline:  solution pathways to break the cycle |last=Elmqvist |first=Thomas |last2=Zipperer |first2=Wayne |last3=Güneralp |first3=Burak|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=139–151|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat fragmentation does not destroy the habitat, as seen in [[habitat loss]], but rather breaks it apart with things like roads and railways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Z, He C, Wu J | title = The Relationship between Habitat Loss and Fragmentation during Urbanization: An Empirical Evaluation from 16 World Cities | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e0154613 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27124180 | pmc = 4849762 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0154613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change may affect a species ability to sustain life by separating it from the environment in which it is able to easily access food, and find areas that they may hide from predation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1676/04-038|title = Nest Survival Relative to Patch Size in a Highly Fragmented Shortgrass Prairie Landscape|journal = The Wilson Bulletin|volume = 117|pages = 23–34|year = 2005|last1 = Skagen|first1 = Susan K.|last2 = Yackel Adams|first2 = Amy A.|last3 = Adams|first3 = Rod D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With proper planning and management, fragmentation can be avoided by adding corridors that aid in the connection of areas and allow for easier movement around urbanized regions.

Depending on the various factors, such as level of urbanization,  both increases or decreases in "species richness" can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKinney|first=Michael L.|date=2008-01-29|title=Effects of urbanization on species richness: A review of plants and animals|journal=Urban Ecosystems|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1007/s11252-007-0045-4|issn=1083-8155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that urbanization may be detrimental to one species but also help facilitate the growth of others. In instances of housing and building devevlopment, many times vegetation is completely removed immediately in order to make it easier and less expensive for construction to occur, thereby obliterating any native species in that area. Other times, such as with birds, urbanization may allow for an increase in richness when organisms are able to adapt to the new environment. This can be seen in species that may find food while scavenging developed areas or vegetation that has been added after urbanization has occurred i.e planted trees in city areas &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKinney|first=Michael|date=October 2002|title=Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/52-10-883.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlUwggJRBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJCMIICPgIBADCCAjcGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMTqpZYxOsMvf_ZeNmAgEQgIICCNFY_lEX31xCqxy90A_hexKOEnkIohgOlqlgsNR-b51C0uV1UZmbPg31KOwX0lGGX9qjCIUtv0gzV6JdUko0485Sti2ytLE4yAnph_tNO__m4SSnn12JmsAt_T-9uOyr9nIPyf4LBEb8CCozte99zh11bhUm0-UEqWeYVdSuBXLSK-4KnhVM2iDELMkQ1vsG3Vl6ACoNlInIjhEnOZ-B48emczGJ6kAlIBIiKrYnEL7FQiOEgkyBvGlHwWxYY6GiI3Lh0aWDclLImRs1boaX-YvLAKFKQVC0roDkmSPdsdO-etn0KFM-5qjgq1cDo8Kh0e3J5h_3xkIdeTNRKJGwMmJZRVBqLB7HoIAmqEX_ioUgb8TvmszNivTdPWpVtU2yaum6NOwMfIxXgxWIO_SfQPGC2vTo7CQtGsHOGflSRU_-dNpEbhzQyFyfbI7z1X0HeNmoohgnQeltLdHcmduoWb_k80lXS6F1TbsiOzG1JaRPikRyORxWtxFdmzClPrzhGtWZNR03bKdwn-E_mSFciSgDIY3VyWQQj96cibZafPB3fYuzfjbJr-K5O23PGKrdsDHKYdKVum0lt3ALxrH8uZu0oe1I46ok7MUJyN474pXAk2XkzlYo1mDlU5YpDqO4oXKhZ5HmVk8KD2ukgvflm9Vifa8t5YypLdJsJk67-mowI-I5oQwb7iU|journal=BioScience|volume=52|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and social effects==
{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=left|qalign=left |quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;When cities don’t plan for increases in population it drives up house and land prices, creating rich (ghettos) and poor ghettos. "You get a very unequal society and that inequality is manifested where people live, in our neighbourhoods, and it means there can be less capacity for empathy and less development for all society." — Jack Finegan, Urban Programme Specialist at [[UN-Habitat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yangon.coconuts.co/2016/02/22/crowded-hlaing-tharyar-township-slums-sit-next-gated-communites | title=In crowded Hlaing Tharyar township, slums sit next to gated communites &amp;#124; Coconuts Yangon| date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; |}}
In the developing world, urbanization does not translate into a significant increase in [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="Eckert-2014" /&gt; Rapid urbanization has led to increased mortality from [[non-communicable disease]]s associated with lifestyle, including [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name="Allender-2008" /&gt; Differences in mortality from [[contagious disease]]s vary depending on the particular disease and location.&lt;ref name="Eckert-2014" /&gt;

Urban health levels are on average better in comparison to rural areas. However, residents in poor urban areas such as slums and [[informal settlement]]s suffer "disproportionately from disease, injury, premature death, and the combination of ill-health and poverty entrenches disadvantage over time."&lt;ref name="UNFPA" /&gt; Many of the urban poor have difficulty accessing health services due to their inability to pay for them; so they resort to less qualified and unregulated providers.

While urbanization is associated with improvements in [[public hygiene]], [[sanitation]] and access to [[health care]], it also entails changes in occupational, [[dietary]] and [[exercise]] patterns.&lt;ref name="Allender-2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allender S, Foster C, Hutchinson L, Arambepola C |title=Quantification of urbanization in relation to chronic diseases in developing countries: a systematic review |journal=Journal of Urban Health |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=938–51 | date=November 2008 |pmid=18931915 |pmc=2587653 |doi=10.1007/s11524-008-9325-4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can have mixed effects on health patterns, alleviating some problems and accentuating others.&lt;ref name="Eckert-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckert S, Kohler S |title=Urbanization and health in developing countries: a systematic review |journal=World Health &amp; Population |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=7–20 |year=2014 |pmid=24702762 |doi=10.12927/whp.2014.23722 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===

One such effect is the formation of [[food desert]]s. Nearly 23.5 million people in the United States lack access to supermarkets within one mile of their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Block|first=Jason P.|last2=Subramanian|first2=S.

Food deserts in developed countries often correspond to areas with a high-density of fast food chains and convenience stores that offer little to no fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooksey-Stowers|first=Kristen|last2=Schwartz|first2=Marlene B.|last3=Brownell|first3=Kelly D.|date=2017-11-14|title=Food Swamps Predict Obesity Rates Better Than Food Deserts in the United States | journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=11|pages=1366|doi=10.3390/ijerph14111366|pmc=5708005|pmid=29135909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization has been shown to be associated with the consumption of less fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and a higher consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Poor access to healthy food and high intakes of fat, sugar and salt are associated with a greater risk for obesity, diabetes and related chronic disease. Overall, [[body mass index]] and [[cholesterol]] levels increase sharply with national income and the degree of urbanization.[[Urbanization#cite note-Allender-2008-40|[40]]]

Food deserts in the United States are most commonly found in low-income and predominately African American neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One study on food deserts in [[Denver]], Colorado found that, in addition to minorities, the affected neighborhoods also had a high proportion of children and new births.&lt;ref&gt;Stilley, Megan. University of Colorado at Denver, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2012. 1509386.&lt;/ref&gt; In children, urbanization is associated with a lower risk of [[Undernutrition|under-nutrition]] but a higher risk of [[overweight]].[[Urbanization#cite note-Eckert-2014-39|&lt;sup&gt;[39]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Asthma===

Urbanization has also been associated with an increased risk for asthma as well. Throughout the world, as communities transition from rural to more urban societies, the number of people effected by asthma increases. The odds of reduced rates of hospitalization and death from asthmas has decreased for children and young adults in urbanized municipalities in Brazil. This finding indicates that urbanization may have a negative impact on population health particularly affecting people’s susceptibility to asthma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ponte|first=Eduardo Vieira|last2=Cruz|first2=Alvaro A.|last3=Athanazio|first3=Rodrigo|last4=Carvalho-Pinto|first4=Regina|last5=Fernandes|first5=Frederico L.

In low and middle income countries many factors contribute to the high numbers of people with asthma. Similar to areas in the United States with increasing urbanization, people living in growing cities in low income countries experience high exposure to air pollution, which increases the prevalence and severity of asthma among these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz|first=Álvaro A.|last2=Stelmach|first2=Rafael|last3=Ponte|first3=Eduardo V.|date=2017-06-01|title=Asthma prevalence and severity in low-resource communities|url=http://Insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00130832-201706000-00005|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|language=ENGLISH|volume=17|issue=3|pages=188–193|doi=10.1097/aci.0000000000000360|pmid=28333691|issn=1528-4050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Links have been found between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlsten|first=Christopher|last2=Rider|first2=Christopher F.|date=2017-04-01|title=Traffic-related air pollution and allergic disease|url=http://Insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00130832-201704000-00006|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|language=ENGLISH|volume=17|issue=2|pages=85–89|doi=10.1097/aci.0000000000000351|pmid=28141628|issn=1528-4050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children living in poor, urban areas in the United States now have an increased risk of morbidity due to asthma in comparison to other low-income children in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keet|first=Corinne A.|last2=Matsui|first2=Elizabeth C.|last3=McCormack|first3=Meredith C.|last4=Peng|first4=Roger D.|title=Urban residence, neighborhood poverty, race/ethnicity, and asthma morbidity among children on Medicaid|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009167491730341X|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=140|issue=3|pages=822–827|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2017.01.036|pmid=28283418|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, children with croup living in urban areas have higher hazard ratios for asthma than similar children living in rural areas. Researchers suggest that this difference in hazard ratios is due to the higher levels of air pollution and exposure to environmental allergens found in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Sheng-Chieh|last2=Lin|first2=Hui-Wen|last3=Chiang|first3=Bor-Luen|date=2017-09-01|title=Association of croup with asthma in children|url=http://Insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005792-201709010-00010|journal=Medicine|language=ENGLISH|volume=96|issue=35|pages=e7667|doi=10.1097/md.0000000000007667|pmid=28858086|pmc=5585480|issn=0025-7974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to elevated levels of ambient air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), can cause DNA methylation of CpG sites in immune cells, which increases children’s risk of developing asthma. Studies have shown a positive correlation between ''Foxp3'' methylation and children’s exposure to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, any amount of exposure to high levels of air pollution have shown long term effects on the ''Foxp3'' region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prunicki|first=Mary|last2=Stell|first2=Laurel|last3=Dinakarpandian|first3=Deendayal|last4=de Planell-Saguer|first4=Mariangels|last5=Lucas|first5=Richard W.|last6=Hammond|first6=S.

Despite the increase in access to health services that usually accompanies urbanization, the rise in population density negatively affects air quality ultimately mitigating the positive value of health resources as more children and young adults develop asthma due to high pollution rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, urban planning as well as emission control can lessen the effects of traffic-related air pollution on allergic diseases such as asthma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Crime===

Historically crime and urbanization have gone hand in hand. The simplest explanation is that areas with a higher population density are surrounded by a greater availability of goods. Committing crimes in urbanized areas is also more feasible. Modernization has led to more crime as well. There is a greater awareness of the income gap between the rich and poor due to modern media. This leads to feelings of deprivation which can lead to crime. In some regions where urbanization happens in wealthier areas, a rise in property crime and a decrease in violent crime is seen.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, L. I. (1981). Crime and modernization: The impact of industrialization and urbanization on crime. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data shows that there is an increase of crime in urbanized areas. Some factors include per capita income, income inequality, and overall population size. There is also a smaller association between unemployment rate, police expenditures and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Gumus, E. (2004). Crime in urban areas: An empirical investigation.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of crime also has the ability to produce more crime. These areas have less social cohesion, and therefore less social control. This is evident in the geographical regions that crime occurs in. As most crime tends to cluster in city centers, the further the distance from the center of the city, the lower the occurrence of crimes are.&lt;ref&gt;Bruinsma, G. J. (2007). Urbanization and urban crime: Dutch geographical and environmental research. Crime and Justice, 35(1), 453-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration is also a factor that can increase crime in urbanized areas. People from one area are displaced and forced to move into an urbanized society. Here they are in a new environment with new norms and social values. This can lead to less social cohesion and more crime.&lt;ref&gt;Malik, A. A. (2016). Urbanization and Crime: A Relational Analysis. J. HUMAN. &amp; Soc. Scl., 21, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical activity===

Although urbanization tends to produce more negative effects, one positive effect that urbanization has impacted is an increase in physical activity in comparison to rural areas.  Residents of rural areas and communities in the United States have higher rates of obesity and engage in less physical activity than urban residents.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Umstattd Meyer|first=M.

=== Mental health ===
Urbanization factors that contribute to [[mental health]] can be thought of as factors that affect the individual and factors that affect the larger social group. At the macro, social group level, changes related to urbanization are thought to contribute to social disintegration and disorganization. These macro factors contribute to social disparities which affect individuals by creating perceived insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luciano|title=Perceived insecurity, mental health and urbanization: Results from a multicentric study|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|volume=62|issue=6|pages=252–61|doi=10.1177/0020764016629694|pmid=26896027|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived insecurity can be due problems with the physical environment, such as issues with personal safety, or problems with the social environment, such as a loss of positive self-concepts from negative events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|date=6 December 2007|title='Crowded suburbs' and 'killer cities': a brief review of the relationship between urban environments and mental health|journal=NSW Public Health Bulletin|volume=18|issue=12|pages=222–7|pmid=18093463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased stress is a common individual psychological stressor that accompanies urbanization and is thought to be due to perceived insecurity. Changes in social organization, a consequence of urbanization, are thought to lead to reduced social support, increased violence, and overcrowding. It is these factors that are thought to contribute to increased stress.&lt;ref name="Srivastava IPJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srivastava|first1=Kalpana|date=July 2009|title=Urbanization and mental health|pmc=2996208|journal=Industrial Psychiatry Journal|volume=18|issue=2|pages=75–6|doi=10.4103/0972-6748.64028|pmid=21180479}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that urbanization or population density alone does not cause mental health problems. It is the combination of urbanization with physical and social risk factors that contribute to mental health problems. As cities continue to expand it is important to consider and account for mental health along with other public health measures that accompany urbanization.

==Changing forms==
Different forms of urbanization can be classified depending on the style of architecture and planning methods as well as historic growth of areas.

In cities of the [[Developed country|developed world]] urbanization traditionally exhibited a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area, the so-called ''in-migration''. In-migration refers to migration from former colonies and similar places. The fact that many immigrants settle in impoverished city centres led to the notion of the "peripheralization of the core", which simply describes that people who used to be at the periphery of the former empires now live right in the centre.

Recent developments, such as [[inner-city]] redevelopment schemes, mean that new arrivals in cities no longer necessarily settle in the centre. In some developed regions, the reverse effect, originally called [[counter urbanization]] has occurred, with cities losing population to rural areas, and is particularly common for richer families. This has been possible because of improved communications, and has been caused by factors such as the fear of crime and poor urban environments. It has contributed to the phenomenon of [[shrinking cities]] experienced by some parts of the industrialized world.

When the residential area shifts outward, this is called suburbanization. A number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2006.11.001| title = Density gradients and their determinants: Evidence from India| journal = Regional Science and Urban Economics| volume = 37| issue = 3| pages = 314–44| year = 2007| last1 = Sridhar | first1 = K. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This networked, poly-centric form of concentration is considered by some emerging pattern of urbanization. It is called variously exurbia, edge city (Garreau, 1991), network city (Batten, 1995), or postmodern city (Dear, 2000). Los Angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization. In the United States, this process has reversed as of 2011, with "re-urbanization" occurring as ''suburban flight'' due to chronically high transport costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bora |first=Madhusmita |url=http://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/shifts-in-u-s-housing-demand-will-likely-lead-to/article_06860ab0-ef92-5c44-a05a-ef5aafef0143.html |title=Shifts in U.S. housing demand will likely lead to the re-urbanization of America |publisher=Nwitimes.com |date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural migrants are attracted by the possibilities that cities can offer, but often settle in [[Slum|shanty towns]] and experience extreme poverty. The inability of countries to provide adequate housing for these rural migrants is related to [[overurbanization]], a phenomenon in which the rate of urbanization grows more rapidly than the rate of economic development, leading to high unemployment and high demand for resources.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Kingsley | last2 = Hertz Golden | first2 = Hilda | year = 1954 | title = Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas | url = | journal = Economic Development and Cultural Change | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–26 | doi=10.1086/449673}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, this was attempted to be tackled with the '''urban bias theory''' which was promoted by [[Michael Lipton]].

{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=left|qalign=left |quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;...the most important class conflict in the poor countries of the world today is not between labour and capital. Nor is it between foreign and national interests. It is between rural classes and urban classes. The rural sector contains most of the poverty and most of the low-cost sources of potential advance; but the urban sector contains most of the articulateness, organization and power. So the urban classes have been able to win most of the rounds of the struggle with the countryside...". — Michael Lipton, author of urban bias theory&lt;ref&gt;Varshney, A. (ed.) 1993. "Beyond Urban Bias", p. 5. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; |}}

Most of the urban poor in developing countries unable to find work, can spend their lives in insecure, poorly paid jobs. According to research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] pro-poor urbanization will require labour-intensive growth, supported by labour protection, flexible land use regulation and investments in basic services.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi-publications/briefing-papers/44-urban-labour-markets-exploitation.pdf|title=Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets|date=November 2008|publisher=Overseas Development Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbanization can be planned urbanization or organic. Planned urbanization, i.e.: [[planned community]] or the [[garden city movement]], is based on an advance plan, which can be prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or [[urban design]] reasons. Examples can be seen in many ancient cities; although with exploration came the collision of nations, which meant that many invaded cities took on the desired planned characteristics of their occupiers. Many ancient organic cities experienced redevelopment for military and economic purposes, new roads carved through the cities, and new parcels of land were cordoned off serving various planned purposes giving cities distinctive geometric designs. UN agencies prefer to see [[infrastructure|urban infrastructure]] installed before urbanization occurs. [[Landscape planning|Landscape planners]] are responsible for landscape infrastructure ([[public park]]s, [[sustainable urban drainage systems]], [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] etc.) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater [[livability]] within a region. Concepts of control of the urban expansion are considered in the [[American Institute of Planners]].

As population continues to grow and urbanize at unprecedented rates, [[new urbanism]] and [[smart growth]] techniques are implemented to create a transition into developing environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable cities. Smart Growth and New Urbanism’s principles include [[walkability]], mixed-use development, comfortable high-density design, [[land conservation]], [[social equity]], and economic diversity. Mixed-use communities work to fight [[gentrification]] with [[affordable housing]] to promote social equity, decrease [[automobile dependency]] to lower use of [[fossil fuel]]s, and promote a [[localized economy]]. Walkable communities have a 38% higher average GDP per capita than less walkable urban metros (Leinberger, Lynch). By combining economic, environmental, and social sustainability, cities will become equitable, resilient, and more appealing than [[urban sprawl]] that [[overexploitation|overuse]]s [[land use|land]], promotes [[automobile use]], and segregates the population economically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/foot-traffic-ahead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Eldridge Lovelace|Lovelace, E.H.]]|title=Control of urban expansion: the Lincoln, Nebraska experience|journal=[[Journal of the American Institute of Planners]]|year=1965|volume=31:4|pages=348–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Zwarte Piet'' controversy==
In 2013, in her role as chair of WGEPAD, Shepherd was asked to inquire into [[Zwarte Piet]] ("Black Pete").
