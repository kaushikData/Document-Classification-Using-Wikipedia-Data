      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Adolphe Rome''' (July 12 1889, [[Stavelot]] – 9 April 1971, [[Korbeek-Lo]]) was a Belgian classical philologist and science historian who was particularly concerned with the ancient history of astronomy.&lt;ref name=AARBobit&gt;Franz de Ruyt: [http://www2.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/ROMEAdolpheARB_197238622.pdf ''Notice sur le chanoine Adolphe Rome, membre de l'Academy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219185031/http://www2.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/ROMEAdolpheARB_197238622.pdf |date=2015-12-19 }}. In: '' Annuaire de l'Académie royale de Belgique '' vol. 138, 1972, pp. 87-99 (with portrait picture)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz de Ruyt: [http://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_1971_num_40_1_3607 ''In memoriam Adolphe Rome (1889–1971)'']. In: '' L'Antiquité Classique '' Vol. 40, 1971, pp. 1–4 (with portrait picture)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Adolphe Rome studied at the Atheneum in [[Mechelen]], where his father Eugène Rome was a teacher of ancient languages. After graduating from the Atheneum, he entered the Catholic seminary in Mechelen and in 1912 was ordained a priest. He then studied classical philology at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] and received there, after an interruption of his studies by WWI, his doctorate in 1919. He then worked as a teacher in [[Schaerbeek]] and [[Nivelles]] and in 1922 received a scholarship at the ''Institut historique belge de Rome'' in Rome. From 1924 to 1927 in Paris he studied ancient and medieval calligraphy. From 1927 he taught Greek philology at the University of Louvain, where he was appointed professor in 1929 and taught until 1958. In 1935 he became [[canon (priest)|honorary canon]] of the cathedral of Mechelen.&lt;ref name=AARBobit/&gt;

During his doctoral studies, Adolphe Rome, who was very interested in mathematics since his school days, settled upon his life-long field of research, the ancient history of science. He received his doctorate with the thesis ''Les fonctions trigonométriques dans Héron d'Alexandrie''. Starting in  the 1920s he began writing a critical edition (published from 1931 to 1943) of the commentaries on the [[Almagest]] of [[Ptolemy]] and the works of [[Theon of Alexandria ]], later continued by his student and successor Joseph Mogenet (1913–1980) and his student Anne Tihon (born 1944). Another of Rome's close associates was Albert Lejeune (1916–1988). In addition to his research on the ancient history of science, Rome published essays on many topics of classical philology, such as the works of [[Pindar]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Theocritus]].&lt;ref name=AARBobit/&gt;

In 1932 he was one of the co-founders of the magazine ''L'Antiquité classique''. In the 1950s, he became editor-in-chief of the science-historical journal '' [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] ''.&lt;ref name=AARBobit/&gt;

Adolphe Rome was elected a corresponding member in 1948 and in 1950 a regular member of the [[Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]].&lt;ref name=AARBobit/&gt; In 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) on ''The calculation of an eclipse of the sun according to Theon of Alexandria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rome, Adolphe|chapter=The calculation of an eclipse of the sun according to Theon of Alexandria|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., August 30–September 1950|volume=vol. 1|pages=209–219|year=1950|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1950.1/Main/icm1950.1.0209.0219.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad Shah Qajar''' ({{lang-fa|احمد شاه قاجار}}; 21 January 1898 – 21 February 1930) was [[Shah]] (King) of [[Persia]] from 16 July 1909 to 15 December 1925, and the last ruling member of the [[Qajar dynasty]].

== Reign ==
On 16 July 1909, [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] was [[Triumph of Tehran|overthrown by rebels seeking to restore the 1906 Constitution]]. The rebels then convened the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Grand Majles]] of 500 delegates from different backgrounds, which placed Ahmad Shah, Mohammad Ali's six-year-old son, on the [[Sun Throne]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The Grand Majlis enacted many reforms. They abolished class representation; created five new seats in the Majles for minorities: two seats for [[Armenians]], and one seat each for [[Jews]], [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The Majles also democratized the electoral system, diminished the electoral dominance of Tehran, and even lowered the voting age from twenty-five to twenty.

Not much is known about Ahmad's early life before his succession to the throne. Due to his young age, his uncle, [[Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk]], governed as regent.

Ahmad Shah was formally crowned on 21 July 1914, upon reaching his majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/07/22/106725554.pdf "16-year-old Shah of Persia Sworn In"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 July 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to fix the damage done by his father by appointing the best ministers he could find. He was, however, an ineffective ruler who was faced with internal unrest and foreign intrusions, particularly by the [[British Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]. Russian and British troops fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] forces in Persia during [[World War I]].

The Second Majlis convened on November 1910 and just like the First Majlis, did not lead to any relevant accomplishment. The Majlis was rendered ineffective because the central government was weak and did not have enough influence to reign in the changes that it had proposed.

In 1917, Britain used Persia as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|unsuccessful attempt]] to reverse the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917. The newly born [[Soviet Union]] responded by annexing portions of northern Persia as buffer states much like its Tsarist predecessor. Marching on [[Tehran]], the Soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the Persian government – whose ministers Ahmad Shah was often unable to control. The weakness of the government in the face of such aggression by an atheist foreign power sparked seething anger among many traditional Persians – including the young [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], who would later condemn both [[Communism]] and monarchy as treason against Persia's sovereignty and the laws of Islam.
[[File:AhmadShahQajar.jpg|250px|thumb|A picture of Ahmad Shah Qajar]]
By 1920, the government had virtually lost all power outside the capital and Ahmad Shah had lost control of the situation. The [[Anglo-Persian Agreement]], along with new political parties, further immobilized the country. The Moderates and Democrats often clashed, particularly when it came to minority rights and [[secularism]]. The debates between the two political parties led to violence and even assassinations.

The weak economic state of Persia put Ahmad Shah and his government at the mercy of foreign influence; they had to obtain loans from the [[Imperial Bank of Persia]].{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} Furthermore, under the Anglo-Persian Agreement, Persia received only a small fraction of the income generated by the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]].  On the other hand, the Red Army along with rebels and warlords ruled much of the countryside.

On 21 February 1921, Ahmad Shah was pushed aside in a [[coup d'état|military coup]] by Colonel [[Reza Shah|Reza Khan]], Minister of War and commander of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], who subsequently seized the post of Prime Minister. During the coup, Reza Khan used three thousand men and only eighteen machine guns, a very bloodless coup that moved forward quickly.  Reza Khan was a self-made man who climbed his way up through the military ranks and appeared to be the right man to take back control of Persia.  One of his first actions was to rescind the Anglo-Persian Agreement, and this was seen as a very successful diplomatic move since the treaty was very unpopular. In addition, he signed the [[Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship (1921)|Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship]]. This agreement canceled all previous treaties between the two countries and also gave Persia full and equal shipping rights in the [[Caspian Sea]].
[[File:Ahmad Shahs Pavilion.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ahmad Shahi Pavilion]] was built at the end of the Qajar era as Ahmad Shah's dwelling among [[Niavaran garden]].]]
Stripped of all his remaining powers, Ahmad Shah went into exile with his family in 1923. Ahmad Shah's apparent lack of interest in attending to the affairs of the state and poor health had prompted him to leave Persia on this extended "European Tour".  He was formally deposed on 31 October 1925, when Reza Khan was proclaimed Shah by the Majlis, as Reza Shah Pahlavi. This terminated the [[Qajar Dynasty]] and established the [[Pahlavi Dynasty]].

== Exile ==

The coup of 1921 rendered Ahmad Shah politically weaker and less relevant.  In 1923, Ahmad Shah left Persia for Europe for health reasons.  Later, the formal termination of the [[Qajar Dynasty]] by the Majles, turned Ahmad Shah's 1923 European tour into exile.

Prior to his death, it is said that Ahmad Shah followed frequent crash diets which did not help his health. For example, he lost and gained 90&amp;nbsp;kg within a two-year span.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} He died in 1930 at Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris, France, and was buried in his family crypt in Kerbela, Iraq.&lt;ref name=qajar2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qajarpages.org/soltanahmad.html |title=Portraits and Pictures of Soltan Ahmad Shah Qajar (Kadjar) |publisher=qajarpages.org |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, former crown prince [[Mohammad Hassan Mirza]], assured the continuation of the dynasty through his descendants.

==Personal life==

Ahmad Shah Qajar married five times. His first wife was Lida Jahanbani. He had four children, each by a different wife.

* Princess Maryamdokht (1915 – 10 November 2005), daughter of Delaram Khanum 
* Princess [[Irandokht]] (1916 – 1984), daughter of Princess [[Badr al-Molouk]] Vala
* Princess Homayoundokht (1917 – 2011), daughter of Princess Khanum Khanumha Moezzi
* Prince [[Fereydoun Mirza Qajar|Fereydoun Mirza]] (1922 – 24 September 1975), son of Fatemeh Khanum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qajarpages.org/ahmadshahchildren.html |title=Children of Soltan Ahmad Shah Qajar (Kadjar) |publisher=Qajarpages.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had 12 grandchildren, who respectively carry the last names Albertini, Faroughy, Panahi and Qajar (also spelled Kadjar).

An '''anthropophage''' &lt;ref name="Zika2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Zika|title=Exorcising Our Demons: Magic, Witchcraft, and Visual Culture in Early Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_yqOu94dAwC&amp;pg=PA463|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12560-4|pages=463–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''anthropophagus''''' (from {{lang-el|ανθρωποφάγος |translit=anthrōpophagos}}, "people-eater", plural {{lang-el|ανθρωποφάγοι |translit=anthropophagi}}) was a member of a mythical race of cannibals described first by [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' as '''''[[androphagi]]''''' ("man-eaters"), and later by other authors, including the playwright [[William Shakespeare]]. The word first appears in [[English language|English]] around 1552.

''‘Late Greek “anthrōpopatheia” - humanity, possession of human feelings, from Greek anthrōpopathēs having human feelings (from anthrōp- anthrop- + -pathēs -path) + -ia’''

“Basically it is cannibalism, but its purpose is not feeding from other human flesh to satisfy hunger, but to transfer powers (of warriors, witch doctors, people with ‘spiritual powers’...) through eating of body parts, like heart, brain, liver etc.” (L. Jersin, November 2018)

In popular culture, the ''anthropophagus'' is sometimes depicted as a being without a head, but instead have their faces on the [[torso]].  This may be a misinterpretation based on Shakespeare's writings in ''[[Othello]]'', where the ''anthropophagi'' are mistaken to be described by the immediate following line, "''and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.''"  In reality, the line actually refers to a separate, different race of mythical beings known as the [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyes]], who are indeed said to have no head, and have their facial features on the chest.

== Accounts ==

People spell this creature's name in several different ways, 'anthropophagi' or 'anthropophage' being two examples.
Herodotus first wrote of ''andropophagi'' in his ''Histories'', where he described them as one of several tribes near [[Scythia]].  An extra note indicates that the ''andropophagi'' are cannibals, as reflected in their name:

{{quote|text=The manners of the Anthropophagi are more savage than those of any other race. They neither observe justice, nor are governed, by any laws. They are nomads, and their dress is Scythian; but the language which they speak is peculiar to themselves. Unlike any other nation in these parts, they are cannibals.|''Histories'', Book 4 (''Melpomene'')|&lt;sub&gt;trans. [[George Rawlinson]], 1858-1860&lt;/sub&gt;}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] later wrote in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' that the same cannibals near Scythia wore the [[scalp]]s of men on their chest.

{{quote|text=The Anthropophagi, whom we have previously mentioned as dwelling ten days' journey beyond the Borysthenes, according to the account of Isigonus of Nicæa, were in the habit of drinking out of human skulls, and placing the scalps, with the hair attached, upon their breasts, like so many napkins.|''Naturalis Historia'' Book 7, Chapter 2|&lt;sub&gt;trans. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]], 1855&lt;/sub&gt;}}

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote in his ''Res Gestae'' a description of the Anthropophagi.
{{quote|text=Next to these are the Melanchlamae and the Anthropophagi, who roam about upon different tracts of land and live on human flesh. And these men are so avoided on account of their horrid food, that all the tribes which were their neighbours have removed to a distance from them. And in this way the whole of that region to the north-east, till you come to the Chinese, is uninhabited.| Res Gestae| Book 31|London: Bohn (1862)}}

== In literature ==

It is likely that the ancient Greek account influenced later writers.  The most famous usage appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'':

{{quote|text=And of the Cannibals that each other eat, &lt;br&gt;The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads &lt;br&gt; Do grow beneath their shoulders.|''Othello'', Act 1. Scene III}}

Shakespeare makes yet another reference to the cannibalist ''anthropophagus'' in the ''[[Merry Wives of Windsor]]'':

{{quote|text=Go knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian &lt;br&gt;unto thee: knock, I say.|''Merry Wives of Windsor'', Act 4. Scene V}}

American novelist Rick Yancey incorporates the myths of the Anthropophagi in his 2010 release ''[[The Monstrumologist]]''.

'''Avishay Braverman''' ({{lang-he-n|אבישי ברוורמן}}, born 15 January 1948) is an [[Israel]]i economist and politician. A former president of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], he served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] between 2006 and 2015, and as [[Minorities Minister of Israel|Minister of Minority Affairs]] between 2009 and 2011.

==Biography==
Braverman studied statistics and economics at [[Tel Aviv University]] and received his PhD in economics from [[Stanford University]] in the [[United States]]. After serving for fourteen years as a senior official in the [[World Bank]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], specializing in economic development with an emphasis on [[social justice]], Braverman returned to Israel to become president of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev for the next sixteen years. He was well regarded in this position and received an award from the city of [[Be'er Sheva]] for his work.

In November 2005, Braverman announced his intention to become involved in politics. Despite rumors that he would join [[Kadima]], in a move viewed as surprising, he ended up joining [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Braverman-joins-Labor-not-Kadima Braverman joins Labor, not Kadima] The Jerusalem Post, 24 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]]. Within the party, he was initially associated with [[Amir Peretz]] and later with [[Ami Ayalon]].

Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]] he won fourth place in the [[Primary election|party's primaries]], retaining his seat in the subsequent election. Braverman opposed the decision of the Labor Party to enter the [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] government in March 2009, but shortly afterwards it was announced that he would be entering the government as Minister without Portfolio, focusing on Minority Affairs, later transformed into the [[Minorities Minister of Israel|Minister of Minority Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1075341.html Netanyahu sworn in as Israel's prime minister] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102083155/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1075341.html |date=January 2, 2010 }} Haaretz, 1 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the cabinet after [[Ehud Barak]] left the Labor Party to establish [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]] in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4014839,00.html Labor ministers quit gov't after split]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917133600/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-4014839%2C00.html |date=September 17, 2016 }} Ynetnews, 17 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected to the Knesset in [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013]].

In December 2014 Braverman announced that he would not run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]], stating that he felt he had done all he could as a Knesset member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-Elections/Labor-MK-Avishay-Braverman-announces-he-wont-run-in-March-elections-384697 Labor MK Avishay Braverman announces he won't run in March elections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062648/http://www.jpost.com/Israel-Elections/Labor-MK-Avishay-Braverman-announces-he-wont-run-in-March-elections-384697 |date=March 4, 2016 }} The Jerusalem Post, 15 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's involvement with the wine industry began in 1961,&lt;ref name=wpros/&gt; when he was hired by Sunset Books as an assistant editor, writing on the subject of wine as well as food and gardening, and met his future wife Harolyn with whom he collaborated.&lt;ref name=W&amp;Vbt/&gt; From 1965 to 1969, Thompson worked with the Media Services of the Wine Institute.

[[File:MattCooke.jpg|thumb|Sopel (right) and [[Matt Cooke]] during warm-ups with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in [[2006–07 NHL season|2007]].]]

Sopel was traded back to the Canucks during their [[2006–07 Vancouver Canucks season|2006–07 season]] on February 1, 2007, the [[NHL trade deadline]] day. He missed the first game of the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs]] against the [[Dallas Stars]] after he injured his back while picking up a cracker that was dropped by his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ziemer |first=Brad |title=Sopel's heard enough cracker jokes |publisher=The Vancouver Sun |date=2007-04-13 |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=a3ef0d89-d6db-494c-a8aa-434d8b0e1453 |accessdate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824132900/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=a3ef0d89-d6db-494c-a8aa-434d8b0e1453 |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canucks beat the Stars in quadruple overtime, in the sixth longest game in NHL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heika |first=Mike |title=Stars lose to Canucks in fourth OT |publisher=The Dallas Morning News|date=2007-04-12 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/041207dnspostarslede.13808604.html|accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Islanders===
On August 3, 2005, the Canucks traded Sopel to the [[New York Islanders]] in exchange for a conditional draft pick in the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pap |first=Elliott |title=Brent Sopel moves on to New York Islanders |publisher=The Vancouver Sun|date=2005-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, just under a week after being traded, Sopel signed a two-year, $4.8 million contract with the Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sopel signs on |publisher=The Province|date=2005-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Blackhawks===
Heading into the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]] with no contract, Sopel was invited to the [[Detroit Red Wings]]' training camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Paul |title=A Leaf training camp hopeful |publisher=Toronto Star |date=2007-09-16 |url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/257124 |accessdate=2007-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035524/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/257124 |archive-date=2011-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on September 28, 2007, Sopel left Detroit's camp, instead signing a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] after the Red Wings had only offered a one-year, $500,000 contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sopel leaves Wings, signs with Chicago|publisher=TSN|date=2007-09-28|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=219440&amp;hubname=nhl|accessdate=2007-09-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070613200214/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=219440&amp;hubname=nhl|archivedate=2007-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sassone |first=Tim |title=Sopel's poise big part of Hawks' early success|publisher=Daily Herald|date=2007-10-17 |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=58713 |accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2008, Sopel signed a three-year, $7 million contract extension with the Blackhawks, keeping him in Chicago through to the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sopel inks three-year deal with Hawks|publisher=TSN|date=2008-01-10|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=226950&amp;hubname=nhl|accessdate=2008-01-10}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 2010, Brent Sopel won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks.

==Personal life==
After his daughter was  diagnosed with [[dyslexia]], Sopel was also diagnosed with the learning disability after the symptoms sounded similar to his struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaplan |first1=Emily |title=Letting his guard down about dyslexia struggles helped blueliner Brent Sopel find purpose |url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/21589115/nhl-former-blackhawks-defenseman-brent-sopel-helping-others-struggle-dyslexia |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=June 8, 2018 |date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired him to 
create the Brent Sopel Foundation to help promote and raise funds for youth with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaminski |first1=Kaitlyn |title=Sopel conducting clinic to help kids with dyslexia |url=https://www.nhl.com/news/former-nhl-defenseman-brent-sopel-conducting-clinic-to-help-dyslexic-children/c-290577280 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=June 8, 2018 |date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campbell Bascom Slemp''' (September 4, 1870 &amp;ndash; August 7, 1943) was an [[American Republican]] politician. He was a six-time [[United States]] [[United States Congress|congressman]] from [[Virginia's 9th congressional district]] from 1907 to 1923 and served as the [[Secretary to the President (US)|presidential secretary]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]]. As a [[philanthropist]], Slemp set up the "Slemp Foundation", which provides gifts and scholarships to schools and colleges in Southwestern [[Virginia]].

==Early and family life==
Slemp was born on September 4, 1870 at [[Seminary, Virginia|Turkey Cove]], [[Virginia]] in [[Lee County, Virginia|Lee County]] to [[Colonel]] [[Campbell Slemp]], who later became a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from the [[Virginia's 9th congressional district|9th district of Virginia]](1903 to 1907). His mother was Nancy (Nannie) Britain Cawood of [[Harlan County, Kentucky]].  His father was an officer in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The 64th Virginia Regimental History indicates her brother had enlisted in the Union army but became sick and went AWOL, dying at home early in the war while MPs attempted to return him to his unit, Jefrrey G. Weaver, 64th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg, H.E. Howard, Inc. The Virginia Regimental Histories Series; 1992) &lt;/ref&gt; Bascom Slemp had one brother who survived infancy, William Moses Slemp (1873-1912) and three sisters: Emma M. Slemp (1865-1889), Susan Jane Slemp Newman (1869-1935), and Laura Alpha Drucilla Slemp  Habourn (1877-1900).

Slemp attended the Methodist-run "Seminary" in Turkey Cove, and had a private tutor (William Davidson of King College), and also at age 9 became a page in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] after his father's election to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swvamusueum.org/cbslemp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, the 16 year old Slemp entered the Corp of Cadets at [[Virginia Military Institute]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]]. In 1891, he graduated with the highest grade point average in the school's history — a record that stands today. He also received the Jackson Medal for Most Distinguished Student four years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.slempfoundation.org/html/cbascomslemp.html|title=The Slemp Foundation.|publisher=[[The Slemp Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bascom Slemp then studied law for a year at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1901.

He briefly married Roberta Trousdale Barton (1891-1911) in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 26, 1911, but their daughter was stillborn the following year.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina death certificate dated October 15, 1912 at Mission Hospital, Asheville, North Carolina. Roberta Trousdale Barton may have married Goodyear tire salesman William Warren Council in 1916 with Slemp as a wintess, for she was listed on his WWI draft registration card and subsequent census forms indicate they moved to Mississippi by 1929, but the marriage record is not available for online inspection, and ancestry.com records include no divorce record. She bore daughters  Roberta Sue and Grace Council in 1919 and 1924, respectively&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bascom Slemp was listed among the lawyer boarders at a Bethesda, Maryland boardinghouse in the 1920 U.S. Federal Census.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Slemp served as Commandant of Cadets at the [[Marion Military Institute]] for one year, after which he was hired as the second Principal of the Stonega Academy in [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia|Big Stone Gap]] (1893-1895).&lt;ref&gt;Sharon B. Ewing, Big Stone Gap, p. 67, available athttps://books.google.com/books?id=uGS1UNoQ7rIC&amp;pg&lt;/ref&gt; Slemp then taught at VMI as Professor of Mathematics for several years. In 1901, after being admitted to the Virginia bar, he resigned his position at the Institute to set up a law practice in Big Stone Gap. Slemp became president of the Slemp Coal Company and of the Hamilton Realty Company, among other business interests.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia, available online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:CoolidgeSlemp.jpg|thumb|Slemp being sworn in as presidential secretary, 1923]]
His father Campbell Slemp served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1903 to 1907, controlling patronage in the state as well as representing [[Virginia's 9th congressional district]] until his unexpected death in October, 1907. In 1905, Bascom Slemp became chairman of Virginia's [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] State Committee, where he served until 1918, at which point he was elected to the [[Republican National Committee]].

Bascom Slemp won the special election to fill his father's vacancy, and also won reelection six times, serving from 1907 until March 3, 1923, after he declined to be a candidate for re-election. As the leading Republican in the Old Dominion, he faced a difficult battle for re-election in 1910, after Democrats persuaded [[Henry C. Stuart]] to run against him, and used the slogan "Redeem the District." [[Theodore Roosevelt]] gave a speech for Slemp, who won by a margin of about 200 votes. Although Stuart initially refused to concede defeat, his contest failed, in part because all 265 precincts had a Democratic registrar, two Democratic clerks and at least two Democratic judges.&lt;ref&gt;Guy B. Hathorn, Congressional Campaign in the Fighting Ninth: The Contest between C. Bascom Slemp and Henry C. Stuart, 66 Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 66 (1958) pp.337-344&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;According to Brent Tarter, The Grandees of Government: the origins and persistence of undemocratic politics in Virginia (University of Virginia Press 2013), Democrat Ebbie Combs of Russell County arranged to have state auditors from Richmond audit the poll tax lists of eligible voters shortly after the deadline, precluding late payment of poll taxes in the district's 15 counties, all then controlled by Republican clerks.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 1923, six months after Slemp completed his last term as Congressman, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] appointed him to serve as his Secretary,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,716345,00.html?iid=digg_share|title=An Appointment|date=1923-08-20|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,716430,00.html|title=C. Bascom Slemp.|date=1923-08-27|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post similar to the later [[White House Chief of Staff]]. Slemp served until March 4, 1925. He resigned early in Coolidge's second term after friction between himself and the President was unable to be resolved and was succeeded by [[Everett Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928646,00.html|title=A Sanders for a Slemp.|date=1925-01-26|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to rural life==
After leaving the Coolidge administration, Slemp returned to his law practice in [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia]] and Washington D.C. In 1930, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Slemp as United States Commissioner General to the [[Paris Colonial Exposition|International Colonial and Overseas Exposition]] in Paris, and at its conclusion in 1931, France awarded Slemp the [[Légion d'honneur|French Legion of Honor Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744520,00.html|title=Honors 1932.|date=1932-10-03|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,752705,00.html|title=Inspiratio0|date=1932-12-15|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930 Census, Slemp lived in Big Stone Gap with his sister S. Janie and her husband John W. Newman and several servants.&lt;ref&gt;1930 U.S. Federal Census for Big Stone Gap district 19, Wise County Virginia family 45, house number 820; 1940 census missing or mis-indexed&lt;/ref&gt; With Janie's help, Slemp established the [[Southwest Virginia Museum]], and after his death the Commonwealth accepted many pieces bequeathed to it.

==Death and legacy==
Slemp often maintained a local residence with siblings, remained a prominent member of the southwest [[Virginia]] community and political scene until his death. He died at St. Mary's hospital in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on August 7, 1943, aged 73, of long-standing heart disease, He was later buried in the family cemetery at Turkey Cove.&lt;ref&gt;findagrave no. 13440185&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philanthropist, Slemp continues to touch many young lives through the Slemp Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.slempfoundation.org|title=The Slemp Foundation.|publisher=[[The Slemp Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in his will and which provides gifts to libraries, schools and colleges in Southwestern Virginia. The "Lonesome Pine Regional Library" (which serves Lee, Dickenson, and Wise Counties, Virginia) has received support from the foundation, and its branch in Big Stone Gap is named in Slemp's honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://lonesomepine.boundless.ly/branches/all/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slemp Scholarship, named in honor of the late congressman, is awarded to outstanding college students who graduated from schools in Lee, [[Scott County, Virginia|Scott]], and Wise Counties, Virginia.

In October 2003, the long-planned ''C. Bascom Slemp Student Center&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.wise.virginia.edu/studentcenter/index.html|title=C. Bascom Slemp Student Center.|publisher=[[The University of Virginia]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' was opened on the campus of the [[University of Virginia's College at Wise]]. This $10.9 million, {{convert|46234|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure was funded by student fees as well as $2.5 million from the Slemp Foundation.

Slemp was a cousin three times removed of the American [[film]] star [[George C. Scott]].

The [[United States Post Office and Courthouse (Big Stone Gap, Virginia)|United States Post Office and Courthouse]] at [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia]] is named the C. Bascom Slemp Federal Building. A historical marker in [[Seminary, Virginia]] about 6 miles southwest of Big Stone Gap on Alt. Route 58, also honors three Congressmen born within a mile of the marker: Slemp (61st-67th Congresses), his father Campbell Slemp (58th through 60th Congresses) and Congressman James B. Richmond (46th Congress).&lt;ref&gt;A Guidebook to Virginia's Historical Markers (University of Virginia Press 1994), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Carole C. Noon was born on July 13, 1949 to the union William and Dorothy Cooney in [[Portland, Oregon]]. She has two sisters named Lee Asbeck and Kay Shelton. During her early years, her father, William Cooney, moved the entire family to an island in the South Pacific, for a business venture, where she spent a significant amount of her childhood. Years later, her parents divorced which resulted in her mother, Dorothy, moving Carole and her sisters to [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]] and later [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]]. She went on to marry Michael Noon, who she later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/science/07noon.html|title=Carole C. Noon, Who Founded Save the Chimps, Dies at 59|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=2009-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Noon attained a bachelor's degree from [[Florida Atlantic University]]. She then earned a master's in anthropology and a doctorate in biological anthropology, under Dr. Linda Wolfe from the [[University of Florida]], specializing in captive chimpanzees. She conducted much of her field research at the [[Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage]] in Zambia, where chimpanzees were orphaned by the bushmeat trade in Africa. There, she completed her dissertation on the re-socialization of chimpanzees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/resocializationo00noon|title=The resocialization of chimpanzees, "Pan troglodytes"|last=Noon|first=Carole|date=1996|others=George A. Smathers Libraries University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned her PhD in 1996.

==Career==
Following the US Air Force’s decision to bid away all its chimpanzees in 1997, with the help of [[Jane Goodall]], Noon co-created [[Save the Chimps|Save The Chimps]] Foundation, which is known today has the world’s largest sanctuary for chimpanzees.  Noon’s bid for the chimpanzees was rejected, and they were later sent to the [[Coulston Foundation]], who was known for violating the [[Animal Welfare Act 1999|Animal Welfare Act]]. Noon went on to sue the US Air Force and settled out of court for the custody of 21 out of the 140 chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.savethechimps.org/the-chimps-history/|title=The Chimps' History - Save the Chimps|work=Save the Chimps|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/magazine/planet-of-the-retired-apes.html|title=Planet of the Retired Apes|last=Siebert|first=Charles|date=2005-07-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/chimp-island-180959225/|title=Chimp Island|last=Scott|first=Phil|date=June 2016|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, she opened a sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida with the assistance of the [[Arcus Foundation|Acrus Foundation]]. In 2002, The Coulston Foundation went bankrupt, and with the help of a grant on the Acrus Foundation, Dr. Noon and Save the chimps bought their lab in Alamogordo, New Mexico and rescued 266 chimpanzees and 61 monkeys. Save The Chimps became the largest chimpanzee sanctuary overnight, housing and caring today for 282 chimpanzees. She worked tirelessly to improve their conditions, train staff to care for the chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.savethechimps.org/about-us/our-history/dr-carole-noon/|title=Dr. Carole Noon - Save the Chimps|work=Save the Chimps|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

{{nihongo|'''Eiji Tsuburaya'''|円谷 英二|Tsuburaya Eiji}} ({{nihongo|'''Eiichi Tsumuraya'''|圓谷 英一|Tsumuraya Eiichi}}; July 10, 1901 – January 25, 1970, in [[Sukagawa, Fukushima]]) was a Japanese [[special effects]] director responsible for many Japanese science-fiction films and television series, being one of the co-creators of the ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'' series, as well as the main creator of the ''[[Ultra Series|Ultraman]]'' series. 

During his rise to post-war fame in the wake of ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954), many press accounts gave Tsuburaya's birthdate as July 7, which falls on the high day of the star festival, ''[[Tanabata]]'', a sign of good fortune. This is akin to an American saying that they were born on the [[Fourth of July]]. Tsuburaya's actual birthdate of July 10 has been verified by his last surviving son, Akira, and the company Eiji founded, [[Tsuburaya Productions]], as the official entry in the Tsuburaya Family Register, in researching the official English-language biography on this important figure of cinema, ''Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters'', [[Chronicle Books]], 2007.&lt;ref name="August"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters: Defending the Earth with Ultraman and Godzilla |last=Ragone |first=August |authorlink=August Ragone |year=2007 |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |location=[[San Francisco, California]] |isbn=978-0-8118-6078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Tsuburaya described his childhood as filled with "mixed emotions." He was the first son of Isamu and Sei Tsumuraya, with a large extended family. His mother died when he was only three and his father moved to China for the family business. Young Eiji was raised by his barely older uncle, Ichiro, and his paternal grandmother, Natsu. He attended elementary school at the ''Sukagawa Choritsu Dai'ichi Jinjo Koutou Shogakko'' beginning in 1908, and two years later, he took up the hobby of building model airplanes, due to the sensational success of Japanese aviators, an interest he would retain for the rest of his life. In 1915, at the age of 14, he graduated the equivalent of [[High School]], and begged his family to let him enroll in the Nippon [[Flying school]] at [[Haneda]]. After the school was closed on account of the accidental death of its founder, Seitaro Tamai, in 1917, Tsuburaya attended trade school. He became quite successful in the research and development department of the [[Utsumi]] toy company, but a chance meeting at a company party in 1919, set the course for his destiny—he was offered a job by director Yoshiro Edamasa, a job that would train him to be a [[motion picture]] [[cameraman]]. While the Tsuburaya family's traditional religion was [[Nichiren Buddhism]], Tsuburaya converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in his later years (his wife had already been a practicing [[Roman Catholic]]).&lt;ref name="August" /&gt;

== Early career and war propaganda ==
In 1919, his first job in the film industry was as an assistant cinematographer at the ''Nihon Katsudou Shashin Kabushiki-kaisha'' (Nihon Cinematograph Company or ''Kokkatsu'' for short) in [[Kyoto]], which later became better known as [[Nikkatsu]]. After serving as a member of the correspondence staff to the military from 1921 to 1923, he joined Ogasaware Productions. He was head cameraman on ''Hunchback of Enmeiin'' (Enmeiin no Semushiotoko), and served as assistant cameraman on [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]]'s ground-breaking 1925 film, ''[[A Page of Madness|Kurutta Ippeiji]]'' (''A Page of Madness'').

He joined [[Shochiku Kyoto Studios]] in 1926 and became full-time cameraman there in 1927. He began using and creating innovative filming techniques during this period, including the first use of a camera crane in Japanese film. In the 1930 film ''Chohichiro Matsudaira'', he created a film illusion by super-imposition. Thus began the work for which he would become known—special visual effects.

1930 was also the year of his marriage to Masano Araki. Hajime, the first of their three sons, was born a year later. During the 1930s, he moved among a number of studios and became known for his meticulous work. It was during this period that he saw a film that would point towards his future career. After his international success with [[Godzilla (1954 film)|''Godzilla'']] in 1954, he said, "When I worked for [[Nikkatsu]] Studios, ''[[King Kong]]'' came to [[Kyoto]] and I never forgot that movie. I thought to myself, 'I will someday make a monster movie like that'".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Al. "The Man Who Made Godzilla Famous." ''Fantastic Films and Other Imaginative Media'' January 1980, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he became head of Special Visual Techniques at [[Toho Tokyo Studios]], setting up an independent special effects department in 1939. He expanded his technique greatly during this period and earned several awards, but did not stay long at Toho.

During the war years (the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]]) he directed a number of propaganda films and produced their special effects for Toho's Educational Film Research Division created by decree of the imperial government.&lt;ref name="August" /&gt; Those include ''[[Kōdō Nippon]]'' (''The Imperial Way of Japan'') (1938), ''[[Kaigun Bakugeki-tai]]'' (''Naval Bomber Squadron'') (1940), ''The Burning Sky'' (''[[Moyuru ōzora]]'') (1940), ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' (''The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya'') (1942), ''Decisive Battle in the Skies'' (''[[Kessen-no Ōzara-e]]'') (1943) and ''[[Kato hayabusa sento-tai]]'' (1944).&lt;ref name="August" /&gt; According to legend, Tsuburaya's work on ''The War at Sea...'' was so impressive that [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]]'s film unit is said to have sold footage of the film to [[Frank Capra]] for use in [[Movietone News|Movietone]] [[newsreel]]s as footage of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ragone, August. ''Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters: Defending the Earth with Ultraman and Godzilla.'' San Francisco, California: Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-0-8118-6078-9}}. 2007. Pg.29&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[occupation of Japan]] following the war, Tsuburaya's wartime association with such propaganda films proved a hindrance to his finding work for some time. He went freelance with his own production company, ''Tsuburaya Visual Effects Research'' (working on films for other studios), until he returned to Toho in the early 1950s.

== Toho years ==
As head of Toho's Visual Effects Department (which was known as the "Special Arts Department" until 1961), that he established in 1939, he supervised an average of sixty craftsmen, technicians and cameramen. It was here that he became part of the team, along with director [[Ishirō Honda]] and producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], that created the first ''[[Godzilla]]'' film in 1954, and were dubbed by Toho's advertising department as "The Golden Trio".

For his work in [[Godzilla (1954 film)|''Godzilla'']] (ゴジラ - Gojira), Tsuburaya won his first "Film Technique Award". In contrast to the [[stop motion]] technique most famously used by [[Willis O'Brien]] to create the 1933 ''[[King Kong]]'', Tsuburaya used a man in a rubber suit to create his giant monster effects. This technique, now most closely associated with Japanese ''[[kaiju]]'' or monster movies, has come to be called [[suitmation]] (originated in the Japanese fan press during the 1980s). Through intense lighting and high-speed filming, Tsuburaya was able to add to the realism of the effects by giving them a slightly slower, ponderous weightiness. This technique, using detailed miniatures with men-in-monster-suits, is still being used today (but combined with CGI techniques as well) and is now considered a traditional Japanese craft art.

The tremendous success of ''Godzilla'' led Toho to produce a series of science fiction films, films introducing new monsters, and further films involving the Godzilla character itself. The most critically and popularly successful of these films were those involving the team of Tsuburaya, Honda and Tanaka, along with the fourth member of the ''Godzilla'' team, composer [[Akira Ifukube]]. Tsuburaya continued producing the special effects for non-kaiju films like ''[[The H-Man]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Last War (1961 film)|The Last War]]'' (1961), and won another Japanese Movie Technique Award for his work in the 1957 science-fiction film ''[[The Mysterians]]''. He also won another award in 1959 for the creation of the "Toho Versatile System", an optical printer for widescreen pictures, which he built in-house and first used on ''[[The Three Treasures]]'' in 1959 (Tsuburaya was continually frustrated by the poor state of equipment he was forced to use, and Toho's money-pinching that prevented the acquisition of new motion picture technologies).

A loyal company man, Tsuburaya continued to work at Toho Studios until his death in 1970 of a [[heart attack]].

== Tsuburaya Productions ==
In the 1940s, Tsuburaya started his own special effects laboratory (set up at his home), and in 1963, founded his own studio for visual effects, [[Tsuburaya Productions]]. In 1966 alone, this company aired the first ''Ultra'' series for television, ''[[Ultra Q]]'' beginning in January, followed it with the highly popular ''[[Ultraman]]'' in July, and premiered a comedy-monster series, ''[[Kaiju Booska|Booska, the Friendly Beast]]'' in November. ''Ultraman'' became the first live-action Japanese television series to be exported around the world, and spawned the [[Ultra Series|''Ultra'' series]] which continues to this day.

== Recognition ==
In honor of the 114th anniversary of his birth, [[Google]] made an animated [[Google Doodle|doodle]] of his skill with special effects on July 7, 2015 (the legendary, but not factual, date of his birth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eiji-tsuburayas-114th-birthday-monster-movie-pioneer-honoured-in-interactive-google-doodle-10370174.html |title=Eiji Tsuburaya's 114th birthday: Monster movie pioneer honoured in interactive Google Doodle |work=[[The Independent]] |date=July 6, 2015 |author=Bolton, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elaha Soroor''' (also spelled as '''Elaha Sorur''') ({{lang-fa|الهه سرور}}) (born in 1988) is an Afghan pop singer. She was in musical reality show ''[[Afghan Star (TV series)|Afghan Star]]'', a television program similar to the [[Idol (TV series)|''Idol'' franchise]].  She is a member of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group of [[Afghanistan]].

== Personal life ==
Soroor was born in Iran into a religious family of refugees who left Afghanistan during the civil war, and lived there for 14 years. She and her family moved back to Afghanistan in 2005. During her high school years, Soroor worked as a news reporter for a local radio station in Kondoz, a city in the north of Afghanistan, and also for the Bakhtar news agency. At the same time, she taught literacy and maths to young girls and women from her neighborhood who were not allowed to attend school under Taliban law.

As a young woman in Kondoz (at the time, the Taliban still had influence on people of the area), Soroor was not afraid to openly challenge conservative views and fight for a more equal society.  She was labeled by locals as a political activist, meaning she and her family were forced to leave Kondoz after receiving death threats from fundamentalist groups.

== Music career ==
After moving to Kabul with her family in 2007 Soroor began to develop her passion for music. She studied at music school where she specialized in traditional Afghan folk music whilst also studying western harmony, and started performing with Afghani group, Aryan.  All this was done in secret without the consent or support of her family, who were against her performing as a professional musician. Upon finding out, they prevented her from singing for a year.

Soroor's voice was discovered by the judges of the TV talent show ''Afghan Star'' in 2009, where she gained popularity nationally among Afghan communities around the world, being the first female Hazara singer to perform on national TV.

Her first two original songs, "Abi Jan" and "Be Bahana" were released in 2009.  In 2010 she recorded "Sangsar", a song which openly criticises the "stoning law" practiced by some Muslim communities. This led to fundamentalist groups attempting to assassinate her and members of her family on several occasions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Image:Georges Biassou.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Georges Biassou&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Georges Biassou''' (1741, [[Haiti]] – 1801, [[Saint Augustine, Florida]]) was an early leader of the 1791 slave rising in [[Saint-Domingue]] that began the [[Haitian Revolution]].  With [[Jean-François Papillon|Jean François]] and [[Jeannot]], he was prophesied by the [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]]  priest, [[Dutty Boukman]], to lead the revolution.

Like some other slave leaders, he fought with the [[Spain|Spanish]] royalists against the [[French Revolution]]ary authorities in [[Saint-Domingue|colonial Haiti]]. Defeated by his former ally [[Toussaint Louverture]], who had allied with the French after they promised to free the slaves, Biassou remained in service to the Spanish Crown.  He withdrew from Santo Domingo in 1795 and moved with his family to [[Florida]], which was then part of the Spanish [[colony]] of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz02vbVtLkEC |title=Avengers of the New World : the story of the Haitian Revolution |last=Dubois |first=Laurent |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780674034365 |pages=115-151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, Biassou changed his first name to Jorge.  Spanish leaders put him in charge of the [[black militia in Florida]].  He began to build alliances there when his brother-in-law married a fugitive from South Carolina.  Florida had provided refuge for both planters and slaves during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Ira.

'''Gerald Albert Asher''' (born 18 August 1932) is an English wine personality, based since 1974 in [[San Francisco]], California. Initially a wine merchant and importer, today he is a wine writer.

Born in [[London]] and raised partly in rural [[Essex]] because of [[the Blitz]], Asher's career in wine began in 1950, when he took a part-time job at a wine retailer in London's [[Shepherd Market]]. He founded his own merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, in 1955, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. Active until 1970, the firm was widely seen as ground-breaking for its introduction to the British market of several previously obscure wines that proceeded to become popular. In 1971, Asher relocated to [[New York City|New York]] to take up a senior position at [[Austin, Nichols|Austin, Nichols and Co]], which imported [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855|Bordeaux-classed]] wines to the United States. The next year he also became wine editor at ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine, a post he would hold for the next three decades, writing the "Wine Journal" column, which eventually became monthly. In 1974, he received the [[Mérite agricole]] from the French government for his contributions to French agriculture.

He moved the same year to San Francisco, where he became head of the Monterey Wine Company. He writes that he had "a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine",&lt;ref name=asher1972newyork74/&gt; having never tasted any before a 1967 visit, but he soon began championing it, organising the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner along with Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of New York's [[The Four Seasons Restaurant|Four Seasons Restaurant]]. The barrel tasting, which started in 1976, played an important role in building the image and understanding of California wines on the East Coast of the United States, and over the next decade became seen by critics as the wine event of the year. Asher started the Mosswood Wine Company in 1978, within the [[McKesson Corporation]], and headed it until 1987, when McKesson sold off its interests in wine and spirits to concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Asher took early retirement to focus solely on his wine writing, which he continues today.

He retained the post of wine editor at ''Gourmet'' until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from ''Gourmet'' have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently ''A Carafé of Red'' in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic [[Jancis Robinson]] calling him "America's most elegant wine writer".&lt;ref name=robinson105/&gt; [[James Beard]], an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing "makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine."&lt;ref name=beard1982/&gt; Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the [[Culinary Institute of America]] in 2009.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gerald Asher was born in [[London]] in 1932. The family moved to rural [[Essex]] at the onset of [[the Blitz]], and Asher was partly raised there, attending [[Westcliff High School for Boys]] in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]].

===First steps into wine===
[[File:Shepherd Market 1.jpg|thumb|[[Shepherd Market]], where Asher's career in wine began in 1950]]
Asher entered the wine industry in 1950, at the age of 18, when he took a part-time job assisting a wine retailer in [[Shepherd Market]], between [[Curzon Street]] and [[Piccadilly]] in [[Mayfair]], Central London. Within a year he had taken a full-time position with a small wine distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal &amp; Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the [[Worshipful Company of Vintners]] in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]], the Spanish region that produces [[Sherry]]. Further such scholarships over the next two years despatched Asher to [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] in eastern France, then the [[Rheingau (wine region)|Rheingau]] wine region in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

===Asher, Storey and Co===
In 1955, aged 23, Asher founded his own London merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Cooper
|1970
|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new firm was regarded as ground-breaking,&lt;ref name=robinson105/&gt; and was for a long time unique in the British market. A 1983 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' retrospective described its formation as "a breeze of change through the wine trade here [in Britain] and the trade of writing about wine."&lt;ref name=punch76/&gt; Many of the wines the firm introduced to British consumers, including [[Beaumes de Venise AOC|Beaumes de Venises]], Arbois, Bandol, [[Château-Grillet AOC|Chateau Grillet]], [[Cahors wine|Cahors]] and others, were considered utterly unknown when the company began, but soon became well known and popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Johnson
|1983}} "Gerald Asher in London was the first, shipping the 'lesser' wines of France – names like Touraine and Roussillon, which today are considered almost classic. The old trade, weaned on Bordeaux and Burgundy, had never heard of them[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1969, ''[[The Observer]]'' was describing the company as "famous for its list of the lesser-known wines of France: wines from the Loire, and the Jura, from Provence and from Savoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Observer
|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
Asher wound up Asher, Storey in 1971, when he moved to [[New York City]] to become Vice-President and National Wine Sales Manager at [[Austin, Nichols|Austin, Nichols and Co]], perhaps better known as the distiller of [[Wild Turkey (bourbon)|Wild Turkey]] bourbon whiskey, but also an American importer of [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855|Bordeaux-classed]] wines from France. He joined the French wine committee of the U.S. National Association of Wine Importers, and became chairman of the Champagne Importers' Association. Around this time he also became interested in [[California wine]], which he had first encountered during his first visit to San Francisco in 1967.&lt;ref name=asher1972newyork74&gt;{{Harvnb
|Asher
|1972
|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he was invited by Jane Montant of ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine to start contributing essays on a periodical basis as the journal's Wine Editor,&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Bespaloff
|1985
|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; a role he would hold for the next three decades. Two years later, he was awarded the [[Mérite agricole]] by the government of France for his contributions to French agriculture.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

===California===
[[File:Four-seasons-ny.jpg|thumb|[[The Four Seasons Restaurant]] in [[New York City]] was the original venue for the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner, which Asher was instrumental in starting and organising, from 1976 to 1985.]]
Asher moved to San Francisco in 1974 to head the Monterey Wine Company, a joint venture between the [[McKesson Corporation]] and the McFarlane family to market The Monterey Vineyard's wines.&lt;ref name=punch76&gt;{{Harvnb
|Punch
|1983
|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Business Week
|1975
|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained this role until 1976.&lt;ref name=symposium&gt;{{Harvnb
|Symposium for Professional Wine Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that he had "a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine",&lt;ref name=asher1972newyork74/&gt; having never tasted any before his 1967 visit, but soon came to regard it as on a par with that from France. Surprised that wine from California was, in his own words, "more exotically rare in New York than many European" wines,&lt;ref name=asher1972newyork74/&gt; he hit upon the idea of holding an annual tasting of California wine in New York, using as models the [[La Paulée de Meursault|Paulée de Meursault]] tasting of Burgundy wine and its grander cousin, the Paulée de Paris held at Taillevent, with "the same elegant context ... but with an American flavour".&lt;ref name=bespaloff/&gt;

Asher approached several Californian growers with this idea, but most were hesitant to take part. The idea became more real when the winemakers Karl Wente and [[Robert Mondavi]] agreed to participate. Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of the prestigious [[The Four Seasons Restaurant|Four Seasons Restaurant]] in [[Manhattan]] agreed to organise the practicalities of such an event in return for Asher's coordination of the California wineries' contributions. The first annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner was held at The Four Seasons in 1976, and soon became hugely popular; though there were only 228 places available for the 1978 tasting, over 2,000 people tried to buy tickets.&lt;ref name=bespaloff&gt;{{Harvnb
|Bespaloff
|1978
|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher was vice-president of "21" Brands, a wine and spirits company within the McKesson Corporation, between 1976 and 1978. He then started the Mosswood Wine Company within the McKesson structure to import and distribute European wine across the United States.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt; Meanwhile, Asher's annual California barrel tasting event in New York became highly acclaimed in the wine world; by 1985, it was being described in newspaper columns as the American wine industry's "most prestigious social event".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Dias Blue
|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Everybody who is anybody in the world of food and wine is invited to the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner," Ruth Riechl wrote for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that year; "Ten years ago it was unclear whether anybody would even show up for the first dinner, held at the Four Seasons. This year the only problem was which one of the 10 people eager to fill each seat would[.]"&lt;ref name=reichl1985/&gt; "Invitations are as scarce as Manhattan taxis at rush hour," wrote ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist Kristine Curry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Curry

Following the 1985 event, described by two wine writers as "the best ever",&lt;ref name=reichl1985/&gt; the annual barrel tasting moved to California. Since it was still generally considered a runaway success in New York, this came as a surprise to many, and Margittai admitted he was sad to see it go: "This is our pride and joy," he said, "but the barrel tasting needs to go home".&lt;ref name=reichl1985&gt;{{Harvnb
|Reichl
|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was in part because of the event's popularity; so many people sought places each year that the restaurant was having to refuse tickets to some of its regular customers. The venue used in 1986, San Francisco's [[Stanford Court Hotel]], could accommodate twice as many guests.&lt;ref name=reichl1985/&gt; "[[Woody Allen]] may think that going West and dying are the same thing," Asher explained, "but we're going to prove him wrong."&lt;ref name=reichl1986&gt;{{Harvnb
|Reichl
|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first barrel tasting in San Francisco was also considered a success by most who attended, with the main difference being the atmosphere, which Barbara Ensrud, a wine writer who had attended every barrel tasting so far, said was "a lot more relaxed than it ever was in New York."&lt;ref name=reichl1986/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=Long ago, during my apprenticeship in the wine trade, I learned that wine is more than the sum of its parts, and more than an expression of its physical origin.

In 1987, McKesson sold off its wine and spirits operations so it could focus on pharmaceuticals. Aged 55, Asher took early retirement, and began to concentrate on his wine writing. His contributions to ''Gourmet'' magazine, which had evolved into a bi-monthly column called the "Wine Journal", now became monthly. Many of Asher's "Wine Journal" entries have been republished in book form as ''On Wine'' (1982), ''Vineyard Tales'' (1996), ''The Pleasures of Wine'' (2002), ''A Vineyard in My Glass'' (2011), and ''A Carafé of Red'' (2012). In 1996, he wrote the ''Wine Journal'', published as a cellar book by [[HarperCollins]]. A number of the ''Gourmet'' columns were translated and published in the Japanese version of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, and in 1997 some of these were published in translation as ''The Secret World of Wine'' by [[Shueisha]] of Tokyo. Asher stopped writing for ''Gourmet'' in February 2002, but he continued to contribute a selection of wines to the monthly menu published in each issue until the magazine discontinued in November 2009.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

In addition to the many accolades he has won for his writing and work in the international wine trade—including "Wine Writer of the Year" from ''Wine &amp; Vines'' magazine in 1984, a 1990 literature achievement award from the American Institute of Wine and Food, the San Francisco Wine Appreciation Guild's Literary Award for 2000, and the 2005 Journalism award from the New York-based European Wine Council—Asher was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame at the [[Culinary Institute of America]] in [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]], California in 2009.&lt;ref name=symposium/&gt;

Asher is generally considered a highly respected authority in the field of wine, and has received acclaim throughout his career for his expertise and writing style, which is widely held to be elegant and enjoyable. In her 1997 book ''Tasting Pleasure'', British wine critic [[Jancis Robinson]] calls Asher "America's most elegant wine writer".&lt;ref name=robinson105&gt;{{Harvnb
|Robinson
|1997
|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. Irene Virbila of the ''Los Angeles Times'' gave ''A Carafé of Red'' a very positive review, describing Asher as a "wonderful prose stylist ... His wide-ranging, astute appreciation is where it's at."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Virbila
|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a glowing review of ''On Wine'' (1982), the American chef and food writer [[James Beard]] called the book "a delight". "Reading it makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his personal views, his prejudices, his delightful sense of humour and his appreciation of life," Beard elaborated; "not to mention his awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine."&lt;ref name=beard1982&gt;{{Harvnb

The '''Ghassanid Kingdom''' ({{lang-ar|الغساسنة}}{{rlm}}; ''al-Ghasāsinah'', also ''Banū Ghassān'' "Sons of Ghassān") was an [[Arab]] kingdom, founded by descendants of the [[Azd]] tribe from [[Yemen]] who immigrated in the early 3rd century to the [[Levant]] region,&lt;ref name="saudiaramcoworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowersock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowersock|first=G.

After settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a [[vassal state|client state]] to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and fought alongside them against the [[Persia]]n [[Sassanids]] and their Arab vassals, the [[Lakhmids]].&lt;ref name="saudiaramcoworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bury"/&gt; The lands of the Ghassanids also acted as a [[buffer zone]] protecting lands that had been annexed by the Romans against raids by [[Bedouin]] tribes.

Few Ghassanids became [[Muslim]] following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Islamic Conquest]]; most Ghassanids remained Christian and joined [[Melkite]] and [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] communities within [[Syria (region)|what is now Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria and Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Bowersock"/&gt;

==Migration from Yemen==
Oral tradition holds that the Ghassanids came from the city of [[Ma'rib]] in [[South Arabia]] and its surrounding cities and towns, modern day [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Hoberman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoberman|first=Barry|title=The King of Ghassan|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198302/the.king.of.ghassan.htm|access-date=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111134936/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198302/the.king.of.ghassan.htm|archive-date=11 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition holds that their exodus from the area was primarily due to the destruction of the [[Marib Dam]], the story of which is detailed in the eponymous 34th chapter of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-34/|title=Quran Surah Saba with English Translation سبا|author=|date=|website=IReBD.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic]] [[proverb]] “They were scattered like the people of [[Sheba|Saba]]” refers to that exodus in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Migration did also occur in different waves, another prominent wave being the prosecution of Christian Arabs by [[Dhu Nuwas|Dhu Nawas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5159-dhu-nuwas-zur-ah-yusuf-ibn-tuban-as-ad-abi-karib|title=DHU NUWAS, ZUR'AH YUSUF IBN TUBAN AS'AD ABI KARIB - JewishEncyclopedia.com|author=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mass graves where many who did not escape were buried alive – the same is recited in the Quran and referred to "Asḥāb al-Ukhdūd" (أصحاب الأخدود).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardwilding.com/portfolio-item/najran-and-al-ukhdud/|title=Najran and Al-Ukhdud - Richard Wilding|author=|date=|website=richardwilding.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the migration to the Levant is unclear, but they are believed to have arrived in the region of Syria between 250-300&amp;nbsp;AD and later waves of migration circa 400&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Hoberman"/&gt; Their earliest appearance in records is dated to 473&amp;nbsp;AD, when their chief Amorkesos signed a treaty with the Eastern Roman Empire acknowledging their status as [[foederati]] controlling parts of Palestine.  He apparently became [[Chalcedonian]] at this time. By the year 510, the Ghassanids were no longer [[Miaphysite]], but [[Chalcedonian]].&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Shahid, 1989, ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fifth Century''.&lt;/ref&gt; They became the leading tribe among the Arab foederati, such as [[Banu Amela]] and [[Banu Judham]].

==Ghassanid Kingdom==

===Roman vassal===
[[Image:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Near East in 565&amp;nbsp;AD, showing the Ghassanids and their neighbors.]]
After originally settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a [[vassal state|client state]] to the Eastern Roman Empire.
The Romans found a powerful ally in the Ghassanids who acted as a buffer zone against the [[Lakhmids]]. In addition, as kings of their own people, they were also phylarchs, native rulers of client frontier states.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 1, Irfan Shahîd, 1995, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, Volume 2 part 2, Irfan Shahîd, pg. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was at [[Jabiyah]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. Geographically, it occupied much of the eastern [[Levant]], and its authority extended via tribal alliances with other [[Azdi]] tribes all the way to the northern [[Hijaz]] as far south as Yathrib ([[Medina]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{google books|id=4Z0YrPfeHa8C |pg=PA160 |page=160 |title=Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalhouseofghassan.org/history/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228194238/http://www.royalhouseofghassan.org/history/ |archivedate=28 February 2014 |title=History |publisher=Sovereign Imperial &amp; Royal House of Ghassan |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine–Persian Wars===
The Ghassanids fought alongside the Byzantine Empire against the [[Persia]]n [[Sassanids]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Lakhmids]].&lt;ref name="bury"/&gt; The lands of the Ghassanids also continually acted as a [[buffer zone]], protecting Byzantine lands against raids by [[Bedouin]] tribes. Among their Arab allies were the [[Banu Judham]] and [[Banu Amela]].

[[File:alheeralgharbi.jpg|thumb|260px|left|The tower of the Ghassanid king [[Al-Harith ibn Jabalah|Arethas son of Jabala]]]]

The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was focused more on the East and a long war with the Persians was always their main concern. The Ghassanids maintained their rule as the guardian of trade routes, policed [[Lakhmid]] tribes and was a source of troops for the imperial army. The Ghassanid king [[al-Harith ibn Jabalah]] (reigned 529–569) supported the Byzantines against [[Sassanid]] [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and was given in 529 by the emperor Justinian I, the highest imperial title that was ever bestowed upon a foreign ruler; also the status of patricians.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shahîd 1995, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shahîd 1995, p. 51-104&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, al-Harith ibn Jabalah was given the rule over all the Arab allies of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shahîd, 1995, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Harith was a [[Miaphysite]] Christian; he helped to revive the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Miaphysite (Jacobite) Church]] and supported Miaphysite development despite [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] Byzantium regarding it as [[heresy|heretical]]. Later Byzantine mistrust and persecution of such religious unorthodoxy brought down his successors, [[al-Mundhir II ibn al-Nu'man|al-Mundhir]] (reigned 569-582) and Nu'man.

The Ghassanids, who had successfully opposed the Persian allied [[Lakhmids]] of al-Hirah (Southern modern-day [[Iraq]]), prospered economically and engaged in much religious and public building; they also patronized the arts and at one time entertained the [[Arabian]] poets [[Nabighah adh-Dhubyani]] and [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] at their courts.&lt;ref name="saudiaramcoworld.com"&gt;Saudi Aramco World: The Kind of Ghassan.

==Islamic conquest==
The Ghassanids remained a Byzantine [[vassal state]] until its rulers and the eastern [[Byzantine Empire]] were overthrown by the [[Muslims]] in the 7th century, following the [[Battle of Yarmuk]] in 636&amp;nbsp;AD. At the time of the Muslim conquest the Ghassanids were no longer united by the same Christian faiths: some of them accepted union with the Byzantine [[Chalcedonian]] church; others remained faithful to [[Miaphysitism]] and a significant number of them maintained their Christian religious identity and decided to side with the Muslim armies to emphasize their loyalty to their Arabic roots and in recognition of the wider context of a rising Arab Empire under the veil of Islam. It is worth noting that a significant percentage of the Muslim armies in the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] (معركة مؤتة) were Christian Arabs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Several of those Christian Arab tribes in today's modern Jordan who sided with the Muslim armies were recognized by exempting them from paying [[jizya]] (جزية). Jizya is a form of tax paid by non-Muslims – Muslims paid another form of tax called Zakah (زكاة).  Later those who remained Christian joined [[Melkite]] Syriac communities.  The remnants of the Ghassanids were dispersed throughout [[The Levant|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref name="Bowersock"/&gt;

===Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham's ordeal with Islam===
There are different opinions why Jabalah and his followers didn't convert to Islam. Some opinions go along the general idea that the Ghassanids were not interested yet in giving up their status as the lords and nobility of [[Syria]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Below is quoted the story of Jabalah's return to the land of the Byzantines as told by 9th-century historian [[al-Baladhuri]].

[[File:Nicephorus I Logothetes.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Nicephorus I]] is said to be a descendant from [[Jabalah ibn al-Aiham]], the last Ghassanid ruler]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham sided with the Ansar ([[Azdi]] Muslims from Medina) saying, "You are our brethren and the sons of our fathers" and professed Islam. After the arrival of 'Umar ibn-al-Khattab in [[Syria]], year 17 (636AD), Jabalah had a dispute with one of the Muzainah and knocked out his eye. 'Umar ordered that he be punished, upon which Jabalah said, "Is his eye like mine? Never, by Allah, shall I abide in a town where I am under authority." He then apostatized and went to the land of the Greeks (the Byzantines). This Jabalah was the king of Ghassan and the successor of al-Harith ibn-abi-Shimr (or Chemor).&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Islamic State, being a translation from the Arabic of the Kitab Futuh al-Buldha of Ahmad ibn-Jabir al-Baladhuri'', trans. by P. K. Hitti and F. C. Murgotten, ''Studies in History, Economics and Public Law'', LXVIII (1916-1924), I, 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the fall of the first kingdom of Ghassan, King Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham established a Government-in-exile in Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;Ghassan Resurrected, Yasmine Zahran 2006, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ghassanid influence on the empire lasted centuries; the climax of this presence was the elevation of one of his descendants, [[Nikephoros I]] (ruled 802-811) to the throne and his establishment of a short-lived dynasty that can be described as the Nikephorian or Phocid Dynasty in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ghassan post Ghassan, Irfan Shahid, Festschrift "The Islamic World - From classical to modern times", for Bernard Lewis, Darwin Press 1989, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; But Nikephoros was not only a mere Ghassanid descendant, he claimed the headship of the Ghassanid Dynasty using the eponym of King Jafna, the founder of the Dynasty, rather than merely express himself descendant of King Jabalah.&lt;ref&gt;Ghassan post Ghassan, Irfan Shahid, Festschrift "The Islamic World - From classical to modern times", for Bernard Lewis, Darwin Press 1989, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarik, Tabari (Cairo, 1966), VIII, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Ghassanids reached their peak under al-Harith V and al-Mundhir III. Both were militarily successful allies of the Byzantines, especially against their enemies the Lakhmids, and secured Byzantium's southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper. On the other hand, the Ghassanids remained fervently dedicated to Miaphysitism, which brought about their break with Byzantium and Mundhir's own downfall and exile, which was followed after 586 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|2000|pp=102–103}}; {{harvnb|Shahîd|1991|pp=1020–1021}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghassanids' patronage of the Miaphysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread, through missionary activities, south into Arabia. According to the historian [[Warwick Ball]], the Ghassanids' promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|2000|p=105}}; {{harvnb|Shahîd|1991|p=1021}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria, as evidenced by a spread of [[urbanization]] and the sponsorship of several churches, monasteries and other buildings. The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life, with patronage of the arts, music and especially Arab-language poetry. In the words of Ball, "the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the [[Caliph]]al courts under Islam", and their court culture, including their penchant for desert palaces like [[Qasr ibn Wardan]], provided the model for the [[Umayyad]] caliphs and their court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|2000|pp=103–105}}; {{harvnb|Shahîd|1991|p=1021}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the first kingdom in the 7th century, several dynasties, both Christian and Muslim, ruled claiming to be a continuation of the House of Ghassan.&lt;ref&gt;Late Antiquity - Bowesock/Brown/Grabar, Harvard University Press, 1999, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Phocid or Nikephorian Dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, other rulers claimed to be the heirs of the Royal Ghassanids. The Rasulid Sultans ruled from the 13th until the 15th century in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Ghassan post Ghassan, Irfan Shahid, Festschrift "The Islamic World - From classical to modern times", for Bernard Lewis, Darwin Press 1989, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; And the Burji Mamluk Sultans in Egypt from the 14th until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ghassan post Ghassan, Irfan Shahid, Festschrift "The Islamic World - From classical to modern times", for Bernard Lewis, Darwin Press 1989, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Even both dynasties being Muslim, they claimed to be heirs and successors of Ghassan. The last rulers to bear the titles of Royal Ghassanid successors were the Christian Sheikhs [[Al-Chemor]] in Mount Lebanon ruling the small sovereign sheikhdoms of Akoura (from 1211 until 1633 CE) and Zgharta-Zwaiya (from 1641 until 1747 CE)- &lt;ref&gt;National News Agency - Ministry of Information Lebanese Republic, 2014 http://nna-leb.gov.lb/ar/show-report/371/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri Guilbeaux''' (1885–1938) was a [[France|French]] [[socialist]] politician. Active in the [[Zimmerwald Conference|Zimmerwald Anti-War Movement]] during [[World War I]]. He was a prominent figure of a group of intellectuals who fought in Geneva against the war; friend of [[Stefan Zweig]], whose poems he translated in French. Zweig nonetheless criticizes him in "Die Welt von Gestern," saying that he "was not a gifted person" and that "I must frankly denominate his literary ability as inconsiderable.  His command of language was not more than average; his education was not profound.  His entire power lay in controversy." He published a magazine, "Demain", that became a point of reference for all who were against the war.

Because of his political credo and his strong personality, he was judged by default in France and sentenced to death. He could escape in Russia, with the help of Lenin.

'''Hippolytus of Rome''' (170–235 AD) was one of the most important third-century theologians in the [[Diocese of Rome]],&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; where he was probably born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trigilio|first1=John Jr.|last2=Brighenti|first2=Kenneth |title=Saints For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtYHF3Ck1VEC&amp;pg=PT82|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-60691-9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photios I of Constantinople]] describes him in his ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' (cod. 121) as a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], who was said to be a disciple of [[Polycarp]], and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful.&lt;ref name=ODCC&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|2005|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came into conflict with the [[pope]]s of his time and seems to have headed a schismatic group as a rival to the [[Bishop of Rome]], thus becoming an [[Antipope]]. He opposed the Roman Popes who softened the penitential system to accommodate the large number of new pagan converts. However, he was reconciled to the Church before he died as a [[Christian martyrs|martyr]].&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt;

Starting in the fourth century, various legends arose about him, identifying him as a priest of the [[Novatianism|Novatianist schism]] or as a soldier converted by [[Saint Lawrence]]. He has also been confused with another martyr of the same name.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; [[Pope Pius IV]] identifies him as "Saint Hippolytus, Bishop of Pontus" who was martyred in the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] through his inscription on a statue found at the Church of Saint Lawrence in Rome and kept at the Vatican as photographed and published in Brunsen.&lt;ref name = "Brunsen"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/hippolytusandhi04bunsgoog ''Hippolytus and His Age''], Volume I, frontispiece, 1852, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
As a [[presbyter]] of the church at Rome under [[Pope Zephyrinus]] (199–217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that [[Origen]], then a young man, heard him preach.&lt;ref&gt;[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|Jerome's ''De Viris Illustribus'']] # 61; cp. [[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' vi. 14, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

He accused Pope Zephyrinus of [[modalism]], the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably [[Justin Martyr]], which distinguished the Father from the Logos ("Word"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when [[Pope Callixtus I]] (217–222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery.&lt;ref name = "EBO"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266682/Saint-Hippolytus-of-Rome "Saint Hippolytus of Rome." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 15 Aug. 2010 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippolytus himself advocated a pronounced rigorism.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07360c.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. "St. Hippolytus of Rome." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 16 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack [[Pope Urban I]] (222–230 AD) and [[Pope Pontian]] (230–235 AD).&lt;ref name=ODCC /&gt; G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, Allen. ''Hippolytus and the Roman church in the third century : communities in tension before the emergence of a monarch-bishop'', 1995, Brill, {{ISBN|9004102450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the persecution at the time of Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 to [[Sardinia]],&lt;ref name=SHMI&gt;{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O. Pirlo, SHMI|title=My First Book of Saints|year=1997|publisher=Sons of Holy Mary Immaculate - Quality Catholic Publications|isbn=971-91595-4-5|pages=179–180|chapter=Sts. Pontian &amp; Hippolytus}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely dying in the mines.&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.h.html?term=hippolytus+romanus "Hippolytus Romanus", ''Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature'' (Henry Wace, ed.), John Murray, London, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under [[Pope Fabian]] (236–250 AD), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called ''[[Chronography of 354]]'' (more precisely, the ''[[Liberian Catalogue]]'') reports that on August 13, probably in 236, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the [[Via Tiburtina]],&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt; his funeral being conducted by [[Justin the Confessor]]. This document indicates that, by about 255, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church.&lt;ref name=ODCC /&gt;

== Legends ==
The facts of his life as well as his writing were soon forgotten in the West, perhaps by reason of his criticism of the bishops of Rome and because he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. [[Pope Damasus I]] dedicated to him one of his famous epigrams, making him, however, a priest of the [[Novatianism|Novatianist]] schism, a view later accepted by [[Prudentius]] in the 5th century in his "Passion of St Hippolytus". In the Passionals of the 7th and 8th centuries he is represented as a soldier converted by [[Saint Lawrence]], a legend that long survived in the Roman [[Breviary]]. He was also confused with a martyr of the same name who was buried in [[Portus]], of which city he was believed to have been a bishop,&lt;ref name=ODCC /&gt; who was put to death by drowning in a deep well.&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt;

According to Prudentius' account, Hippolytus was dragged to death by wild horses,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Foxe]], [[Foxes Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]] (E. Hall, 1833) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JMU8AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Martina,+a+noble+and+beautiful+virgin;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qJLHQOybos&amp;sig=Jurps8PFSrKmZovYj3zZ8raeaKk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj289Wu0M_NAhXCnJQKHaUXB6MQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Martina&amp;f=false p41].&lt;/ref&gt; a striking parallel to the story of the mythological [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]], who was dragged to death by wild horses at Athens.  He described the subterranean tomb of the saint and states that he saw there a picture representing Hippolytus' execution. He also confirms August 13 as the date on which a Hippolytus was celebrated but this again refers to the convert of Lawrence, as preserved in the [[Menaion]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

The latter account led to Hippolytus being considered the [[patron saint]] of horses. During the [[Middle Ages]], sick horses were brought to [[St Ippolyts]], [[Hertfordshire]], England, where a church is dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/links/ippollitts.htm Ippollitts (A Guide to Old Hertfordshire)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
[[File:HippolytusStatue.JPG|upright=1|thumb|[[Ancient Roman|Roman]] sculpture, maybe of Hippolytus, found in 1551 and used for the attribution of the Apostolic Tradition]]

Hippolytus' principal work is the ''[[Refutation of all Heresies]]''.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; Of its ten books, Book I was the most important.&lt;ref name = "EBO"/&gt; It was long known and was printed (with the title ''Philosophumena'') among the works of Origen. Books II and III are lost, and Books IV–X were found, without the name of the author, in a monastery of [[Mount Athos]] in 1842. E. Miller published them in 1851 under the title ''Philosophumena'', attributing them to Origen of Alexandria. They have since been attributed to Hippolytus.

In 1551 a marble statue of a seated figure (originally female, perhaps personifying one of the sciences) was purportedly found in the cemetery of the Via Tiburtina and was heavily restored. On the sides of the seat was carved a [[paschal cycle]], and on the back the titles of numerous writings by Hippolytus.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; Many other works are listed by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and [[Jerome]].

Hippolytus' voluminous writings, which for variety of subject can be compared with those of Origen, embrace the spheres of [[exegesis]], [[homiletics]], [[apologetics]] and [[polemic]], [[chronography]], and [[canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. Hippolytus recorded the first [[liturgy|liturgical]] reference to the [[Virgin Mary]], as part of the ordination rite of a bishop.&lt;ref name=McNally68 &gt;McNally, Terrence, ''What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary'' 2009 {{ISBN|1-4415-1051-6}} pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Of exegetical works usually attributed to Hippolytus, the best preserved are the ''Commentary on the Prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'' and the ''Commentary on the [[Song of Songs]]''.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; This is the earliest attested Christian interpretation of the Song, covering only the first three chapters to Song 3:7.

The commentary on the [[Song of Songs]] survives in two Georgian manuscripts, a Greek [[epitome]], a Paleo-Slavonic [[florilegium]], and fragments in Armenian and Syriac as well as in many patristic quotations, especially in [[Ambrose of Milan]]'s ''Exposition on Psalm 118 (119)''. It is generally regarded as an instruction relating to a post-Baptismal rite of anointing with oil as a symbol of receiving the Holy Spirit. The commentary was originally written as part of a [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|mystagogy]], an instruction for new Christians. Scholars have usually assumed the ''Commentary On the Song of Songs'' was originally composed for use during [[Passover]], a season favored in the West for Baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus' ''Commentary on Daniel'' 1.17&lt;/ref&gt; Hippolytus supplied his commentary with a fully developed introduction known as the ''schema isagogicum'', indicating his knowledge of the rhetorical conventions for teachers discussing classical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mansfeld|1997|p=}} notes Origen's use of the schema, but not Hippolytus'.&lt;/ref&gt; He employs a common rhetorical trope, [[ekphrasis]], using images on the walls or floors of Greco-Roman homes, and in the catacombs as paintings or mosaics.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[https://www.gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/p-59818-the-mystery-of-anointing-hippolytus-commentary-on-the-song-of-songs-in-social-and-critical-contextsbrby-yancy-smithbrgorgias-studies-in-early-christianity-and-patristics-62.aspx Smith, Yancy.] ''The Mystery of Anointing: Hippolytus' Commentary On the Song of Songs in Social and Critical Contexts''. Gorgias Studies in Early Christianity and Patristics 62. 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-4632-0218-7}} page 9, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Origen felt that the Song should be reserved for the spiritually mature and that studying it might be harmful for the novice.

About 215, he wrote the ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', which contains the earliest known ritual of ordination.&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt; The influence of Hippolytus was felt chiefly through his works on chronography and ecclesiastical law. His chronicle of the world, a compilation embracing the whole period from the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] up to the year 234, formed a basis for many chronographical works both in the East and West.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/armenian/Chronicon_of_Hippolytus.pdf] ''The Chronicon of Hippolytus'' T.C. Schmidt and Nick Nicholas, 2010, second edition (rough draft)&lt;/ref&gt; It is from the ''Apostolic Tradition'' that the current words of episcopal ordination in the Catholic Church come from, as updated by [[Pope Paul VI]].

In the great compilations of ecclesiastical law that arose in the East since the 3rd century, the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]] many canons were attributed to Hippolytus, for example in the [[Canons of Hippolytus]] or [[Apostolic Constitutions#Epitome|the Constitutions through Hippolytus]]. How much of this material is genuinely his, how much of it worked over, and how much of it wrongly attributed to him, can no longer be determined beyond dispute, however a great deal was incorporated into the ''[[Fetha Negest]]'', which once served as the constitutional basis of law in [[Ethiopia]] — where he is still remembered as '''Abulides'''. During the early 20th century the work known as ''The Egyptian Church Order'' was identified as the [[Apostolic Tradition]] and attributed to Hippolytus; nowaday this attribution is hotly contested.

Differences in style and theology lead some scholars to conclude that some of the works attributed to Hippolytus actually derive from a second author.&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; Two small but potentially important works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the [[Seventy Apostles]] of Christ,'' are often neglected because the manuscripts were lost during most of the church age and then found in Greece in the 19th century. As most scholars consider them to not have been written by him, they are often ascribed to "{{nowrap|'''Pseudo-Hippolytus'''}}". The two are included in an appendix to the works of Hippolytus in the voluminous collection of Early Church Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–6&lt;/ref&gt; The work on the 70 apostles is noteworthy as a (potentially) early source.

==Eschatology==
Hippolytus is an important figure in the development of Christian eschatology. In ''On Christ and the Antichrist'' and ''Commentary on the Prophet Daniel'' Hippolytus gave his interpretation of Bible prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1583543?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dunbar, David G.. “The Delay of the Parousia in Hippolytus”. ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 37.4 (1983): 313–327]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of persecutions during the reign of Septimus Severus, many early Christian writers turned to eschatology. ''On Christ and the Antichrist'' is one of his earliest works. Hippolytus was greatly influenced by Irenaeus.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, David G., ''The Eschatology of Hippolytus of Rome'', (Ann Arbor: University Press, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Irenaeus, Hippolytus focuses on the meaning of prophecy for the Church in his own time. Of the dogmatic works, ''On [[Christ]] and the [[Antichrist]]'' survives in a complete state and was probably written about 202.

Hippolytus follows the long-established usage in interpreting Daniel's seventy prophetic weeks to be weeks of literal years. Hippolytus gave an explanation of Daniel's paralleling prophecies of chapters 2 and 7, which he, as with the other fathers, specifically relates to the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. His interpretation of events and their significance is Christological.&lt;ref name=Daley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S6NOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 Daley, Brian. ''The Hope of the Early Church: A Handbook of Patristic Eschatology'', CUP, 1991] {{ISBN|9780521352581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated that Rome would be partitioned into ten kingdoms and these in turn would be followed by the rise of the dread Antichrist, who would oppress the saints. This would be ended by Christ's Second Advent, the resurrection of the righteous, and the destruction of said Antichrist. After which would come the judgment and burning up of the wicked.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=271}}

Hippolytus did not subscribe to the belief that the Second Coming was imminent.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pkVCYrN8tL4C Cummings, Owen F., ''Eucharistic Doctors: A Theological History'', Paulist Press, 2005] {{ISBN|9780809142439}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was apparently the first to set a specific date for the second Advent through calculation—AD 500—which was 260 years after his time. He assumed, like [[Irenaeus]] his teacher, that inasmuch as God made all things in six days, and these days symbolize a thousand years each, in six thousand years from the creation the end will come.  He apparently based his calculation on the Septuagint which had the world beginning about 5500 BC.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=278}}&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''On Daniel'', ch. 2, 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feast days ==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[feast day]] of St Hippolytus falls on August 13, which is also the [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] of the [[Great Feasts|Feast]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Because on the Apodosis the hymns of the Transfiguration are to be repeated, the feast of St. Hippolytus may be transferred to the day before or to some other convenient day. The Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrates the feast of ''"St Hippolytus Pope of Rome"'' on January 30, who may or may not be the same individual.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] celebrates St Hippolytus jointly with [[Pope Pontian|St Pontian]] on August 13. The feast of Saint Hippolytus formerly celebrated on 22 August as one of the companions of Saint [[Symphorian and Timotheus|Timotheus]] was a duplicate of his 13 August feast and for that reason was deleted when the [[General Roman Calendar]] was [[Mysterii Paschalis|revised in 1969]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier editions of the [[Roman Martyrology]] referred to the 22 August Hippolytus as Bishop of Porto. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] sees this as "connected with the confusion regarding the Roman presbyter resulting from the Acts of the Martyrs of Porto. It has not been ascertained whether the memory of the latter was localized at Porto merely in connection with the legend in Prudentius, without further foundation, or whether a person named Hippolytus was really martyred at Porto, and afterwards confounded in legend with Hippolytus of Rome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07362a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:''Sts. Hippolytus'']&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is shared by a Benedictine source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0822.shtml Saint of the Day, 22 August]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology also mentioned on 30 January a Hippolytus venerated at [[Antioch]], but the details it gave were borrowed from the story of Hippolytus of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0130.shtml Saint of the Day, 30 January]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern editions of the Roman Martyrology omit all mention of this supposed distinct Saint Hippolytus of Antioch.

'''Hsiao Huang-chi''' ({{zh|t=蕭煌奇|tp=Hsiāo huáng chí|poj=Siau Hông-kî|p=Xiāo huáng qí}}; born September 22, 1976) is a  Taiwanese singer, songwriter and former [[judo]]ka ([[Rank in Judo|2nd dan black belt]]). He represented Taiwan in [[FESPIC Games]] in Beijing in 1994, where he won the bronze title and placed seventh at the [[1996 Atlanta Paralympics]]. Hsiao gained attention in the [[Hokkien pop]] scene after winning the Best Male Vocalist – Taiwanese award at the [[19th Golden Melody Awards]] in 2008.

Hsiao had [[congenital cataract]]s which led him to his blindness at birth, which was partially cured by surgery when he was 4. However his vision gradually deteriorated, and he completely lost his eyesight at age 15, it was revealed to be during a pickup game of basketball in high school before he attempted to box out for a rebound.

Hsiao had also gained a license to practice as a therapeutic masseur in high school. In 2012, he opened a massage clinic in Taipei, that employs blind and deaf people.

[[File:Dama d'Elx.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Lady of Elche|Lady of Elx]], 4th century BC, polychrome stone bust from L'Alcúdia, [[Elche]], Spain]]

The '''Iberians''' ({{lang-la|Hibērī}}, from {{lang-el|Ίβηρες}}, ''Iberes'') were a set of peoples that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] sources (among others, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], [[Avienus]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]]) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the [[Iberian peninsula]], at least from the 6th century BC. The Roman sources also use the term ''Hispani'' to refer to the Iberians.

The term ''Iberian'', as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|all the populations of the Iberian peninsula]] without regard to ethnic differences ([[Old European culture|Pre-Indo-European]], [[Celts]] and non-Celtic [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]). The other, more restricted ethnic sense, refers to the people living in the eastern and southern coasts of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which by the 6th century BC had absorbed cultural influences from the [[Phoenicia]]ns and the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;An English-language survey is Richard J. Harrison, ''Spain at the Dawn of History: Iberians, Phoenicians and Greeks'' (Thames &amp; Hudson), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] cultural group spoke the [[Iberian language]] from the 7th to the 1st century BC.

Other peoples possibly related to the Iberians are the [[Vascones]], though more related to the [[Aquitani]] than to the Iberians. The rest of the peninsula, in the northern, central, northwestern, western and southwestern areas, was inhabited by [[Celts]] or [[Celtiberians]] groups and the possibly [[Pre-Celtic|Pre-Celtic or Proto-Celtic]] [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Lusitanians]], [[Vettones]], and the [[Turdetani]].

== History ==
The Iberian culture developed from the 6th century BC, and perhaps as early as the fifth to the third millennium BC in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iberians – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568486/Iberians.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrBUT5E?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568486/Iberians.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Iberians.html Iberians – Encyclopedia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historymedren.about.com"&gt;[http://historymedren.about.com/library/text/bltxtspain2.htm Spain: Historical Setting – Library of Congress Country Study – Iberia]&lt;/ref&gt; The Iberians lived in villages and [[oppida]] (fortified settlements) and their communities were based on a [[tribe|tribal]] organization. The Iberians in the [[Levante, Spain|Spanish Levant]] were more urbanized than their neighbors in the central and northwestern regions of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. The peoples in the central and northwest regions were mostly [[Celts|Celtic]], semi-pastoral and lived in scattered villages, though they also had a few fortified towns like [[Numantia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Richardson, Hispaniae; Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218-82 BC, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a knowledge of [[writing]], [[metalworking]], including [[bronze]], and [[agricultural]] techniques.

===Settlements===
[[File:Silver plate - Tresor de Tivissa - Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya - Barcelona 2014.JPG|thumb|Ancient silver vessel from the Tivissa Treasure, c. 500 BC. [[Archaeology Museum of Catalonia]]]]

In the centuries preceding Carthaginian and Roman conquest, Iberian settlements grew in [[social complexity]], exhibiting evidence of [[social stratification]] and [[urbanization]]. This process was probably aided by trading contacts with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Carthaginians]]. By the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC a series of important social changes  led to the consolidation of an aristocracy and the emergence of a [[Clientelism|clientele system.]] "This new political system led, among other things, to cities and towns that centered around these leaders, also known as [[territorial nucleation]]. In this context, the [[oppidum]] or fortified Iberian town became the centre of reference in the landscape and the political space."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.europeana.eu/2018/11/the-history-of-the-iberians/|title=The history of the Iberians|last=Rueda|first=Carmen|last2=Sánchez|first2=Alberto|date=2018-11-30|website=blog.europeana.eu|publisher=[[Europeana]] – CC BY-SA|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30|last3=Amate|first3=Pilar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement of ''Castellet de Banyoles'' in [[Tivissa]] was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements in the north eastern part of the Iberian peninsula that was discovered in 1912. Also, the 'Treasure of Tivissa', a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mac.cat/eng/Sites/Castellet-de-Banyoles Castellet de Banyoles (Tivissa)] Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucentum]] was another ancient Iberian settlement, as well as [[Castelldefels Castle]].

[[Mausoleum of Pozo Moro]] near the town of [[Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón]] in [[Castile-La Mancha]] seems to mark the location of another big settlement.

[[Sagunto]] is the location of an ancient Iberian and later Roman city of Saguntum, where a big fortress was built in the 5th century BC.

[[Greek colonies#Greek colonies|Greek colonists]] made the first historical reference to the Iberians in the 6th century BC. They defined Iberians as non-Celtic peoples south of the [[Ebro]] river (Iber). The Greeks also dubbed as "Iberians" another people in the [[Caucasus]] region, currently known as [[Caucasian Iberia]]ns. It is thought that there is no connection between the two peoples.

The Iberians traded extensively with other Mediterranean cultures. Iberian [[pottery]] and metalwork has been found in [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[North Africa]]. The Iberians had extensive contact with [[Greek colonies#Greek colonies|Greek colonists]] in the Spanish colonies of [[Emporion]], [[Roses, Girona|Rhode]], and [[Hemeroskopeion]]. The Iberians may have adopted some of the [[Greeks]]' artistic techniques. [[Statue]]s such as the [[Lady of Baza]] and the [[Lady of Elche|Lady of Elx]] are thought to have been made by Iberians relatively well acquainted with Greek [[art]]. [[Thucydides]] stated that one of the three original tribes of [[Sicily]], the [[Sicani]], were of Iberian origin, though "Iberian" at the time could have included what we think of as [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art141.htm|publisher=Best of Sicily|title=Sicilian Peoples: The Sicanians|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iberians also had contacts with the [[Phoenicians]], who had established various colonies in southern [[Andalucia]]. Their first [[colony]] on the Iberian Peninsula was founded in 1100 BC and was originally called ''Gadir'', later renamed by the Romans as ''Gades'' (modern [[Cádiz]]). Other Phoenician colonies in southern Iberia included Malaka ([[Málaga]]), [[Sexi (Phoenician colony)|Sexi]] and [[Abdera, Spain|Abdera]].

=== Second Punic War and Roman conquest ===
{{Main|Second Punic War}}
[[File:Iberia 218-217BC-es.svg|250px|right|thumb|Iberia during the Second Punic War, showing the short-lived Carthaginian (yellow) and Roman (red) territories and allies]]
After the [[First Punic war]], the massive war debt suffered by Carthage led them to attempt to expand their control over the Iberian peninsula. [[Hamilcar Barca]] began this conquest from his base at [[Cádiz]] by conquering the Tartessian [[Guadalquivir]] river region, which was rich in silver. After Hamilcar's death, his son-in-law [[Hasdrubal]] continued his incursions into Iberia, founding the colony of Qart Hadasht (modern [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]) and extending his influence all the way to the southern bank of the river [[Ebro]]. After Hasdrubal's assassination in 221 BC, Hannibal assumed command of the Carthaginian forces and spent two years completing the conquest of the Iberians south of the Ebro.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Theodore Ayrault, ''Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 B.C'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306813629&amp;id=Z8nOkDyOwnUC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=cWeIfM9HD3&amp;dq=hannibal,+two+years,+ebro&amp;sig=7GjeNn45CNSF19-t84lYIor7Mp4 143]&lt;/ref&gt; In his first campaign, Hannibal defeated the [[Olcades]], the [[Vaccaei]] and the [[Carpetani]] expanding his control over the river Tagus region.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, D. ''Hannibal's Dynasty: Power and Politics in the Western Mediterranean, 247-183 BC'', p.89-91, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal then laid siege to Roman ally of [[Saguntum]] and this led to the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]]. The Iberian theater was a key battleground during this war and many Iberian and Celtiberian warriors fought for both Rome and Carthage, though most tribes sided with Carthage.

Rome sent [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] and [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to conquer Iberia from Carthage. Gnaeus subsequently defeated the Iberian [[Ilergetes]] tribe north of the Ebro who were allied with Carthage, conquered the Iberian [[oppidum]] of [[Tarragona|Tarraco]] and defeated the Carthaginian fleet. After the arrival of Publius Scipio, Tarraco was fortified and, by 211 BC, the Scipio brothers had overrun the Carthaginian and allied forces south of the Ebro. However, during this campaign, Publius Scipio was killed in battle and Gnaeus died in the retreat. The tide turned with the arrival of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]] in 210 BC. Scipio attacked and conquered [[Carthago Nova]] and defeated the army of [[Hasdrubal Barca]] at the [[Battle of Baecula]] (209-208). The war dragged on with Carthage sending more reinforcements until the [[Battle of Ilipa]] (modern [[Alcalá del Río]] in [[Seville (province)|Sevilla province]]), which was a decisive victory for Publius Scipio Africanus. The Carthaginians retreated to [[Cádiz|Gades]], and Publius Scipio gained control over the entire south of the peninsula. After this victory, the Ilergetes and other Iberian tribes revolted and it was only after this revolt that the Romans conquered the rest of the Carthaginian territories in southern Spain.

After the Carthaginian defeat, the Iberian territories were divided into two major provinces, [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]]. In 197 BC, the Iberian tribes revolted once again in the H. Citerior province. After securing these regions, Rome invaded and conquered [[Lusitania]] and [[Celtiberia]]. The Romans fought a [[Lusitanian War|long and drawn out campaign]] for the conquest of Lusitania. Wars and campaigns in the northern regions of the Iberian peninsula would continue until 16 BC, when the final rebellions of the [[Cantabrian Wars]] were defeated.

== Iberian culture ==
[[File:Serreta-cer-jinetes.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Horseman from Iberian pottery, [[Alicante]]]]
Iberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains (Latin: "regulus"), nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a "senate" by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed "fides".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rafael Treviño Martinez, Rome's Enemies (4) : Spanish Armies 218-19 BC (Men at Arms Series, 180)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks. [[Horse breeding]] was particularly important to the Iberians and their nobility. Mining was also very important for their economy, especially the silver mines near Gader and Cartago Nova, the iron mines in the [[Ebro]] valley, as well as the exploitation of [[tin]] and [[copper]] deposits. They produced fine metalwork and high quality iron weapons such as the [[falcata]].

=== Art and religion ===
{{Main|Iberian sculpture}}
The Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region. A distinct feature of the culture, the pottery was primarily decorated with geometric forms in red but in some areas (from [[Murcia]] to the south of [[Catalonia]]) it also included figurative images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Lord of the Horses - Old Iberian god - Villaricos (Almeria) - Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya - Barcelona 2014.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Lord of the Horses, Villaricos (Almeria), Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya, [[Barcelona]]]]
The Iberian [[polytheistic]] religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull [[Bicha of Balazote]] (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The [[Lady of Elche]] and [[Lady of Guardamar]] show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like [[Tanit]], [[Baal]], [[Melkart]], [[Artemis]], [[Demeter]] and [[Asclepius]] were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity "Betatun" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lisbeth Bredholt Christensen, et al. The Handbook of Religions in Ancient Europe&lt;/ref&gt; There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the [[Lady of Baza]] and linked with birds, flowers and wheat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula ([[Murcia]]). There are many depictions of a "horse taming god" or "lord of the horses" (''despotes hippon''). The female goddess [[Ataegina]] is also widely attested in the inscriptions.

Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves.&lt;ref&gt;La religiosidad entre los iberos, http://www.artehistoria.com/v2/contextos/5758.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and [[Silius Italicus]] mentions priests in the region of [[Tartessos]] at a temple of [[Melqart]]. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the "Bastetania dance" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Lisbeth Bredholt Christensen, et al. The Handbook of Religions in Ancient Europe, page&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common.

In Iberian [[eschatology]], "death was seen as the starting point for a journey symbolised by a crossing of the sea, the land or even the sky. Supernatural and mythical beings, such as the Sphinx or the wolf, and sometimes Divinity itself, accompanied and guided the deceased on this journey".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs.

Iberians venerated the war god [[Cariocecus]].

=== Warfare ===
[[File:Guerrero ibero del siglo III a. C (2).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Reenactor armed as an Iberian soldier with Falcata]]
Iberian soldiers were widely employed by Carthage and Rome as mercenaries and auxiliary troops. A large portion of Carthaginian forces during the [[Punic wars]] was made up of Iberians and [[Celtiberians]]. Iberian warfare was [[Endemic warfare|endemic]] and based on intertribal raiding and pillaging. In set piece battle, Iberians were known to regularly charge and retreat, throwing javelins and shouting at their opponents without actually committing to full contact combat. This sort of fighting was termed ''concursare'' by the Romans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Iberians were particularly fond of [[ambushes]] and [[guerrilla tactics]].

Ancient sources mention two major types of Iberian infantry, ''scutati'' and ''caetrati''. ''Scutati'' were heavily armored and carried large Celtic type [[scutum shield]]. The ''caetrati'' carried the caetra, a small Iberian [[buckler]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Iberian armaments included the famed [[Gladius#Predecessors and origins|Gladius Hispaniensis]], a curved sword called the [[falcata]], straight swords, spears, javelins and an all iron spear called the [[Soliferrum]]. Iberian horsemen were a key element of Iberian forces as well as Carthaginian armies. Spain was rich with excellent wild horses and Iberian cavalry was some of the best in the ancient Mediterranean.

=== Iberian tribes ===
[[File:Greek and Phoenician Colonies in The Iberian Peninsula.png|thumb|right|300px|Ethnology of the Iberian Peninsula c. 300 BC, based on the map by Portuguese archeologist Luís Fraga]] 
Iberians dwelt along eastern and southern coastal regions of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], that corresponds to the northwestern shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (see the map), roughly in today's [[Catalonia]], Eastern, Northeastern and Northern [[Aragon]], [[Valencian Community]], [[Murcia Region]], Eastern [[Andalucia]], and the [[Balearic Islands]] (in [[Spain]]), and also in today's [[Roussillon]] and parts of [[Languedoc]] (in [[France]]).
The peninsula has this name because ancient [[Greeks]], [[Romans]] and other mediterranean peoples first contacted with peoples (tribes or tribal confederacies) that were Iberians in the ethnic and linguistic sense, although the majority of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]'s peoples, that dwelt in the Northern, Central and Western regions (the majority of the peninsula's area), were not Iberians themselves in the ethnic and linguistic sense (they could only be considered Iberians in the geographical sense, i.e. they dwelt in the Iberian Peninsula).

The Iberian tribes or tribal confederacies were:

*Andosini - in the mountains of East [[Pyrenees]] southern slopes, in the high [[Segre river|Segre]] river basin, area of modern [[Andorra]].
*[[Ausetani]] - in the [[Osona]] region (old [[County of Osona]]), in the middle [[Ter river|Ter]] river basin. [[Vic|Ausa]] (today's [[Vic]]) was their main centre.
*[[Bastetani]]/[[Bastetani|Bastitani]]/[[Bastuli]] - The biggest iberian tribal confederation in area, they dwelt in a territory that included large areas of the mediterranean coast and the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], in what are today parts of the modern provinces of [[Murcia (province)|Murcia]], [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]], [[Jaén (province), Spain|Jaén]], [[Almería (province)|Almería]], [[Granada (province)|Granada]] and [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]]. [[Baza, Spain|Basti]] (today's [[Baza, Spain|Baza]]) was their main centre.
**Mastieni - in and around [[Mastia]] territory ([[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]).
*[[Bergistani]]/[[Bergistani|Bergusii]] - in the high [[Llobregat river|Llobregat]] river basin, roughly in today's [[Barcelona province|Barcelona]] province. [[Berga]] was their main centre. North of the [[Lacetani]].
*[[Castellani (people)|Castellani]] - in the high [[Ter river|Ter]] river basin, East [[Pyrenees]] southern slopes. North of the [[Ausetani]].
*[[Cessetani]]/[[Cessetani|Cossetani]] - in the [[Tarraco]] region (roughly in today's central and east [[Tarragona province|Tarragona]] province), in the mediterranean coastal region. [[Tarraco|Kese]] ([[Tarraco]] in Roman times, that would become the [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] capital), was their main centre.
*[[Ceretani]]/[[Ceretani|Cerretani]] - in [[Cerdanya|Cerretana]] (today's [[Cerdanya]]/[[Cerdaña]]) and other East [[Pyrenees]] mountains southern slopes, also in the high [[Segre river|Segre]] and [[Noguera Ribagorçana|Noguera]] rivers basins (tributaries of the [[Ebro River|Iberus]] - [[Ebro]] river), in the east part of [[Ribagorça]]. Libyca or Julia Libyca (today's [[Llivia]]) was their main centre. North of the [[Ilergetes]] and the [[Bergistani]].
*[[Contestani]] - South of the [[Xúquer|Sucro]] ([[Xúquer]]) river and north of the [[Segura River|Thader]] ([[Segura River|Segura]]) river, in an area that today is roughly part of the [[Alicante province|Alicante]]/[[Alicante province|Alacant]], [[Valencia province|Valencia]], [[Murcia Province|Murcia]] and [[Albacete Province|Albacete]] provinces. A tribal confederation. East of the [[Bastetani]]. Centres included Saetabi (modern [[Xàtiva]]) and [[la Bastida de les Alcusses]].
**Deitani - in and around [[Elche|Ilici]] territory (today's [[Elx]]/[[Elche]])
*[[Edetani]] - North of the [[Xúquer|Sucro]] ([[Xúquer]]/[[Júcar]]) river and south of the [[Millars River|Millars]] river, roughly in today's [[Valencia province]]. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. [[Edeta]] (Roman times [[Llíria|Lauro]], today's [[Lliria]]), to the northwest of [[Valencia]], was their main centre, [[Saguntum|Arse]] ([[Saguntum]] in Roman times, today's [[Sagunto]]/[[Sagunt]]) was also in their territory. North of the [[Contestani]] and the [[Bastetani]] and south of the [[Ilercavones]].
*[[Elisyces]]/[[Elisyces|Helisyces]] - a tribe that dwelt in the region of [[Narbo]] ([[Narbonne]]) and modern northern [[Roussillon]]. May have been either Iberian or [[Ligurians|Ligurian]] or a Ligurian-Iberian tribe.
*[[Ilercavones]] - in the low [[Ebro River|Iberus]] ([[Ebro]]) river basin to the [[Millars River|Millars]] river along the mediterranean coast and to the inland towards the [[Sierra de Gúdar]], in [[Ilercavonia]]. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. [[Hibera]] (Roman time Dertusa or Dertosa, modern time [[Tortosa]]) was their main centre. North of the [[Edetani]], south of the [[Ilergetes]], east of the [[Sedetani]] and west of the [[Cessetani]].
*[[Ilergetes]]/[[Ilergetes|Ilergetae]] - in the plains area of the middle and low [[Segre river|Segre]] and [[Cinca River (Spain)|Cinca]] rivers towards the [[Ebro river|Iberus]] ([[Ebro]]) river margins. One of the biggest iberian tribes or tribal confederations. [[Iltrida]] ([[Lérida|Ilerda]] in Roman times, today's [[Lérida]]/[[Lleida]]) was their main centre.
*[[Indigetes]]/[[Indigetes|Indigetae]] - in the low [[Ter river|Ter]] river basin, East [[Pyrenees]] southern slopes, they occupied the far north east area of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] known as [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], in the gulf of [[Empúries|Empodrae]] ([[Empúries]]) and Rhoda (Roses), stretching up into the [[Pyrenees]] though the regions of [[Empordà]], [[Selva]] and perhaps as far as [[Gironès]], in what is roughly today's [[Girona Province]]. Indika/Indiga or Undika was their main centre. A tribal confederation: they was formed by four tribes.
*[[Lacetani]] - in the middle [[Llobregat river|Llobregat]] river basin and surrounding hills. Northwest of the [[Laietani]]. 
*[[Laietani]] - in the low [[Llobregat river|Llobregat]] river basin, along a part of the mediterranean coast roughly in what is today a part of the [[Barcelona province|Barcelona]] province and [[Barcelona]] city. Laieta (Barcino in Roman times and [[Barcelona]] in modern times) was their main centre.
*[[Oretani]] - In the high [[Guadalquivir|Baetis]] ([[Guadalquivir]]) river valley, eastern [[Sierra Morena|Marianus Mons]] ([[Sierra Morena]]) and southern area of today's [[La Mancha]]. They could have been an Iberian tribe, a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic]] one, or a mixed Celtic and Iberian tribe or tribal confederacy (and hence related to the [[Celtiberians]]). The Mantesani/Mentesani/Mantasani of today's [[La Mancha]] and the [[Germani (Oretania)|Germani]] (of Oretania) in eastern [[Sierra Morena|Marianus Mons]] ([[Sierra Morena]]) and west Jabalón river valley, sometimes are included in the Oretani but it is not certain if they were Oretani tribes.
*[[Sedetani]] - south of the [[Ebro River|Iberus]] ([[Ebro]]) river and west of the [[Guadalope River|Guadalope]] river, roughly in the middle basin of the [[Ebro River|Iberus]] ([[Ebro]]). Salduie (Roman time Salduba and [[Caesaraugusta]] and modern time [[Zaragoza]]) was in their territory. May have been more closely related to the [[Edetani]]. West of the [[Ilercavones]].
*[[Sordones]] - in the [[Roussillon]] territory ([[Pyrénées Orientales]] Départment, [[France]]), [[Ruscino]] (today's Château-Roussillon near [[Perpignan]]) was their main centre.
*Vescetani/Oscenses - In today's northern [[Aragon]], east of [[Gállego river]], in [[Sobrarbe]], in and around [[Bolskan]], later [[Huesca|Osca]] ([[Huesca]]), and high [[Cinca (Spain)|Cinca River]] valley, [[Spain]]. They could also be related to the [[Vascones]] and therefore be related to the [[Aquitani]] speaking the [[Aquitanian language]], or a mixed Iberian-[[Aquitani]]an tribe or tribal conderacy.
*Unknown named tribe or tribes in the [[Balearic Islands]] (formed by the [[Pityusic Islands]] and [[Gymnesian islands]]), may have been Iberians.

=== Iberian language ===
{{Main|Iberian language}}
[[File:Mapa llengües paleohispàniques-ang.jpg|thumb|220px|Paleohispanic languages according to inscriptions (except Aquitanian – according to [[anthroponyms]] and theonyms used in [[Latin]] inscriptions)]]
[[File:Mapa escriptures paleohispàniques-ang.jpg|220px|thumb|Iberian scripts in the context of [[paleohispanic scripts]]]]
The Iberian language, like the rest of the [[paleohispanic languages]], became [[extinct language|extinct]] by the 1st to 2nd centuries AD, after being gradually replaced by [[Latin]]. The Iberian language remains an unclassified non-Indo European language. A 1978 study claimed many similarities between Iberian and the [[Messapic language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x2442045rp541gn7] On the decipherment of ancient Iberian, James M. Anderson – University of Calgary&lt;/ref&gt; Iberian languages also share some elements with the [[Basque language]].&lt;ref&gt;José Ignacio Hualde, Joseba A. Lakarra, Towards a History of the Basque Language, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Links have also been found with the [[Etruscan language]] and [[Minoan language|Minoan]] [[Linear A]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al, Prehistoric Iberia: Genetics, Anthropology, and Linguistics, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iberian scripts ===
{{Main|Iberian scripts}}
The Iberians use three different scripts to represent the [[Iberian language]].
* [[Northeastern Iberian script]]
** Dual variant (4th century BC and 3rd century BC)
** Non-dual variant (2nd century BC and 1st century BC)
* [[Southeastern Iberian script]]
* [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]]

[[Northeastern Iberian script]] and [[southeastern Iberian script]] share a common distinctive typological characteristic, also present in other [[paleohispanic scripts]]: they present signs with syllabic value for the [[occlusive]]s and signs with monofonematic value for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. From a [[writing systems]] point of view, they are neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]], they are mixed scripts that normally are identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. About this common origin, there is no agreement between researchers: for some this origin is only linked to the [[Phoenician alphabet]] while for others the [[Greek alphabet]] had participated too.

'''Imron Cotan''' (born 21 December 1954) is an [[Indonesia]]n diplomat. He was [[Ambassador of Indonesia to Australia]] between 2003 and 2005, and Ambassador of Indonesia to China between 2010 and 2013.

== Life and career ==
Cotan was born on 21 December 1954. He graduated [[Gadjah Mada University]] before joining the Indonesian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] in 1982. After completing the department's course for junior diplomats in 1984, he took on a role promoting international environmental preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/aboutemb/dubes/2003cv.htm |title=Curriculum Vitae of the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Indonesia to the Commonwealth of Australia: H.E.

In November 2003, Cotan took up a post as [[Ambassador of Indonesia to Australia]]. Speaking about on his time in Australia at the end of the posting in 2005, Cotan reflected that the relationship was difficult when he first came to Canberra in 2003 because of events that happened in East Timor in 1999.&lt;ref name=ABC2005&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-09-21/departing-cotan-reflects/2108958|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002074919/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-09-21/departing-cotan-reflects/2108958|archivedate=2 October 2016|title=Departing Cotan reflects|date=21 September 2005|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotan said the aid and relief Australia's military had provided to Indonesia in the wake of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] had brought the two countries closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Disaster-draws-Indonesia-Australia-closer-than-ever/2005/01/04/1104832113251.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|archivedate=30 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130151921/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Disaster-draws-Indonesia-Australia-closer-than-ever/2005/01/04/1104832113251.html|title=Indonesia, Australia closer than ever|first1=Cynthia|last1=Banham|first2=Tom|last2=Allard|first3=Mark|last3=Metherell|date=5 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said however that he was stunned at the way Australians reacted to the arrest and sentencing of [[Schapelle Corby]] for drug smuggling in 2004–05—some Australians wanted the country's tsunami aid taken into account in Corby's sentencing.&lt;ref name=ABC2005/&gt;

Cotan was appointed Ambassador of Indonesia to China in 2010. In an interview in 2011, Cotan said he was proud to see the relationship between the two countries reach its highest point ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theworldfolio.com/interviews/imron-cotan-indonesia-ambassador-to-the-people-republic-of-china-n1998/1998/|date=2011|title=Indonesia´s ambassador to China says political stability the key to prosperity|website=The World Folio|archivedate=2 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002080026/http://www.theworldfolio.com/interviews/imron-cotan-indonesia-ambassador-to-the-people-republic-of-china-n1998/1998/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was ambassador, the Indonesian Government opened a consulate general in Shanghai, which was expected to enhance the ties between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/700676.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002080315/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/700676.shtml|archivedate=2 October 2016|title=Indonesia opens consulate general in Shanghai, China|website=The Global Times|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janko Gagić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јанко Гагић}}; died 4 February 1804) was a [[Serbian hajduk]] leader (''buljubaša'') He was killed during the ''[[Slaughter of the Knezes]]'', the incident that sparked the [[Serbian Revolution]], ultimately leading to [[Serbia]]'s liberation from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arheo-amateri.rs/2012/02/istorija/novi_vek/seca-knezova-1804/ |title=Seča knezova |publisher=Arheo-amateri |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gagić was born in village of Ribnica in the [[Ribarska Banja]] region near [[Kruševac]]. After several Turks abducted his sister Teodora, Janko, a young and courageous man, with several comrades chased them down and killed them. As it was unsafe for him to remain in his home region, he moved to the village of [[Boleč]] between [[Belgrade]] and [[Grocka]]. He joined the [[Serbian Free Corps]] and participated in the [[Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)|Austro-Turkish War]] and [[Koča's frontier rebellion]], where he gained military experience. Known for his bravery, he was chosen to be a ''knez'' (village chieftain) in Boleč during the Habsburg occupation of Serbia. After the war and return of Ottoman rule, the [[Janissaries]] began to empower themselves. In 1801, the Janissary leaders, known as ''[[Dahije]]'', took over the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] in defiance of the Sultan. Janko had by become an influential [[brigand]]. Janko was unreluctant in attacking Dahije and controlled a road to [[Smederevo]] near Boleč along with his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:478195-Srpski-junak-koji-je-ratovao-protiv-Turaka-posle-210-godina-bice-sahranjen/ |title=Srpski junak koji je ratovao protiv Turaka, posle 210 godina biće sahranjen|publisher=Novosti |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Dahije started to fear that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them, they decided to execute notable Serbs to forestall this. As a notable hajduk commander, Janko was subject of fear among Turks, which is why he was targeted; the Turks abducted his son, forcing Janko to surrender. He was decapitated. His death was described in the Serbian epic folk poem ''Otac'' ("The Father").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/Отац_(епска_песма)/ |title=Otac (poem) |publisher=Wikisource |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, one of the biggest streets, and a public fountain in Boleč, are named after him.{{where|date=July 2016}} In February 2014, exactly 210 years after his assassination, his remains were moved into a Boleč churchyard tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tob.rs/sr-lat/events.php?id=1189 |title=Podizanje spomen obeležja Janku Gagiću |publisher=TOB |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170141/http://www.tob.rs/sr-lat/events.php?id=1189 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jasmuheen''' (born '''Ellen Greve'''; 1957) is a proponent of "[[prana|pranic]] nourishment" or [[inedia|breatharianism]], a practice defined as living without food or fluid of any sort and regarded by the scientific community as a lethal [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/703279.stm  | title=Guru condemned as 'dangerous' | publisher=[[BBC]] |date=6 April 2000  | first= | last=  | accessdate =10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She makes appearances at [[New Age]] conferences worldwide, has hosted spiritual retreats in [[Thailand]] and has released books and audio recordings.

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2017}}
Jasmuheen was born in 1957 in [[New South Wales]], Australia of post-war Norwegian migrant parents.

==Breatharianism==
Jasmuheen developed financial and business management skills working full-time in the finance industry. In 1992 she began combining her experience in business and finance with meditation, selling access to workshops and seminars on the topic and, by [[deed poll]] changed her name to Jasmuheen.{{citation needed| date= January 2017}}

In 1998, she appeared in her first film, a six-part [[direct to video]] documentary called ''The Legend of Atlantis: Return of the Lightmasters''.{{citation needed|date= January 2017}} The Australian television programme ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate how she could live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute [[dehydration]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and [[high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"&gt;{{cite news | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=25 October 1999  | first= | last=  | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm |accessdate =7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen claimed that this was a result of "polluted air". On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice [[Inedia]]. But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen's speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a [[Stone (weight)|stone]] (6&amp;nbsp;kg or 14&amp;nbsp;lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: "You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%." The doctor continued: "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure."&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1999"/&gt; Jasmuheen's condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal. The film crew agreed with this assessment and stopped filming.

Regarding her intake of food, Jasmuheen is quoted by the Correx Archives as saying:&lt;ref name="Correx"&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Willis | title = Jasmuheen&amp;nbsp;– Can people live on nothing but air? | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm | work = Interview with Jasmuheen (transcript) | publisher = Correx Archives | year= 1997 | accessdate = 9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Generally not much at all. Maybe a few cups of tea and a glass of water, but now and then if I feel a bit bored and I want some flavour, then I will have a mouthful of whatever it is I'm wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that." In the aftermath of the ''60 Minutes'' broadcast, [[Kathy Marks]] noted in ''[[The Independent]]'', "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".&lt;ref name="Independent 25 October 1999"&gt;{{cite news |last= Marks |first= Kathy| authorlink= Kathy Marks |title= Gaunt and weak, the sham diet guru who refuses to see the light |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/gaunt-and-weak-the-sham-diet-guru-who-refuses-to-see-the-light-737972.html| date= 25 October 1999|newspaper= [[The Independent]] |location=London| accessdate= 15 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen has stated that she has lived on approximately 300 [[calorie]]s per day for the past fourteen years, maintaining full health through supplementing a fluid intake with "cosmic particles" or "micro-food", which she describes as [[prana]]. She has stated that she has not yet mastered the ability to be fluid-free for more than short periods.

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 ("presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of [[paranormal]] or [[pseudoscientific]] piffle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/features/bent-spoon/ |title=Bent Spoon Winner 2000 – Jasmuheen |accessdate=10 December 2006 |author= Barry Williams |year=2000 |work=Bent Spoon winners |publisher=Australian Skeptics}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also awarded the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for her book ''Pranic Nourishment&amp;nbsp;– Living on Light'', "which explains that although some people do eat food, they don't ever really need to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 2000 Ig Nobel Prize Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225074430/http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html |date=25 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen maintains that some of her beliefs are based on the writings and "more recent [[Channelling (mediumistic)|channelled]] material" of the [[Count of St Germain]].&lt;ref name="BBC 1999"&gt;{{cite news | title = All they need is the air ... | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 22 September 1999 | accessdate = 16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that her [[DNA]] expanded from 2 to 12 strands to take up more hydrogen.&lt;ref name="Correx" /&gt; The extra strands of DNA have not been scientifically verified. When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, Jasmuheen stated "you cannot view spiritual energy under a microscope". She claimed that such a challenge would be a deliberate attack on her beliefs, and that she refuses to act as an example of her alleged paranormal attributes.&lt;ref name="Correx" /&gt;

In 2005, [[James Randi]] offered her the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|US$1 million prize]] to demonstrate her claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/070105quality.html#14 |title=Online Newsletter |accessdate=7 March 2013 |last=Randi |first=James |authorlink=James Randi |date=1 July 2005 |work=SWIFT |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007184948/http://www.randi.org/jr/070105quality.html#14 |archivedate= 7 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she appeared in the documentaries ''[[3 Magic Words]]'' and ''[[In the Beginning There Was Light]]''.

=== Deaths of followers ===
{{asof|2012}}, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's publications.&lt;ref name="3Deaths"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Walker |author2=Judith O'Reilly | title = Three deaths linked to 'living on air' cult | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | publisher = (London) | date = 26 September 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiss woman starves to death on daylight diet |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/swiss-woman-starved-to-death-on-daylight-diet/story-e6frf7lf-1226339082591 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012}} "This was the fourth known death linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's books since the practice emerged in the early 90s."&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medicalexposedownloads.com/PDF/breatharian.pdf medicalexposedownloads.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

53-year-old Melbourne resident Lani Marcia Roslyn Morris died in 1999, while attempting the breatharian "diet" advocated by Jasmuheen. Jim Vadim Pesnak, 63, and his wife Eugenia, 60, were jailed for six years and two years, respectively, on charges of manslaughter for their involvement in the death of Morris. Pesnak had delayed seeking medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sands|first=Judy|title=Prison for air cult disciples|newspaper=Courier-Mail|date=27 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring this case, Jasmuheen commented that Morris's practice of Inedia perhaps was "not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation".&lt;ref name="3Deaths"/&gt;

Jasmuheen offered similar defence in response to the death of Verity Linn, who died of [[Hypothermia]] and [[Dehydration]] with lack of nutrition while practising Inedia in Scotland, her diary mentioning Jasmuheen's teachings. Linn's body was found in a tent.&lt;ref name="The Herald"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12248399.Cult_woman_did_not_starve_to_death/ | title="Cult woman did not starve to death" | publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=23 September 1999 | accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/453661.stm | title=Scotland: "woman starved herself to death" | publisher=[[BBC]] |date=6 April 2000 | accessdate =10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it was reported that a Swiss woman died of starvation after having attempted to survive purely on light, as taught in one of Jasmuheen's books.&lt;ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/&gt; In 2017 a Dutch woman living in a household of four practitioners of breatharianism inspired by Jasmuheen&lt;ref name="contactmuziek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | title=Contact &amp; Muziek: Lichtvoeding | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612223030/http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | archive-date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; died under mysterious circumstances. The three remaining members of the household are suspected of withholding the malnourished woman adequate medical care.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/12/om-onderzoekt-sterfgeval-in-woongroep-die-voeding-afzweert-a1562695 | title=OM onderzoekt sterfgeval in woongroep die voeding afzweert | newspaper = NRC Handelsblad | location = Amsterdam | last = van der Veen | first = Casper | date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmuheen has written that "If you haven't found the light that will nourish you, you may have the intention to become a breatharian, but in fact you may be putting yourself through food deprivation. There is one known case where a person died when trying to become a breatharian."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/stars3/breathe_light/warnings.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Michelle Shirley, spokeswoman for the [[Cult Information Centre]], told the BBC that the centre had been contacted five times in the previous 12 months by concerned friends and family members of Breatharians and that "although Breatharianism is not strictly a cult, the centre has been monitoring its activities". She added, "We are particularly concerned about any implication that if it doesn't work, it is the person's fault. That implies there is nothing wrong with the Breatharians' teachings."&lt;ref name="BBC 1999"/&gt;

==Personal life for Jason Hawes==

===Background===
Hawes was born in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]] and moved to [[Warwick, Rhode Island]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; According to his own account, Hawes began to see [[Apparitional experience|apparitions]] at the age of twenty after a girlfriend who practiced [[Reiki]] manipulated his [[Energy (esotericism)|life force energy]]. [[Paranormal research]]er [[John Zaffis]] told Hawes that he was becoming [[Psychic|sensitive]] to paranormal phenomena. Hawes founded the Rhode Island Paranormal Society (RIPS) in 1990 as a support group for people who had paranormal experiences. When Hawes was twenty-two, Hawes went on to found TAPS/The Atlantic Paranormal Society and co-create the major hit ''Ghost Hunters''. ''Ghost Hunters'' became the flagship show of the Syfy Channel and made it one of the top watched channels on cable.&lt;ref name="Rohrbach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basinpark.com/photogallery/basindisplay/pic_details.php?pid=295&amp;size=1|last=Rohrbach|first=Jill M.|title=On Sci Fi Channel's Ghost Hunters Episode|date=July 26, 2005|publisher=Eureka!

===Interests and hobbies===
Hawes has written two books on the paranormal and four [[sci-fi]]/[[thriller (genre)|thriller]] screenplays.&lt;ref name="dragoncon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dragoncon.org/dc_guest_detail.php?id=1442 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721000634/http://dragoncon.org/dc_guest_detail.php?id=1442 |archivedate=2007-07-21 |df= }} Hawes bio on DragonCon.org&lt;/ref&gt; He and fellow TAPS founder Grant Wilson are longtime co-workers at their day job as plumbers for [[Roto-Rooter]]. It was Hawes who brought Wilson into the plumbing business.&lt;ref name="Hawes 2"&gt;''Ghost Hunting'' (Hawes, Wilson and Friedman), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are former co-owners of the Spalding Inn, based in [[Whitefield, New Hampshire|Whitefield]], [[New Hampshire]].They finally sold the Inn in the summer of 2014.&lt;ref name="Hawes 3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeking Spirits: The Lost Cases of The Atlantic Paranormal Society|chapter=Jason: The Haunted Hotel|year=2009|last1=Hawes|first1=Jason|last2=Wilson|first2=Grant|last3=Friedman|first3=Michael Jan|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-0115-5|lccn=2009025000|pages=254–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spalding Inn" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thespaldinginn.com/ | title = The Spalding Inn | accessdate = 2009-09-07 | format = commercial site | publisher = spaldinginn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
Hawes has used public ghost hunting events and personal appearances to raise money for various charities, such as the [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]] and Cure Kids Cancer.

===Threatening e-mail===
In March 2005, Barry Clinton Eckstrom, 51, of [[Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania]], began to send threatening e-mails to Jason Hawes, founder of TAPS.  Hawes alerted the FBI in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].  When the e-mails began to include threats against then President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] became involved.  Eckstrom also used Hawes's name to send e-mails to some female members of TAPS, in which he threatened to rape and murder them.  While under surveillance by federal agents, Eckstrom used a [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania]] library computer to send an e-mail in Hawes' name to Roto Rooter's [[Cincinnati]] headquarters, threatening to shoot employees there.  Next, Eckstrom typed a message threatening to kill President Bush, again in Hawes' name, using the [[Department of Homeland Security]]'s website.  Before he could send the message, he was arrested.  Because of these activities, Eckstrom was sentenced to two years in federal prison in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pittsburgh man indicted for allegedly threatening President Bush

'''Leela Dube''' (27 March 1923 – 20 May 2012) was a renowned anthropologist and feminist scholar, fondly called Leeladee by many. She was the widow of anthropologist and sociologist Shyama Charan Dube and a younger sister of the late classical singer [[Sumati Mutatkar]]. She is survived by two sons, Mukul Dube and [[Saurabh Dube]]. Known for her work on kinship and in women's studies, she wrote several books including ''Matriliny and Islam: religion and society in the Laccadives''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Leela Dube|title=In Memoriam: Prof. Leela Dube(1923-2012)|url=http://feministsindia.com/in-memoriam-prof-leela-dube-1923-2012|publisher=feministsindia.com|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Women and kinship: comparative perspectives on gender in South and South‑east Asia''.

==Career==
Although she had taught earlier at Osmania, Dube's academic career really began in 1960 at [[Sagar University]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]. She moved to [[Delhi]] in 1975. She played a crucial role in shaping the "Towards Equality" report of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (1974), [[Government of India]], discussion of which in the [[Parliament of India]] brought women's studies to centre stage in Indian academia via the [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] and the [[ICSSR]].

She was a key person in the [[Indian Sociological Society]] in the 1970s and was responsible for introducing women's studies concerns into mainstream sociology. She was one of the pioneering and senior faculty in the [[Institute of Rural Management, Anand]], when it started functioning in 1980. One of her studies in the then nascent educational organisation put it on the international map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies on women in South East Asia: a status report |first=Leela |last=Dube |publisher=UNESCO Regional Office in Asia and Oceania |year=1980  |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000457/045796eb.pdf |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In IRMA she pioneered a course for the first batch in 1980, termed then "Rural Environment"; a foundation course which attempted to push a "business management techniques program design" towards asking questions about village society. It was  also designed as a preparatory course to the "village field work segment". This was  an innovation for business schools which she pioneered from probably her own sociological field work experiences. This course has been developed further, and split; in 2012, it was offered as three half credit courses, termed "Rural Society and Polity", "Rural Livelihood Systems", and "Rural Research Methods". It continues to be offered as a first semester course, as a preparation for the field work that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irma.ac.in/programmes/prm_programme_structure.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313011736/https://www.irma.ac.in/programmes/prm_programme_structure.php |archivedate=13 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the World Sociological Congress of 1984, women activists and women's studies scholars played a dominant role through Research Committee (RC) 32. Dube summed up the session with her comments on the tradition of son preference in India. In a debate in the ''Economic and Political Weekly'' in 1982–86 on sex selective abortions, her contribution was noteworthy and her prediction about the direct relationship between deficit of women and increased violence against women proved to be true in later years.

Due to the team effort of women's studies scholars (including Leela Dube), RC 32 was institutionalised in the World Sociological Congress. Dube invited many activists for the 12th [[International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]], Zagreb, 24–31 July 1988, to present papers on "Codification of Customary Laws into Family Laws in Asia". In the Congress, Dube's speech on feminist anthropologist [[Eleanor Leacock]] provided new insights into the departure of feminist anthropologists from the colonial legacy of "Big Brother watching you". Power relations between the North and The South in the construction of knowledge and the hegemonic presence of the ETIC approach in academics were questioned by Leacock as well as by Dube, a proponent of the "dialogical approach" in anthropological and ethnographic research.

At different times, Leela Dube was associated with the Indian Council of Social Science Research and the [[Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library|Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]]. For short spells she was visiting faculty at several universities in different parts of the world.

In keeping with her expressed wish, her eyes were donated after her death.

==Books and articles==
''Visibility and Power: Essays on Women in Society and Development'', co-edited by Leela Dube, [[Eleanor Leacock]] and [[Shirley Ardener]] and published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1986, provides an international perspective for the anthropology of women in the contexts of India, Iran, Malaysia, Brazil and Yugoslavia.

Her piece, "On the Construction of Gender: Hindu Girls in Patrilineal India", ''Economic and Political Weekly'', Vol. 23, No. 18 (Apr. 30, 1988), has been used by women's groups for study circles and training programmes.

A volume in the series on Women and the Household, ''Structures and Strategies: Women, Work, and Family'' (1990), co-edited by Leela Dube and Rajni Palriwala, has been useful in teaching women's studies in Economics, Sociology, Geography, Social Work and Governance courses.

''Women and Kinship: Comparative Perspectives on Gender in South and South-East Asia'', by Leela Dube, United Nations University Press (1997), argues that kinship systems provide an important context in which gender relations are located in the personal and public arenas.

Her celebrated book, ''Anthropological Explorations in Gender: Intersecting Fields'', published in 2001 by Sage, is an important contribution in feminist anthropology in India. It examines gender, kinship and culture by sourcing a variety of unconventional materials such as folk tales, folk songs, proverbs, legends and myths to construct an ethnographic profile of feminist thought. She provides an understanding of the socialization of the girl child in the patriarchal family, with the "seed and soil" theory propagated by Hindu scriptures and epics symbolizing a domination-subordination power relationship between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Books by Leela Dube|title=All Books by Leela dube|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/author/leela-dube|publisher=BookFinder.com|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthropological Explorations in Gender:Intersecting Fields|title=Anthropological Explorations in Gender: Intersecting Fields|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/Anthropological_Explorations_in_Gender-Intersecting_Fields/0761994858/|publisher=BookFinder.com|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Books by Leela Dube|title=Books by Leela dube|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/Structures_and_Strategies-Women,_Work,_and_Family_In/817036163X/|publisher=BookFinder.com|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her last publication, a Marathi translation of her last book in English, was ''Manavashastratil Lingbhavachi Shodhamohim'', which appeared in 2009.

==Awards==
In 2009 she was given the UGC's Swami Pranavananda Saraswati Award for 2005.

In 2007 she received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the [[Indian Sociological Society]].

This article is a '''list of notable people related to [[Cape Verde]]'''.

The words “[[Cabo Verdean people|Cabo Verdean]]” are not always used to express the same notions. They can be used to express:
# People who were born in Cape Verde and/or were raised in Cape Verde, generally having lived most of their lives in Cape Verde and who ethnically identify themselves as Cape Verdeans.
# People who may or may not have born in Cape Verde, having lived most of their lives outside Cape Verde, having a different [[nationality]] than Cape Verdean. Many of these people also have Cape Verdean nationality. Most of these people ethnically identify themselves as Cape Verdeans, having strong ties with Cape Verde and Cape Verdean culture.
# People who were not born in Cape Verde but with one or both parents being of one of the two criteria above. Since the ties between Cape Verdean descendants and Cape Verde are usually long lasting, these people often consider themselves as being “Cape Verdeans”.

[[File:Cartoucheroué.JPG|thumb|The execution of '''Cartouche''', 1721]]
'''Louis Dominique Garthausen''', also known as '''Cartouche''' (1693, [[Paris]]–November 28, 1721, Paris; age 27–28), who usually went by the name of Louis Bourguignon or Louis Lamarre when he wanted to hide his identity, was a [[highwayman]] reported to steal from the rich and give to the poor in the environs of Paris during the [[Régence]] until the authorities had him [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]].

Cartouche's personal dash and exploits were exploited in ballads and popular prints and have been vividly revived in [[bodice-ripper]]s and the swashbuckling romance with slapstick comedy of the film ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'' (1962) by [[Philippe de Broca]], starring [[Jean Paul Belmondo]] and the twenty-three-year-old [[Claudia Cardinale]].

The '''Manifestation of God''' is a concept in  the [[Bahá'í Faith]] that refers to what are commonly called [[prophet]]s.  The Manifestations of God are appearances of the Divine Spirit or Holy Spirit in a series of personages, and as such, they perfectly reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization through the agency of that same Spirit.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baha'i Faith, it is believed that the Manifestations of God are the only channel for humanity to know about [[God]] because contact with the Spirit is what transforms the heart and mind, creating a living relationship between the soul and God. They act as perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God into the physical world.&lt;ref name="hatcher118"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZmkG1ASirgC |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bahá'í teachings]] hold that the motive force in all human development is due to the coming of the Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="hatcher115"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are directly linked with the Bahá'í concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]].

[[File:Ringstone.svg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Bahá'í symbols#Ringstone symbol|Ringstone symbol]] represents humanity's connection to God through the Manifestation of God]]
The Bahá'í concept of the intermediary between [[God]] and [[human]]ity is expressed in the term Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation"/&gt; Bahá'ís believe in a [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|single, imperishable God]], the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | pages = 737–740| isbn = 0-02-865733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish [[religion]] in the world.&lt;ref name="manifestation"/&gt;

The Manifestations of God are not seen as [[incarnation]]s of God as God cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of a Manifestation of God emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, [[knowledge]] and attributes of [[God]]; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; A common Bahá'í analogy used to explain the relationship between the Manifestation of God and God is that of a perfect [[mirror]]. In the analogy, God is likened to the [[Sun]] – the source of physical life on [[earth]].  The spirit and attributes of God are likened to the rays of the Sun, and the Manifestations of God are likened to perfect mirrors reflecting the rays of the Sun.&lt;ref name="hatcher118"/&gt; Thus, the Manifestations of God act as pure mirrors that reflect the attributes of God onto this material world.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

The Manifestations of God are seen to represent a level of existence which is an intermediary between God and [[humans]]. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, explained that at one extreme the Manifestations of God are [[humility|humble]] servants of God and at the other extreme they claim to speak with the voice of God, and manifest his attributes to humanity. They may at times emphasize their humanity, and at other times proclaim their divinity.  These stations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

The Manifestations of God are believed to possess capacities that do not exist in humans, and this difference is not a difference in degree but a difference in kind.  The Manifestations of God are not seen to be simply great thinkers or [[philosophers]] who have a better understanding than others, but that, by their nature, they are inherently superior to the average human.&lt;ref name="hatcher120"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Manifestations of God are special beings, having a unique relationship to God as they have been sent by God from the spiritual world as an instrument of divine [[revelation]].  They are understood to have existed in the spiritual world prior to their physical [[birth]] in this life.  They are also seen to have [[innate]], divinely revealed knowledge and absolute knowledge of the physical world.&lt;ref name="hatcher120"/&gt; According to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son and successor of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, the Manifestations of God must be distinguished above any other person in every aspect and qualification, in order that they can effectively train and educate people.&lt;ref name="fwu"&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |year=1972 |title=Foundations of World Unity |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-018-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/FWU/ | page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Manifestation of God, according to Bahá'í belief, is to educate humanity. The Manifestations of God are seen as divine educators, who are raised up by God with the purpose of uplifting mankind and expressing his will. In expressing God's intent, the Manifestations of God are seen to establish [[religion]] in the world.  Each brings a book and [[revelation|reveals]] teachings and laws according to the time and place which they appear.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh used the term ''revelation'' to describe the phenomena that occurs each time a Manifestation of God appears; he stated that the writings of the Manifestation of God represent the infallible word of God, and because the writings remain after the earthly life of the Manifestation they are a very important part of revelation.&lt;ref name="hatcher82"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws and precepts revealed by the Manifestation of God lie in different spheres and levels and include elements intended to help individuals develop a [[moral character|sound character]] and acquire divine attributes, as well as laws and principles designed to help improve the welfare of society and advance [[civilization]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá has stated that from time to time an educator will come to teach humanity, and without these teachings humanity would be overcome by such emotions and attitudes as anger, jealousy and hatred.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

The Bahá'í belief that the primary role of the Manifestation of God is that of an educator is stated by Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá:

:"The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth. The purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most High. The light which these souls radiate is responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples. They are like unto leaven which leaveneth the world of being, and constitute the animating force through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest. Through them the clouds rain their bounty upon men, and the earth bringeth forth its fruits. All things must needs have a cause, a motive power, an animating principle. These souls and symbols of detachment have provided, and will continue to provide, the supreme moving impulse in the world of being."&lt;ref name="gleanings"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#pg156|pages = 156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"God sent all His Prophets into the world with one aim, to sow in the hearts of men love and goodwill, and for this great purpose, they were willing to suffer and to die. All the sacred Books were written to lead and direct man into the ways of love and unity; and yet, in spite of all this, we have the sad spectacle of war and bloodshed in our midst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear=1912 |year=1995 |title=Paris Talks |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bahá'í Distribution Service |isbn=1-870989-57-0 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-34.html | page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equality==
{{see also|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
In Bahá'í belief, all of the Manifestations of God are from the same God and have the same [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] nature, and that there is absolute equality among them. The differences between the various Manifestations of God and their teachings, Bahá'u'lláh explained, are due to the varying needs and capacities of the civilization in which they appeared, and not due to any differences in their level of importance or nature.&lt;ref name="hatcher116"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | pages = 116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]] that in respect to their station of unity "if thou callest them all by one name and dost ascribe to them the same attribute, thou hast not erred from the truth."&lt;ref name="iqan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |origyear=1862  |year=2003 |title=Kitáb-i-Íqán: The Book of Certitude |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=1-931847-08-8 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-5.html#gr34 | pages = 152–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Manifestations of God all fulfill the same purpose and perform the same function by mediating between God and creation. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh then states the diversity of the teachings of the Manifestations of God does not come about because of their differences, since they are one and the same, but because they each have a different mission. Bahá'u'lláh writes regarding this station of distinction, "each Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined Revelation, and specially designated limitations."&lt;ref name="iqan" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]] that those who perceive distinctions and differences between the Manifestations of God, will notice the underlying [[wikt:unity|unity]] of the Manifestations once they continue on their spiritual path.&lt;ref name="gdm"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=2002 |title=Gems of Divine Mysteries |publisher=Bahá'í World Centre  |location=Haifa, Israel |isbn=0-85398-975-3 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GDM/gdm-4.html | pages = 33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh in several passages goes so far as to say that denial of one Manifestation is equivalent to denial of all of them. `Abdu'l-Bahá said that a Bahá'í will choose death over denial of any of the great Prophets, whether Moses, Muhammad or Christ.&lt;ref name="abl"&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear=1911 |year=1982 |title=`Abdu'l-Bahá in London |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=London, UK |isbn=0-900125-50-0 | pages = 56–57 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/ABL/abl-16.html#pg56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í belief in the oneness of the Manifestations of God does not mean, however, that the same individual soul is born again at different times and in different physical bodies.  In the Bahá'í view, the various Manifestations of God were all different personalities and had separate individual realities.  Instead, their equality is due to that Manifestation of God manifested and revealed the qualities of God to the same degree.&lt;ref name="hatcher116"/&gt;

==Religious perennialism==
{{See also|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|l1=Progressive revelation}}
Bahá'u'lláh taught that Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single [[progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive religion]] from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-10.html | title = The Changeless Faith of God | accessdate = 2006-11-12 | year = 2006 | author = bahai.org | publisher = bahai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bahá'í view the succession of Manifestations of God had no beginning and will have no end.&lt;ref name="hatcher128"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | pages = 128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that Manifestations will continue to come about every thousand years, extending "over many ages into the unborn reaches of time."&lt;ref name="dnd"&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1970 |title=Dawn of a New Day |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=India |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DND/dnd-257.html | page = 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sab"&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |year=1978 |title=Selections From the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-85398-081-0 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-34.html | pages = 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Manifestations of God are explained to have always come to humanity and will continue to do so, `Abdu'l-Bahá explained that there are distinct cycles within this process.  The cycles consist of hundreds of thousands of years and are characterized by three periods. The first period involves the coming of a series of Manifestations of God who prepare humanity for a universal [[theophany]]; the second period involves the appearance of the Manifestation of God that brings the universal theophany and his dispensation; finally the third period includes the Manifestations of God that come after. `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that in the current cycle, the first period was started by [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and extended to the time of the [[Báb]].  Bahá'u'lláh is seen as the universal Manifestation of God, and the current cycle will continue for another 500,000 years.&lt;ref name="manifestation"/&gt;

There is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Abraham]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Manifestations of God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 231 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Báb]], as well as Bahá'u'lláh, were included in this definition.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; Thus religious history is interpreted as a series of periods or "dispensations", where each ''Manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.

Bahá'ís do not claim that the Bahá'í revelation is the final stage in God's direction in the course of human spiritual evolution.  The Bahá'í writings contain assurances that after 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's coming, [[Bahá'í prophecies#The next Manifestation of God|another Manifestation of God]] will appear to advance human civilization.&lt;ref name="hatcher128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |year=1978 |title=Selections From the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-85398-081-0|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-34-printable.html |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abdu'l-Bahá writes in the ''Tablet of the Universe'' (''"Lawh-i-Aflákiyyih"'') that there are infinite Manifestations of God in the [[Bahá'í cosmology|infinite worlds of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hatcher |first=John S. |title=Close Connections: The Bridge Between Spiritual and Physical Reality |year=2005 |place=Wilmette, Illinois |isbn=1-931847-15-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxJCt1Kj--8C |pages=150–151 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor prophets==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] definition, there is a distinction between minor prophets and the Manifestations of God, the major prophets.  This distinction is also referred to as lesser/greater, dependent/independent, follower/universal, and other similar phrases. The Manifestations of God or the major prophets are compared to the sun, which produces its own heat and light, and the minor prophets are likened to the moon, which receives its light from the sun.

The Manifestations of God are described as prophets endowed with constancy. The term endowed with constancy refers to prophets to whom a book was revealed (in which the book contained legislation) and with whom lasting [[Covenant (religion)|covenants]] with God were made, abrogating past covenants. For example, Bahá'u'lláh describes [[Moses]] as a Manifestation of God and his brother [[Aaron]] a minor prophet; Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14-17).  Furthermore, the other prophets of the [[Old Testament]] such as [[Jeremiah]], [[David]], [[Solomon]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Isaiah]] are described as minor prophets as they came in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.&lt;ref name="manifestation"/&gt;  There is, however, no definite list of who is or isn't a minor prophet in the Bahá'í understanding.

The distinction can also be described as the difference between inspiration and [[revelation]].  Revelation is seen to be the direct and infallible perception of God's word and is only accessible to the Manifestations of God who transmit it to humanity.  On the other hand, inspiration is seen to be the indirect and relative perception of spiritual truths that each person may have access to.  Bahá'u'lláh stated that at times, God chooses ordinary people to act as ''prophets'' and thus inspires them to play certain roles in human affairs; these people however remain ordinary people whose powers of inspiration have been further developed by God.&lt;ref name="hatcher122"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |author2=Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other possible divine teachers==
{{see also| Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans}}
It is implied, though not specifically named, that the [[Americas|American continents]] have had their share of divine revelations, which somewhat have been lost to time except in oral traditions.  A quote exists by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:

:"In ancient times the people of America were, through their northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are other signs which indicate communication. As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur'án it hath been revealed: "We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a Messenger" (Q. 17:15). Undoubtedly in those regions, the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now."&lt;ref&gt;Research Department Memorandum, dated 16 May 1996, published in "Native Messengers of God in Canada? A test case for Baha'i universalism", by Christopher Buck, published in Bahá'í Studies Review 6 pages 97-133, London: Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics are researching Native Messengers and some have connected the signs of a Prophet with the [[Great Peacemaker]] of the [[Haudenosaunee]]. As such, some Bahá'í's revere the Peacemaker as a Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Buck | first = Christopher | title = Native Messengers of God in Canada? A test case for Baha'i universalism | journal = The Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = | issue = | pages = 97–132 | publisher = Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe | location = London | year = 1996| url =http://bahai-library.com/buck_native_messengers | issn = | accessdate = 2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the Great Peacemaker was never named specifically in the Writings, he cannot be officially listed as a Manifestation of God within the Faith.

In regards to the Asiatic prophets, Shoghi Effendi wrote:
:"The only reason there is not more mention of the Asiatic Prophets is because Their names seem to be lost in the mists of ancient history. Buddha is mentioned, and Zoroaster, in our Scriptures — both non-Jewish Prophets or non Semitic Prophets. We are taught there always have been Manifestations of God, but we do not have any record of Their names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Shoghi Effendi |editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) |year = 1983 |title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |isbn = 81-85091-46-3 |url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4#n1696 | page = 503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prussian Lithuanians contributed greatly to the development of written Lithuanian, which for a long time was considerably more widespread and in more literary use in Lithuania Minor than in Lithuania proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfredas Bumblauskas|title=The History of Lithuania|url=http://www.eu2013.lt/en/History-of-Lithuania-Book|year=2013|publisher=Eugrimas|isbn=978-609-437-204-9|accessdate=25 September 2013|pages=15–16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most Lithuanians, who remained [[Roman Catholic]] after the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Lietuvininkai became [[Lutherans|Lutheran-Protestants (Evangelical-Lutheran)]].

There were 121,345 speakers of Lithuanian in the Prussian census of 1890. Almost all Prussian Lithuanians fled or were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled after World War II]], when East Prussia was divided between [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The northern part became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], while the southern part was attached to Poland. Only the small [[Klaipėda Region]] ({{lang-de|Memelland}}) was attached to Lithuania.

==Ethnonyms and identity==
The term ''Preußische Litauer'' (''Prussian Lithuanians'' in German) appeared in German texts of the 16th century. The term ''Kleinlitaw'' (''Lithuania Minor'' in German) was first used by [[Simon Grunau]] between 1517 and 1527. Prussian Lithuanians used various names for themselves: Prussians (Lithuanian: ''Prūsai'', German: ''Preusch''), Prussian Lithuanians (Lithuanian: ''Pruſû Lietuwiai'', ''Pruſû Lietuvininkai'', ''Pruſißki Lietuvininkai'', German: ''Preußische Litauer''), or simply Lithuanians (Lithuanian: ''Lietuw(i)ni(n)kai'', German: ''Litauer''). Local self-designating terms found in literature, such as ''Sziszionißkiai'' ("people from here"), ''Burai'' (German: ''Bauern''), were neither politonyms nor [[ethnonyms]]. Another similar term appeared in the [[Klaipėda Region]] (Memelland) during the interwar years – ''Memellanders''&lt;ref name="Vareikis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vareikis |first=V. |year=2001 |url=http://www.ku.lt/sociologija/files/2001_nr.1-2.54-65.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722151629/http://www.ku.lt/sociologija/files/2001_nr.1-2.54-65.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-22 |title=Memellander/Klaipėdiškiai Identity and German-Lithuanian Relations in Lithuania Minor in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries |journal=Sociologija.

Modern Lithuanian historiography uses the term ''Lietuvininkai''&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}{{cite book | last = Vėlius | first = Norbertas | authorlink = Norbertas Vėlius |author2=et all  | title = Lietuvininkų kraštas | publisher = Litterae universitatis |year=1995 | location = Kaunas | pages = | url = http://pirmojiknyga.mch.mii.lt/Leidiniai/lietkrastas.de.htm | language=Lithuanian| id =   | isbn = 9986-475-03-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes a neologism unknown to Lietuwininkai themselves, ''Mažlietuviai''. The usage of ''Lietuvininkai'' is problematic as it is a [[synonym]] of the word ''Lietuviai'' ("Lithuanians"), and not the name of a separate ethnic sub-group.

For Prussian Lithuanians loyalty to the German state, strong religious beliefs, and the mother tongue were the three main criteria of self-identification.&lt;ref name="Pocytė2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pocytė |first=S. |year=2001 |url=http://senas.ku.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2001_nr_1-2-77-89.pdf |title=Mažosios ir Didžiosios Lietuvos integracijos problema XIX a. - XX a. pradžioje |journal=Sociologija.

===Early history===
[[Image:Preusche littauer.jpg|thumb|right|Prussian Lithuanians in 1744]]
The territory where Prussian Lithuanians lived in ancient times was inhabited by the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]], [[Skalvians|Skalvian]] and [[Curonians|Curonian]] tribes. The area between the rivers [[Łyna River|Alle]] and [[Neman River|Neman]] became almost uninhabited during the 13th-century [[Prussian Crusade]] and wars between the pagan [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Teutonic Order]].&lt;ref name="Gudavičius"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gudavičius |first=E. |year=1999 |title=Lietuvos istorija |pages=439–441 |isbn=9986-39-112-1 |publisher=Lietuvos rašytojų sąjungos leidykla |location=Vilnus}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uninhabited area was named ''the wilderness'' in chronicles. Local tribes were resettled, either voluntary or by force, in the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the 1422 [[Treaty of Melno]], a stable border between the two states was established. Better living conditions in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights attracted many Lithuanians and Samogitians to settle there.&lt;ref name="Gudavičius"/&gt; [[Masurians]] and [[Curonians]] began moving into Prussia around the same time.

After 1525, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert]] became duke of Prussia and converted to [[Protestantism]]. Many Prussian Lithuanians also became Protestants. By the will of Albert, church services for Prussian Lithuanians were held in the Lithuanian language. Although Lithuanians who settled in Prussia were mainly farmers, in the 16th century there was an influx of educated Protestant immigrants from Lithuania, such as [[Martynas Mažvydas]], [[Abraomas Kulvietis]] and [[Stanislovas Rapolionis]], who became among the first professors at [[Königsberg University]], founded in 1544. Martynas Mažvydas was a zealous Protestant and urged citizens to stop all contact between Prussian Lithuanians and Lithuanians living in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in a bid to curtail Catholic influence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxiamzius.lt/numeriai/2006/03/01/zvil_00.html |title= Kodėl mes išlikome? |year=2006 |author=Bernardas Aleknavičius |accessdate=2007-10-15|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1708, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was devastated by [[Plague (disease)|plague]], especially its easternmost part, where Prussian Lithuanians lived. About 50% of Prussian Lithuanians died. To compensate for the loss, King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] invited settlers from [[Salzburg]], the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], and [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]] to repopulate the area. Many of these Lutherans were members of the [[Pietism]] movement, which then spread among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1811 a teacher's seminary for Prussian Lithuanians was established in Karalene near [[Insterburg]], which remained open until 1924. From the mid-18th century, a majority of Prussian Lithuanians were literate; in comparison, the process was much slower in the Grand Duchy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===19th century===
[[Image:Wilhelm1.jpg|thumb|left|The 7th stanza of [[Lietuvininks we are born]] was dedicated to German Emperor Wilhelm I ({{lang-lt|Wilius I}})]]
The nationalistic [[Lithuanian national revival]] in the late 19th century was not popular with Prussian Lithuanians. To them integration with Lithuania was not understandable and not acceptable.&lt;ref name="Pocytė2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt; The idea of Lithuanian–Latvian unity was more popular than idea of Lithuanian-Prussian Lithuanian unity during the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]], a conference held in 1905.&lt;ref name="Pivoras"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pivoras |first=S. |year=1998 |url=http://www.lis.lt/index.php?id=archyvas&amp;lang=LT&amp;TomasID=6&amp;ArchyvasPSL=57&amp;ArchyvasID=333&amp;ArchyvasKiekis=1 |title=Lietuvių ir latvių bendradarbiavimas priešinantis tautinei priespaudai XIX a. pabaigoje – XX a. pradžioje |journal= Lietuvos istorijos studijos |volume=6 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Prussian Lithuanian elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], [[Jonas Smalakys]], was a fierce  agitator for the integrity of the [[German Empire]]. In 1879, [[Georg Sauerwein]] published the poem ''[[Lietuwininkais esame mes gime]]'' in the newspaper ''[[Lietuwißka Ceitunga]]''. The 7th stanza was dedicated to [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor]].

There was no national [[Germanization]] policy until 1870; Prussian Lithuanians voluntarily adopted German language and culture.&lt;ref name="Arnašius"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Arnašius | first = Helmutas | title = Vokiečiai Klaipėdoje | url = http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2002/078/078vok.html | journal = Mokslas ir Gyvenimas | accessdate = 2007-10-30 | year = 2002 | volume = 7-8 | language = Lithuanian | quote = Šis procesas nebuvo skatinamas kokių nors germanizacijos užmačių, jis savaime brendo aukštos ir žemos civilizacijų bei kultūrų sankirtoje. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531031428/http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2002/078/078vok.html | archivedate = 2008-05-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, when part of Lithuania became integrated with the new nation of Germany, learning the German language was made compulsory in state schools. Studying the German language provided the possibility for Prussian Lithuanians to become acquainted with Western European culture and values.&lt;ref name="Arnašius"/&gt; However, Germanization also provoked a cultural movement among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1879 and 1896, petitions for the return of the Lithuanian language to schools was signed by 12,330 and 23,058 Prussian Lithuanians from the districts of [[Klaipėda|Memel]], [[Vzmorye|Heydekrug]], [[Tilsit]] and [[Ragnit]].&lt;ref name="lrytas.lt"&gt;{{lt icon}}[http://lrytas.lt/?data=&amp;id=11919032961191434646&amp;sk_id=&amp;view=4&amp;p=3 Ko neįstengė suprasti Lietuvos valdžia ir klaipėdiškiai 1923-1939 metais?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the French administration made a survey in the Klaipėda Region that showed that only 2.2% of Prussian Lithuanians would prefer purely Lithuanian schools.&lt;ref name="Arnašius"/&gt; The Lithuanian language and culture were not persecuted in Prussia. In contrast, there were restrictive [[Russification]] policies and a [[Lithuanian press ban]] in the parts of Lithuania that had become part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The Prussian Lithuanians could publish own newspapers and books, even helping Lithuanians in  Russia to bypass their press ban by publishing their newspapers, such as ''[[Auszra]]'' and ''[[Varpas]]''.

===Between the two World Wars===
{{Main|Klaipėda Region}}
{{See also|Klaipėda Revolt}}
[[Image:Tilsit Act.jpg|thumb|right|230 px|A 1938 reproduction of the Act of Tilsit, signed in 1918]]
The northern part of East Prussia beyond the [[Neman River]] was detached from East Prussia at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], dividing the territories inhabited by Prussian Lithuanians between [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Klaipėda Region]] (Memelland) under the administration of the [[Council of Ambassadors]], which was formed to enforce the agreements reached in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The organisation "Deutsch-Litauischer Heimatbund" ({{lang-lt|Namynês Bundas}}) sought reunification with Germany or to create an independent state of Memelland and had a membership of 30,000 individuals. Two dozen pro-Lithuanian representatives of the Prussian Lithuanian National Council signed the [[Act of Tilsit]], asking to unite the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania; the idea was not supported by the majority of Prussian Lithuanians.&lt;ref name="Pocytė2"/&gt; [[World War I]] was followed by severe economical hardships and inflation in Germany. In 1923, the [[Republic of Lithuania]] occupied the Klaipėda Region during the [[Klaipėda Revolt]].

A secret report of 1923 by Jonas Polovinskas-Budrys, a Lithuanian professional counterintelligence officer, shows  around 60% of the local inhabitants supported the revolt, 30% were neutral and 10% were against, namely the supporters of a ''freistadt'' status or reunification with Germany.&lt;ref name="lrytas.lt"/&gt; Soon Lithuanian policies alienated the Prussian Lithuanians. People from Greater Lithuania were sent to assume public administration posts in the region. According to the Lithuanian view, the Prussian Lithuanians were Germanized Lithuanians who should be re-Lithuanized.&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt; Prussian Lithuanians saw this [[Lithuanization]] policy as a threat to their own culture and began to support German political parties, and even started identifying themselves as Germans.&lt;ref name="Didlietuviai"/&gt; During the 1925 census, 37,626 people declared themselves to be Lithuanians and 34,337 people identified themselves as Memellanders, a neologism to distinguish themselves from Lithuanians. Inhabitants of the Klaipėda Region continuously voted for German or German-oriented parties.&lt;ref name="Arnašius"/&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] invaded Klaipėda after the [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania]]. The inhabitants were allowed to choose Lithuanian citizenship. Only 500 asked for citizenship, and only 20 were awarded it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The reunification of Klaipėda with Germany was met with joy by a majority of inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt; About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, fled the region.&lt;ref name=cd117&gt;{{cite book | last=Skirius | first=Juozas | title=Gimtoji istorija.

===World War II and after===
After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Prussian Lithuanian activists living in Germany were persecuted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1938, Prussian and Lithuanian place names in East Prussia were translated into German or replaced by German names often unrelated to the Lithuanian toponym. For example, Lasdehnen  ([[Lazdynai]]) became [[Krasnoznamensk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Haselberg]], Jodlauken (Juodlaukiai) became Schwalbental, and so on. Toponyms of the Klaipėda region were not changed after reunification. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper ''Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis'' was not closed down until 1940. during World War II. Church services in [[Tilsit]] and [[Ragnit]] were held in the Lithuanian language until the [[evacuation of East Prussia]] in late 1944.

The evacuation started late; the Red Army approached much faster than expected and cut off the territorial connection with other German-held territories by January 26, 1945. Many refugees perished due to Soviet low-flying strafing attacks on the civilians columns,&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"&gt;Albertas Juška, ''Mažosios Lietuvos Bažnyčia XVI-XX amžiuje'', Klaipėda: 1997, pp. 742-771, here after the German translation [http://www.liuteronai.lt/Istorija-ir-teologija/Baznycios-istorija/Die-Kirche-in-Klein-Litauen ''Die Kirche in Klein Litauen''] (section: 9.

However, many managed to flee by land or sea into those parts of Germany captured by the British and Americans.&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"/&gt; Among the latter were the pastors A. Keleris, J. Pauperas, M. Preikšaitis, O. Stanaitis, A. Trakis, and J. Urdse, who gathered those from the Lithuanian parishes and reorganised the Lithuanian church in the western zones of [[Allied-occupied Germany]].&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"/&gt;

====Expulsion after World War II====
{{see |Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)}}
The Red Army made no distinction between Germans of Prussian Lithuanian or German ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"/&gt; During the evacuation of East Prussia, Prussian Lithuanians, like other East Prussians, fled in an attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"/&gt; Mass murder, rape, and looting were the common fate of those who did not succeed. After the end of war, some Prussian Lithuanians tried to return to their East Prussian homes, but they were discriminated against and denied food rations by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 9-Kleinlitauer"/&gt;

All who remained at the war's end were expelled from Soviet's [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and from the former Klaipėda Region, which was transferred to the [[Lithuanian SSR]] in 1947. By 1945, there were only about 20,000 inhabitants left in the Klaipėda Region, compared to the 152,800 in 1939. The government of the Lithuanian SSR followed Soviet policy and viewed the Prussian Lithuanians as Germanized Lithuanians. About 8,000 persons were repatriated from [[DP camps]] during 1945–50. However, their homes and farms were not returned as either Russians or Lithuanians had already occupied their property. Prussians who remained in the former Memel (Klaipėda) territory were fired from their jobs and otherwise discriminated against.&lt;ref name="kaukas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gudelienė |first=V. |year=1998 |url=http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/98/3/03knygos.html |title=Trys knygos apie lietuvininkų tragediją |journal=Mokslas ir gyvenimas |volume=3 |pages=66–76 |issn=1392-3358 |language=lt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927171701/http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/98/3/03knygos.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Prussian Lithuanians and their descendants did not regain lost property in the Klaipėda region.&lt;ref name="trys knygos"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/98/3/03knygos.html| title=Tries knygos apie lietuvininkų tragediją| accessdate=2007-03-31| language=lt| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927171701/http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/98/3/03knygos.html| archivedate=2006-09-27| df=}} "Kai kurie ir iš nepriklausomos Lietuvos išvažiuoja į Vokietiją, nes čia ne visiems pavyksta atgauti žemę ir sodybas, miestuose ir miesteliuose turėtus gyvenamuosius namus.

Some still want the Lietuvininkai to "return" to ''the [[Germany|Vaterland]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950 and beyond====
In 1951 about 3,500 people from the former Memel Territory were expelled by the authority of the Lithuanian SSR to [[East Germany]]. After [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s visit to Moscow in 1958, the former citizens of Germany were allowed to emigrate, and the majority of Prussian Lithuanians in the Lithuanian SSR emigrated to [[West Germany]]. Only about 2,000 local Lithuanians chose to remain in the Klaipėda Region and virtually none in the Kaliningrad Oblast. The majority of Prussian Lithuanians today live in the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with 65,000 refugees from Lithuania proper, mostly Roman Catholic, who made their way to the western occupation zones of Germany, by 1948 they had founded 158 schools in the Lithuanian language.&lt;ref name="Lithuanian High School History"&gt;[http://gimnazija.de/?q=en/node/101 "History"] on: [http://gimnazija.de/?q=en ''Lithuanian High School''], retrieved on 28 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the emigration of many Lithuanians overseas and the assimilation of the remaining Prussian Lithuanians in Germany, the number of Lithuanian schools has now dwindled to only one, [[:de:Litauisches Gymnasium Hüttenfeld|Litauisches Gymnasium/Vasario 16-osios gimnazija (Lithuanian High School)]] {{de icon}} in [[Lampertheim|Lampertheim in Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Lithuanian High School History"/&gt; Until 1990, this secondary boarding school was the only Lithuanian school outside areas controlled by the Soviet Union. It was attended by several well-known exiled Lithuanians, such as the singer [[Lena Valaitis]].

Communities of Prussian Lithuanians have developed in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Sweden]] and [[Australia]]. However, a separate ethnic and cultural identity for Prussian Lithuanians is not as strong as it once was, and cultural differences are gradually vanishing.

==Culture and traditions==
[[File:Mažosios Lietuvos kanklės-arfa (rekonstrukcija; LNM).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Reconstruction of a [[kanklės]]-harp (''kanklės-arfa'') from [[Lithuania Minor]] on the basis of Teodor Lepner's 1744 book "Der Preussische Litauer"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varioburnos.com/mediums/people/abutkus/abutkus_G.htm Mažosios Lietuvos kanklės-arfa. 1984 m.]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[National Museum of Lithuania]]]]
The Prussian Lithuanians that settled in the [[monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]] over the centuries were  influenced by [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and the [[German language]]. They adopted the cultural values and social conventions of the German state, but preserved their [[Lithuanian language]],&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt; traditions and folk culture. For centuries Prussian Lithuanians lived in a political and religious environment that was different from that of other Lithuanians and evolved into a separate ethnic group. The common state united some aspects of, traditions and folk culture.&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt; who viewed its rulers as their own rulers.&lt;ref name="Pocytė"/&gt; Hanging portraits of the rulers of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] in the home was widespread.

The [[Pietist]] congregational movement attracted large numbers of Prussian Lithuanians: evangelical fellowships ({{lang-de|Stundenhalter}}, {{lang-lt|Surinkimininkai}}) were very active in Prussia, as they were in the rest of the [[German Empire]]. About 40% of Lithuanians belonged to such fellowships, whose members lived by [[ascetic]] principles.&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt;

Until the mid-19th century Prussian Lithuanians were mostly villagers. Their feudal mentality is reflected in the poem  [[The Seasons (poem)|''The Seasons'']] by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]. ''The Seasons'' criticizes the tendency to adopt German ways, since this was often associated with decadent noblemen. Donelaitis called for Lithuanians to do their duty, to not envy those who went to town, to not complain or be lazy, and try to work as much as was needed to be a good peasant:

:There, in the city, one is laid up with his gout;
:Another's aches and pains require a doctor's aid.
:Why do these countless ills torment the luckless rich?
:Why does untimely death so often strike them down?

Towns were not large. People who emigrated to the major towns, [[Königsberg]] and [[Klaipėda|Memel]], usually became bilingual and eventually became Germanized.{{dubious|date=December 2010}}

After World War II, virtually no Prussian Lithuanians remained in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and only a small number survived in the Lithuanian SSR. Their peasant culture, first threatened by germanization in the German Empire and politically oppressed in the Nazi era, was now completely wiped out by the Soviets, who made no distinction between Germans and Lithuanians. The situation was somewhat better in the former Memel Territory but even there churches and cemeteries were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balsas.lt/naujiena/221185/apartamentai-ant-kapiniu/rubrika:naujienos-lietuva]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal names==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Prussian Lithuanian surnames often consist of a [[patronym]]ic with suffixes "''-eit''" and "''-at''". It has the same role as the [[English language|English]] suffix "''-son''" in the surnames ''Abrahamson'' and ''Johnson''. Examples include: ''Abromeit, Grigoleit, Jakeit, [[Klaus Wowereit|Wowereit]], Kukulat, Szameitat''.

Another type of Prussian Lithuanian surname use the suffixes "''-ies" or "''-us''": ''Kairies, Resgies, Baltßus, Karallus''.

A difference existed between female and male surnames in everyday speech. For example, while officially the wife of Kurschat (Prussian Lithuanian ''Kurßaitis'' or ''Kurßatis'') was also called Kurschat, in the Prussian Lithuanian language special forms were used in speech: the form of a wife's surname was Kurßaitê / Kurßatė and the form of an unmarried woman was Kurßaitikê / Kurßaitukê.

==Language==
Since the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, Prussian Lithuanians have typically been bilingual.&lt;ref name="Vareikis"/&gt;

===German===
The German language used by Prussian Lithuanians belongs to the [[Low Prussian]] dialect of [[Low German]], [[Mundart des Ostgebietes]] subdialect.

===Lithuanian===
The Lithuanian language of Prussian Lithuanians could be divided into two main dialects: [[Samogitian dialect]] and [[Aukštaitian dialect]]. The standard Prussian Lithuanian language is quite similar to standard Lithuanian except for the number of German [[loanword]]s. The Lithuanian language which was spoken in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  was influenced by [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], while in Prussia it was influenced more heavily by the German language. Thus, while Lithuanians used Slavic loanwords and translations, Prussian Lithuanians used German loanwords and translations, and some Slavic loanwords.

==Prussian Lithuanian literature==
[[Image:Pakajaus paslas 1884.jpg|thumb|301px|right|The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper ''Pakajaus Paſlas!: Lietuwos Brolams bei Seſerims Diewo-Ʒodi ir Surinkimus apſakas'' was published between 1881 and 1939.]]
Literature in the Lithuanian language appeared earlier in the [[Duchy of Prussia]] than in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The first book in Lithuanian was published in [[Königsberg]] in 1547 by [[Martynas Mažvydas]], an émigré from [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while the first Lithuanian book in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was printed in 1596 by [[Mikalojus Daukša]]. Many other authors who wrote in Lithuanian were not Prussian Lithuanians, but local Prussian Germans: Michael Märlin, Jakob Quandt, Wilhelm Martinius, Gottfried Ostermeyer, Sigfried Ostermeyer, [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], Andrew Krause, [[Philipp Ruhig]], Matttheus Praetorius, Christian Mielcke, Adam Schimmelpfennig, for example. The first major [[Lithuanian literature|Lithuanian poet]], Kristijonas Donelaitis, was from East Prussia and reflected the Prussian Lithuanian lifestyle in his works. The first newspaper in the Lithuanian language, ''Nuſidawimai apie Ewangēliôs Praſiplatinima tarp Źydû ir Pagonû'', was published by Prussian Lithuanians. Prior to [[World War I]], the government and political parties financed the Prussian Lithuanian press.

===Orthography===
The Prussian Lithuanian [[orthography]] was based on the German style, while in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania it was primarily based on the Polish style. Prussian Lithuanians used [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. Lithuanians did not read Prussian Lithuanian publications and vice versa; the cultural communication was very limited. Attempts to create a unified newspaper and common orthography for all Lithuanian speakers at the beginning of the 20th century were unsuccessful. After 1905, modern Lithuanian orthography was standardized while Prussian Lithuanian orthography remained the same – German Gothic script, a noun was begun with a capital letter, the letters [[Long s|ſ]], [[ß]], [[Ezh (letter)|ʒ]] were used, and the construction of sentences was different from Lithuanian.

Books and newspapers that were published in Lithuania in Roman type were reprinted in Gothic script in [[Memel Territory]] in 1923-39. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper ''Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis'' ({{lang-de|Neues Tilsiter Wanderer}}) was published in Tilsit in Gothic style until 1940, when it was closed by the Nazis.

'''Robert Baltovich''' (born July 17, 1965) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] man who was wrongly convicted in 1992 of the murder of his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bain, in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  He spent eight years in prison and nearly another decade trying to clear his name, before being found not guilty in a retrial on April 22, 2008.

== Elizabeth Bain murder ==

In 1990, Baltovich graduated with a degree in [[psychology]] and history from the [[University of Toronto at Scarborough]]. There he met fellow student Elizabeth Bain and a relationship developed.
Bain disappeared on June 19, 1990 after telling her mother she was going to "check the tennis schedule" on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat. Her body was never found.

== First trial and conviction ==

On November 19, 1990, Baltovich was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. His case continued in the courts for several years, during which he consistently maintained his innocence. His lawyers suggested that the so-called "Scarborough rapist" (the term used for the then unidentified serial killer [[Paul Bernardo]]) might be responsible for the murder.

On March 31, 1992, Baltovich was convicted of [[second-degree murder]]. His lawyers appealed and on March 31, 2000, Baltovich was released on bail, pending the outcome of his appeal.  In September 2004 his appeal was finally processed; once more his case gained national attention when his lawyers alleged that he had been wrongfully convicted and that Bernardo was guilty of Bain's murder. They pointed to circumstantial evidence suggesting links to Bernardo, evidence not available during Baltovich's original trial because Bernardo's identity as the "Scarborough rapist" was then unknown. Asked about the matter, Bernardo denied involvement in Bain's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=0r6sXHn1lko}} Police video interview of Bernardo re Bain&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal, retrial and acquittal ==

On December 2, 2004, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] set aside the conviction, delivering what news reports called "a scathing attack"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050715.wbalto0715/BNStory/National/ globeandmail.com: National&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the conduct of the original trial judge. This fell short of the acquittal that Baltovich's counsel had argued for. On July 15, 2005, Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, and remain free on bail in the meantime. During that time, Baltovich worked as a librarian for the Government of Ontario.

On March 31, 2008, jury selection began in the second-degree murder trial. The trial, slated to begin in Toronto on April 14, 2008, was delayed, with the Crown (prosecution) giving no reason.  When the trial resumed, the Crown declined to call any of the more than 50 witnesses they had planned, citing "recent developments, including the cumulative effect of the pre-trial evidentiary rulings rendered to date in this case, other evidentiary issues, and changes to case law".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/Crime/article/416997 TheStar.com | Crime | Baltovich acquitted of murder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/04/22/baltovich-trial.html 'I get to live the rest my life free': Baltovich acquitted&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Suit ==

In January 2010, the Attorney-General concluded that the payment of financial compensation was not appropriate.

On April 21, 2010, a civil suit alleging malicious prosecution, negligent investigation and negligent representation was filed on behalf of Baltovich. The defendants named include John McMahon, now a judge with the Superior Court of Ontario, and Paul Amenta, a practicing Crown Attorney in Toronto. Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould and Det. Sgt. Steve Reesor, the two lead detectives in the case, are also named as defendants.

In May 2014, Baltovich's lawyers applied to amend his statement of claim. Media reported that during examinations for discovery related to Baltovich's civil suit, previously undisclosed forensic evidence had surfaced indicating that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould had met with two forensic experts three days after Baltovich's arrest in November 1990 during which time he was told that the police theory of the crime - that Baltovich had killed Elizabeth Bain on June 19, 1990, hidden her body nearby in Colonel Danforth Park and that he had returned three days later to retrieve her body and drive it out of Scarborough in her car - was not supported by the forensic evidence found in Bain's car and that, according to Baltovich's lawyers, the theory presented at Baltovich's first trial was "flawed and untenable." It is also alleged that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould doctored his notes in an effort to conceal the existence of the meeting by removing pages referencing the meeting and replacing them with another page from his notes from a later date.

{{Religious text primary|date=October 2011}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Sariah''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"], LDS.org (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «sa-rī´a»&lt;/ref&gt; was the wife of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], and the mother of [[Laman and Lemuel|Laman]], [[Laman and Lemuel|Lemuel]], [[Sam (Book of Mormon)|Sam]], and [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Book of Mormon also mentions [[Jacob (Book of Mormon)|Jacob]], and [[Joseph (Book of Mormon)|Joseph]], two additional sons born to Lehi after his departure from Jerusalem, but does not explicitly name Sariah as their mother, though no other wife of Lehi is ever named.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1 Nephi 18:19 does make it fairly certain that sariah is their mother. She traveled with her husband from Jerusalem, into the wilderness, and eventually, across the ocean to the "promised land" (the [[Americas]]).  She is perhaps best known for the story in [[First Nephi]] where she complains against her husband for sending her sons back to Jerusalem.  She becomes convinced that they have perished in the desert, but is overjoyed upon their eventual return.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lehi's vision of the tree of life, Sariah eats the precious fruit, symbolizing that she is righteous and will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family tree==
As the wife of Lehi, and the mother of Nephi and Laman (who went on to establish the nations of the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s), Sariah can be considered one of the principal ancestors of the ''Book of Mormon'' people.  Her immediate family is shown in the diagram below.

==Etymology==
Among [[Latter Day Saints|LDS]] [[linguistics|linguists]], prevalent consensus of the reading of the name "Sariah" is שׂריה ''Śaryāh'' ("princess of [[Tetragrammaton|Jehovah]]"), and an alternative voicing of the name [[Seraiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fronk|first=Camille|title=Desert Epiphany: Sariah and the Women in 1 Nephi|url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=9&amp;num=2&amp;id=222|publisher=Neal A.

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Sariah was portrayed by [[Jan Broberg Felt]]. The portrayal was highly influenced by [[Arnold Friberg]] paintings of the characters.

[[File:Sir William Congreve, 2nd Bt by James Lonsdale.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir William Congreve, 2nd Bt, by James Lonsdale (died 1839)]]
'''Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet''' [[Royal Guelphic Order|KCH]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (20 May 1772 – 16 May 1828) was an [[England|English]] [[inventor]] and [[rocket artillery]] pioneer distinguished for his development and deployment of [[Congreve rocket]]s, and a [[Tory Party (UK)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP).

==Biography==
He was son of [[Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet|Lt. General Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet]], the Comptroller of the Royal Laboratories at the [[Royal Arsenal]] and raised in [[Kent]], [[England]]. He was educated at [[Newcome's school]] in Hackney, [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]] and [[Singlewell School]] in Kent. He then studied law at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1793 and MA in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Venn recorded these educational details for a William Congreve, but without identifying him with his "illustrious contemporary namesake", the inventor. {{acad|id=CNGV788W|name=Congreve, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 he succeeded his father as second Baronet Congreve.

In 1803 he was a volunteer in the London and Westminster Light Horse, and was a London businessman who published a polemical newspaper, the ''Royal Standard and Political Register'', which was [[Tory]], pro-government and anti-[[William Cobbett|Cobbett]]. Following a damaging libel action against it in 1804, Congreve withdrew from publishing and applied himself to inventing. Many years previously, several unsuccessful experiments had been made at the Royal Laboratory in Woolwich  by Lt. General [[Thomas Desaguliers]].

Congreve was awarded the honorary rank of  [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] army's artillery in 1811, and was often referred to as "Colonel Congreve", later made [[major general]] in the same army.&lt;ref name=odnb1 /&gt;  He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27congreve%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= [[Royal Society]]| accessdate= 23 December 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was also awarded the [[Order of St. George]] following the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813&lt;ref name=odnb1 /&gt; and 1816 he was made [[Royal Guelphic Order|Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH)]].&lt;ref name=odnb2&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 12|page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1821 he was awarded the [[Order of the Sword]] by the King of Sweden.&lt;ref name=odnb2 /&gt;

He enjoyed the friendship of the [[George IV of Great Britain|Prince Regent]], in whose household he served as an equerry from 1811, carrying on the service when the Prince, who supported his rocket projects, became King George IV in 1820.&lt;ref name=odnb1 /&gt;

Earlier in 1812 he offered to contest for Parliament the borough of [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] but withdrew before polling for lack of support.  He entered Parliament later that year when he was nominated as MP for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Gatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Gatton]] in 1812, but withdrew at the next elections in 1814 in favour of the son of the borough's proprietor Sir Mark Wood.&lt;ref name=odnb1 /&gt; In 1818 he was returned as Member for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]], a seat he held until his death.&lt;ref name=odnb2 /&gt;

After living with a mistress and fathering two illegitimate sons, he married in December 1824, at Wessel, [[Prussia]], Isabella Carvalho (or Charlotte), a young woman of Portuguese descent and widow of Henry Nisbett McEvoy. They had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=odnb2 /&gt;

In later years he became a businessman and was chairman of the Equitable Loan Bank, director of the Arigna Iron and Coal Company, the Palladium Insurance Company and the Peruvian Mining Company. After a major fraud case began against him in 1826 in connection with the Arigna company, he fled to France, where he was taken seriously ill.  He was prosecuted in his absence, the [[Lord Chancellor of England|Lord Chancellor]] ultimately ruling, just before Congreve's death, that the transaction was 'clearly fraudlent' and designed to profit Congreve and others.&lt;ref name=odnb2 /&gt;

He died in [[Toulouse]], France, in May 1828, aged 55, and was buried there in the Protestant and Jewish cemetery of Chemin du Béarnais.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.persee.fr/doc/anami_0003-4398_1969_num_81_94_4628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congreve Rockets==
{{main|Congreve rocket}}
[[File:Congreve rocket img 2950.jpg|thumb|Tip of a Congreve rocket, on display at Paris naval museum]]

[[Mysorean rockets]] were the first [[iron]]-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. [[Hyder Ali]], the 18th century ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] and his son and successor [[Tipu Sultan]] used them effectively against the [[British East India Company]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], beginning in 1780 with the [[Battle of Pollilur (1780)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tipu's missile launch pad in shambles|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/23/stories/2005062310360300.htm|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 June 2005|location=Karnataka, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In battles at [[Seringapatam]] in [[Siege of Seringapatam (1792)|1792]] and [[Battle of Seringapatam|1799]] these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.&lt;ref name=r&amp;ms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357360/rocket-and-missile-system/|title=Rocket and missile system|author1=Frederick C. Durant III |author2=Stephen Oliver Fought |author3=John F. Guilmartin, Jr. |date= |work= |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian rocket experiences, mentioned in Munro's book of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Baker D (1978)
''The Rocket'', New Cavendish Books, London&lt;/ref&gt; eventually led to the [[Royal Arsenal]] beginning a military rocket [[R&amp;D]] program in 1801. Several rocket cases were collected from Mysore and sent to Britain for analysis. The development was chiefly the work of William Congreve, who set up a research and development programme at the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]]'s laboratory.  After development work was complete the rockets were manufactured in quantity further north, near [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Waltham Abbey, Essex]]. He was told that "the British at Seringapatam had suffered more from the rockets than from the shells or any other weapon used by the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Von Braun W, Ordway III F. I. ''History of rocketry and space travel'', Nelson&lt;/ref&gt; "In at least one instance", an eye-witness told Congreve, "a single rocket had killed three men and badly wounded others."&lt;ref&gt;Ley E (1958). ''Rockets, missiles, and space travel'', Chapman &amp; Hall, London&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Congreve may have adapted [[iron]]-cased [[gunpowder]] rockets for use by the British military from prototypes created by the Irish nationalist [[Robert Emmet]] during Emmet's Rebellion in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick M. Geoghegan(2003) ''Robert Emmet: a life'', p.107,  McGill-Queens University Press, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; But this seems far less likely given the fact that the British had been exposed to Indian rockets since 1780 at the latest, and that a vast quantity of unused rockets and their construction equipment fell into British hands at the end of the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] in 1799, 4 years before Emmet's rockets.

Congreve first demonstrated solid fuel rockets at the Royal Arsenal in 1805. He considered his work sufficiently advanced to engage in two [[Royal Navy]] attacks on the French fleet at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]], one that year and one the next. In 1807 Congreve and sixteen Ordnance Department civilian employees were present at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Bombardment of Copenhagen]], during which 300 rockets contributed to the conflagration of the city.&lt;ref&gt;The First Golden Age of Rocketry, p21&lt;/ref&gt;

Congreve rockets were successfully used for the remainder of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the most celebrated employment of the weapon being at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The "rockets' red glare" in the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American national anthem]] describes their firing at [[Fort McHenry]] during the [[War of 1812]]. In January 1814 the Royal Artillery absorbed the various companies armed with rockets into two Rocket Troops within the Royal Horse Artillery. They remained in the arsenal of the United Kingdom until the 1850s. Congreve organized the impressive firework displays in London for the peace of 1814 and for the coronation of George IV in 1821.

==Other inventions==
Besides his rockets, Congreve was a prolific (if indifferently successful) [[inventor]] for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;He registered 18 patents, of which 2 were for rockets&lt;/ref&gt; Congreve invented a [[gun]]-[[recoil]] mounting, a [[time bomb|time]]-[[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]], a rocket [[parachute]] attachment, a [[Canal lock#Hydro-pneumatic canal lift|hydropneumatic canal lock]]  (installed at [[Camden Lock|Hampstead Road Lock]], north London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sir William Congreve's Hydro-pneumatic Lock|journal=[[The New Monthly Magazine]]|date=1 August 1815|volume=4|issue=19|pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[sluice]] (1813), a [[perpetual motion machine]], a process of [[colour printing]] (1821) which was widely used in [[Germany]], a new form of [[steam engine]], and a method of consuming [[smoke]] (which was applied at the [[Royal Arsenal|Royal Laboratory]]). He also took out [[patent]]s for a [[Congreve clock|clock]] in which time was measured by a [[ball]] rolling along a [[zigzag|zig-zag]] track on an [[Inclined plane|inclined]] [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]; for protecting [[building]]s against [[fire]]; inlaying and combining [[metal]]s; un[[forgery|forge]]able [[bank note]] [[paper]]; a method of killing [[whale]]s by means of rockets; improvements in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]]; [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype plate]]s; [[firework]]s; and [[gas meter]]s. Congreve was named as comptroller of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich from 1814 until his death. (Congreve's father [[Sir William Congreve]] had also held the same post.)

Congreve's unsuccessful perpetual motion scheme involved an endless band which should raise more water by its [[capillary action]] on one side than on the other.  He used capillary action of fluids that would disobey the law of never rising above their own level, so to produce a continual ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over [[pulley]]s. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of [[sponge]], a bed, and, over this, again an endless band of heavy [[weight]]s jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still [[water]]. The capillary action raised the water, whereas the same thing could not happen in the part, since the weights would squeeze the water out. Hence, it was heavier than the other; but as "we know that if it were the same weight, there would be [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]], if the heavy chain be also [[uniform]]". Therefore, the extra weight of it would cause the chain to move round in the direction of the arrow, and this would go on, supposedly, continually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perpetual Motion |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/perpetual-motion-1911-11-18/ |website=scientificamerican.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In 1804 Congreve published ''A concise account of the origin and progress of the rocket system''.  Publication of ''A Concise Account of the Origin and Progress of the Rocket System'' by William Congreve was in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Congreve, William (1772-1828)|display=Congreve, William (1772–1828)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814 Congreve published ''The details of the rocket system''. In 1827 ''The Congreve Rocket System'' was published in London. His other publications were: ''An Elementary Treatise on the Mounting of Naval Ordnance'' (1812); ''A Description of the Hydropneumatical Lock'' (1815); ''A New Principle of Steam-Engine'' (1819); ''Resumption of Cash Payments'' (1819) and ''Systems of Currency'' (1819).

'''Sundar Rao Nadkarni''' was an Indian film actor, editor, cinematographer, producer and director. He was the director of the record-creating Tamil film ''[[Haridas (1944 film)|Haridas]]''.

== Early life ==

Sundar Rao Nadkarni was born in [[Mangalore]] in a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] speaking family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=e07vBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nadkarni%20marathi&amp;f=false|title=PRIDE OF TAMIL CINEMA: 1931 TO 2013: Tamil Films that have earned National and International Recognition|last=Dhananjayan|first=G.|date=2014-11-03|publisher=Blue Ocean Publishers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career in [[Bangalore]] as an actor in silent films produced by Surya Films. Later, he moved to [[Bombay]] where he took to film direction and editing. Nadkarni caught the eye of film producer [[Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar]] who, after the success of ''[[Sabapathy (1941 film)|Sabhapathy]]'', was looking to make another comedy film. Thereon, he moved to Coimbatore and finally Madras, where he settled down permanently.

In 1942, Nadkarni directed the Tamil film ''[[En Manaivi]]'' which was a hit. Following this success, Nadkarni also made other successful Tamil films. But his greatest hit was the 1944 film ''Haridas'' which set a record by becoming the first Tamil film to run for 110 weeks at a single theatre. He directed all the top Tamil actors during his active years, notably M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar and T. R. Rajakumari in ''Haridas'' (1944), Narsimha Bharathi in ''Krishna Vijayam'' (1950), and MGR and Savitri in ''Mahadevi'' (1957).

'''George Thomas Seaver''' (born November 17, 1944), nicknamed '''Tom Terrific''' and '''The Franchise''', is a retired [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]]. He pitched from 1967 to 1986 for four teams, but is noted primarily for his time with the [[New York Mets]] and especially for his important role in the team's 1969 World Championship. During a 20-year career, Seaver compiled 311 [[win (baseball statistics)|wins]], 3,640 [[strikeout]]s, 61 [[shutouts in baseball|shutouts]] and a 2.86 [[earned run average]]. In {{Baseball year|1992}}, he was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the highest percentage of votes ever recorded at the time (98.84%; subsequently surpassed in 2016 by [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] with 99.32%), and is one of two players (with [[Mike Piazza]]) wearing a New York Mets hat on his plaque in the Hall of Fame. As of 2016, Seaver, Mike Piazza and [[Gil Hodges]] (who played for the [[Expansion team|expansion]] Mets in 1962–63) are the only Mets players to have their jersey numbers retired by the team (Hodges' number was retired as a manager even though he also played for the Mets).

He won the [[National League]] [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1967, and he received three NL [[Cy Young Award]]s as the league's best pitcher. Seaver is the Mets' all-time leader in wins, and he is considered by many baseball experts to be one of the best [[starting pitcher]]s in the history of baseball.

==Early life==
Seaver was born in [[Fresno, California]], to Betty Lee (Cline) and Charles Henry Seaver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/seaver.htm Baseball Hall Of Fame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Pitching for [[Fresno High School]], Seaver compensated for his lack of size and strength by developing great control on the mound. Despite being an All-City [[basketball]] player, he hoped to play baseball in college.

He joined the [[United States Marine Corps Reserves]] on June 28, 1962. He served with [[Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms|AIRFMFPAC 29 Palms, California]] through July {{Baseball year|1963}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmc-mccs.org/sports/hof/2003-seaver.cfm Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame], Retrieved July 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After six months of active duty in the Reserves, Seaver enrolled at [[Fresno City College]].

In anticipation of the following season, he was recruited to pitch for the [[University of Southern California]] by legendary Trojan coach [[Rod Dedeaux]].  Unsure as to whether Seaver was worthy of a scholarship, he was sent to pitch for the [[Alaska Goldpanners]] of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], in 1964. After a stellar season – in which he pitched and won a game in the national tournament with a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] – he was awarded a scholarship to USC. As a sophomore, Seaver posted a 10–2 record, and he was drafted in the tenth round of the [[1965 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].  When Seaver asked for $70,000, however, the Dodgers passed.&lt;ref name="Golenbock 2002 187"&gt;{{cite book|last=Golenbock|first=Peter|title=Amazin': The Miraculous History of New York's most Beloved Baseball Team|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2002|location=New York|pages=187|isbn=0-312-30992-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, he signed a contract with the [[Atlanta Braves]], who had drafted him in the first round of the secondary June draft (20th overall). However, the contract was voided by [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[William Eckert]] because his college team had played two exhibition games that year (although Seaver himself hadn't played). Seaver intended, then, to finish the college season, but because he had signed a pro contract, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] ruled him ineligible. After Seaver's father complained to Eckert about the unfairness of the situation, and threatened with a lawsuit, Eckert ruled that other teams could match the Braves' offer.&lt;ref name="Golenbock 2002 187"/&gt;  The Mets were subsequently awarded his signing rights in a lottery drawing among the three teams (the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Cleveland Indians]] being the two others) that were willing to match the Braves' terms.

==Professional playing career==

===New York Mets===

====Rookie of the Year====
Seaver spent one season with the [[Jacksonville Suns]] of the [[International League]], then joined the New York Mets in 1967. He won 16 games for the last-place Mets, with 18 complete games, 170 strikeouts, and a 2.76 ERA, all Mets records to that point, and was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He was also named to the [[1967 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1967 All-Star Game]], and got the save by pitching a scoreless 15th inning. In {{mlby|1968}}, he won 16 games again, and recorded over 200 strikeouts for the first of nine consecutive seasons, but the Mets moved up only one spot in the standings, to ninth.

====1969 championship season====
In {{mlby|1969}}, Seaver and the [[1969 New York Mets season|Mets]] won their first [[1969 World Series|World Series]] championship. Seaver won a league-high 25 games and his first National League Cy Young Award. He also finished runner-up to [[Willie McCovey]] for the League's Most Valuable Player Award.

In front of a crowd of over 59,000 at New York's [[Shea Stadium]] on July 9, Seaver threw {{frac|8|1|3}} perfect innings against the division-leading [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]. Rookie backup outfielder [[Jim Qualls|Jimmy Qualls]] broke up Seaver's bid for a [[perfect game]] when he lined a clean single to left field.

In the first-ever [[1969 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] game, Seaver outlasted [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]]'s [[Phil Niekro]] for a sloppy 9-5 victory. Seaver was also the starter for the Mets' first [[World Series]] game, but lost a 4-1 decision to the [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]]' [[Mike Cuellar]]. Seaver then pitched a 10-inning complete game for a 2-1 win in Game Four to put the Mets on the cusp of their first championship.

At year's end, Seaver was presented with the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of the year and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hickock Belt Tom Seaver|url=http://hickokbelt.com/winners/past-winners/winners/tom-seaver/|work=Hickokbelt.com|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leggett|first=William|title=TOM SEAVER – 12.22.69|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1083193/index.htm?eref=sisf|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=December 22, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continued excellence====
On April 22, {{mlby|1970}}, Seaver set a major league record by striking out the final 10 batters of the game in a 2-1 victory over the [[1970 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] at [[Shea Stadium]]. Al Ferrara, who had homered in the second inning for the Padres' run, was the final strikeout victim of the game. In addition to his 10 consecutive strikeouts, Seaver tied [[Steve Carlton]]'s major league record, at the time, with 19 strikeouts in a nine-inning game,.&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN197004220.shtml Box Score of 19-strikeout game, April 22, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mets also won the game in which Carlton struck out 19, with Carlton victimized by Ron Swoboda's pair of 2-run homers in a 4–3 Mets victory in St. Louis on September 15, 1969. (The record was later eclipsed by 20-strikeout games by [[Kerry Wood]], [[Randy Johnson]], [[Max Scherzer]], and twice by [[Roger Clemens]].)  By mid-August, Seaver's record stood at 17-6 and he seemed well on his way to a second consecutive 20-victory season.  But he only won one of his last ten starts, including four on short rest, to finish 18-12. Nonetheless, Seaver led the National League in both ERA and strikeouts.

[[File:Tom Seaver at Shea Stadium 1974 CROP.jpg|thumb|200px|Seaver at [[Shea Stadium]], 1974.]]
The {{mlby|1971}} season was arguably Seaver's finest year, when he led the league in ERA (1.76) and strikeouts (289 in 286 innings) while going 20–10. However, he finished second in the Cy Young balloting to [[Ferguson Jenkins]] of the Chicago Cubs, due to Jenkins' league-leading 24 wins, 325 innings pitched, and exceptional control numbers. Seaver himself has said that 1971 was his best season.

Seaver had four more twenty-win seasons (20 in {{mlby|1971}}, 21 in {{mlby|1972}}, 22 in 1975, and 21 in {{mlby|1977}}) (7 wins for the Mets, then 14 more after being traded to the Reds). He won two more Cy Young Awards ({{mlby|1973}} and 1975, both with the Mets).

During his tenure with the Mets, Seaver made 108 starts in which he pitched 9 or more innings and allowed 1 run or less. His record in those starts is 93-3 with 12 no-decisions. In seven of the 12 no-decisions, he pitched 10 or more innings. In the 12 no-decisions, he pitched a total of 117 innings, allowing 56 hits and 5 earned runs, compiling a 0.38 ERA.

Between 1970 and 1976, Seaver led the [[National League]] in strikeouts five of the seven seasons, finishing second in {{mlby|1972}} and third in {{mlby|1974}}. Seaver also won three ERA titles as a Met. Two famous quotes about Seaver are attributed to [[Reggie Jackson]]: "Blind men come to the park just to hear him pitch." The second was that, while pitching for the Mets during the 1973 World series, 6th game, with the Mets up 3 games to 2, and so poised to win their second Championship, with Mr. Seaver scheduled to start. He did, but did not have his "arm" that day, his arm strength, that is, and the opposing team knew it.  Seaver would go on to start and lose the 6th game... Mr. Jackson is reported to have said "Seaver pitched with his heart that day." Seaver was perhaps the foremost latter-day exponent of "drop and drive" overhand delivery, but his powerful legs protected his arm, and ensured his longevity. Seaver was frequently compared to fellow Hall of Fame pitcher [[Christy Mathewson]].

====Midnight Massacre====
By 1977, [[Free agent|free agency]] had begun and contract negotiations between Mets ownership and Seaver were not going well. Seaver wanted to renegotiate his contract to bring his salary in line with what other top pitchers were making, but chairman of the board [[M. Donald Grant]], who by this time had been given [[wikt:carte blanche|carte blanche]] by Met management to do what he wished, refused to budge. Longtime ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]] regularly wrote negative columns about Seaver's "greedy" demands. As for Seaver, he attempted to resolve the impasse by going to then-team owner Lorinda de Roulet, who along with then-GM Joe McDonald, had negotiated in principle a three-year contract extension by mid-June. But before the contract could be signed, Young wrote an unattributed story in the Daily News claiming that Seaver was being goaded by his wife to ask for more money because she was jealous of the fact that [[Nolan Ryan]] was making more money with the [[California Angels]]. Upon being informed of the story, Seaver informed de Roulet that he immediately wanted out, and asked McDonald to immediately trade him, feeling that he could not co-exist with M. Donald Grant.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/2007/06/17/2007-06-17_the_true_story_of_the_midnight_massacre-1.html?print=1&amp;page=all|title=The true story of The Midnight Massacre – How Tom Seaver was run out of town 30 years ago|author=Madden, Bill|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of two trades that New York's sports reporters dubbed "the Midnight Massacre" (the other involved struggling outfielder [[Dave Kingman]]),  Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on June 15, {{mlby|1977}} (the trading deadline for that year) for pitcher [[Pat Zachry]], [[minor league]] outfielder [[Steve Henderson (baseball)|Steve Henderson]], infielder [[Doug Flynn]], and [[minor league]] outfielder [[Dan Norman]]. Seaver would go 14-3 with [[1977 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] and win 21 games that season, including an emotional 5-1 win over the Mets in his return to Shea Stadium.  Seaver struck out 11 in the return, and also hit a double. Seaver, who was immensely popular in New York, also received a lengthy ovation at the [[1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1977 All-Star Game]], which was held in New York's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].  His departure from New York sparked sustained negative fan reaction, as the Mets became the league's worst team, finishing in last place the next 3 seasons. Combined with the Yankees' resurgence in the market, attendance dipped in {{mlby|1978}}, and plunged in {{mlby|1979}} to 9,740 per game. M. Donald Grant was fired after the [[1978 New York Mets season|1978 season]], and Joe McDonald was fired after the [[1979 New York Mets season|1979 season]] following a sale of the team to publishing magnate [[Nelson Doubleday, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/metsattn.shtml New York Mets Attendance Records by Baseball Almanac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a sardonic nod to the general manager, Shea Stadium acquired the nickname "[[Grant's Tomb]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/sports/baseball/18cheer.html|title=Recalling the Time of the Signs at Shea|author=Mallozzi, Vincent M.|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=June 18, 2006|accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cincinnati Reds===
After having thrown five one-hitters for the Mets, including two games in which no-hit bids were broken up in the ninth inning, Seaver recorded a 4-0 [[no-hitter]] against the [[1978 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] on June 16, 1978 at [[Riverfront Stadium]]. It was the only no-hitter of his professional career.

Seaver was 75-46 in Cincinnati.  He led the Cincinnati pitching staff in 1979, when the Reds won the Western Division, and again in the strike-shortened 1981 season, when the Reds had the best record in the major leagues.  In the latter season, Seaver, with his sterling 14-2 performance, was a close runner-up to [[Fernando Valenzuela]] for the {{Baseball year|1981}} Cy Young Award. (Seaver had finished third and fourth in two other previous years.)  In 1981, during one of his 2 losses, Seaver recorded his 3,000th strikeout.  After recording his 3000th, he took himself out of the game, walking off the mound to a standing ovation. He suffered through an injury-ridden {{Baseball year|1982}} campaign, finishing 5-13.

===Return to New York===
On December 16, 1982, Seaver was traded back to the Mets, for [[Charlie Puleo]], [[Lloyd McClendon]], and [[Jason Felice]]. On April 5, {{Baseball year|1983}}, he tied [[Walter Johnson]]'s major league record of 14 Opening Day starts, shutting out the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for six innings in a 2-0 Mets win. (He made two more such starts with the [[Chicago White Sox]] in {{mlby|1985}} and {{mlby|1986}} for a record total of 16 opening day assignments.) Despite a 9-14 record that season, Seaver had high expectations going into {{mlby|1984}} and intended to finish his career where he started it.

===300 wins===
Seaver and the Mets were stunned on January 20, 1984 when he was claimed in a free-agent compensation draft by the Chicago White Sox. The team (especially GM [[Frank Cashen]]) had incorrectly assumed that no one would pursue a high-salaried, 39-year-old starting pitcher, and left him off the protected list. Faced with either reporting to the White Sox or retiring, Seaver chose the former. The result for the Mets was an opening in the starting rotation that allowed [[Dwight Gooden]] to be part of the team.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Seaver pitched two and a half seasons in Chicago and recorded his last [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] on July 19, [[1985 Chicago White Sox season|1985]] against the visiting [[1985 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]]. In an anomaly, Seaver won two games on May 9, 1984; he pitched the 25th and final inning of a game suspended the day before, picking up the win in [[relief pitcher|relief]] against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], before starting and winning the day's regularly scheduled game, also facing the Brewers.

After Seaver's 298th win, a reporter had pointed out to White Sox catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] that following his upcoming start in [[1985 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]], Seaver's next scheduled start would be in New York, and that the possibility existed that he might achieve the mark there. Fisk emphatically stated that Seaver ''would'' win in Boston, and then ''would'' win his 300th.

On August 4, 1985, Seaver recorded his 300th victory at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] against the [[1985 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], throwing a complete game 4-1 victory. [[Don Baylor]] was the tying run at the plate; he hit a fly ball to left field for the final out of the game.  Coincidentally, it was [[Phil Rizzuto]] Day &amp;ndash; Seaver would later become Rizzuto's broadcast partner for Yankee games. [[Lindsey Nelson]], a Mets radio and TV announcer during Seaver's Mets days, called the final out for Yankees TV flagship [[WPIX]].

===Final season===
Late in 1985, his next-to-last season, Seaver almost returned to the Mets, as general manager Frank Cashen was poised to make a late-season trade. However, manager [[Davey Johnson]] vetoed the idea, and Seaver instead ended his career with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|1986]] after being traded for [[Steve Lyons (baseball)|Steve Lyons]] in mid-season. Seaver's 311th and last win came on August 18, 1986 against the [[1986 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. At the time of his retirement, Seaver was third on the all-time strikeout list (3,640), trailing only [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Steve Carlton]]. No major league pitcher has ever matched his feat of striking out ten consecutive batters.&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com" /&gt; His career average of 6.85 strikeouts per nine innings is fourth only to Steve Carlton (7.1), Nolan Ryan (9.55), and Randy Johnson (10.6) of any Hall of Famer with at least 300 wins. Seaver's lifetime ERA of 2.86 was third among starting pitchers in the [[live-ball era]], behind only [[Whitey Ford]] (2.73) and [[Sandy Koufax]] (2.76). ([[Jim Palmer]] and [[Andy Messersmith]] both have a career [[earned run average]] of 2.86 as well.) Seaver also holds the record for consecutive 200-strike-out seasons with nine (1968–1976).  Seaver's 61 career shutouts are second only to Warren Spahn (63) in the live-ball era.  His career [[win–loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] percentage of .603 is one of the highest of any Hall of Fame pitcher with 300 wins in the live-ball era, and his record of 7.84 hits per nine innings is second only to [[Nolan Ryan]] (6.56) for all Hall of Fame pitchers with at least three hundred wins, and first among all HOF pitchers in any era with 300 wins, 3000 strikeouts, and a winning percentage of .600 or better. A knee injury prevented him from appearing against the Mets in the [[1986 World Series]] between the Mets and Red Sox, but Seaver received among the loudest ovations during player introductions prior to Game 1. Roger Clemens attributes the time he shared with Seaver as 1986 Red Sox teammates as instrumental in helping him make the transition from thrower to pitcher. The Red Sox did not offer Seaver a contract to his liking for the {{mlby|1987}} season. His 1986 salary was $1 million; the Red Sox offered $500,000, which Seaver declined. When no new contract agreement was reached, Seaver was granted free agency on November 12, 1986.

In 1987, the [[1987 New York Mets season|Mets]] starting rotation was decimated by injury and they sought help from Seaver. Though no actual contract was signed, Seaver joined the club on June 6, and was hit hard in an exhibition game against the Triple-A [[Tidewater Tides]] on June 11. After similar poor outings on the 16th &amp; 20th, he announced his retirement, saying, ''"I've used up all the competitive pitches in my arm!"'' The Mets retired his uniform number 41 in {{mlby|1988}} in a special Tom Seaver Day ceremony. As of 2017, Seaver and Mike Piazza remain the only Met players to have their uniform numbers retired. [[Casey Stengel]] and [[Gil Hodges]] had their numbers retired as Met managers, and Jackie Robinson had his number retired by all teams. Their numbers—14 (Hodges), 31 (Piazza), 37 (Stengel), 41 (Seaver), and 42 (Jackie Robinson)—were posted in large numerals on the outfield fence at Shea Stadium (except Piazza, whose number 31 was retired in 2016), and are posted on the left field corner overhang at Citi Field. He is one of only two pitchers (the other being Walter Johnson) to have 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts, and an under 3.00 ERA.

|Image  = TomSeaverMets.svg
|Name   = Tom Seaver

|Team   = New York Mets
|Year   = 1988
|}}
Seaver was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on January 7, [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1992|1992]]. At the time he received the highest percentage of votes with 98.84% (on 425 of 430). [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] had 437 of 440, which got him a 99.3%, which superseded both Seaver's vote total and percentage. It leaves both men higher than the likes of [[Nolan Ryan]]'s 98.79% (491 of 497), and [[Ty Cobb]]'s 98.23% (222 of 226), among all others. Three of the five ballots that had omitted Seaver were blank, cast by writers protesting the Hall's decision to make [[Pete Rose]] ineligible for consideration. One ballot was sent by a writer who was recovering from open-heart surgery and failed to notice Seaver's name. The fifth "no" vote was cast by a writer who said he never voted for any player in their first year of eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2006-12-21-bodley-ripken-hall_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Ripken is a 100% Hall of Famer |date=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seaver is one of two players enshrined in the Hall of Fame with a Mets cap on his plaque, along with [[Mike Piazza]]. He was also inducted into the [[New York Mets Hall of Fame]] in 1988, the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and the [[Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

[[File:Tom Seaver's Last Pitch.jpg|thumb|245px|Seaver throws the [[ceremonial first pitch]] before the final game at [[Shea Stadium]] – September 28, 2008]]
In 1999, Seaver ranked 32nd on ''[[The Sporting News]]''{{'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the only player to have spent a majority of his career with the Mets to make the list. That year, he was also a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball]] [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team|All-Century Team]]. Baseball purists often compare him to Christy Mathewson for his combination of raw power, pinpoint control, intelligence, and intense scrutiny of his performance. Seaver was the foremost latter-day exponent of "drop and drive" overhand delivery that utilitized his powerful legs, took strain off of his arm, and helped ensure his longevity. He always credited the training he received in the Mets organization, citing the long careers of teammates Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan and Tug McGraw as further proof. Seaver could also help himself at the plate. A decent hitter and proficient bunter, Seaver hit 12 home runs during his career, along with a relatively solid lifetime average for a pitcher of .154.

[[Hank Aaron]] stated that Seaver was the toughest pitcher he ever faced.  Seaver approached Aaron before his first All-Star Game in 1967 and asked Aaron for his autograph. Seaver felt the need to introduce himself to Aaron, as he was certain "Hammerin' Hank" would not know who he was. Aaron replied to Seaver, "Kid, I know who you are, and before your career is over, I guarantee you everyone in this stadium will, too."

On September 28, 2006, Seaver was chosen as the "Hometown Hero" for the Mets franchise by ESPN. Seaver made a return to Shea Stadium during the "Shea Goodbye" closing ceremony on September 28, 2008, where he threw out the final pitch in the history of the stadium to [[Mike Piazza]]. He and Piazza then opened the Mets' new home, [[Citi Field]] with the [[ceremonial first pitch]] on April 13, 2009.

The [[2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] was dedicated to Seaver.  He concluded the introduction of the starting lineup ceremonies by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. Mets player [[David Wright]] participated.

==Broadcasting career==
Since his retirement as a player, Seaver has sometimes been a television [[color commentator]], working variously for the Mets, the [[New York Yankees]], and with [[Vin Scully]] in {{Baseball year|1989}} for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]. Seaver replaced [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC plans innovative ways to fill baseball void|date=January 31, 1989|first=Rudy|last=Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; as NBC's lead baseball color commentator, which led to him calling the [[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989 All-Star Game]] and [[1989 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. He worked as an analyst for Yankees' telecasts on [[WPIX]] from [[1989 New York Yankees season|1989]] to [[1993 New York Yankees season|1993]] and for Mets telecasts on WPIX from [[1999 New York Mets season|1999]] to [[2005 New York Mets season|2005]], making him one of three sportscasters to be regular announcers for both teams; the others are [[Fran Healy (baseball)|Fran Healy]] and [[Tim McCarver]]. He has also worked as a part-time scout, and as a [[spring training]] pitching coach. Seaver's TV experience dates back to his playing career, when he was invited to serve as a [[World Series]] analyst for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] in {{wsy|1977}} and for NBC in {{wsy|1978}}, {{wsy|1980}}, and {{wsy|1982}}. Also while an active player, Seaver called the [[1981 National League Division Series]] between [[1981 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] and [[1981 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia]] and that years's [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] alongside [[Dick Enberg]] for NBC.

==Personal life and health==
Seaver married Nancy Lynn McIntyre on June 9, 1966. They are parents of two daughters, Sarah and Annie. They live in [[Calistoga, California]], where he started his own {{convert|3.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} vineyard, Seaver Family Vineyards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.seavervineyards.com/index |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916070642/https://www.seavervineyards.com/index |archive-date=2015-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on his {{convert|116|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/dining/28seav.html |work=The New York Times |title=Warming Up in the Vineyard, Tom Terrific |first=Eric |last=Asimov |date=December 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first vintage was produced in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindbloom |first=John |title=St. Helena gets a taste of Seaver and Sinatra |journal=[[St. Helena Star]] |location=Napa, California |date=August 26, 2010 |url=http://napavalleyregister.com/star/business/st-helena-gets-a-taste-of-seaver-and-sinatra/article_0bcc08a9-c1b7-5b4b-b3ff-5e5d3aae92ec.html |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=Marty |title=Tom's terrific life after baseball |journal=[[Napa Valley Register]] |location=Napa, California |date=October 8, 2009 |url=http://napavalleyregister.com/calistogan/sports/tom-s-terrific-life-after-baseball/article_1cd6a4b7-4daa-5294-97b3-810e20721b30.html |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madden |first=Bill |title=Mets legend Tom Seaver says pitchers should 'learn to pitch' or they won't age well |journal=[[New York Daily News]] |location=Calistoga, California |date=May 26, 2017 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-legend-tom-seaver-advice-power-pitchers-article-1.3197263 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his two cabernets, "Nancy's Fancy" and "GTS", in an April 2010 wine-tasting event in [[SoHo]] to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/seavers-tales-of-wine-and-roses/ |work=The New York Times |first=Ken |last=Belson |date=April 26, 2010 |title=Seaver's Tales of Wine and Roses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His media nickname referred to the cartoon character [[Tom Terrific]].

In 1991, Seaver was diagnosed with [[Lyme disease]], which caused [[Bell's palsy]]. After lying dormant in his system the disease reoccurred in 2012. Seaver suffered from loss of memory not even remembering long term acquaintances, "sleep disorder, nausea, and a general overall feeling of chemical imbalance". In January 2013 Seaver was diagnosed with Stage 3 of the disease. As of July 2013, after a treatment regimen of mostly vitamins, Seaver was feeling much better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/madden-tom-nearing-terrific-day-mets-legend-winning-battle-lyme-disease-article-1.1289293#ixzz2ZMsDLxA7NY Mets great and Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver feeling better, winning his battle with Lyme disease] ''New York Daily News'' March 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/madden-mets-legend-seaver-set-all-star-game-pitch-article-1.1394430#ixzz2ZMpSpRN3 At 2013 MLB All-Star Game, Mets legend Tom Seaver, fighting back from Lyme disease and memory loss, ready for pitch] ''New York Daily News'' July 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to former teammate [[Bud Harrelson]], Seaver has "some short term memory loss but is otherwise doing well."&lt;ref name=40yearstrade&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/40-years-ago-the-mets-did-the-unthinkable-they-traded-tom-seaver-1.13725886 40 years ago, the Mets did the unthinkable: They traded Tom Seaver] ''Newsday'' June 10,2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">'''William A. Mathews''' (1800–1856) was a 19th-century Texas colonist, soldier, courier and quartermaster in the [[Texas Revolution]].

==Early life and family==
Mathews sometimes spelled Matthews, was born in Vermont in 1800. At the age of seventeen, he would join with [[Green DeWitt]] at Missouri. In 1824, he would assist DeWitt when traveling to Texas, bringing in families and settling near Gonzales, Texas. Mathews married Naomi Dewitt, a daughter of Green DeWitt and they had one son. Mathews became a prominent citizen of Gonzales, rendering aid to all settlers of the colony.&lt;ref name=johnson1284&gt;Johnson (1916), p. 1284.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died early and in 1838 he married Nancy King, a daughter of John G. King. They had two children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/innerresidents2.htm TAMU, Sons of DeWitt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Texas==
Mathews would aid in the colonization of the [[DeWitt Colony]]. He would contract with DeWitt, who was encountering difficulties filling his obligations with the Mexican government in bringing 400 families to Texas. Mathews was contracted to bring 20 families into the DeWitt Colony from [[Tennessee]]. Mathews would guide the group to Texas, seeing to procure their supplies and other needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/tenntexland.htm TAMU, Tennessee-Texas Land Company]&lt;/ref&gt; Once entering Texas he would assure that they would receive their land grants. He acquired much land for himself, thus becoming a farmer and cattle rancher of the region.&lt;ref name=johnson1285&gt;Johnson (1916), p. 1285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
On February 4, 1836, William A. Mathews was named along with [[Mathew Caldwell]] and [[Byrd Lockhart]] as commissioners to raise a group of volunteers in Gonzales for a [[Gonzales Ranging Company|ranging company]].&lt;ref name=lindley96&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, a 23 member Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers were mustered into service.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Groneman, "LOCKHART, BYRD," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/flo01], accessed June 25, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Texas Revolution, he would participate as a volunteer soldier, courier and quartermaster.

In 1837-1838, he would serve with Byrd Lockhart's company, as a scout for the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/supsites/military/l/lockb_9l.htm Military Rolls A3; T1 p70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

William A. Matthews died in 1856 and was buried on the east side of the Masonic cemetery in Gonzales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewbutlerphotos.com/Other/Historical-Markers-Gonzales/16915259_Qvf7vR/1/1278312080_8tcJnGD#1278312080_8tcJnGD Gonzales Historical Markers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1962, a historical grave marker was placed in the Gonzales Masonic Cemetery, honoring his service to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=William+A.+Matthews&amp;cnty=gonzales Texas Stoppingpoints]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Roger Corliss''' (August 28, 1926 – July 8, 2011)&lt;ref name=Contemp&gt;"William R(oger) Corliss". ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Gale. July 3, 2002. Retrieved on August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American physicist and writer who was known&lt;ref&gt;William J. Broad. "The science corps wants a few more good heretics". ''The New York Times''. October 16, 1983. A18.&lt;/ref&gt; for his interest in collecting data regarding [[Charles_Fort#Fortean_phenomena|anomalous phenomena]]. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] described him as "[[Charles Fort|Fort]]'s latter-day - and much more scientific - successor."&lt;ref name=clarke110&gt;Clarke, Arthur C. (1990). ''Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography''. Gollancz. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Starting in 1974, Corliss published a number of works in the "Sourcebook Project". Each volume was devoted to a scientific field ([[archeology]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]], et cetera) and featured articles culled almost exclusively from [[scientific journal]]s. Corliss was inspired by [[Charles Fort]], who decades earlier also collected reports of unusual phenomena. Many of the articles in Corliss's works were earlier mentioned in Charles Fort's works. Unlike Fort, known for his idiosyncratic writing style, Corliss initially offered little in the way of his own opinions or editorial comments, preferring to let the articles speak for themselves. Corliss quoted all relevant parts of articles (often reprinting entire articles or stories, including illustrations). In some of his later ''Sourcebook'' efforts, such as the mid-1990s ''Biological Anomalies'' series, Corliss added his evaluation of both the reliability of the claims, and their ranking as anomalies. Well-documented reports from credible sources are ranked as a "1" while entirely unsubstantiated reports are rated as a "4", with "2" or "3" representing intermediate reports. Similarly, Corliss's uses a rating of "1" for anomalies that cannot be explained by existing scientific theories, while a "4" describes phenomena that are unusual but do not challenge scientific theories. 

Corliss wrote many other books and articles, notably including 13 educational books about astronomy, outer space and space travel for [[NASA]] and a similar number for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=newscientist1&gt;Adrian Hope. "Finding a Home for Stray Fact". ''[[New Scientist]]''. July 14, 1977. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In his book ''Unexplained!'', [[Jerome Clark]] describes Corliss as "essentially conservative in outlook". He explains, "Corliss [is] more interested in unusual weather, ball lighting, geophysical oddities, extraordinary mirages, and the like &amp;mdash; in short,  anomalies that, while important in their own right, are far less likely to outrage mainstream scientists than those that delighted Fort, such as UFOs, monstrous creatures, or other sorts of extraordinary events and entities."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Clark. "Sourcebook Project" ''Unexplained!''. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 466-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] said:

{{quote|Unlike Fort, Corliss selected his material almost exclusively from scientific journals like ''Nature'' and ''Science'', not newspapers, so it has already been subjected to a filtering process which would have removed most hoaxes and reports from obvious cranks. Nevertheless, there is much that is quite baffling in some of these reports from highly reputable sources.&lt;ref name=clarke110/&gt;}}

The meteorologist [[Charles A. Doswell III|Charles A. Doswell]] has praised the research of Corliss, stating his documentation of anomalies was intriguing.&lt;ref&gt;Doswell, Charles A. (1984). ''Severe and Unusual Weather by Joe R. Eagleman; Tornados, Dark Days, Anomalous Precipitation, and Related Weather Phenomena: A Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies by William R. Corliss''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 72, No. 1. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the geologist Henry Faul has criticized Corliss. In a review for ''Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena'', Faul states that Corliss is particularly prone to classify things as "unexplained" even when a good explanation is available. &lt;ref&gt;Faul, Henry. (1977). ''Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena by William R. Corliss; John C. Holden''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 65, No. 6. p. 776.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for a book that documented astronomical anomalies, the astronomer [[Joseph Veverka]] believes that in the book of Astronomical Anomalies Corliss was not privy to developments of the astronomical scientific literature for more than a decade and ended up making some incorrect statements.&lt;ref&gt;Veverka, Joseph. (1986). ''The Moon and the Planets: A Catalog of Astronomical Anomalies by William R. Corliss''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 74, No. 6. p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt;
