{{main|2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open &amp;ndash; Women's Singles}}

The '''2018 US Open Women's Singles final''' was the championship [[tennis]] match of the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles|Women's Singles tournament]] at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]]. It was contested between [[Serena Williams]] and [[Naomi Osaka]], seeded 17th and 20th respectively. Osaka defeated Williams in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 19 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-09/us-open-naomi-osaka-beats-serena-williams-controversy/10218766?section=sport|title=US Open: Naomi Osaka beats Serena Williams in controversial women's singles final|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match was historically significant for both players. It was Williams' first US Open after a 12-month hiatus to give birth to her first child in September 2017, and second attempt since her pregnancy (after [[2018 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|that year's Wimbledon]]) to equal [[Margaret Court]]'s [[List of Grand Slam women's singles champions#Most Grand Slam tournament singles titles|all-time record]] of 24 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles. Osaka was the first Japanese player to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final, and was attempting to become the first able-bodied Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.

The match generated significant controversy due to a series of altercations between Williams and chair umpire [[Carlos Ramos (umpire)|Carlos Ramos]] during the second set. Williams' on-court behavior and Ramos' disciplinary actions, and Williams' responses, particularly her invocation of perceived [[Misogyny in sports|sexism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-09/us-open-serena-williams-says-sexism-to-blame-in-loss-to-osaka/10219364|title=US Open: Serena Williams says she was treated more harshly because she is a woman|publisher= [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45461716|title=US Open 2018: Serena Williams accuses umpire of sexism after outbursts in final|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; during her arguments with Ramos and officials, and following the match, polarised the tennis community and media worldwide.

==Background==
The pair met only once previously, with Osaka winning in straight sets in the first round of the [[2018 Miami Open &amp;ndash; Women's Singles|2018 Miami Open]].&lt;ref name="h2h"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serena draws Osaka in blockbuster Miami opener|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/serena-draws-osaka-blockbuster-miami-opener|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=WTA Tennis|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com.au/tennis/story/_/id/22861125/miami-open-tennis-serena-williams-know-naomi-osaka-was-does-now|title=If Serena Williams didn't know who Naomi Osaka was, she does now|publisher=ESPN|first=Bonnie|last=Ford|date=22 March 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018 Miami Open"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com.au/tennis/story/_/id/22861010/serena-williams-loses-1st-round-miami-open|title=Serena Williams loses to Naomi Osaka in straight sets at Miami Open|publisher=ESPN|date=22 March 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Williams===
At the start of the tournament, Williams had won 23 Grand Slam championships, the [[List of Grand Slam women's singles champions#Most Grand Slam tournament singles titles|most  in the Open Era, and second-most of all time]], and was attempting to equal [[Margaret Court]]'s all-time record of 24 Grand Slam championships, which required her to best her own record of being the oldest female Grand Slam women's singles champion at the time set at the [[2017 Australian Open - Women's Singles|2017 Australian Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|title=History is on the line as Venus Williams tries to become oldest women's Grand Slam winner|date=14 July 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-wimbledon-venus-williams-20170714-story.html|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2018 marked a highly anticipated comeback for Williams since giving birth in September 2017.  Her prior successes, and consequent status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, attracted significant media interest in her pregnancy and motherhood, where she openly revealed almost suffering near-fatal [[Complications of pregnancy|childbirth-related complications]] as a result of an emergency Caesarian section, requiring five surgeries and leaving her bedridden for six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Serena|title=Serena Williams: What my life-threatening experience taught me about giving birth (Opinion)|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/20/opinions/protect-mother-pregnancy-williams-opinion/index.html|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used her struggle to cast light on the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serena Williams:I almost died after giving birth to my daughter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/20/serena-williams-childbirth-health-daughter-tennis|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently being hailed as an inspiration for mothers overall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinsliff|first1=Gaby|title=Motherhood isn't easy - even for a warrior like Serena Williams|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/07/serena-williams-motherhood-warrior-physical-emotional-toll-women|date=7 August 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Serena Comeback"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Sean|title=Serena Williams Opens Up About Her Complicated Comeback|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|url=http://time.com/5368858/serena-williams-comeback/|date=16 August 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; further adding to public anticipation towards her return to tour.

Williams' return was, however, difficult. Originally intending to return for the [[2018 Australian Open]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haskell|first1=Rob|title=Serena Williams on Pregnancy, Power, and Coming Back to Center Court|date=15 August 2017|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-pregnancy-vogue-september-issue-2017|website=Vogue|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; complications from her pregnancy caused her to miss the tournament, leaving her unable to defend her [[2017 Australian Open - Women's Singles|title from the previous year]], and delay her return until the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open - Women's Singles|Indian Wells Masters]] that February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haskell|first1=Rob|title=Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback|date=11 January 2018|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018|website=Vogue|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she lost to older sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]] in the third round. In the [[2018 Miami Open - Women's Singles|Miami Open]] two weeks later, Williams would face Osaka for the first time, and only time until their US Open match, in the first round, where Osaka upset Williams in straight sets - Williams' earliest ever exit from the Miami Open in her career. Williams' first Grand Slam campaign since her return at the [[2018 French Open - Women's Singles|French Open]] ended disappointingly, as she withdrew before her fourth round match against [[Maria Sharapova]]. However, her [[2018 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] campaign the following month was more successful, reaching the final. Despite losing to [[Angelique Kerber]] in straight sets, her feat of reaching the final in the first place was seen as both a return to form—Sonia Oxley of [[BBC Sport]] quipping that "she still has the stamina, spirit and shots to carry on collecting Grand Slam titles", and 2016 men's singles champion [[Andy Murray]] noting that "It is tough to bet against her now she's got this far"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oxley|first1=Sonia|title=Serena Williams into final with win over Camilla Giorgi|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/44783078|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and a reinforcement of her status as an icon of motherhood and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robert|first1=Yola|title=What We Can All Learn From Serena Williams' Loss At Wimbledon|work=[[Forbes]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/yolarobert1/2018/07/20/what-we-can-all-learn-from-serena-williams-loss-at-wimbledon|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osaka===
[[File:Naomi Osaka (27849809747).jpg|thumb|right|Osaka at the 2018 French Open, where she was seeded at a Major for the first time in her career.]]
Osaka was relatively unknown, beginning the year ranked No. 68, having only entered the top 50 briefly in 2016, and having neither been seeded in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament nor advanced beyond the third round. She had, however, made a break at the [[2017 US Open - Women's Singles|2017 US Open]], upsetting defending champion [[Angelique Kerber]] in the first round, 6–3, 6–1. She improved upon her Grand Slam record at the [[2018 Australian Open]], advancing to the fourth round where she lost to world No. 1 and eventual runner-up [[Simona Halep]] in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2.

Following her 2018 Australian Open campaign, Osaka earned the biggest win of her career at [[2018 BNP Paribas Open - Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], during which she defeated former World No. 1s [[Maria Sharapova]] and [[Karolína Plíšková]], and avenged her Australian Open loss to Halep in the semi-final, before defeating [[Daria Kasatkina]] in the final to claim her biggest championship yet. Subsequently, she entered the [[2018 French Open - Women's Singles|2018 French Open]] seeded 21st, the first Grand Slam tournament in which she was seeded in the main draw. By mid-August 2018, Osaka attained the highest ranking yet of her career at World No. 17, and was the youngest player in the [[WTA Rankings|WTA's top 20]].&lt;ref name="Osaka NYT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larmer|first1=Brook|title=Naomi Osaka's Breakthrough Game|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=23 August 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/magazine/naomi-osakas-breakthrough-game.html?|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osaka entered the main draw of the US Open seeded 20th; however, early round losses on her side of the draw, including those of Australian Open champion [[Caroline Wozniacki]] and Wimbledon champion [[Petra Kvitová]], meant that Osaka did not face any player seeded above her until her semi-final with [[Madison Keys]]. Osaka qualified for the final having only dropped one set during the entire tournament (in the fourth round against [[Aryna Sabalenka]]), and by beating Keys in the semi-final 6–2, 6–4, a match during which she saved all 13 break points she faced. Osaka was the first player from Japan to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final (the second Japanese able-bodied player overall after [[Kei Nishikori]] at the [[2014 US Open – Men's Singles|2014 US Open]], and fourth player overall after Nishikori, [[Yui Kamiji]] and [[Shingo Kunieda]]), and was attempting to become the first able-bodied Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Osaka's personal admiration for Williams as a primary inspiration for her tennis career was a focal point of the media's interest in her rise. Upon defeating [[Maria Sharapova]] in her successful 2018 Indian Wells campaign, Osaka quipped, "There are three people I wanted to play, [[Venus Williams|Venus]], [Sharapova] and Serena. Now I'm just waiting to play Serena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pantic|first1=Nina|title=In slugfest win over Sharapova, Naomi Osaka shows a veteran's mettle|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/03/maria-sharapova-naomi-osaka-indian-wells-bnp-paribas-open-2018/72586/|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=Tennis.com|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams has been described as Osaka's "hero" and "idol", and the US Open final matchup as Osaka's childhood dream;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first=Paul|title=US Open 2018: Serena Williams to face Naomi Osaka in Flushing Meadows final|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=8 September 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/us-open-2018-final-serena-williams-naomi-osaka-flushing-meadows-live-a8526676.html|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osaka Keys BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=US Open 2018: Serena Williams final 'a dream' - Osaka|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=7 September 2018|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45443470|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osaka's focus has been described as "solely on becoming the next Serena",&lt;ref name="Osaka NYT" /&gt; Osaka herself remarking that, during challenging scenarios on court, she thinks "What would Serena do?"&lt;ref name="2018 Miami Open" /&gt; Interviewed following her semi-final victory over Keys, Osaka commented on her thoughts during the match, "I was just thinking that I really wanted to play Serena, because she is Serena,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naomi Osaka to take on idol Serena Williams in final|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/09/07/more-sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-makes-history-u-s-open-will-meet-serena-williams-final/#.W5cG5egza70|date=7 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when asked what her message to Serena would be, simply said, "I love you."&lt;ref name="Osaka Keys BBC" /&gt;

===Second set===
With Williams leading the second set, 1–0, 15-40, chair umpire Ramos gave Williams an official warning for alleged coaching, a code violation under [[International Tennis Federation]] rules. Television replays showed her coach, [[Patrick Mouratoglou]], gesturing to Serena with his hands and nodding, apparently signalling her to move forward towards the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodo|first1=Peter|title=US Open tennis - About that no-coaching rule in Grand Slam tennis, let's change it|publisher=[[ESPN]]|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/24618866/us-open-tennis-no-coaching-rule-grand-slam-tennis-let-change-it|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=S.

In response, Williams approached Ramos and told him, "If he's giving me a thumbs up, he's telling me to come on. We don't have any code, and I know you don't know that, and I understand why you thought that was coaching but I'm telling you it's not. I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose. I'm just letting you know."&lt;ref name="breakdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-09/serena-williams-us-open-breakdown-blow-by-blow/10218962?section=sport|title=Serena Williams's US Open final breakdown blow-by-blow|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|first=Jon|last=Healy|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osaka won the next point to level the second set, 1–1. During the following court change, leading 2-1, Williams brought up the matter again with Ramos, saying "it's not something I would do but I could understand why you may have thought that but just know I've never cheated." Ramos assured Williams that he understood her, the on-court microphone picking him up telling Williams "I understood your reaction as well", which Williams thanked him for; however, the ruling was upheld.

After breaking Osaka's serve for the first time in the match, Williams was serving at 3–1, at 30-15, however double faulted two points in a row to bring up break point, 30-40. Osaka broke back Williams' serve on the next point to bring the set back on serve, 3–2, as Williams hit the ball into the net on a backhand unforced error, turned to her box in frustration saying (according to on-court commentator [[Luke Jensen]]) "I can't get over the top of the ball", and smashed her racquet on the court. Ramos issued her a second code violation, this time for racquet abuse. As her second violation, she was penalised a point, and thus the next game started 15-0 to Osaka's advantage. Upon hearing of this, Williams raised the issue of her first code violation again with Ramos, insisting "this is unbelievable. Every time I play here I have problems." Williams insisted that Ramos "make an announcement that I didn't get coaching ... you owe me an apology, I have never cheated in my life!" Invoking her recent pregnancy, she further remonstrated that "I have a daughter and I stand for what is right for her" and that "you will never do another one of my matches."&lt;ref name="breakdown"/&gt; Osaka held serve the following game to level the set at 3–3, before breaking Williams' serve a second time in the set with a forehand winner to lead 4–3. 

At the following change of ends, Williams continued to furiously berate Ramos, accusing him of attacking her character by insinuating that she cheated via being coached. She continued to demand an apology from Ramos, asserting to him that "you will never, ever, ever, be on another court of mine as long as you live." The exchange culminated in Williams calling the umpire a "liar" and a "thief" for, as she perceived, unjustly "stealing" a point following the racket abuse incident. Ramos judged this to be a further code violation for verbal abuse; as the third code violation of the match against Williams, Osaka was awarded the next game by default, bringing the score to 5–3 and Osaka one game away from victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/sports/tennis/us-open-naomi-osaka-serena-williams.html |title =Naomi Osaka Lost Her Moment of Triumph.

==Aftermath==

Upon defeat, Williams embraced Osaka, but refused to shake Ramos' hand as per game etiquette, instead pointing at him and reasserting, "You owe me an apology." As Ramos left the court, the crowd booed; Osaka, after greeting her team, did not acknowledge the crowd but immediately returned to her bench and hid her face with her towel.

The crowd continued booing as the trophy presentation commenced, interrupting both [[Master of ceremonies|MC]] [[Tom Rinaldi]] and [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]] president [[Katrina Adams]] several times. Ramos was not present to receive his token of appreciation as is normally the case in Grand Slam finals, and Osaka hid her face under her visor and wept as Williams consoled her. Upon accepting her runner-up plate, Williams, also in tears, attempted to stay positive and encourage the crowd by congratulating Osaka and pleading the crowd not to boo anymore, after which the crowd began to cheer. Upon receiving the trophy, Rinaldi asked Osaka for her thoughts on playing and defeating her idol. Osaka, still in tears, deferred from his question to address the crowd, saying, "I know everyone was cheering for her and I'm sorry it had to end like this," before acknowledging her family, team, and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2018/09/08/naomi-osaka-receives-us-open-trophy-tears-serena-williams-meltdown/|title =Naomi Osaka receives US Open trophy in tears after boos greet presentation ceremony|date=9 September 2018|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams, in her post-match press conference, raised the gender issue again, saying that the violations made her "feel like it was a sexist remark", reasserting that men have said worse things on court without violation, and drawing upon an earlier controversy in the tournament where [[Alizé Cornet]] was given a code violation for taking off her on-court (an action male players frequently do), as an example of double standards between men and women in tennis. She alluded to her actions being part of her role to stand up for women's rights and equality, and vowed to continue, a statement which drew both isolated applause and murmurs from the attendees.

The on-court incidents of the second set polarised opinions among current and retired tennis players worldwide. [[Chris Evert]] (whose [[Open Era]] record of 6 US Open women's singles titles Williams would have broken had Williams won), while commentating the match for [[ESPN]], claimed that while first and second code violations were common for similar incidents, it was unprecedented to issue a third code violation (and therefore game penalty) for verbal abuse. Immediately following the match, interviewed while still in the player's box, Mouratoglou admitted to coaching Williams, but doubted whether Williams saw his gestures. Mouratoglou added that "100% of coaches on 100% of matches" still commit such actions, calling the response a "hypocrite thing" and the act of Williams breaking her racquet a normal human emotional reaction to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Evert|Evert, Chris]]|date=9 September 2018|title=2018 US Open Highlights: Serena Williams' dispute overshadows Naomi Osaka's final win|medium= Live sports broadcast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiBrForlj-k|access-date=11 September 2018|format= |time= |location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evert later agreed with Mouratoglou that "every coach coaches" despite it being a violation of rules, and with Williams' point that men have said worse things, including profanities (which Williams did not say), without penalty, but added that Williams' adamant insistence upon an apology aggravated the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Evert|Evert, Chris]]|date=9 September 2018|title=2018 US Open analysis: Was Serena Williams' penalty vs Naomi Osaka deserved?|medium= Live sports broadcast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxk23HRb-2I|access-date=11 September 2018|format= |time= |location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billie Jean King]], former US Open Champion and founder of the [[Women's Tennis Association]], was initially supportive of Williams, [[Twitter|tweeting]] following the match: "When a woman is emotional, she's 'hysterical' and she's penalised for it. When a man does the same, he's 'outspoken' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same."[https://twitter.com/BillieJeanKing/status/1038613218296569856] However, being interviewed by [[Christiane Amanpour]] three days later, King softened her criticism of the perceived double standard, admitting that Ramos did the right thing and could not apologise as Williams demanded in the situation, and placing some responsibility on Williams, saying that "No one was saying she was a good sport, if they are they're crazy. She was totally out of line." King, however, agreed with Evert, that Ramos could have been less strict and given Williams a softer warning prior to any disciplinary actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45492288|title=US Open 2018: Serena Williams 'out of line' in US Open final but umpire 'blew it', says Billie Jean King|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 September 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=King|first=Billie Jean|subject-link= |interviewer=[[Christiane Amanpour]]|title=Billie Kean King: No one free from blame at US Open Final |url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/09/11/billie-jean-king-serena-williams-amanpour.cnn |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=11 September 2018|access-date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4-time US Open champion [[Martina Navratilova]] claimed Williams' behaviour was not excused by the question of whether a male player would have avoided penalty, and added that while Mouratoglou was partly right in saying that coaching was widespread, so is the issuing of penalties for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Navratilova|first1=Martina|title=What Serena Got Wrong|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/opinion/martina-navratilova-serena-williams-us-open.html?crpt=article&amp;clicksource=inarticlelink|date=10 September 2018|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide opinion was divided following the match, with many{{who|date=September 2018}} branding Williams' behaviour "embarrassing" and "ridiculous", while others claimed she was a victim of blatant sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/us-open-womens-final-world-reacts-to-fiery-finals-clash/news-story/d71e3ebb88c013a17e7f2af12eb9e403|title=US Open Women’s Final: World reacts to fiery finals clash|publisher=news.com.au|first=Matt|last=Young|date=10 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to penalise Williams was also criticized by many, including [[2003 US Open &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|2003 men's champion]] [[Andy Roddick]] and two-time US Open finalist [[Victoria Azarenka]], among others. [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|Former world number one]] [[Ana Ivanovic]], though, stayed away from the controversy, commending Osaka for her composed performance throughout the match while also praising Williams for being the champion she is.&lt;ref name="tournament-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/09/11/2018-us-open-the-tournament-that-was/|title=2018 US Open: The tournament that was|publisher=The Roar|date=11 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Williams also received support from [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] chief executive Steve Simon, as well as [[United States Tennis Association]] president Katrina Adams, who had been ridiculed for hailing Williams' "class and sportsmanship" during the post-match presentation.&lt;ref name="WTA-comments"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7224706/serena-williams-us-open-wta-carlos-ramos-naomi-osaka/?utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1536649187|title=Serena Williams backed by women’s tennis bosses as she claims US Open umpire was sexist|publisher=The Sun|first=Steve|last=Brenner|date=10 September 2018|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Tennis Federation]] later issued a statement supporting Carlos Ramos' umpiring during the match, stating: "Mr Ramos' decisions were in accordance with the relevant rules and were reaffirmed by the US Open’s decision to fine Serena Williams for the three offences. Mr Ramos acted at all times with professionalism and integrity."&lt;ref name="WTA-comments"/&gt;

[[File:Acroyoga in butler park.jpg|thumb|Acroyogis practicing Acro Yoga in a park.]]
'''Acroyoga''' (also written ''Acro-Yoga'' or ''Acro Yoga'') is a physical practice which combines [[yoga]], [[acrobatics]] and [[Thai massage]]. 

Acroyoga is more vigorous than many traditional yoga practices and may lead to more injuries.&lt;ref name="yogainjuries"&gt;{{citation |first=Eva Norlyk |last=Smith |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eva-norlyk-smith-phd/yoga-injuries-debate_b_2896134.html |title=The Yoga Injuries Debate: How 'Dangerous' Is Yoga, Really? |publisher=HuffPost Healthy Living |date=23 March 2013 |accessdate=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acroyoga has been practiced since the beginning of the century. One of the oldest videos of someone doing Acroyoga is with Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, practicing the role of the base, while a child executed some asanas in 1938. Since then, Acroyoga has gained new movements, and is still changing.

== Roles ==
There are three primary roles in an Acroyoga practice: '''base''', '''flyer''', and '''spotter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chee |last=Gates |work=Fitness Magazine |url=http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/yoga/poses/extreme-yoga-poses |title=Extreme Yoga Poses and Positions |accessdate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Base''' - this is the individual who has the most points of contact with the ground. Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be "bone-stacked" for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders).
* '''Flyer''' - this is the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength.
* '''Spotter''' - this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips. The spotter can also make recommendations to the Base and Flyer to improve their form.

==Elements==
[[File:AcroYoga pose Back Bird variation.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga static Inverted Dancer pose]]

=== Acrobatics ===
is the physical part of Acroyoga that uses gymnastics techniques to build strength, flexibility, trust and teamwork between partners.

In the Acrobatic element we have:

==== Static poses ====
Initially basic poses such as bird, throne and whale. When the partners hold the position using equilibrium which is a state of rest or balance due to the equal action of opposing forces.

====    Acrobatic flying ====
Focus on movement - first, the flyer and base learn a static pose, later, how to move from one pose to another, creating a movement that is called "transition" in between the two poses.

In the acrobatic flying, there is a sequence of movements that start and end in the same position, which is called ''washing machine''. There are many different washing machines. These basics washing machines that are taught are: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5mdp_e00Y barrel roll] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fk_YQI_YrU ninja star].

=== Pops ===
Small jumps where the partners keep physical contact with each other, usually keeping their hands connected.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kww0J4Fr3WM]

=== Yoga ===
Reflects the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of traditional [[Yoga]]

=== Therapeutics ===
[[File:AcroYoga pose Super Yogi.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga therapeutic flying – this pose is called Super Yogi.]]At AcroYoga Inc this includes Thai massage, therapeutic flying and partner yoga.

A basic therapeutic pose is ''Folded Leaf'' in which one partner is inverted and supported on the vertical legs of the other partner whose hands are then free for back massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2660|title=Partners In Play|website=Yoga Journal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Therapeutic flying====
The flyer relaxes the body and is guided by the base through some stretches and massage.

To help the flyer to relax, it is crucial to develop trust first, which can be done by practicing the acrobatic flying. Also, it is important that the base has a strong sense of responsibility, care and trust in all the movements that will execute, before start to heal flyers using therapeutic flying techniques.

It can use techniques from different types of massage, having as a result, a deep level of relaxation.

==Learning AcroYoga==
[[File:AcroYoga Jam.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga meeting in a public park in Austin, Texas.]]
Learning Acroyoga requires strength training, flexibility training and technique training.&lt;ref name="flightmanual"&gt;Nemer, Jason and Sauer-Klein, Jenny. ''AcroYoga Flight Manual'', 2008, acroyoga.org&lt;/ref&gt; Strength training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like [[push-up]]s and [[hand walking]]. [[Yin yoga|Flexibility training]] is best done at the end of a session with a partner. Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned with an expert teacher.&lt;ref name="flightmanual" /&gt;  One important Acroyoga technique is called ''stacking the bones.'' This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the flyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilgrimageyoga.com/five-reasons-you-should-do-acroyoga/|title=FIVE REASONS YOU SHOULD DO ACROYOGA|website=Pilgrimage of the Heart Yoga|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Acro Yoga session may include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulamovement.com/yoga/acro.html|title=AcroYoga|work=Kula Movement|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Circle ceremony''' promotes communication and openness

* '''Inversions''' help build trust between the partners&lt;ref name="yogajournal practice"/&gt;

Some communities have regular Acro Yoga meetings to provide a place for interested people to come together and practice for free. There are also larger Acro Yoga events such as the annual Divine Play in [[Portland, Oregon]] that draw practitioners from a regional or national area.

In the world, there are instructors teaching Acro Yoga in regular classes and workshops.

You can learn Acroyoga by yourself, but it takes time, discipline and responsibility, as you may not know all the techniques that will make the practice safe, for yourself and others.

The [[Guinness World Record]] (GWR) for fastest [[circumnavigation]] of the globe by [[bicycle]] is awarded for completing a continuous journey around the globe by bicycle and other means, consisting of a minimum 29,000&amp;nbsp;km in total distance cycled.

In 2013, GWR rules changed and the old record of 106 days 10 hours 33 minutes (22,997km/14,206 miles) set by Jay Aldous and Matt DeWall of SLC, Utah, USA in 1984 will now stand in GWR archives. The new rules now state that the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be 18,000 miles (29,000 km), and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length. The clock does not stop for any waiting time for transit flights or ferries or for the duration of the transit (see full rules below).

The male record is currently 78 days 14 hours, and 40 minutes by [[Mark Beaumont]] of Scotland. [[Jenny Graham]] of Scotland (member of the Adventure Syndicate) holds the current female record, completing her attempt in October 2018 in a total of 124 days. She cycled the route solo and totally unsupported often sleeping rough in drainage ditches or behind bushes. 

Although Guinness makes no differentiation, there are two types of attempts: supported and unsupported. Most cyclists choose to do the challenge supported, especially through the Australian outback. 

The principles for unsupported rides are:
# do it all yourself, under your own power;
# carry all your own gear (i.e. no domestiques); and
# no outside support (deliveries only to public addresses or 'open' homes, no support vehicles of any kind meeting the rider along the way to provide supplies). 'Pure' unsupported rides also preclude any visits from friends or others along the way. These rules require riders to be alone for the entire ride, with a minimum 5-bicycle-length distance from any other riders or support vehicles.

==Guinness rules==
The rules state "the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be {{convert|18000|mi|sigfig=3}}, and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length, i.e. {{convert|24900|mi|sigfig=3}}." They also state that: "Any considerable distance travelled opposite to the direction of the attempt must be discounted from any calculations of the overall distance travelled," and that the route "must be ridden through two approximate antipodal points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fastest Circumnavigation By Bicycle - Guidelines|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|date=2014-04-08|url=https://tomdaviesrtw.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/79886-fastest-circumnavigation-by-bicycle-male.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cycleseven.org/round-the-world-cycling-record|title=Round the world cycling record - The Guinness rules|publisher=CycleSeven.org|date=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Bate writes, "The record criteria requires &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; the rider to cover 28,970 kilometers by bike, in an East to West or West to East direction, wavering no more than 5 degrees off course. The total journey distance must be a minimum of 40,075 kilometers, to include all transit by flight or sea. The ride must start and finish in the same place and must pass at least two antipodal points (these are two points that line up through the earth's centre). When the rider reaches a transit point to connect with a flight or boat to the next continent or country start point, the clock stops with regard to the actual riding time *(no longer the case any more since the rules have changed in relation to transit time, which is NOW included in the total time). As most of the earth's surface is water, this is unavoidable and fair as it applies to all athletes attempting the record. Once customs is cleared at the next destination, the clock immediately starts again. The same bicycle must be used throughout the attempt, although repairs and replacement parts and bikes are allowed for mechanical failure. Satellite tracking is highly recommended by Guinness World Records and a daily log, signatures of dignitaries and photographs at strategic points must be collated as evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/stats/news.php?id=19201|title=Alan Bate's around-the-world cycling record attempt|publisher=Explorers Web|date=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement to pass at least two [[Antipodes|antipodal points]] causes some problems in route planning. For example, among popular countries for around the world cyclists, the antipodes of Australia is spread out over the Atlantic Ocean, North America over the Indian Ocean, Africa over mid Pacific Ocean, and Europe and most of Asia over the South Pacific Ocean, without any land mass there. Those land areas would not give any opportunities for an antipodal pair while cycling. Some possible pairs are [[China]] / [[Argentina]], [[Malaysia]] / [[Peru]], and [[Spain]] / [[New Zealand]] (Madrid and Wellington fall within the ±5-degree difference permitted by Guinness).

The length requirement requires also consideration. To cycle [[Lisbon]]–[[Vladivostok]] (13900 km), [[Perth]]–[[Brisbane]] (4300 km) and [[Los Angeles]]–[[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] (7200 km) with air travel between legs gives 25,400 km. So some detours are needed (such as e.g [[Invercargill]]–[[Auckland]], New Zealand, 1800 km, for the sake of the antipodes requirement).

==History==

===Nick Sanders===
[[File:Nick Sanders.jpg|thumb|150px|Nick Sanders, the first person to set the record.]]

[[File:Australian Football Field.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diagram of a standard Australian Football field]]

An '''Australian rules football playing field''' is a venue where [[Australian rules football]] is played.

The [[playing field]] is typically a large [[oval]]-shaped [[grass]] surface (often modified [[cricket field]]s).  These fields may vary especially for variations of the game.  However, for official [[Australian Football League]] matches, strict requirement specifications must be met for stadiums.

==Standard specifications==
[[Image:Footygroundfix.svg|thumb|400px|Explanation of Australian rules football ground markings]]

===Ground dimensions===
Australian rules football grounds, even at the highest level of the game, have no fixed dimensions. For senior football, the playing field is an oval, typically between 135–185 metres long goal-to-goal and 110–155&amp;nbsp;metres wide wing-to-wing. Grounds can vary from long and narrow to almost circular, and are not necessarily symmetrical, depending upon how and where the field was constructed. At least 5 metres of space between the boundary line and any fence is required for safety.

Smaller fields are generally used for junior football; some are purpose-built, and some are temporarily marked out within the confines of full-sized oval; as for a senior match, there are no fixed dimensions for a junior-sized field. The Western Australian Football Commission advises that a good rule of thumb is to set the length of the field equivalent to 3½ times the length of an average kick of the age group playing.&lt;ref name="wafc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/australianrulesdimensions|title=Dimensions for football – Australian rules|publisher=Government of Western Australia, Department of Sport and Recreation|accessdate=12 April 2014|author=Western Australian Football Commission Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground markings===
A top-level Australian rules football ground has the following markings:&lt;ref name="wafc" /&gt;
*Two goal-lines, one at each end of the field, which are straight and 19.2&amp;nbsp;m (21&amp;nbsp;yds) long.
*Two boundary lines, which are curved around the edge of the field and connect the two goal-lines. Together, the boundary-lines and the goal-lines mark out the playing area, in a slightly truncated oval.
*Two goal squares, one at each end of the field, which are 6.4m×9m (7yd×10yd) in front of each goal-face. The line parallel to the goal line is called the kick-off line. The goal square is the area from which a [[kick-in]] can occur.
*The centre square, which is 50m×50m in the centre of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Coach_AFL/2017_Laws_of_Australian_Football.pdf Laws of Football 2017], p12&lt;/ref&gt; This square dictates how many midfielders can be present at a centre bounce.
*The centre circles: two concentric circles of 3&amp;nbsp;m and 10&amp;nbsp;m diameter, with a line bisecting them running wing-to-wing. These markings dictate where the ruckmen can stand during a centre bounce.
*Two fifty-metre arcs: a circular arc at each end of the field drawn between the boundary lines at a distance of 50m from the centre of the goal-line. Except in competitions which allow for [[Super Goal|super goals]], these arcs serve only as an informative visual indicator of distance.
*Interchange gates: two short markings on the boundary line near the interchange benches, which dictate where players may enter and exit the ground for interchanges.

Grounds at lower or junior levels, particularly small grounds, may lack some of these markings.

===Goal posts===
At each end of the ground there are two goal posts, spaced 6.4m (7yds) apart; these are conventionally painted white. A further 6.4m (7yds) on either side of these are behind posts; the behind posts are shorter than the goal posts; additionally, in South Australia it is customary for behind posts to be painted red, 5 metres in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Advertiser|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|author=Michelangelo Rucci|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=12 April 2014|title=Footy fans march back to the Adelaide Oval of the future|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/footy-fans-march-back-to-the-adelaide-oval-of-the-future/story-fni6uo1m-1226868031522}}&lt;/ref&gt; All posts are typically padded with [[wall padding]] to minimise injury due to players colliding with them.&lt;ref name="wafc" /&gt;

===Surface===
Playing surface is a controversial issue in Australian rules football due to possible injuries caused to players moving at high speed including [[Spectacular mark|marking]], jumping, turning and being [[Tackle (football move)|tackled]] without protective padding. For these reasons the playing field standards imply use of [[lawn]] as a surface.

==Purpose-built stadiums==
{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}
Almost all Australian rules football fields are of a suitable size and shape for cricket; and in the majority of cases, the fields are used for cricket in the summer and Australian rules football in the winter, a seasonal strategy which is rooted in the history of Australian sport. As a consequence of this, there are very few fields which were purpose-built for and used by Australian rules football to the exclusion of cricket and all other sports.

However, there are many grounds – particularly those built more recently – which were built with Australian rules football as the primary intended purpose, but upon which other sports, including cricket, have been played.

==Variations==
{{main article|Variations of Australian rules football}}
Variations of the standard field dimensions and layout exist.  For junior levels, smaller fields are often used.  Rectangular fields have also been used in the past in Australia and also overseas, as well as adapted fields from other sports such as [[Association Football]] and [[American Football]].

{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}
In the sport of [[cricket]], a '''bouncer''' (or '''bumper''') is a type of [[delivery (cricket)|delivery]], usually [[bowling (cricket)|bowled]] by a fast [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]].

==Usage==
Bouncers are used to drive the batsman back on to his back foot if he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at the [[line and length|line]] of the batsman's body. Aiming at the batsman is legal provided the [[bouncing ball|ball bounces]] on the pitch; or upon reaching the batsman, the ball is below the batsman's waist. Aiming at the batsman's head without bouncing on the pitch, known as a [[beamer (cricket)|beamer]], is illegal.

[[File:Playing a hook shot.jpg|thumb|left|260px|A batsman attempting to play a [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook shot]] against a bouncer.]]
A batsman may play a bouncer in either a defensive or an attacking way. If the batsman plays it defensively he aims primarily to avoid getting out, and secondarily to avoid being hit by the ball. For a head-high bouncer, these goals are achieved most easily by ducking under the ball. If the ball is at chest height, the batsman's best defence is to move on to his back foot, raise his bat vertically to chest height, and attempt to block the ball and direct it downwards to the pitch so as to avoid presenting a catch to a fielder. Sometimes the batsman will need to jump into the air to gain the necessary height to defend with the bat. He may also sway out of the way. Given these approaches, the bowler can hope to both intimidate the batsman somewhat, and possibly have the ball deflect off the bat at an awkward angle and produce a catch for a nearby fielder. A bouncer ball is not valid if the ball is above the marks height before touching ground (the mark height is 8ft) that's mean when the bowler is bowling the ball the bowl should not exceed the 8 feet of height before touching ground, if it is above the mark level the ball will be declared No ball and the rule may change if the bowler height is above 6ft 5inch it will be increase 1/2 feet as height increase and the ball release as high intentionally it would be categorized as unfair delivery. That may be concern as objectionable delivery. The bowler that throw convective delivery as bouncer may lead to match fine or can be temporary ban for not obeying the cricket rule and tried to unfollow the rules.       
[[File:Cricket_delivery_lengths_en.svg|left|thumb|Bouncer in purple.]]

Conversely, the bouncer can be a very productive ball for the batsman, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook shot]]. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook, shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.

There is an unspoken agreement, particularly in the time before the widespread use of batting helmets, that fast bowlers will not bowl bouncers at each other, because less skilled batsmen are less likely to effectively defend and therefore more likely to be struck. Breaking of this rule can lead to 'bouncer wars' – that is, the targeted bowler engaging in retaliatory hostile short-pitched bowling at his opponent during the following innings.

==ICC rules==
Because of the potential danger to batsmen of being hit and to stop bowlers bowling bouncers all the time, there are Laws in the [[Laws of Cricket]] governing how frequently a bowler may bowl bouncers, as well as how many fielders may field backward of square leg. These laws take into account the relative skill of the batsmen.

During the 1970s to 1980s, bouncers were used as part of a team's intimidatory tactics, especially by the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies team]]. In 1991, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) introduced a "one bouncer per batsman per over" rule in an attempt to discourage use of intimidation. However, the ruling was not well received by players and umpires alike, with English [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]] [[Dickie Bird]] describing it as "farcical" as he felt that calling intimidatory tactics should be left to the umpire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bird wants end to bouncer rule|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket-bird-wants-end-to-bouncer-rule-1397077.html|publisher=[[The Independent|independent.co.uk]]|date=28 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC changed it to two bouncers per over in 1994, with a two-run no-ball penalty (rather than one-run no-ball) if the bowler exceeded two bouncers an over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket-icc-allows-extra-bouncer-per-over-lords-changes-intimidatory-bowling-rule-1412275.html|title=Cricket: ICC allows extra bouncer per over: Lord's changes|author=MARTIN JOHNSON, Cricket Correspondent|date=6 July 1994|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Day International cricket allowed one bouncer per over in 2001 (and a one-run no-ball in case a bowler exceeded the limit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cricket's Turning Points: The bouncer rule|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/491190.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2012 the ICC increased the number of bouncers that could be bowled during a One Day International to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/icc-paves-day-night-tests/32709| title=ICC paves way for Day-Night Tests| publisher=Wisden India| date=29 October 2012| access-date=30 October 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630231143/http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/icc-paves-day-night-tests/32709#| archive-date=30 June 2015| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bouncers per over allowed in T20s was kept to one.

==Controversies==
Fast leg theory, the deliberate and sustained bowling of bouncers aimed at the body, coupled with a cordon of legside catching fieldsmen to catch deflections, was a tactic used by [[English cricket team|England]] against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in 1932/33, dubbed the [[Bodyline]] series by the Australians. This controversial tactic caused the [[Laws of Cricket]] to be reformed to prevent any recurrence. 

In 1954–55 in Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21372.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; England fast bowler [[Frank Tyson]] bowled bouncers at Australian [[Ray Lindwall]], who returned the favour by hospitalising Tyson with one of his own. An angry Tyson returned with a large lump on his head and took 6/85 in the second innings to give England a 38-run victory.

In 1994 at the Oval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/59/59371.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devon Malcolm]] was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from [[Fanie de Villiers]]. The incensed Malcolm told the South Africans "You guys are history" and took apart their second innings with 9/57.

==Injuries and deaths caused by bouncers==
[[File:Justin_Langer_Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Justin Langer]] spent time in hospital in 2006 after being struck in the head by a bouncer]]
The bouncer is an aggressive delivery and the very nature of the delivery by a fast bowler and aimed at the head can lead to batsmen being hit in the chest, neck or head.

In 1962, Indian captain [[Nari Contractor]] was hit above his right ear by a [[Charlie Griffith]] bouncer which resulted in severe loss of blood and left Contractor critically ill. He regained full consciousness after six days and returned to first-class cricket ten months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The bouncer that ended a career|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/807661.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, Australian opener [[Justin Langer]], was struck on the head in his 100th Test from a bouncer from [[Makhaya Ntini]] and hospitalised. In 2008 [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] batsman [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]] was knocked out for several minutes after being hit by a bouncer from Australian [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]] [[Brett Lee]] during a test match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brett Lee bumper KO's runmaker Chanderpaul|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/lee-bumper-kos-runmaker/story-e6frepmo-1111116438755|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoaib Akhtar]] injured both [[Gary Kirsten]] (2003) and [[Brian Lara]] (2004) with fast bouncers. Both batsmen had to be taken off the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/638803.html|title=My XI : Shoaib Akhtar – 'Undoubtedly the quickest, the meanest'  – Cricket videos, MP3, podcasts, cricket audio – ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2014, Australian cricketer [[Phillip Hughes]] was knocked unconscious by a bouncer from [[Sean Abbott]], which hit the side of his head, between the grille and shell of his helmet, during a [[Sheffield Shield]] match.&lt;ref name=abc-hughes-scg&gt;{{cite news |title=Phillip Hughes in critical condition following surgery after being knocked out by bouncer in Sheffield Shield match |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-25/test-aspirant-phillip-hughes-in-critical-condition-after-surgery/5916844 |accessdate=25 November 2014 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, suffering from a [[subarachnoid haemorrhage]], but died from his injuries two days later, never having regained consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/30219440|title= Phillip Hughes: Australian batsman dies, aged 25 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 27 November 2014|website=BBC News | accessdate= 27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brännbollscupen''' is an annual competition in [[brännboll]] in [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]], organised by [[IKSU]]. Brännboll is a Scandinavian game similar to [[baseball]].&lt;ref name=historik /&gt;

Brännbollscupen was first arranged in 1974 with 44 participating teams. Throughout the years the tournament has grown to over 1000 participating teams. Since 1997, the contest has World Cup status.&lt;ref name=historik /&gt;

Brännbollscupen is always played the last weekend of May. When the sun sets and it is too dark to play brännboll, the festival [[Brännbollsyran]] takes place.

'''Dolphin Oval''', based on the corner of Ashmole and Klingner Roads in [[Kippa-Ring, Queensland|Kippa-Ring]], north of [[Brisbane]], is the home ground for the [[Redcliffe Dolphins]] [[rugby league]] football club, who play in the [[Queensland Cup|Queensland Intrust Super Cup]].

The ground regularly hosts pre-season [[National Rugby League|NRL]] trials, and hosted the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Queensland Cup Grand Finals.

==History==
The creation of the Dolphin Oval began when the [[City of Redcliffe|Redcliffe City Council]] made re-claimed land available for sporting fields in the 1970s. The [[Redcliffe Dolphins]], who at the time were based at the Redcliffe Showgrounds, showed immediate interest and applied for the maximum area available. Redcliffe City Council engineer Kevin Tibbets took to the construction of the ground with the utmost enthusiasm, with the football club even hosting a trip interstate for him to study playing arenas in New South Wales.

The transition from the Redcliffe Showgrounds to Dolphin Oval presented some major problems. Due to the isolation of the area at the time of construction, normal services were not readily available and therefore had to be brought in. Due to the gravity flow to Klingner Road, expensive sewerage pumps had to be brought in, power for the floodlights had to go underground to the main oval and the run-through tunnel was [[transhipped]] from Western Australia at a cost of $9,000, which was still cheaper than buying one from the Eastern states.

The lighting at the showgrounds was far superior, but the Redcliffe Rugby League Old Boys, led by Neil Okamura, contributed a $5,000 loan, which was later turned into a grant, for suitable floodlighting. They also constructed a perimeter playing fence around the main oval at a cost of $2,780. In return, the football club provided the Old Boys with a solid can-booth at the northern end of the complex and were granted the rights to sell liquor on a commission basis.

The pressure to build a licensed club at Dolphin Oval was met with a great deal of caution, especially when the existing club at the Showgrounds was still profitable. But within 12 months after the sod-turning ceremony, the new clubhouse was opened by the Mayor of Redcliffe, Ald. Alf Charlish. With the help of the Federal Member for Petrie, [[Dean Wells (politician)|Dean Wells]], and his Government's contribution through their C.E.P. Funding, along with the football club's own financial arrangements with the [[Commonwealth Bank]], the move was made possible.

However the heavily publicised and enforced "Don't Drink and Drive" policy by the Government struck the thriving bar trade, and, according to ''From Shellgrit to Dolphins'', a book on the History of the Redcliffe Dolphins, says: 
''"Suffice to say the club only barely kept its doors open and its creditors at bay until the advent of poker machines in 1992, but proudly was able to meet its financial commitments"''

In January 1979, the committee proposed to name the complex the Don McLennan Oval, but Mr McLennan requested that it be called Dolphin Oval.

Fittingly, the first game at Dolphin Oval was between [[Redcliffe Dolphins|Redcliffe]] and [[Norths Devils|Norths]], the club that originally proposed Redcliffe's admission into the BRL. The original lease was acquired to 1998 and later extended to 2008, before the Redcliffe Dolphins bought the land.

==Redevelopment and renaming==
The ground was redeveloped between 2015 and 2018 following announcement of the programme in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/moreton/redcliffe-dolphins-has-revealed-plans-for-a-12-million-stadium-at-dolphin-oval/story-fni9r1i7-1226907637419 |title=Redcliffe Dolphins has revealed plans for a $12 million stadium at Dolphin Oval |date=6 May 2014 |work=Courier Mail |accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After securing funding from [[Moreton Bay Region|Moreton Bay Regional Council]] and the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government funding]] phase 1 of the redeveloped ground, now called Dolphin Stadium was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/moreton/new-redcliffe-dolphins-rugby-league-stadium-takes-shape-at-redcliffe/news-story/5989b6fccb7a068ee37fe3ab8165991f?nk=c0e4c77c696a080799051b273655d281-1517932856 |title=New Redcliffe Dolphins rugby league stadium takes shape at Redcliffe |work=Courier Mail |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second phase of work completed in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redcliffedolphins.com.au/dolphin-stadium/ |title=Dolphin Stadium |publisher=Redcliffe Dolphins |accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3006">The '''Iskandar Johor Open''' was a [[golf]] tournament held in [[Malaysia]] and part of the [[Asian Tour]]. It was first held in 2007 when it was played at the Royal Johor Country Club in [[Johor Bahru District|Johor Bahru]]. 

The 2008 purse was US$500,000. In 2009, Johor Open's purse was doubled to a size of US$1 million. The prize fund in 2010 was US$1.25 million, the joint richest event sanctioned solely by the Asian Tour, alongside the [[Hero Honda Indian Open]], and 8th richest event of the Asian Tour. The 2011 Johor Open was added to the [[European Tour]] and the purse increased to US$2 million. In 2012, the Johor Open was no longer a European Tour event but the prize money remained at US$2 million. The tournament was discontinued after 2012.
 
The Championship was supported by the [[Johor]] state government and the [[Iskandar Region Development Authority]] (IRDA).

'''JSC ZAZ Stadium''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Zaporizhia]], [[Ukraine]] that belongs to the Zaporizhia Car-manufacturing Plant ([[ZAZ]]). The stadium's capacity is 15,000 people.

The stadium is located right next to the factory, just across a railroad. It is located in the southern part of the city and urban residential area. Near the stadium flows a small river Mokra-Moskovka which is a left tributary of [[Dnieper]]. Near the stadium is located a train station Zaporizhia-1, while the stadium itself is about mile away down the Kosmichna vulytsia (local street) from the main highway {{Highway M (Ukraine)|18}} {{European route E|105}}. 

Originally the stadium was a home to the factory team [[FC Torpedo Zaporizhia]] that existed in 1982-2002.

In 2001-2006 the stadium was the home of [[FC Metalurh Zaporizhia]] as the [[Ukrainian Premier League|Ukrainian Top League]] suspended Metaurh's home stadium in 2001 due to safety concerns. In July 2006, the team returned to its renovated [[Slavutych Arena]]. 

Here on 7 May 2002 during the Ukrainian Top League game Metalurh - Dynamo, [[Valeriy Lobanovsky]] received a heart attack, after which five days later he died in one of the Zaporizhia city clinics.

'''John Hemmingham''' (born 26 February 1963) is an association football supporter and football administrator from [[Sheffield]], England. He is best known as the leader and trumpet player of the [[Pukka Pies England Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18431515 |title=Euro 2012: England band 'has bulldog spirit' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemmingham first started playing music at football in 1993 with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] fans. In 1996, he was invited to play at [[England national football team]] matches. He has since played at other sporting events including the [[Olympics]] and [[boxing]] matches.

Hemmingham also works in football administration. He started in 2001 as the chief executive of [[Wednesdayite|The Owls Trust]] until a dispute with the Sheffield Wednesday chairman caused him to resign in 2004. Hemmingham then went on to work at other football clubs, including [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] before taking a position at Sheffield Wednesday after his relations improved with them. He also married in 2007.

== Band ==

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Hemmingham started playing music at football matches in 1993 when he took a bugle to a Sheffield Wednesday match away at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Goodison Park]] and played the fanfare to [[Aida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englandfans.thefa.com/ef/pages/news.aspx?id=45636dd8-a94b-444a-97a3-c6bee0e4d081 |title=Band Aid |publisher=The Football Association |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action was noticed by local newspapers and after a phone call to Hemmingham from Sheffield Wednesday manager, [[Trevor Francis]],&lt;ref name=fl /&gt; Sheffield Wednesday then hired Hemmingham and group of Sheffield Wednesday supporters to form an official club band which became known as the "''Kop Band''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duleep Allirajah |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D3E3.htm |title=The Sheffield Wednesday Kop Band banned |publisher=Spiked Online |date=31 January 2002 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the band became popular, Hemmingham and the Kop Band have been banned from [[Steel City derby]] rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]'s stadium, [[Bramall Lane]] a number of times. In 2002, they were banned from Bramall Lane because Sheffield United were concerned that playing music might lead to "unsafe crowd movement" and "unacceptable structural movement" by Sheffield United's safety officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+BRASSED+OFF+BAND.-a082280522 |title=Brassed off Band. |publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' (The Free Library) |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they were also banned because it was claimed by Sheffield United officials that playing music might cause structural damage to the stands to which, Hemmingham led criticism of it calling the ban "laughable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/120431/.html |title=All the top football stories |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
In 1996, Hemmingham, along with the Kop Band, were invited by the head of [[The Football Association]], [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] to form a supporters band for the England national team in time for [[UEFA Euro 96]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heard |first=Chris |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3579800.stm |title=Great Escape soccer fans' tribute |publisher=BBC News |date=19 August 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemmingham accepted and the Kop Band became known as the ''England Supporters Band''. Since then, Hemmingham claims he has not missed an England game.&lt;ref name=stags&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7631675.stm |title=Stags chief settling into role |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being viewed as the leader of the band, Hemmingham is also the managing director of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/research/news/?itemno=10143 |title=Drum rhythm on song for World Cup success |publisher=[[Durham University]] |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being offered a recording deal by [[Virgin Group]] chairman, [[Richard Branson]],&lt;ref name=peak /&gt; Hemmingham and the band released ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' theme tune as singles for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=8534 |title=ChartArchive – England Supporters' Band |publisher=Chart Stats |date=30 December 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119064241/http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=8534 |archivedate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The England Supporters band then started received backing from commercial sponsors. In 2002, the band was sponsored by British newspaper, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' who paid for the band to fly to Japan for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/150011/.html |title=Band of the Rising Sun |work=The Sun |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the band were sponsored by [[Leicester]]-based company [[Pukka Pies]], becoming known as the Pukka Pies England Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2006/05/11/pukka_worldcup_feature.shtml |title=Footballs' pukka band! |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 publishers, Peakpublish announced they had signed a deal with Hemmingham for him to write two books about the formation of the ''England Supporters Band'' and his experiences with them. The books were called ''The Story of the England Supporters' Band''&lt;ref name=peak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakpublish.com/jhemmingham/band/ |title=The Story of the England Supporters' Band by John Hemmingham acquired by Peakpublish |publisher=Peakpublish |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Playing for England''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Hemmingham  | title = Playing for England| publisher = Peakpublic | location =  | year = 2010| isbn = 1907219102  | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sports===
Hemmingham has also led the ''England Band'' to other sporting events. In 2008, Hemmingham took the band to Beijing, China during the [[Beijing 2008]] Summer Olympics to support [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Team GB]]&lt;ref name=fl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/20080814/owls-band-marches-on-olympics_2293322_1365767 |title=Owls band marches on Olympics |publisher=[[The Football League]] |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they were not permitted to enter the [[Beijing National Stadium]] with their instruments and instead played on the streets of Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7571177.stm |title=Olympic ban a sour note with band |publisher=BBC News |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, during the [[London 2012]] [[Summer Olympics]] it was announced that the ''England Band'' would be supporting both the [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team]] and the [[Great Britain women's national field hockey team]] during their matches at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Band-drumming-support-Team-GB/story-16589653-detail/story.html |title=Band drumming up support for Team GB |publisher=''This is Leicestershire'' |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemmingham has also taken the band to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], United States as well as the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] to support [[Manchester]] [[boxing|boxer]], [[Ricky Hatton]]. They have also attended [[Rugby sevens]] matches to support the [[England national rugby sevens team|England national team]].&lt;ref name=fl /&gt;

== Football administration ==
Hemmingham first started in football administration as the chief executive of an independent supporters group called The Owls Trust, which he helped establish, in 2001.&lt;ref name=chad /&gt; The Owls Trust was disliked by many Sheffield Wednesday fans and by Sheffield Wednesday chairman [[Dave Allen (football chairman)|Dave Allen]] as it was perceived that it was a vehicle leading towards a takeover by [[Ken Bates]], then chairman of Sheffield Wednesday's rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], as The Owls Trust controlled a large amount of shares and Hemmingham had publicly stated support for Bates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/3696187.stm |title=Owls ambition drives Bates |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an attempted [[boardroom coup]] by The Owls Trust to remove Allen from the chairmanship in an [[extraordinary general meeting]] in October 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/3763914.stm |title=Trust seek to oust Owls chairman |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, The Owls Trust were evicted from their offices at [[Hillsborough Stadium]], Hemmingham was banned from executive areas of the stadium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amy Lawrence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/07/newsstory.sport4 |title=The game that ate itself |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=7 November 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Kop Band was asked to reduce its numbers by Allen. Hemmingham's ban was then later extended to a full stadium ban from Hillsborough.&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/latestnews/20090109/owls-banned-band-man-is-back_2293301_1512897 |title=Owls' banned band man is back! |publisher=The Football League |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, after securing an area for matchday parking, Hemmingham resigned to take a full-time position at Bates' Leeds United as head of customer services and membership.&lt;ref name=chad&gt;{{cite web|author=Thursday 2|url=http://www.chad.co.uk/sport/football/mansfield-town-fc/new-stags-chief-to-call-the-tune-1-704603 |title=New Stags chief to call the tune |publisher=''Mansfield and Ashfield Chad'' |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Hemmingham receiving death threats from Sheffield Wednesday fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/other-clubs/owls-fan-s-switch-sparks-death-threats-1-2557215 |title=Owls fan's switch sparks death threats |publisher=''Yorkshire Post'' |date=21 March 2005 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Hemmingham left Leeds United and in August, he was appointed as the chief executive of [[Non-League football|non-league]] side, Mansfield Town&lt;ref name=stags /&gt; where he oversaw the expansion of the capacity of their [[Field Mill]] stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Stags-building-future-Field/story-12236452-detail/story.html |title=Mansfield building ambitious plans for future |publisher=''This is Nottingham'' |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2009, he left his position after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/mansfield_town/7809627.stm |title=Holdsworth assembles Stags staff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January, his relations with Sheffield Wednesday improved after Allen was no longer chairman and the new directors at the club, [[Lee Strafford]] and Nick Parker elected to remove Hemmingham's ban from Hillsborough.&lt;ref name=ban /&gt; In 2011, Hemmingham rejoined Sheffield Wednesday as the Commercial Manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday Ladies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://files.pitchero.com/clubs/8596/Vs%20Liverpool%20Feds%20-%20HG8.pdf |title=Sheffield Wednesday Women's FC vs. Liverpool Feds Ladies FC |publisher=Sheffield Wednesday Women matchday programme |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hemmingham has been married since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Cusick|url=http://www.quaysnews.net/Playing_for_England-2564.html|title=Playing for England|publisher=Quays News|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703171243/http://www.quaysnews.net/Playing_for_England-2564.html|archivedate=3 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinesiophobia''' is a term used in the context of [[physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation medicine]] and [[physical therapy]] to describe people's fear of pain due to movement, a factor that hinders rehabilitation and actually prolongs disability and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent HK, et al.

The western-most geographical extreme of Australia is [[Steep Point, Western Australia|Steep Point]], whereas the eastern-most extreme is [[Cape Byron]]. Similarly, the northern-most geographical extreme is [[Cape York Peninsula]], and the southern-most is the [[South East Cape]]. The distance between the east and west [[as the crow flies]] is {{convert|4030|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|3685|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south†. The western-most capital city in Australia is [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and the eastern-most capital city is [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]].

===George Perdon===
George Perdon ran across Australia during the 1973 Trans-Continental Run, completing the {{convert|4807|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} journey in 47 days, 1 hour and 54 minutes. He averaged {{convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} per day, and set records for {{convert|1000|mi|km}}, {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, {{convert|2000|mi|km}} and {{convert|2600|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=George Perdon|url=http://www.aura.asn.au/GeorgePerdon.html|date=|accessdate=21 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719165432/http://www.aura.asn.au/GeorgePerdon.html|archivedate=19 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perdon became a household name in 1973 when competing in the 1973 Trans Australia race and racing his rival - Tony Rafferty. Perdon was unable to get time off work at the appropriate time and missed the official start, giving Rafferty one week's head start before heading off from Fremantle. Perdon was to end up beating Rafferty into Sydney by a day. They took slightly different routes during the run, causing the run to generate front-page headlines for a majority of the journey.&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;

Perdon died on 29 June 1993.&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;

===Tony Rafferty===
In 1972, Tony Rafferty became the first man to run from Melbourne to Sydney, pioneering ultra-distance running in Australia. He was also the first man to run from Perth to Adelaide, Adelaide to Brisbane, Melbourne to Brisbane and Sydney to Brisbane. In 1978, he became the first man to run from Melbourne to Sydney and return.&lt;ref name = "rafferty4"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Speaker Tony Rafferty|url=http://www.icmi.com.au/Speaker/Sports/Tony_Rafferty/Biography|date=|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August to October 1973 Tony became the first person to run from [[Fremantle]] to the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], and in the process became the first person to run across the [[Nullarbor Plain]].&lt;ref name="rafferty1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Tony Rafferty|url=http://www.aura.asn.au/TonyRafferty.html|date=|accessdate=21 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219222126/http://www.aura.asn.au//TonyRafferty.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the run in 74 days.&lt;ref name = "rafferty3"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=A History of the Marathon Race — 490 B.C. to 1975|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1976/JSH0302/jsh0302d.pdf|date=|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony has received many commendations for his achievements. Most notably, he was a [[Olympic Flame|Torch Bearer]] for the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]], and the recipient of the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] (OAM) in 2002 for services to Ultramarathon Running and the promotion of Community Fitness.&lt;ref name="rafferty1"/&gt;

===Ron Grant===
{{main article|Ron Grant (runner)}}
In 1983, Ron Grant ran {{convert|13383|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} around Australia in 217 days. Ron completed the run in an anticlockwise direction. Starting in [[Brisbane]], he then proceeded to [[Townsville]], [[Mt Isa]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], then back to Brisbane. He maintained an overall daily average of {{convert|61.67|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}, and was the first person to do it solo. Soon after this achievement, he was awarded the Queensland Sportsman of the year Award in 1983, Queenslander of the Year in 1984, and the [[Order of Australia]] in 1984.&lt;ref name = "grant1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Ron Grant|url=http://austultrahistory.wikispaces.com/Ron+Grant|date=|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "grant2"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=World Harmony Run: 75 Ron Grant|url=http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/au/torch_bearer/gallery/75_ron_grant|date=|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sarah Fulcher set her incredible record one marathon at a time. It was an unparalleled feat that will take a heck of a commitment to beat. During her record run, Fulcher averaged 10 minutes per mile."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, B. (1989, March). The longest run ever. Women's Sports and Fitness Magazine, 11(2), 67&lt;/ref&gt; "This would also make her the youngest person (at that time) to make any transcontinental run."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crazyfeatherspublishing.com/ Morris, D (2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9936">The ''Nike Hypervenom'' is a [[football boot]] that is manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. This type of boot is said to be for traction, power, and agility, designed for deceptive players. Therefore, it is endorsed/worn by players, notably [[Forward (association football)|forwards]], such as [[Robert Lewandowski]], [[Kylian Mbappé]], [[Harry Kane]], [[Edinson Cavani]], [[Gonzalo Higuaín]], [[Marcus Rashford]], [[Mauro Icardi]], [[Riyad Mahrez]], [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang|Aubameyang]] and [[Thiago Alcântara|Thiago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nike Hypervenom 3|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-hypervenom-3|website=Nike News|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nike Just Gave AS Monaco Sensation Kylian Mbappé His First Pair of Personalised Boots |url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2017/05/nike-kylian-mbappe |agency=Complex |date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the ''Nike Hypervenom Phantom'' was launched. It was launched and designed for Brazilian forward [[Neymar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Nike Hypervenom boots launched by Neymar in Rio|url=https://www.t3.com/news/new-nike-hypervenom-boots-launched-by-barca-bound-neymar-in-rio|website=T3|accessdate=October 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boot is currently in its third version. There is one high-end model for the first version, the ''Hypervenom Phantom''; whereas, there are two high-end models for the second version—the ''Nike Hypervenom Phantom II'', which is a mid-cut variant and the ''Nike Hypervenom Phinish'', the low-cut variant. However, Nike chose to discontinue the Nike Hypervenom Phinish from the third silo onwards due to confusion that the mid-cut version was better than the low-cut. The mid-cut version will be called "Hypervenom Phantom DF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nike To Discontinue Nike Hypervenom Phinish Boots|url=http://www.footyheadlines.com/2016/11/nike-to-ditch-nike-hypervenom-phinish-boots.html?m=1|website=Footy Headlines|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boot is available in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions in which all feature a glass nylon soleplate. There are also Turf (TF) and Indoor (IC) versions, in which the high-end model of these variants is the ''Nike HypervenomX Proximo''. The SG soleplate features 6 removable aluminium studs, in which different studs with different lengths can be used, and 6 fixed bladed studs. The FG version has 12 bladed and conical studs. The AG model contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries.

== Background ==
The ''Nike Hypervenom Phantom'' introduced several new features from other football boots at the time. It was made to replace the previous line, ''[[Nike Total 90]] (T90)'', a line from Nike that has been around since 2000. This decision was met with mixed feelings, in which some say it is a good decision to replace the older line, and the others saying it was not a beneficial idea, as there were not many 'power' boots on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2013/07/09/death-of-the-t90-birth-of-the-hypervenom/|title=Death of the T90, Birth of the Hypervenom!|last=Gauthier|first=Jim|date=2013-07-09|website=Soccer Cleats 101|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hypervenom'' was launched in May 2013, with the [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] player, at the time, [[Neymar]], the main poster boy for this new line. The launch colourway was black/bright citrus. All boots were made in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) varieties, with the SG version using removable studs. The upper of the first boot has a newly developed material of ''NikeSkin.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ha|first1=peter|title=Nike Hypervenom: It's Like Playing Soccer Barefoot|url=https://gizmodo.com/nike-hypervenom-its-like-playing-soccer-barefoot-510134745|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypervenom Phantom ==
The ''Hypervenom Phantom'' was released in May 2013. The boot was first known through a Nike commercial "Nike Hypervenom - Deadly Breed". Later on, more commercials will be made starring [[Neymar]] in which t''he video is counting down to the released date of the Hypervenoms. The boot are advertised to be for "fit, touch and traction". The boots are originally released in the black/bright'' citrus colourway.

The ''Hypervenom Phantom'' features a ''NikeSkin'' upper, combining mesh webbing and thin layers of polyurethane to create a material that is soft and flexible, ''All-Conditions Control (ACC)'' for the same control for any condition, whether wet or dry. The upper of the ''Hypervenoms'' is honeycomed-like in design.  It also feature a lightweight, perforated anatomical sockliner for low-profile cushioning and has a responsive glass nylon chassis with agility traction stud pattern for agility, comfort and durability. Those who use these boots have said that they are able to move freely with ease and felt comfortable in those boots. However, some argue that it lacks proper tightness that they encounter issues such as roll-over or heel slippage. There are also some who said that the boots are not durable and lasted quite a short time under frequent use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reviews.nike.com/9191/599843/nike-hypervenom-phantom-mens-firm-ground-soccer-cleat-reviews/reviews.htm|title=Nike Nike HYPERVENOM Phantom Men's Firm-Ground Soccer Cleat Reviews &amp; Customer Ratings - Top &amp; Best Rated Products|website=Nike|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the knockout stages of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], following a 4–1 win over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in which Neymar scored the tournament’s 100th goal, Nike commemorated this with a special edition pair of ''Gold/Volt/Black'' ''Hypervenom'' boots. This was also made because Neymar spray painted his football boots gold when he was 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/performance/football-boots/2014/06/nike-launch-neymar-hypervenom-goldvoltblack/|title=Nike Launch Gold Neymar HyperVenom : Football Boots : Soccer Bible|website=www.soccerbible.com|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, the ''Liquid Diamond Hypervenom'' was released. It was made to help Neymar "stand out" in a match, to describe Neymar's energetic style of playing and the feelings that Neymar had to his sister was "rare, like diamonds" as stated in a Nike commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neymar Jr. and Nike Introduce Hypervenom Liquid Diamond|url=https://news.nike.com/news/liquid-diamond|website=Nike News|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2015, the ''Hypervenom Phantom Transform SE'' was released. It features a special upper that changes from black to orange when heat is applied to it. This was the last edition of the ''Hypervenom Phantom I''.

== Hypervenom Phantom II/Hypervenom Phinish ==
Two years after the ''Hypervenom Phantom I'' was released, the new ''Hypervenom Phantom II'' and ''Hypervenom Phinish'' was released. This time, there were significant changes to the upper in terms of design and fit. The launch colourway is ''Wolf Grey/Total Orange/Black.''

=== Hypervenom Phantom II ===
The ''Hypervenom Phantom II'' is a mid-cut boot due to the ''Nike Dynamic Fit Collar'' which is made out of ''Flyknit'' said to provide ''ankle support''. As before, it has an ''ACC upper''. It also features a different ''NikeSkin'' upper from the previous version. One of the difference was the use of Nike's ''Flywire'' technology to provide a lock-in and tightened feel for a cleaner strike.

=== Change of upper ===
Due to the complaints about the new upper being too stiff, Nike opted to change the upper to the original ones on the Nike Hypervenom 1, effective 29 May 2016.

== Hypervenom III ==
In February 2017, Nike introduced the next generation of Hypervenom shoes with the Nike Hypervenom III. Nike did away with the Phinish and renamed that shoe 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom'. The collared shoe that had previously been known as the Nike Hypervenom Phantom is now the 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom DF' with the DF standing for Dynamic Fit referring to the collar. Nike have made noticeable aesthetic and construction alterations that make the Phantom III a different experience from the Phantom II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soccerpro.com/theinstep/nike-hypervenom-tier-breakdown-tell-differences/|title=Nike Hypervenom III Tier Breakdown - We Tell You The Differences - The Instep|date=2017-02-27|work=The Instep|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypervenom X ==
As the demand for urban football (street/cage football) is high, Nike created urban football boots using the same materials and/or design of their pitch football boots. The main difference in this line of Hypervenom is the use of gum rubber for the sole of the indoor and turf design.

[[File:HypervenomX Proximo.png|thumb|A pair of HypervenomX Proximo Indoor (IC), which has a flat gum rubber sole.]]

=== HypervenomX Proximo ===
The HypervenomX Proximo has exactly the same upper as the Hypervenom Phantom III. The only difference is use of a non-marking rubber sole for traction on indoor or turf courts and not including the PORON foam inserts

=== HypervenomX Finale ===
The HypervenomX Finale is the high-end low-cut model of the HypervenomX line. However, the upper is different compared to the upper used on the Hypervenom Phantom model. The upper is rather similar to the upper on the first version of the Hypervenom line, the Hypervenom Phantom 1. It also lacks ACC(All-Conditions Control).

The arena is named after former [[Senator of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno S. Aquino Jr.]], commonly known as Ninoy Aquino.

==History==
The venue was formerly an open-air stadium before being converted into a covered indoor arena. Formerly called the '''Rizal Multi-Purpose Arena''', the arena was renovated in time for the 1989 ABC Under-18 Championships hosted by the Philippines, which opened in January 24, 1989. At the opening of the tournament, the arena was renamed the '''Ninoy Aquino Stadium''' and a marker dedicating the arena was unveiled. The renovation included new chairs and a new scoring system from [[South Korea]] installed by Korean technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious no show by Youth cage|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g_oZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2175%2C564278|accessdate=15 June 2015|publisher=Manila Standard|date=4 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sin to bless cage site|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iPoZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2085%2C1404007|accessdate=15 June 2015|publisher=Manila Standard|date=9 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It could have cost much less|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iY8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=awsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5061%2C3667474|accessdate=15 June 2015|publisher=Manila Standard|date=22 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena hosted the volleyball tournament of the [[1991 Southeast Asian Games]], The table tennis competitions of the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] as the second venue of the tournament.

It has also hosted mostly college basketball games such as the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]], [[National Capital Region Athletic Association|NCRAA]] and the [[National Athletic Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities|NAASCU]]. Currently, it is also known for hosting taekwondo tournaments, the two editions of the BSCP National Pool Championships and as one of the alternate venues of [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] games. It was also the home court of the [[Manila Metrostars]] in the now-defunct [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]].

At its onset, the selections were handled by a New York-based public relations firm, Publicity Enterprises, which was led by [[Haskell Cohen]], who was a former sportswriter as well as the publicity director for the NBA at the time (1950–1969). The first All-America team in 1957 consisted of three five-player teams, and the first-team selections appeared on television on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite news|last=Huff|first=Doug|title=EA SPORTS Boys &amp; Girls All-Americans|work=yahoo.com|url=https://www.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1132&amp;CID=356222|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X2J21x11?url=https://www.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1132&amp;CID=356222|archivedate=March 15, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Terry H.

Starting in 2011, the selections were compiled in conjunction with ''[[Sporting News]]'' and their writer, Brian McLaughlin.  Candidates also began to be limited to players in their senior year.&lt;ref name=wroten/&gt;&lt;ref name=2011picks/&gt;&lt;ref name=brian_profile/&gt; The selections went to a single-team format in 2012,&lt;ref name=2012picks/&gt; and the size was reduced from 40- to a 20-player first team in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Brian|title=Escobar named Parade All-American in basketball|date=March 17, 2014|newspaper=Tallahassee Democrat|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/sports/preps/2014/03/16/escobar-named-parade-all-american-in-basketball-/6491273/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XrZfr1W2?url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/sports/preps/2014/03/16/escobar-named-parade-all-american-in-basketball-/6491273/|archivedate=April 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin described the selections as mostly [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] college-bound players that had a stellar senior year in high school.  Additionally, ''Parade'' differentiated itself from most other All-American teams by not focusing solely on a player's standing among [[college recruiter]]s.  For example, some selectors might choose top recruits that had been injured much of their senior year.&lt;ref name=brian_profile&gt;{{cite news|title=Brian McLaughlin|work=Parade|url=http://parade.com/member/brianmclaughlin/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XqWq6Ukw?url=http://parade.com/member/brianmclaughlin/|archivedate=April 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Ernie|title=Jonesport-Beals basketball standout Garet Beal named Parade All-American|date=May 24, 2013|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/05/24/sports/basketball/jonesport-beals-basketball-standout-garet-beal-named-parade-all-american/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XrajHkB7?url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/05/24/sports/basketball/jonesport-beals-basketball-standout-garet-beal-named-parade-all-american/|archivedate=April 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Parade'' discontinued its boys' basketball All-America selections after 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=Brian McLaughlin|user=BrianMacWriter|number=744234941341442048|date=June 18, 2016|title=@bigbluehistory Apparently a decision was made to discontinue those teams I am sad to report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709080057/https:/twitter.com/BrianMacWriter/status/744234941341442048|archivedate=July 9, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Rocball''' is a non-contact [[Team sport|team]] net game derivative of [[volleyball]] and a [[Mesoamerica|Meso-American]] sport once played by the [[sportsperson|athlete]]s of the [[Aztec]] civilization of what is now the country of [[Mexico]]. Rocball has existed since 1979 and was founded by  James Feger, a Physical Education teacher at Marianas High School located in The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The sports is getting popular  in many Asian counties specially India. Delhi , the capital city of India is becoming epicenter of development of the game .  Any volleyball court can be converted into a Rocball arena by simply placing two goalposts at two sides .

==Rules of the Sport==
Rocball is played on a [[rectangular]] court bisected by an overhead net with [[Goal (sport)|goals]] located behind each end of the court.

The offensive team has the scoring advantage because of service and court points. However, either team has the opportunity to score from one to three points during any one play; under certain conditions, the defensive team can score one point plays, the server can score different types of two point plays, the [[Goalkeeper|goalies]] of either team can score two points, any player from either team can score a three-point goal, and there are different ways to win a set of play.

It is the first team net sport to implement offensive and defensive scoring, multiple point plays, plays in which a team can lose point, and the first team net sport to include the combination of [[kicking]] and hitting play action.

==RocBall jargon==

*''Court Point'' - the offensive team scores a point. 
*''Bogey Point'' - The offensive team loses a point. 
*''Jam'' - the defensive team scores a point. 
*''Face'' - the offensive or defensive team scores one point. 
*''Xunk'' - the defensive team loses two points. 
*''Ace'' - the offensive team scores two points. 
*''Kee'' - the offensive or defensive team scores two points 
*''Goal'' - a three-point play in which a team can add points to their own score or reduce their opponent's score. 
*''Juice-Out'' - the manner in which a team can win a game in four sets. 
*''O-Kon'' - Rocball overtime if neither team can Juice-Out in four sets. 
*''Blow-Out/Skunk/Scratch/Match'' - terms used to describe how teams win the different types of sets in Rocball

==Rocball in the Pacific==
Rocball is popular in the island of Saipan, in Micronesia. it is also played in Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.

Players can pay a voluntary fee to receive "supporter" status, which gives access to additional in-app statistics, but comes with no gameplay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turf - Outdoor addiction, Supporter|url=https://turfgame.com/supporter|publisher=Andrimon|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has received media attention from Swedish, Finnish and Danish newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnolds Bjerg erobret|url=http://sn.dk/Holbaek/Arnolds-Bjerg-erobret/artikel/295800|publisher=[[Sjællands Nyheder]]|date=19 March 2012|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spelet som tar dig ut på cykeltur|trans-title=The game that takes you on a bicycle ride|url=http://gamla.hbl.fi/nyheter/2015-08-10/765876/spelet-som-tar-dig-ut-pa-cykeltur|author=Fanny Fröman|publisher=[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]|date=10 August 2015|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="di rusning"/&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Turf'' combines elements from traditional [[orienteering]] with elements commonly seen in many video games, such as a leveling system, leaderboards and achievements. The goal is to collect points by capturing virtual zones using the built-in GPS system of modern smartphones, and try to keep them for as long as possible to compete with other players. Zones are located all over the world, but with the highest concentration in countries with active competition, such as [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]]. Zones are most commonly taken by foot or by bicycle, but occasionally zones are captured by other means, such as by boat and by car. ''Turf'' is by many players used as an [[exergaming|exergame]], a way of combining exercise with gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Han har cyklat minst 2000 mil på två år|trans-title=He has traveled at least 2,000 miles by bicycle over the course of two years|url=http://vlt.se/kulturnoje/1.3079357-han-har-cyklat-minst-2000-mil-pa-tva-ar|publisher=[[Vestmanlands Läns Tidning]]|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=16 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobilspelet som håller dig aktiv|trans-title=The mobile game that keeps you active|url=http://norran.se/livsstil/mobilspelet-som-haller-dig-aktiv-425384|publisher=[[Norran]]|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=16 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been compared with augmented reality games ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Go]]''.&lt;ref name="di rusning"&gt;{{cite web|title=Efter Pokémon Go – rusning till svensk föregångare|trans-title=After Pokémon Go - rush towards Swedish predecessor|url=http://digital.di.se/artikel/efter-pokemon-go--rusning-till-svensk-foregangare|author=Daniel Goldberg|publisher=[[Dagens Industri]]|date=29 July 2016|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game rounds ==
''Turf'' is played in rounds that each last for a month. Collected points by the player reset when a new round starts, as well as all ownership of the zones in the game. Total accumulated points by the player never reset after a round ends, as these are used to determine a player's rank as well as provide useful statistics for players to track their progress. At the end of a round the winner may choose to create a unique, custom zone anywhere, often referred to as a "winner zone".

== Events == 
There are special events arranged when players gather in a city to compete. A major annual event is called a ''Bonanza'', where participants gather in a city and run a standalone game session that lasts for a couple hours. Bonanzas are characterized by dense placement of zones in a game environment separate from the regular game to make the contest a standalone championship. The first Bonanza organized for [[Djurgården]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 21 May 2011. In 2016, it was held in [[Kalmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundratals deltagare väntas till "Turf-VM"|trans-title=Hundreds of participants expected for the "Turf world championships"|url=http://www.barometern.se/kalmar/hundratals-deltagare-vantas-till-turf-vm/|publisher=[[Barometern]]|date=16 May 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turfare jagade mobilzoner i Kalmar|trans-title=Turfers hunted mobile zones in Kalmar|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=86&amp;artikel=6437879|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=23 May 2016|accessdate=16 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Västeråsare anordnar turf-bonanza i helgen|trans-title=People in Västerås are arranging a Turf Bonanza this weekend|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=112&amp;artikel=5249543|author=Natalie Caballero Löf|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=17 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, smaller, events also occur that are similar to the major annual Bonanza event. They can be situated in different places with different orientations ([[canoe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turfande kanotister intog Malmfjärden|trans-title=Turf-playing canoers captured Malmfjärden|url=http://www.barometern.se/kalmar/turfande-kanotister-intog-malmfjarden/|author=Peter Karlsson|publisher=[[Barometern]]|date=30 August 2015|accessdate=20 July 2016|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; only by foot, long seclusion etc.) In 19 June 2011, one of the first ''Turf'' events was at [[Dreamhack]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TURF @ Dreamhack|url=http://www.dreamhack.se/DHS11/2011/06/16/turf-dreamhack|publisher=[[Dreamhack]]|accessdate=17 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event can also be a closed event where only the invited have access, with small groups such as school physical education. In 2016, more than 300 physical education lessons consisted of "orientation" of the Turf.&lt;ref name="di rusning"/&gt;

[[Volleyball]] is a sport played all over India, both in rural as well as urban India. It is a popular recreation sport. India is ranked 5th in [[Asia]], and 27th in the world. Doing well in the youth and junior levels, India came in second in the 2003 World Youth Championships. Currently, a major problem for the sport is the lack of sponsors. The Indian senior men's team is currently ranked 39th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fivb.org/en/volleyball/VB_Ranking_M_2012-08.asp |title = FIVB World Rankings | accessdate = 2013-01-11 | author = Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A league has been started in India for volleyball with six teams participating in four round robin format at four different venues ([[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Yanam]]), i.e. one round at one venue. It is called [[Indian Volley League]]. The teams come from [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Yanam]] and two state teams [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]].
