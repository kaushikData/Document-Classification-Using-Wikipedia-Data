      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''Billie Barry''' (d. 30 September 2014) was an Irish singer, dancer and choreographer who founded the Billie Barry Stage School in 1964.

Billie Barry was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Her father John Clarke-Barry was a respected musician who took part in many orchestras. Her mother was an amateur operatic singer. Barry started performing as a singer at the age of five. She later joined the Barry Sisters singing group, which toured Ireland and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/billie-barry-legend-of-irish-stage-dies-1.1946871 | title=Billie Barry, legend of Irish stage, dies | work=Irish Times | date=30 September 2014 | accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She started the [[stage school]] after her husband Paddy was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Paddy died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/theatre-arts/family-pay-tribute-as-irish-stage-school-legend-billie-barry-dies-30627114.html | title=Billie Barrie Dies | work=Irish Independent| date=30 September 2014 | accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billie Barry became a household name in Ireland due to the success the school enjoyed. Notable pupils include [[Angeline Ball]], [[Susan McFadden]], [[Brian McFadden]], [[Mikey Graham]] (of [[Boyzone]]), [[Samantha Mumba]], [[Hilda Fay]], [[Louise Bowden]], [[Brenda Donoghue]], [[Lisa Lambe]], [[Ruth-Anne Cunningham]], [[Devon Murray]] and Jacinta Whyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billiebarrystageschool.ie/ | title=Billie Barry Stage School | accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BlueJ''' is an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale [[software development]]. It runs with the help of JDK (Java Development Kit).

BlueJ was developed to support the learning and teaching of [[object-oriented programming]], and its design differs from other development environments as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using BlueJ to Introduce Programming|url=http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/pubs/2008/2697/content.pdf|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main screen graphically shows the class structure of an application under development (in a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-like diagram), and objects can be interactively created and tested. This interaction facility, combined with a clean, simple user interface, allows easy experimentation with objects under development. Object-oriented concepts ([[Class (computer science)|classes]], [[Object (computer science)|objects]], communication through [[Method (computer science)|method calls]]) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.

== History ==

The development of BlueJ was started in 1999 by  lord fury and [[John Rosenberg (academic)|John Rosenberg]] at [[Monash University]], as a successor to the [[Blue programming language|Blue]]&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Object-Oriented Program Development Environment for the First Programming Course|url=https://kar.kent.ac.uk/21392/1/ObjectKolling.pdf|accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; system. BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the [[Eiffel_(programming_language)|Eiffel]] language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language.

In March 2009, the BlueJ project became [[free and open source software]], and licensed under [[GNU GPL]] with the [[Classpath exception#The classpath exception|classpath exception]].

BlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at [[King's College London]], England, where Kölling works.

== Functionality ==

BlueJ has a simpler interface than most professional IDEs, but its functionality is not a subset of those kinds of environment. While many of the standard development tools exist, such as an editor, compiler and runtime environment, it also offers tools that are specific to its educational goals and not found in this form in common professional environments. These includes interactive object creation and method invocation (via the "Object Bench"), simplified debugging and teamwork controls, interactive, line-based expression and statement evaluation (via the "Code Pad"), and automated creation of JUnit classes from recordings of interactive test sequences.

=== Visualisation ===


The BlueJ interface emphasises class structure (in preference of source code) by showing a UML-like diagram as its main screen. Class structures can be manipulated by the user, and the class relation display is generated automatically from the source code.

Source level structure is visualised through ''scope highlighting'' (the visual emphasis of lexical scope through use of graphical frames and background colour).

=== Interaction and experimentation ===


Supported interaction features include the ability to create objects interactively for ad-hoc testing and experimentation, and support for interactive invocation of public methods. Parameters may be passed and objects can be composed in interactive calls. 

Interactive tests may be recorded and stored as standard unit test classes. Code fragments can be evaluated interactively in the Code Pad, which provides a Java-based [[REPL]].

=== Supported languages ===


BlueJ supported programming in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and in Stride &lt;ref&gt;[http://stride-lang.net Stride]&lt;/ref&gt;. Java support was provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017. 

== Teacher support ==

Support for teachers using BlueJ in their classroom is provided via the Blueroom &lt;ref&gt;[https://blueroom.bluej.org Blueroom]&lt;/ref&gt;, an educator community site offering teaching resources and discussion forums. An introductory textbook is available &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/ Objects First With Java]&lt;/ref&gt;.

After WWII Rosario returned to Puerto Rico where he worked as an X-Ray technician. In the  1950s he moved to Montana and joined the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He was later transferred to  [[Washington, D.C.]]  where he worked as an X-Ray technician until 1957. Then he worked at the [[American Lung Association|National Tuberculosis Association]] until 1967 and for the Washington D.C. Health Department from 1967 to 1969.

In 1970, Mayor [[Walter E. Washington]] hired Rosario to head the newly formed Spanish Community Advisory Committee which was later named the [[Office of Latino Affairs of the District of Columbia|Office of Latino Affairs]]. In 1980 he served as the Assistant Director of the D.C. Office on Aging, until he retired in 1984.

=== Family ===
Carlos Rosario married Carmin Maria Rosario of Washington and had three sons: Carlos M. Rosario Jr., Jose Rosario, and Reinaldo Rosario; and two daughters, Leticia Rosario and Vilma Tirado.

== Activism ==

Carlos Rosario created various programs that allow Hispanic Americans and Hispanic immigrants to integrate into American society,&lt;ref name="example of how the school helps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meléndez-Vela|first1=Milagros|title=Alcanza sus sueños de superación gracias a escuela para adultos en DC|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/eltiempolatino/2016/09/29/2e96c4e6-8414-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html|language=Spanish|agency=Washington Post|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

'''''Cow Clicker''''' is an [[Incremental game|incremental]] [[social network game]] on [[Facebook]] developed by [[game studies|video game researcher]] [[Ian Bogost]]. The game serves as a [[Deconstruction|deconstructive]] satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn "clicks" by clicking on a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's [[pasture]] allows the user to also receive "clicks" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as "Mooney" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.

In the wake of a controversial speech by [[Zynga]]'s president at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] in 2010, Bogost developed ''Cow Clicker'' for a presentation at a [[New York University]] seminar on [[Social network game|social gaming]] in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and [[monetization]] rather than the artistic aspects of the [[Media (communication)|medium]]. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used ''Cow Clicker'' to parody other recent gaming trends, such as [[gamification]], [[Educational software|educational]] [[Mobile app|apps]], and [[alternate reality game]]s.

Some critics praised ''Cow Clicker'' for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.

==Gameplay==
The player is initially given a [[pasture]] with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a "click" is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] known as "Mooney" can be bought with [[Facebook Credits]]; it can be used to purchase special "premium" cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.&lt;ref name=edge-cc&gt;{{cite web|title=Poking at Cow Clicker|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/poking-cow-clicker|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|accessdate=July 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804162626/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/poking-cow-clicker|archivedate=August 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tc-clickingcows&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsotsis|first=Alexia|authorlink = Alexia Tsotsis|title=Why Clicking Cows Brings Us Closer Together|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/26/cow-clicker-facebook/|date=July 7, 2010|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Creation and development===
At the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]], [[Zynga]]'s game ''[[FarmVille]]'' was awarded the "Best New Social/Online Game" at its [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their "[[freemium]]" games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack "artistic" gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited [[Indie game|independent game developers]] to join his company.&lt;ref name=wired-cc&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanz|first=Jason|title=The Curse of Cow Clicker|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_cowclicker/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=February 21, 2012|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the conference, Bogost coined the term "cow clickers" to describe games such as ''FarmVille'' which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, "you click on a cow, and that’s all you do." Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the [[Laboratory rat|rats]] in [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Operant conditioning chamber|operant conditioning experiment]], often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;

In July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a [[New York University]] seminar, "Social Games On Trial", to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled ''Cow Clicker''. The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of ''FarmVille'': to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase [[virtual goods]].&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt; The bulk of the code was written in three days.&lt;ref name="fb data"/&gt;

''Cow Clicker'' is similar to the 2013 game ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' by Julien Thiennot, which [[Ian Bogost]] describes as ''Cow Clicker''{{'s}} "logical conclusion".&lt;ref name="Play Anything"&gt;{{cite book|title=Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games|isbn=9780465096503|last=Bogost|first=Ian|date=2016|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Updates===
Unexpectedly to Bogost, ''Cow Clicker'' became a [[viral phenomenon]], amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden [[Cowbell]] for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' ''Cow Clicker'' news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]], and the "Stargrazer Cow", which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around [[United States dollar|$]]20's worth of Mooney.&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|url=http://kotaku.com/5846080/the-life+changing-20-rightward+facing-cow|title=The Life-Changing $20 Rightward-Facing Cow|date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used ''Cow Clicker'' to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an [[API]] to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed "Cowclickification"), the spin-off game  ''Cow Clicker [[Bejeweled Blitz|Blitz]]'' (co-developed with [[PopCap Games]] co-founder Jason Kapalka), "My First Cow Clicker" for [[iOS]] (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to "train" children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a "Cow Clicktivism" campaign where users could click on an [[emaciation|emaciated]] cow to donate to [[Oxfam America]]{{emdash}}with a goal of donating an actual cow to a [[third world]] country. The cow, known as the "Cowclicktivist Cow", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.&lt;ref name=edge-cc/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku"/&gt;

==="Cowpocalypse" event and conclusion===
In 2011, an [[alternate reality game]] known as the "Cow ClickARG" was held, where a series of clues from the "bovine gods" eventually revealed that a "[[Apocalypse|Cowpocalypse]]" would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to [[Supplication|supplicate]] with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month.&lt;ref name=clickness&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clickness Unto Death|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/the_clickness_unto_death.shtml|publisher=Ian Bogost|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been [[rapture]]d. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the "end" of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that "it wasn't very fun before."&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cow Clicker Founder: If You Can't Ruin It, Destroy It|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/18/142518949/cow-clicker-founder-if-you-cant-ruin-it-destroy-it|publisher=NPR|date=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data collection===
In 2018, Bogost wrote an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' discussing the collection of data by [[Facebook]] apps, with reference to ''Cow Clicker'', following a scandal involving [[Cambridge Analytica]]'s use of Facebook data. Bogost notes that Facebook apps appear to be part of the website itself, whereas they actually operate with almost no oversight. He claims that "without even trying", ''Cow Clicker'' stored its users' Facebook ID and any networks (such as workplaces) that the user was a part of, and that this information is still stored on his private server. Bogost notes that he could have used this data for malicious purposes, criticising Facebook's "move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development".&lt;ref name="fb data"&gt;{{cite news |title=My Cow Game Extracted Your Facebook Data |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/my-cow-game-extracted-your-facebook-data/556214/ |work=[[The Atlantic]] |last=Bogost |first=Ian |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Cow Clicker'' received critical attention soon after its release. One early commentator was Alexia Tsotsis of [[TechCrunch]], who acknowledged the game's intent as a commentary on the impact of social network games. In an interview, Bogost foresaw the transformation of the internet into a "compulsive virtual dystopia" through Zynga's use of social gaming.&lt;ref name=tc-clickingcows/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;

[[Nick Yee]] of the [[Palo Alto Research Center]] compared the players of games which do not provide "meaningful opportunities for achievement, social interaction, and challenge" to rats in a [[Skinner box]]. Accordingly, he compared Cow Clicker to being inside an "incredibly clear Skinner box"{{emdash}}acknowledging how little effort the game took in order to keep users playing the game. Jason Tanz of [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] considered Cow Clicker as an example of the growth in the trend of [[gamification]]{{emdash}}where developers introduce elements influenced by games into their services without providing the normal "experience" a game traditionally incorporates.&lt;ref name="wired-cc"/&gt;

PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka praised ''Cow Clicker'' for being the type of "ironic, satirical, self-referential" game that Facebook's game ecosystem was lacking, as he felt there were too many commercially driven games on the social network. [[Playdom]]'s Scott Jon Siegel criticized the game for not going far enough in its satire, and putting too many highlights on the "absurd monetisation practices and meaningless clicking which social games are all too well known for."&lt;ref name=edge-cc/&gt;

The '''Cowdrey Lecture''', also referred to as the '''MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture''', is an annual event organised by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) at the [[Lord's|Lord's Cricket Ground]]. 

The event was first hosted in 2001, following the death of its [[eponym]] Late Lord [[Colin Cowdrey]], in December 2000. Colin Cowdrey is reported to have been instrumental in adapting the Captains' Charter as the [[Spirit of Cricket]] and subsequently adding it as the [[preamble]] to the [[Laws of Cricket]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/mcc-spirit-of-cricket/mcc-spirit-of-cricket-cowdrey-lecture/|title=MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture|website=www.lords.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held annually during the English summer and is delivered by pre-eminent cricketing personalities. The event is an invite only affair, with high profile cricketing personalities, représentatives of cricketing boards and journalists in attendance. The format of the event is simple: the cowdrey lecture followed by an informal discussion/question-answer session with a panel of distinguished personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Donna King''' (born 1957) is an American dancer and [[musical theatre]] performer who appeared in Broadway musicals in the 1970s and 1980s and has lived and worked mostly in England since the 1980s.

She is also an actress and has appeared in theatre as well as on film and television.

==Life==
Originally from [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], King trained at the Miller Marley School of Dance in [[Overland Park, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=millermarley&gt;[http://www.millermarley.com/MM/MMAlumniCommon.shtml?../Bios-Alumni/MM-Alumni-KingDonna.shtml Alumni: Donna King] at millermarley.com, accessed 8 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She worked briefly on a revue in [[Las Vegas]] before starting at [[Studio 54]], [[New York City]], on its opening night in 1977. She appeared as one of the good-time girls in the Broadway musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1978), then in [[Roland Petit]]'s 1981 revival of ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'', before originating the part of [[Bombalurina (cat)|Bombalurina]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'',&lt;ref name=dame&gt;[https://www.donnakingdame.com/the-company Biography] at donnakingdame.com, accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biography from Cats program, 1982: "DONNA KING (Bombalurina) This K.C. kitty hit Vegas then split fast. Was an original best little whore from Texas a coupla blocks down. Loved playin' a Frenchie in Petit's Can-Can. Hit the celluloid for a Grease 2 slide. Now I'm exquisitely fulfilled just being an enchanted cat. Thanks for coming."&lt;/ref&gt; which she played from 1982 to 1984. In September 1982, the ''[[New York Magazine]]'' ran a feature on King, who was pictured as Bombalurina in a window display at [[Bergdorf Goodman]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Magazine]]'' dated 13 Sep 1982, pp. 58—59&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a lead dancer in the film ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name=millermarley/&gt;

In 1984, King married [[John Napier (designer)|John Napier]], a British theatre designer who had designed the set and costumes for ''Cats'', and they had two children, James (now the musician [[Jimmy Napes]]) and Jessica.&lt;ref name=dame/&gt; They were divorced in 1994. In 2014, Andrew Lloyd Webber said in an interview about the production team of ''Cats'' — "[[Trevor Nunn|Trevor]], John and I all married a ‘cat’ eventually – so it really was life-changing!" The three “cats” were Sharon Lee-Hill, Donna King, and [[Sarah Brightman]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Stewart, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/11281186/Andrew-LLoyd-Webber-Cats-2014-Nicole-Sherzinger.html 'They told me I was crazy': Andrew Lloyd Webber on Cats] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' dated 10 December 2014, accessed 8 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Donna King appeared in the lead role of May in a revival of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' at the Timber Street Studios, London. The ''Theatre Record'' reviewer reported that she gave a performance of great subtlety, but found King "too bright-eyed and bushy-tailed" for the part.&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Record'', Volume 11, Issues 10-17, pp. 627, 644, 645&lt;/ref&gt;

King had a notable part in [[Jilly Cooper]]'s ''[[The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous (film)|The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous]]'' (1997). In the opening scene, her tryst with the anti-hero, Lysander Hawkley, is interrupted by her husband, who chases Lysander out of the house naked with a crossbow.&lt;ref name=people&gt;Dave Lanning, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61111733.html Sooper-Stud's Flight of Fancy] dated June 8, 1997, in ''[[The Sunday People|The People]]'' (London, England) at highbeam.com, accessed 6 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

She now has a studio in [[Camden Town]] and teaches music, theatre, and film students.&lt;ref name=dame/&gt;

The '''European College of [[Parma]] Foundation''' ({{lang-it|Fondazione Collegio Europeo di Parma}}, {{lang-fr|La Fondation Collège Européen de Parme}}): is a higher education institution which provides academic training for young European graduates in the field of [[European Union law]], [[economics]] and [[politics]]. The educational programme offered by the European College of Parma is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary academic curriculum covering the whole process of European integration.

The educational programme provided by the European College is geared to preparing students for careers in [[European Union|EU]], national and local [[institutions]], professional associations, the corporate world and private practice.

The first unit of the college was created in 1988 as a [[consortium]] of institutions, by the will of the institutions of the territory of Parma and the region [[Emilia-Romagna]] in order to offer students and  community a school of higher education, which promoted the knowledge of the functioning of EU institutions.

==Academics==
The current offer consists of an interdisciplinary academic curriculum on the process of European integration, aimed particularly at post-graduate Master students: the [[Advanced Diploma in European Studies]] (ADES). It was launched  on 27 September 2003 with the inauguration of the first academic year, by the President of European Commission, Romano Prodi [2]. In 2004 was inaugurated the current site of the college and the institute got the legal form of [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]], similarly to the one of the [[College of Europe]] of [[Bruges]] and [[Natolin]]. The goal is to train young European graduates in the fields of law, economics and politics of the European Union.

The Scientific Committee is composed  by: [[Jacques Delors]], [[Romano Prodi]], [[Ana Palacio]], [[Étienne Davignon]], [[Franco Frattini]], [[Martin Bangemann]], [[Alfonso Mattera]], [[Cesare Azzali]], [[Franco Mosconi]], [[Andrea Boltho]], [[Erik Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Website of the European College of Parma&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotions==
Since 2003, similarly to what happens at the [[College of Europe]] in [[Bruges]] and [[Natolin]], each academic year is called "promotion". These are dedicated to prominent personalities that have contributed to the European integration.

[[File:Goodwood Final Line up 2012.JPG|thumb|Goodwood Final Line up 2013 Greenpower.]]'''Greenpower''' is the trading name of a charitable organisation, the Greenpower Education Trust, whose objective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title =About Greenpower 
|url=http://www.greenpower.co.uk/about
|accessdate = 2011-11-07 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to inspire more young people to become engineers by presenting the engineering industry as an interesting and relevant career choice which could help to solve problems relating to the [[personal development|personal]], [[Social cognition|social]] and [[Child development|emotional development]] (known in Britain as PSED) of individuals and societies. The main idea is for teams of students between the ages of 9 and 25 to design, build, and race their own electric powered race cars on top racing circuits such as Goodwood.

==History==
The trust originated from a study by [[Sussex]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] in 1998 which considered the needs of [[engineering]] companies in that region. The investigation revealed low levels of interest in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (the so-called STEM school subjects).

The Greenpower project started in 1999 to encourage students to design, build and race their own electric race cars within professionally drafted [[specifications]] and only a small helping hand from experienced adults. [[Motorsport|Events]] were organized for weekends at major motor circuits around the UK to facilitate attendance from the general public. Circuits included (and still include) Goodwood, Castle Combe and Dunsfold (top gear test track).

Greenpower claims that it now works with 500 schools providing events around the UK. Its Headquarters are at [[Fontwell]] in Southern England and Greenpower national events were run at the nearby [[Goodwood Festival of Speed|Goodwood Motor Circuit]] whose owner is a [[Greenpower#Patrons and Partners|Patron]] of Greenpower. Between 2015 and 2018, the International Final was held at [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]] in the middle of October as a two day event. The final attracts some 170 cars from all over the UK and Ireland with a small number of entries from international teams in America, Poland and South Africa. The Corporate Challenge attracts entries from large companies and universities as far away as [[Poland]], up to 2012 this had been held at Goodwood or Silverstone but in 2013 was amalgamated with the Final of the F24 championship.

On 30 June 2014, Greenpower announced a partnership with the FIA's [[FIA Formula E Championship|Formula e]] racing series, running a support race for schools during the formula e race weekend.&lt;ref name ="formula _e"&gt;http://www.greenpower.co.uk/node/483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==

All Greenpower classes use a 24V, 240W Framco motor and pairs of 12V REC36-12 or YPC33-12 [[AGM battery|AGM]] batteries. These batteries are selected to be reasonably easy to lift, leak-proof and their discharge characteristics determine how fast the cars can go. The motor and batteries are sealed and cannot be modified.
[[File:Spacesuit-Media-Adam-Pigott-Greenpower-Hull-07-27-0029.jpg|alt=A Formula Goblin G2 kit car.|thumb|A Formula Goblin G2 kit car.]]

===Formula Goblin===
[[File:Greenpower Goblins at Goodwood.jpg|thumb|The Gathering of Goblins, at [[Goodwood Circuit]]]] The Goblin Kit Car is offered by as a suitable platform for primary school children aged 9–11. The rules state only this kit may be used which ensures safety for all those competing.  The kit includes all parts and components required to build a complete car - except for the bodywork which is left to the creativity of the team.

The motor and battery, together with comprehensive instructions are included. Only basic hand tools are required to assemble the kit, which can be dismantled at the end of the season and reused by another group.

Race days consist of many events, including that of a sprint race.

The kit is purchased from Greenpower and costs (2018) [[£]]1250.&lt;ref&gt;http://gpshop.theuniprogroup.com/index.php/goblin/kit-car/goblin-kit-car.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula 24===
[[File:Greenpower Formula 24 Cars at the 2011 National Final, Goodwood.jpg|thumb|Greenpower Formula 24 Cars at the 2011 National Final, Goodwood]] IET Formula 24 (F24) is the main racing category - 258 cars completed at least one competitive lap in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://bbk-online.net/gpt/distance11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to 11- to 16-year-olds. Since then, the competition has grown to involve over 500 different schools, each hoping to race their way into the final at the Rockingham Motor Speedway.

The rules are built around the standard batteries and motor along with some safety-based rules. These are designed to be relatively open-ended and with room for innovation, leading to a huge variation in how the cars look. There is a kit car available to allow a simplified entry.

Up to 2013, F24 races consisted of a 4-hour endurance race, and teams could use six batteries in that time (80 minutes per pair of batteries). A minimum of five drivers were required to drive for a maximum of 90 minutes each. Typical average speeds were around 20-30&amp;nbsp;mph.

However, the rules were modified for the 2014 season to change the F24 race into a sprint style event. Teams are only allowed to use one pair of batteries per 90 minute race, with two races during the day. There must be a minimum of three drivers per race.

Prices cover a wide range as different teams use different designs, materials and techniques. The highest costing car doesn't necessarily give the best results. Top cars have ranged from the price of £1200 (excluding batteries and motor) up to approximately £9000. The motor and six batteries cost a total of £404 + VAT, while the kit car is £2750 + VAT (October 2018, includes motor, batteries, team registration and entry to the first race)

The technology and attention to detail evident in a top level F24/F24+ car should not be under-estimated, equivalent energy consumption of &gt;3000mpge is commonplace, as such they can be regarded as being the most efficient racing cars anywhere in the world by a considerable margin.

===Formula 24-Kit Car===
[[File:Spacesuit-Media-Jamie-Sheldrick-Greenpower-IF05-10-18-15290.jpg|alt=Megazord R2 - Bristol Grammar School, and The Chicken - Bormsgrove School line up on the front row of the 2018 IET F24 Kit Car Final.|thumb|Megazord R2 - Bristol Grammar School, and The Chicken - Bormsgrove School line up on the front row of the 2018 IET F24 Kit Car Final.]]
Starting in 2014 an additional award has been given to the best kit car, this is unlike the main F24 championship in that the best result is taken from either of the two races per event as opposed to individual awards for each race. The inaugural kit car international championship was won by Megazord from Bristol Grammar School, with the chassis number 002 it is the first kit car ever sold.

===Formula 24+===

[[File:Greenpower Formula 24+ car at Goodwood.jpg|thumb|A Greenpower F24+ car, "Fireblade" driven by Ross competing at Goodwood in the final round of the 2011 Formula 24+ championship.]]

IET Formula 24+ is for young people aged 16 – 25 and is all about designing and building an electric car with technical regulations that are much the same as those for IET F24. Since 2013, the race has been incorporated with the Corporate Challenge (at some events where companies join the students racing).

Up to 2013, 24+ races lasted 90 minutes while using four batteries (45 minute per pair of batteries) leading to significantly higher speeds than F24. Average speeds range from 25&amp;nbsp;mph to nearly 40&amp;nbsp;mph (depending on the car and driver). Most teams only used one driver, but some would change during the battery pit stop.

The new rules in 2014 shortened this race to 60 minutes, with each race using only one pair of batteries. A minimum of one driver is required.

===Participation===

Any group of young people that fall into the age category can enter the Greenpower competition as a team (including units sponsored by private companies or public organizations such as primary schools and colleges, Institutes of secondary education, and also older people in youth groups, and universities etc.).

==The races==
The F24 season has events held at race tracks around the UK, including [[Goodwood Circuit]], [[Mallory Park]] and [[Top Gear test track|Dunsfold]]. The races last 90 minutes each (two in one day), and the distance completed in this time is submitted to a table of results. The car's greatest distance of the season ranks it in this table, with the top cars qualifying for the International Final, held in October.

The F24+ season consists of similar races, but a smaller number of events are held, in between the two F24 races. These races last 60 minutes, with points being awarded for position at the end of the race to the first 10 cars in the standard 1st = 25pts, 10th = 1pt system. Each cars best 2 regular season results, plus the result from the final round of the championship at the International Finals contribute to the points table.

Each race sees a number of awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title =Greenpower Awards
|url=http://www.greenpower.co.uk/awards
|accessdate = 2012-04-10 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; being presented for engineering, innovation, presentation, best new team and the "Spirit of Greenpower".

Goblin events are run separately and each is slightly different depending on space and team numbers. At most events there are 3 tests that take place: a slalom, a drag and a sprint. The slalom is against the clock, as is the drag race. Each is completed six times which allows for a large group of students to all get the thrill of driving, with the lowest time from each team used. The sprint is a short race (typically three laps) with a few cars on track, run as heats followed by finals as necessary. Points are awarded for each test (1st place = 1 point, 2nd place = 2 points etc.). There are also awards at Goblin events and these carry negative points, helping to reduce a team's score. The lowest overall score wins the event.

==International Finals==
In 1999, the only race held was at Goodwood Motor Circuit, and, as such, is considered the National Final, despite there having been no qualification events in that year. Greenpower regulations have changed to reduce speeds of cars over the years, meaning the 2006 final still has the greatest recorded distance and the greatest average speed of any final (and any race other than the 2006 Race of Champions).
Until 2006, cars could be fully enclosed, but for the 2007 season this was banned, followed by the wholesale ban on windscreens the next year, meaning all cars after this point have been fully open-cockpit. The 2006 season was also the last to feature 6 hour races.&lt;ref name="07regs"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070421044827/http://www.greenpower.co.uk/news/index.php?id=000102&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, the batteries supplied were changed, with a large reduction in available energy, reducing speeds.
In 2014 the finals were restyled as the 'Greenpower International Finals', due to participation from teams from multiple countries, such as [[Silesian University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="internationalfinals"&gt;http://www.greenpower.co.uk/node/488&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2014, it was announced that due to space requirements, the 2015 International Final was to be held at [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]].&lt;ref name="15finals"&gt;http://www.greenpower.co.uk/node/500&lt;/ref&gt;

While on scholarship, the financial expenses of tuition, certain academic fees, a monthly stipend, mandatory books and equipment, and a laptop rental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laptops For Military Docs - How it Works|url=https://www.laptopsformilitarydocs.com/how-it-works|}}&lt;/ref&gt; are paid by the student's sponsoring service.

As inactive reserve officers, the students are required to serve 45 days of active duty for training (ADT) each fiscal year.  While on active duty, they receive the same rights, privileges, and pay, and are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], as any other active-duty officer. For the first two years of training, this duty is sometimes spent attending an officer basic course/school ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050811003445/http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/obc/ Army], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630215751/https://otcn.netc.navy.mil/ois/index.cfm Navy], [https://web.archive.org/web/20050825202417/http://ots.afoats.af.mil/ Air Force]) or executing "School Orders" (participating in clinical training) at the student's university. For the 3rd and 4th years, the student will often carry out elective clinical rotations at a military hospital.  Time spent in HPSP may count towards the 20 years required for a reserve retirement if the member participates in the selected reserve after separating from active duty, and is credited back on a one-for-one selected reserve / HPSP year basis.  No HPSP time (active duty or not) counts towards an active duty 20-year retirement.

Upon graduation, the students are promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in the Army and Air Force, or [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in the Navy, and medical school graduates may be placed on active duty if matched for [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in a military or civilian hospital, while clinical psychology doctoral students have a similar arrangement for their one-year internship. In general, Army and Air Force medical residents are allowed to complete their residencies before proceeding to their first assignments, while Navy personnel complete an internship and then serve as a general medical officer (GMO), with the option of completing a residency following their GMO tour. Student must apply to military residencies and must accept these positions if they are offered. While wages for military residents are higher than for civilian, a military residency requires the student to fulfill further service obligations, which are paid back concurrently with the obligation from medical school.

The incurred service obligation is generally one-for-one for every service-paid year of schooling, with a minimum of two years for physicians and three years for other specialties. Additional time required for certain postgraduate programs, such as lengthy residencies, can result in longer service obligations. Fulfillment of the obligation begins only ''after'' postgraduate training is completed.  For Navy officers, time spent as a GMO is credited towards the service obligation. However, physicians that serve time as a GMO or flight surgeon prior to residency (after internship) will incur additional commitment of one-for-one if they complete subsequent residency training.  This usually results in a longer service commitment than if they entered residency directly (example: 4 year medical commitment - 3 year GMO tour + 4-year residency = 7 year total commitment versus only 4 years if residency was entered directly).  It is important to note that longer initial commitments have a significant negative financial impact; medical officers may take certain multi-year bonuses (which may equal up to 40% of total pay) which will run consecutive with initial residency and certain other commitments, resulting in substantial lost income if residency commitment payback is delayed due to GMO/flight medicine tour or sponsored fellowship/residency.

HPSP opportunities are not offered by the [[United States Marine Corps]], since it receives its medical services from the U.S. Navy.

'''R. John M. Hughes''' (born {{birth date and age|1958|7|15|df=y}}) is a Swedish [[computer scientist]] and professor in the department of Computing Science at the [[Chalmers University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/rjmh.aspx|title=Chalmers Staff Page|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
In 1984, Hughes received his PhD from the University of Oxford for the thesis "The Design and Implementation of Programming Languages".&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes is a member of the Functional Programming group at Chalmers, and much of his research relates to the [[Haskell programming language]]. He does research in the field of [[programming languages]] and is the author of many influential research papers on the subject, including "Why Functional Programming Matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hughes | first = John | title = Why Functional Programming Matters | journal = Computer Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–107 | year = 1989| url = http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html | accessdate = 2010-05-06 | doi=10.1093/comjnl/32.2.98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes is one of the developers of [[QuickCheck]], as well as cofounder and CEO of [[QuviQ]], which provides the QuickCheck software and offers classes in how to use it.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2016 he appeared in the [[popular science]] YouTube channel Computerphile explaining Functional Programming and QuickCheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Computerphile|title=Functional Programming &amp; Haskell - Computerphile|date=2016-11-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnX3B9oaKzw|accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Computerphile|title=Code Checking Automation - Computerphile|date=2017-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfaNEebCDos|accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivory A. Toldson]] has served as editor-in-chief since 2008.

The journal lists three aims as its mission: first, to stimulate the collection and facilitate the dissemination of facts about the education of Black people; second, to present discussions involving critical appraisals of the proposals and practices relating to the education of Black people; and third, to stimulate and sponsor investigations of issues incident to the education of Black people.

Notable contributors in the fields of education, sociology, history, and other disciplines over the years have included [[Horace Mann Bond]], [[Ralph J. Bunche]], [[Kenneth B. Clark]], [[James P. Comer]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[E. Franklin Frazier]], [[Edmund W. Gordon]], [[Robert J. Havighurst]], [[Dorothy Height]], [[Dwight O. W. Holmes]], [[Charles S. Johnson]], [[Alain Locke]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Benjamin E. Mays]], [[James Nabrit, Jr.]], [[Dorothy B. Porter]], and others.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2016}}

== Life ==

After concluding her undergraduate studies at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1991, Connolly began her graduate work at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. After receiving her PhD in 1997, she joined the Classics faculty as Assistant Professor of Classics at the [[University of Washington]]. In 2000, she was hired by the Classics Department at [[Stanford]], and there taught both Classics and Political Science classes. In 2004, she joined the faculty at [[NYU]], where she was subsequently promoted to Associate Professor (2007) and Professor (2014).

== Works ==

Connolly has published two monographs on Roman rhetoric and politics. The first, ''[https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8521.html The State of Speech: Rhetoric and Political Thought in Ancient Rome]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8521.html|title=The State of Speech|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was published in 2007 by [[Princeton University Press]]; the second, ''[https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10378.html The Life of Roman Republicanism]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10378.html|title=The Life of Roman Republicanism|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, also published by Princeton and appeared in 2014. In addition to these scholarly studies, she is also the author of a popular handbook for young academics: ''Going on the Market: A Handbook for Classicists and Ancient Historians''.

'''Key Stage 3''' (commonly abbreviated as '''KS3''') is the legal term for the three years of schooling in [[state school|maintained schools]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]] normally known as Year 7, Year 8 and Year 9, when pupils are aged between 11 and 14. In [[Northern Ireland]] the term also refers to the first three years of secondary education, although these are known as Year 8, Year 9 and Year 10.

==England and Wales==

===Legal definition===
The term is defined in the [[Education Act 2002]] as "the period beginning at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class attain the age of twelve and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class attain the age of fourteen".&lt;ref name=educationact&gt;Defined in section 82 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/82 Education Act 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Key Stage]] normally covers pupils during their first three years of [[secondary education]], although in some cases part or all of this stage may fall in a [[Middle school|middle]] or high school. Some middle and high schools have been piloting accelerated Key Stage 3, by teaching the curriculum over two years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR836.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in at least 15 areas:&lt;ref name=nc&gt;Set out on the [http://www.nc.uk.net/nc_resources/html/ks3and4.shtml National Curriculum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721160225/http://www.nc.uk.net/nc_resources/html/ks3and4.shtml |date=2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Career education]]
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] (in Wales only)

At the end of this stage, pupils aged 14 — in Year 9 — are assessed as part of the national programme of [[National Curriculum assessment]]. Until 2008 this involved a series of externally marked tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/15/sats-schooltables|title=Labour education U-turn scraps Sats tests for 14-year-olds|first=Polly|last=Curtis|date=14 October 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2009, this will be based on on-going teacher assessment, with results for each school being published in performance tables.

==Northern Ireland==

===Legal definition===
The term is defined in The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 as "key stage 3 is the period beginning at the same time as the next school year after the end of key stage 2 and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class complete three school years in that key stage".&lt;ref name=NIact&gt;Defined in paragraph 3 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20061915.htm#3 Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the foundation stage and [[Key Stage 1]] and [[Key Stage 2]] are defined as lasting for seven years in total from the start of [[compulsory education]].

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in the nine areas of learning in the curriculum, some of which include specific subject strands:&lt;ref name=ninc&gt;Set out on the [http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/ Northern Ireland National Curriculum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leading Edge Partnership''' programme was established in 2003 by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The programme's intention was to encourage Secondary schools in England to work in partnership to solve some problems in education. In 2005 the programme expanded.

The programme encourages schools to work to raise achievement through the sharing of proven ideas. There are over 300 Leading Edge schools within the programme.

The '''McGill Executive Institute''' is the corporate education and management development unit of the [[McGill University]] [[Desautels Faculty of Management]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It provides a variety of public business seminars as well as custom [[executive education]] and coaching for all levels of management.

Founded in 1956,&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1308%2C2644596 McGill Management Institute teaches the unusual...it’s where executives go to learn about computers], The Montreal Gazette, Aug 18, 1984, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.

==History==

After establishing the first management diploma in 1906, McGill University began offering evening classes in business education in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2010-2011/sites/mcgill.ca.study.2010-2011/files/desautels_faculty_of_management_201011_0.pdf  Desautels Faculty of Management: Programs, Courses and University Regulations 2010-2011], Desautels Website, PDF retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following Canada's post World War II expansion, McGill University responded to the needs of senior executives by offering seminars in personnel management, marketing, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EIMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20personnel-management&amp;pg=3548%2C915652 McGill University Evening Extension Course listing], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 8, 1950, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3255%2C552133 Executive Development Institute, 12th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 5, 1961, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aMItAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=montreal%20board-of-trade%20seminar%20institute%20executive&amp;pg=4026%2C1105140 Executive Development Institute, 13th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 7, 1962, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8MtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=1953%2C316811 Executive Development Institute, 15th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 3, 1964, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.&lt;ref name="computers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3272%2C1782776 To Help the Executive Grow], The Montreal Gazette - Jul 11, 1963, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the McGill Management Institute was founded to facilitate the more effective delivery of business seminars offered at McGill University.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt; In 1973, the Executive Development Institute merged with the McGill Management Institute and, under the McGill banner, continued the facilitation of the EDC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UhQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1486%2C4031929 Ross Plans Book on University Growth], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 31, 1973, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zYcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=5535%2C2565363 Psychological Survival for Executives], The Montreal Gazette - April 10, 1974, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The merger coincided with a move to its current home in the Bronfman building at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, where it underwent a significant expansion of its offerings. By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt;

In 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the [[Desautels Faculty of Management]].

==Philosophy==

The McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 213, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, ''Executive Education in Canadian Firms'', Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The executive programs at this Institute recognize better than most schools, even among the other eight illustrious institutions discussed here, the need for international diversity and content. Indeed, McGill has been recognized as having an international dimension unsurpassed in North America for diversity among students and faculty, and for program style and content. The scope of McGill's global outlook is certainly equal to that of Harvard and INSEAD, also featured here as giants of international connectivity, which simply must be part of any program involving  executives of international or multinational firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 138, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Products and Services==
Each year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the [[Mini-MBA]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://executive.mcgill.ca/seminars List of Seminars available from McGill Executive Institute website], Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives.  Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.

The McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R.

'''Michael Tracey''' (born August 1948) is a British-American academic and producer with a specialty in [[public service broadcasting]]. He acquired notoriety as a result of his tenure as the head of the Broadcasting Research Unit in London, Britain's leading think tank dealing with media issues, and later with his investigative reporting of the murder of [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey|JonBenét Ramsey]].  He is the author of ''The Decline and Fall of Public Service Broadcasting and the Production of Political Television''. He is currently a professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Tracey|url=http://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/media-studies/michael-tracey|website=University of Colorado Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tracey earned a bachelor's of arts in politics from the [[University of Exeter]] in 1971, followed by a PhD in mass communications 
in 1974 from the [[University of Leicester]]. From 1981–88, he was the director of the Broadcasting Research Unit in London. He has been a professor at the  [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] since 1988.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Tracey|url=https://experts.colorado.edu/vitas/104259.pdf|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==JonBenét Ramsey murder==
Tracey is the producer of three documentaries about the [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey]].&lt;ref name="false" /&gt; He has been a strong advocate of the innocence of JonBenét's parents and critic of the media frenzy that implicated the parents.  On July 9, 2008, twelve years after the murder, DNA revealed that it was not the parents, but an unidentified man responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryckman|first1=Lisa|title=DNA points JonBenet case in new direction|url=http://rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Jul/10/dna-points-jonbenet-case-in-new-direction/|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|date=July 10, 2008|archiveurl=http://rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Jul/10/dna-points-jonbenet-case-in-new-direction/|archivedate=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey has a history of identifying false leads in the murder investigation.&lt;ref name="false"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: CU Professor Has History Of False Leads In Ramsey Case|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/report-cu-professor-has-history-of-false-leads-in-ramsey-case|accessdate=June 4, 2017|publisher=7NEWS|date=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his film ''Who Killed the Pageant Queen?'', which aired June 16, 2004 in the United Kingdom, Tracey claimed to have "stunning new evidence" that was leading police to a previously unidentified "prime suspect." According to Tracey, it was the "investigators’ top priority" to find this suspect, but they were stymied because he had gone "underground."

All of these claims were proved false:
*The "suspect" turned out to be John Steven Gigax. Tom Bennett of the Boulder [[District Attorney]]'s office has stated more than once that Gigax was never a suspect.
*Gigax had not fled from authorities or gone "underground"; he was easily found with an Internet search, because he openly runs a jewelry sales web site.
*Gigax's only tie to the Ramsey case is tenuous at best: he was an acquaintance of Michael Helgoth, who was briefly considered a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtimesbpb.com/Issues/2006-08-17/news/jonbenet.html JonBenet Flimsy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821214557/http://www.newtimesbpb.com/Issues/2006-08-17/news/jonbenet.html |date=2006-08-21 }} August 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Gigax is attempting to initiate legal action against Tracey for falsely implicating him in the murder.

Tracey identified [[John Mark Karr]] to the [[Boulder, Colorado#People|Boulder]] authorities as a person who should be investigated in the Ramsey case. Karr's confession to the crime earned widespread attention, but [[DNA test]]s later ruled him out as a suspect.

Tracey and Karr began corresponding in 2002, approximately two years before the film that implicated Gigax was seen by the public. Radio host [[Peter Boyles]] believes that Tracey was "grooming" Karr to be the next suspect. Boulder District Attorney Mary Lacy made the decision to have Karr arrested, and transported from Thailand to Los Angeles to Boulder, spurred by information provided by Tracey.

Colorado Governor [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] said Lacy should be "held responsible for the most expensive DNA test in Colorado history," referring to the test that exonerated Karr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sink|first1=Mindy|title=Costly flight for suspect in Ramsey case defended|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/08/30/news/ramsey.php|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=International Herald Tribune|date=August 30, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205051258/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/08/30/news/ramsey.php|archivedate=February 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey was once a columnist for the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''.

The '''Michigan Promise Scholarship''' was a merit-based [[scholarship]] program in the state of [[Michigan]] that provided up to $4,000 towards post-secondary education at any approved Michigan institution to qualifying Michigan high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,1607,7-128-38193_44522_47227---,00.html  State of Michigan website: Student Financial Aid-Approved Postsecondary Educational Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; The full amount was reserved for students attending at least two-year programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,1607,7-128-38193_44522---,00.html State of Michigan website: Student Financial Aid-Promise Scholarship factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:MichiganMeritAwardLogo.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Michigan Merit Award logo]]
In 1999, Michigan legislature enacted in Public Act 94 the Michigan Merit Award. Designed to benefit graduating seniors between 2000 and 2006, it granted up to $3,000.00 to students who performed exceptionally well on the [[Michigan Educational Assessment Program]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,1607,7-128-38193_39284---,00.html State of Michigan website: Student Financial Aid homepage-Michigan Merit Award]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2006, Governor Granholm signed Public Act 479 establishing the Michigan Promise Scholarship to replace that award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,1607,7-128-38193_44522---,00.html State of Michigan website: Student Financial Aid- Michigan Promise Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Students were eligible to receive the scholarship if they had taken the entire [[Michigan Merit Examination]] (MME) in their junior or senior year of high school and received at least a score of Level 1 or Level 2 on all components. The scholarship was dispersed in installments, with $1,000.00 available at the start of each of the first and second years and the balance payable after completion of the second year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4uvsob552jzabujlgnjpiujt))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-Act-479-of-2006.pdf | title = Michigan Promise Grant Act, Act 479 of 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-15 | publisher = Michigan Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain eligibility, a student's [[GPA]] at the approved institution couldn't drop below 2.5. If the program a student attended didn't assign grades, the student had to provide proof of having successfully completed the program.

==Current State==
The State of Michigan discontinued the Michigan Promise Scholarship until further notice due to lack of funding. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,1607,7-128-38193_44522---,00.html  State of Michigan website: Student Financial Aid- Michigan Promise Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minhaj-ul-Quran Norway===
'''Minhaj-ul-Quran Norway''' is the [[Norway|Norwegian]] branch of the [[Minhaj-ul-Quran International]] organisation based in [[Oslo]]. MQI established its centre in Norway and Denmark early in 1984. MQI has various community related projects which are supported by the [[Norwegian Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drammenmoske.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=200&amp;Itemid=165 Minhaj-ul-Quran Norway]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main projects is the Minhaj conflict resolution or Minhaj Konfliktråd (MKR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drammenmoske.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=201&amp;Itemid=166 Minhaj Konfliktråd (MKR).&lt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

Minhaj-ul-Quran holds one of the largest annual [[Itikaf]] gatherings during the month of [[Ramadan]] with approximately 37,000 people sitting congregational Itikaf in 2007. It holds the largest [[Laylat ul Qadr]] night event on the 27th Ramadan with millions of attendees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itikaf.minhaj.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;mod=text&amp;tid=1 Itikaf Introduction]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53296&amp;Itemid=2 Around 50,000 to take part in Aitkaf at Minhajul Quran ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401180341/http://app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53296&amp;Itemid=2 |date=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2005 Minhaj-ul-Quran established a full-time institution called ''Gosha-e-Durood'' where any individual can apply to sit for reciting salutations on Muhammad. In the last two years trillions of salutations have been recited. A building dedicated to this purpose with ''Mawlana'' [[Rumi]] style [[minaret]]s is under construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://durood.minhaj.org/durood/index.php?thm=&amp;lang=en&amp;tid=2&amp;caption=About%20Us About Gosha-e-Darood]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minhaj-ul-Quran International is the first organisation of its kind that has initiated interfaith dialogues with religious minorities in Pakistan.

The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has formally recognised and granted a 'Special Consultative Status' to Minhaj-ul-Quran International due to its services in promoting peace, tolerance, interfaith harmony and education, tackling extremism and terrorism, engaging with young Muslims for religious moderation, promoting women’s rights, and providing social welfare and promotion of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ecosoc6458.doc.htm United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Minhaj-ul-Quran organised a major "Peace for Humanity" conference at [[Wembley Arena]] in [[London]] at which, under the auspices of [[Tahir-ul-Qadri]], its 12,000 attendees announced a global [[London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism 2011|declaration]] denouncing racism, interfaith intolerance, extremism and terrorism.&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-24/uk/30198086_1_peace-rally-islamic-scholar-terrorism  “Thousands of Muslims Rally against Extremism in London”, The Times of India, 24 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Minhaj-ul-Quran strategist [[Joel Hayward]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minhaj.org/urdu/tid/13634 Urdu statement]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the declaration text for Qadri&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joelhayward.org/londondeclaration.htm Joel Hayward’s Books and Articles: London Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111000819/http://www.joelhayward.org/londondeclaration.htm |date=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was its second formal signatory after Qadri himself. Notably, senior [[Al-Azhar University]] leaders and dignitaries then signed it before Minhaj-ul-Quran opened it up via the internet for public signing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londondeclaration.com/sign-the-declaration/ Sign The Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to get one million signatures within a year.&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;  The [[London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism 2011|London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism]] is intended as an interfaith document which unequivocally condemns all extremism and terrorism, ”because at the heart of all religions is a belief in the sanctity of the lives of the innocent.”&lt;ref name="London Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londondeclaration.com/shtml |title=London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism |accessdate=2011-10-05 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration adds: “The indiscriminate nature of terrorism, which has in recent years killed far more civilians and other non-combatants than it has combatants, is un-Islamic, un-Judaic, un-Christian and it is indeed incompatible with the true teachings of all faiths.”&lt;ref name="London Declaration"/&gt; The London Declaration also “unequivocally condemn[s] anti-Semitism (including when sometimes it is disingenuously clothed as anti-Zionism), Islamophobia (including when it is sometimes disingenuously dressed up as patriotism) and all other forms of racism and xenophobia.”&lt;ref name="London Declaration"/&gt; Some extremists have already tried to prevent the success of the Declaration via cyber-attacks on the website hosting it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/876601-extremists-block-muslim-website-just-hours-after-it-appears-online Extremists block Muslim website just hours after it appears online, Metro, 26 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahir-ul Qadri announced the largest March in modern times in Pakistan; a march to take place on 14th Jan 2013 at 'Tahrir Square' Islamabad. The agenda of long march is to voice elimination of feudalism, introduction of real democracy, rule of law and implementation of constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paktribune.com/articles/Tahirul-Qadris-entry-in-political-arena-243008.html|title=Tahirul Qadri's entry in political arena|publisher=[[Pak Tribune]]|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

'''Yngve Koehler Raustein''' (17 Oct 1970 – 18 Sep 1992) was a Norwegian [[undergraduate]] student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and a resident of [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories|Baker House]]. On the evening of 18 September 1992 he was walking down Memorial Drive by [[Hayden Library]] when he and his companion were attacked by three students&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N42/raustein.42n.html The Tech, V.112.42]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School]]. Shon McHugh (aged 15), Joseph D. Donovan (aged 17), and Alfredo Velez (aged 18) robbed Raustein and his companion of $33, and McHugh stabbed Raustein, causing fatal injuries. MIT President [[Charles M. Vest]] issued a statement the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N42/vest.42n.html The Tech, V.112.42]&lt;/ref&gt;  A memorial service for Raustein was held on 9 October 1992.

Raustein's murder was the first of an MIT student for over a decade and sparked a [[Town and gown]] debate centering on the tension between the wealthy universities in Cambridge, MIT and [[Harvard University]], and the poorer permanent Cambridge population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N42/safety.42n.html  The Tech, V.112.42]&lt;/ref&gt; A vigil held the week after his death drew representatives from both communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=117812 The Harvard Crimson 25 Sep 92]&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent memorial award, the '''Yngve Raustein Award for Scholarship, Teamwork and Community''', was established at MIT in 1993. Raustein has been memorialized in the [[Garden of Peace]] memorial in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenofpeacememorial.org/ The Garden Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

McHugh was tried as a juvenile, and was released from prison after less than 11 years. Velez testified against Donovan and was sentenced to less than 10 years in prison. Donovan was charged with [[felony murder]] and was sentenced to [[life without parole]]. Donovan (aged 33) in 2009 is appealing against his sentence of life without parole for [[Felony murder rule|felony murder]] on the grounds that, although he punched Raustein, he had no knowledge of a knife or planned robbery. Raustein's family have said that "the life without parole sentence was way too harsh".&lt;ref name=necn/&gt; The [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] declined an appeal in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDC3C150F7967&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=SJC WON'T REVERSE MURDER CONVICTION|last=Associated Press|date=30 March 1996|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Massachusetts Parole Board decided he should be released following six months in a rehabilitative program and one year in a lower level security prison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/07/state-parole-board-frees-third-man-who-was-sentenced-life-without-parole-for-murder-juvenile/TFYJTd8va72z7SFaVfBfbK/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Youth Service Corps''' (NYSC) is a scheme set up by the [[Nigeria]]n government to involve Nigerian graduates in nation building and the development of the country. There is no military conscription in [[Nigeria]], but since 1973 graduates of [[List of Nigerian universities|universities]] and later polytechnics have been required to take part in the National Youth Service Corps program for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==
NYSC was created on 22 May, 1973 as an avenue for the reconciliation, reconstruction, and rebuilding of the nation after the [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]]. It was established based on decree No. 24 that stated that the scheme was created "with a view to the proper encouragement and development of common ties among the youths of Nigeria and the promotion of national unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysc.gov.ng/aboutscheme.html|title=NYSC - About Scheme|website=www.nysc.gov.ng|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Corps members (participants in the National Youth Service Scheme) are posted to states other than their state of origin where they are expected to mix with people from different ethnic groups, social and family backgrounds, and learn the culture of the indigenes in the location they are posted to. This action is aimed at bringing about unity in the country and help the youths appreciate other ethnic groups.
There is an "orientation" period of approximately three weeks spent in a military controlled "camp" away from family and friends. There is also a "passing out ceremony" at the end of the three weeks orientation camp after which corp members are posted to their Place of Primary Assignment (PPA). They are expected to work as full time staff at their PPA with exception of one working day devoted for the execution of community development service. After eleven months at their PPA, corp member are allowed a one month of vacation before their final passing out ceremony where they would be issued certificates of completion.

==Merit==
Nigerian graduates are ineligible for employment in governmental establishments (and most private establishments) until they have completed the mandatory one year service or obtained the relevant exemptions. Graduates who are exempted from the service include those above the age of thirty and those with physical disability. During the service year, Corps members have the opportunity to learn the cultures of other people.

==Objectives of the scheme==

The objectives of the National Youth Service Corps Scheme are clearly enumerated in Decree No.51 of 16th June 1993 as follows:
* To inculcate discipline in Nigerian youths by instilling in them a tradition of industry at work, and of patriotic and loyal service to Nigeria in any situation they may find themselves.
* To raise the moral tone of the Nigerian youths by giving them the opportunity to learn about higher ideals of national achievement, social and cultural improvement
* To develop in the Nigerian youths the attitudes of mind, acquired through shared experience and suitable training. which will make them more amenable to mobilisation in the national interest
* To enable Nigerian youths acquire the spirit of self reliance by encouraging them to develop skills for self employment
* To contribute to the accelerated growth of the national economy
* To develop common ties among the Nigerian youths and promote national unity and integration
* To remove prejudices, eliminate ignorance and confirm at first hand the many similarities among Nigerians of all ethnic groups
* To develop a sense of corporate existence and common destiny of the people of Nigeria.
* The equitable distribution of members of the service corps and the effective utilisation of their skills in area of national needs
* That as far as possible, youths are assigned to jobs in States other than their States of origin
* That such group of youths assigned to work together is as representative of Nigeria as far as possible
* That the Nigerian youths are exposed to the modes of living of the people in different parts of Nigeria
* That the Nigerian youths are encouraged to eschew religious intolerance by accommodating religious differences
* That members of the service corps are encouraged to seek at the end of their one year national service, career employment all over Nigeria, thus promoting the free movement of labour
* That employers are induced partly through their experience with members of the service corps to employ more readily and on a permanent basis, qualified Nigerians, irrespective of their States of origin. Unfortunately, most employers discard these young graduates, waiting for the next orientation programme to get a fresh set of graduates.

==Criticisms==
The program has been met with criticism from a large portion of the country and complaints from Corps members about their remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.punchng.com/news/corps-members-protest-in-kaduna-over-allowances/&lt;/ref&gt; Several youth carrying out the NYSC program have been killed in the regions where they were sent due to religious, ethnic or political violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premiumtimesng.com/news/116447-ex-nysc-members-victims-of-suleja-bomb-blast-accuse-jonathan-administration-of-neglect.html Visit The Official NYSC Interactive Website/ Forum http://www.nyscforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the issue of security, many{{who|date=November 2018}} have questioned the continued importance of the scheme and have called for a dialogue in this regard. Many{{who|date=November 2018}} cite the fact that the program has failed to achieve any of its set objectives. They{{who|date=November 2018}} simply see it as a waste of time and a waste of Nigeria's resources. Some{{who|date=November 2018}} even argue that the program is a conduit for massive corruption, while others{{who|date=November 2018}} see it as government providing cheap labour for schools and its other agencies.

'''Olivier Boissiere''' (Olivier Boissière, born in 1939) is a French writer and commentator of contemporary art and architecture. His profiles, comments, features and interviews have been published in international magazines such as [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]], [[Abitare]], [http://www.larchitecturedaujourdhui.fr/ L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui] and [[Vogue Paris]]. Boissiere is the author of several books about the works of [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]] and [[Philippe Starck]].&lt;ref&gt;archINFORM database [https://eng.archinform.net/arch/4302.htm "Olivier Boissiere, author"]. Retrieved on 03 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been on [[Jean Nouvel]]'s team &lt;ref&gt;Hristov, Ivo.

As an assistant and neophyte of art critic [[Pierre Restany]], Boissière witnessed the emerging of the avant-garde in the Sixties with [[Yves Klein]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]] and others, who held their  exhibitions in Galerie J in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1433397/Pierre-Restany.html "Pierre Restany,"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 2003''&lt;/ref&gt; Later his interests shifted to modern European and American architecture. He was close to the early [[Frank Gehry]] and familiar with the Californian art scene in the Seventies, privileged to encounter great artists such as [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]] and [[Donald Judd]]. A close friend of [[Lewis Baltz]], he still keeps strong bonds with the French art scene as a familiar of [[Sophie Calle]],&lt;ref&gt;SOPHIE CALLE, "Douleur Exquise", Erna Hesse Luxembourg, 2008 [http://www.ernahecey.com/luxembourg/exhibitions_1_details.php Exhibition Rress release]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Charles Blais|Jean Charles Blais]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Charles Blais, SECHS SONGS D'AMOUR [http://www.uncabinetdamateur.bg/exhibitions/past/item/11-sechs-songs-damour#information "Un Cabinet d'Amateur"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Buren]], Bertrand Lavier, [[Olivier Mosset]] and [[Bernard Frize]]. A modest art collector himself, Boissiere gathers his works along some recent discoveries in his Un Cabinet d'Amateur in Sofia, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncabinetdamateur.bg/#information "UN CABINET D'AMATEUR Olivier Boissiere"]&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives and works in Paris and Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;Веселин Трандов, [http://www.capital.bg/light/lica/2013/06/21/2086950_sugrajdaninut_olivie/ "Съгражданинът Оливие"], в-к Капитал, 21 юни 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1960's. Nouveaux Réalistes, Pop and Minimal art. ==

Boissiere’s introduction to the arts started from Gallerie J in Paris, where he worked as an assistant to Jeanine de Goldschmidt and art critic [[Pierre Restany]]. It was the home of the [[Nouveau réalisme|Nouveaux Réalistes]] - an artistic movement, founded by [[Pierre Restany|Restany]] together with [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Raymond Hains]] and others. The gallery did present the first exhibition of [[Cy Twombly]] in Paris, the famous [[Daniel Spoerri]] dinners and the oil barrels of [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]] on Rue Visconti. During this period Boissiere witnessed the opening of the first [[Ileana Sonnabend]] gallery in Paris, where American [[Pop art]] artists such as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] were introduced in Europe for the first time.

== 1970's. Young Americans and Frank Gehry ==

After being a partner in Atelier A, a short lived venture where artists like [[Arman]] and [[Robert Malaval]] designed objects and artefacts, Boissiere was cooped in a small institution under the French ministry of industry to take part in a program promoting French design. He did attend and reported about international design congresses in Moscow, Kyoto, Vancouver, Aspen and Berlin. Soon he was appointed an editor of Architecture Intérieure Cree Magazine, where he introduced the young lions&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Stanley Tigerman: une bilbiothèque pour handicapés, Chicago, Architecture intérieure créé, May–June 1979,171, page 108–112&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the International style who were at that time [[Archigram]], [[Cedric Price]], [[Renzo Piano]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], the Radical architecture in Italy, the American “Post-moderns” after the provoking [[Learning from Las Vegas]], the architectural theories of [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Lucien Kroll]], the works of [[Gordon Matta-Clark|Gordon Matta Clark]].
In the US Olivier Boissière did multiple coast to coast trips, documenting the works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or following the steps of art historian [[Aby Warburg]], who had visited the world of the Hopis in Arizona at beginning of the century. At the eve of his journalistic career, he had encounters with [[Zaha Hadid]], still a student of the Architectural Association, [[Tomás Maldonado|Tomas Maldonado]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Philip Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Dynastie (interview with Philip Johnson), L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, September 1987,252, page 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk]] and [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Ten California Architects, Domus No. 604, March, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Europe he was fortunate to attend the first great exhibitions by curator [[Harald Szeemann]], the Bachelors Machines at UCAD in Paris and [[Documenta|dokumenta]] V in Kassel with works by [[Joseph Beuys|Beuys]], [[Edward Kienholz|Kienholz]] and [[Bruce Nauman]].

== 1980's. Travelling with art and architecture. Lewis Baltz. ==

Spanning his life between Paris, Milan and Los Angeles, Olivier Boissiere became a regular culture and architecture writer for [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]], L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, [[Le Monde]] and some [[Condé Nast]] magazines such as [[Vogue Paris|Vogue]], where he collaborated with photographer Donatella Brun. His journalistic travels ranged from accompanying [[Frank Gehry]] to the reception of his [[Gerrit Rietveld|Gerit Rietweld]] Award in Utrecht through meeting [[Luis Barragán]] in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[Olivier Boissiere, Habitation de M. Francisco Gilardi, Mexico; architect: Luis Barragán, L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, April 1980,208]&lt;/ref&gt; from paying visits to the buildings of [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]] in Stockholm to doing a series of interviews with [[Rem Koolhaas]] in the Netherlands and photographing the [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]'s [[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC Building]] just opened in Hong Kong. During this period he interviewed [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]] in New York after meeting them in Utrecht and visited the studio of [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]] in Los Angeles. His encounter with great artist and photographer [[Lewis Baltz]] was the beginning of a long friendship, marked by a common interest both in art history and [[The Great Game]]. Boissiere wrote texts for some of Baltz's projects, such as Fos Secteur 80 at [[Tate]], La Ronde de Nuit, shown at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] and later Piazza Arnolfo in Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Rian, Last Interview of Lewis Baltz, L’Oeil de la Photographie, 01 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Baltz, Notebooks and ephemera 1987 - 2011, The Getty Research Institute, Special Collections&lt;/ref&gt; His first meeting with [[Jean Nouvel]] had happened during this time.

== 1990's. Working with Jean Nouvel. Book publishing. ==
The competition for the [[Kansai International Airport]] in Japan in the late 80's did mark the beginning of an ongoing episodic collaboration with [[Jean Nouvel]], according to projects, competitions and circumstances. Olivier Boissière acted as a researcher, commentator, advisor and publication editor on different projects in real time, which was full-time with Nouvel, the motto of his office being "If you don’t come on Saturday, forget to come back on Sunday!"&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nouvel by Olivier Boissière, Terrail, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervals he worked both as author and director of the architectural collections for two publishing houses in Paris and did extensive trips in Europe and India, doing a close survey on the legacy of [[Le Corbusier]] along with [[Dominique Lyon]] and photographer Anriet Denis.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Lyon, Olivier Boissiere, Anriet Denis, Le Corbusier Alive, Vilo International, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant ХХ century houses in Europe ranging from the Art Nouveau to the British high tech was the subject for another book.&lt;ref&gt;Twentieth-Century Houses: Europe by Olivier Boissiere, Rizzoli, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A trip to the South West Arizona and New Mexico provided for meetings with architects [[Antoine Predock]] and Bart Prince . As a guest of [[Donald Judd]], Boissière did a large photo survey of the [[Chinati Foundation]] in Marfa, Texas with major artworks and installations by [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] and [[Donald Judd]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Judd: sur la route de Marfa, L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, December 1992,284 page 88–97&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2000’s. Between East and West ==
At the beginning of 2000, Boissiere was a coordinator for [[Jean Nouvel]]'s Morat site for the [[Expo.02]] in Switzerland. Along with Federico Mazzoto he also coordinated [[Jean Nouvel|Nouvel]]'s project for Piazza Arnolfo in Colle d'Elsa, featuring artists [[Daniel Buren]], [[Lewis Baltz]], Alessandra Tesi, Bertrand Lavier. 
Following up Nouvel's projects for the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], directed by [[Thomas Krens]], he visited Baku and The Republic of Azerbaidjan, Rio de Janeiro and [[Oscar Niemeyer]]'s office,  and was granted  private visits of the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in Saint Petersburg and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abitare.it/en/research/2011/12/20/being-jean-nouvel-2/ Being Jean Nouvel], edited by Olivier Boissiere and Maria Giulia Zunino, ABITARE 518/2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1997 Olivier Boissiere has been shifting between Paris and Sofia. Along with Anriet Denis he established Adob Design in Sofia - a showroom, promoting good design, which introduced for the first time in Bulgaria the furniture of the [[Charles and Ray Eames|Eames]], [[Jasper Morrison]], [[Marc Newson]], [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]] and [[Frank Gehry]], the lights of [[Achille Castiglioni]] and [[Ingo Maurer]] and organized exhibitions where Gehry, Maurer and Nouvel were presented. For more than 15 years his voice has resonated as a commentator of the creative processes in Bulgaria. His ongoing commitment for sustainable architecture has been guiding a few of the young Bulgarian architects. In 2010 Olivier Boissiere has been the coordinator of the first ABITARE Talks Conference in Sofia “Do we need museums and galleries” with speakers [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Italo Rota]], David Cascaro and Monique Veaute.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Giulia Zunino [http://www.abitare.it/it/archivio/2010/02/26/abitare-talks-2/?refresh_ce-cp "La prima edizione degli Abitare Talks, organizzati da Abitare Bulgaria a Sofia"], abitare.it, 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under his proficient eye in 2011 the first Sofia Architecture Week was organized by One Magazine, where Boissiere introduced French architects like Anne Lacaton, Dominique Lyon, Frédéric Borel and Rudy Ricciotti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edno.bg/assets/Magazines/edno_broy90_fall2010.pdf "What have we seen so far at Sofia Architecture Week and what are we about to see?"], One Magazine No. 90/2011, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2012 to present. Un Cabinet d'Amateur.==
Being a modest art collector himself, Olivier Boissière works closely with the emerging talents on the Bulgarian art scene, some of which he presents at his private apartment/gallery in Sofia. Un Cabinet d'Amateur, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art, was established in 2012 and has exhibited works  of Kalin Serapionov, [[Svetlana Mircheva]], Marie Maillard, Stela Vassileva, [[Lewis Baltz]], Jean-Charles Blais, [[Sophie Calle]].&lt;ref&gt;Светлана Куюмджиева, [http://www.kultura.bg/bg/print_article/view/22609 "Запознанство със Софи Кал"], в-к Култура, брой 33 (2782), 10 октомври 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Along with artworks, the Cabinet accommodates a small library with Boissere's personal collection of books, catalogs and documents from his longtime journey in the field. In 2015 Boissiere was an advisor to the team of architects Manal Rachdi and [[Sou Fujimoto]] in the "Reinventer Paris" competition. It was a winning entry for a block at Porte Maillot.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Rinaldi, [http://aasarchitecture.com/2016/02/mille-arbres-by-manal-rachdi-oxo-architectes-sou-fujimoto.html "MILLE ARBRES BY MANAL RACHDI OXO ARCHITECTES + SOU FUJIMOTO"], aasarchitecture.com, 04 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
He is currently working on the book about Jean Nouvel's Louvre in Abu Dhabi and a second fiction novel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2151">'''Oren Brown''' (April 13, 1909 – March 6, 2004) was a well-known and highly successful [[United States|American]] [[Vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogue]] and [[voice teacher]].

Born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], Brown attended [[Boston University]], where he earned a Bachelor of Music with an emphasis in vocal performance and a master's degree in music composition. In 1932 he began his long career as a voice teacher which would last up until his death 72 years later. He notably served as a faculty member of the [[Mannes College of Music]] during the late 1940s and was on the voice faculty at the [[Juilliard School]] from 1972 through 1991. Many of his students have had successful singing careers, including [[John Aler]], [[Cecilia (Norwegian singer)|Cecilia]], [[Eva Johansson]], [[James King (tenor)|James King]], [[Ann Monoyios]], and [[Bo Skovhus]] among many others.

In 1952 Brown joined the staff of the [[Washington University School of Medicine]], serving as a lecturer in [[Speech therapy|voice therapy]] and [[otolaryngology]] up through 1968. While there he collaborated with medical personnel to develop an interdisciplinary approaches to voice training, making him one of the first vocal pedagogues, along with [[William Vennard]] and [[Ralph Appelman]], to introduce contemporary scientific research in the areas of human anatomy and physiology into the study of singing. In addition to contributing articles to a number of music journals, he also is the author of ''Discover Your Voice: How to Develop Healthy Voice Habits'' (1996), which is a well-known and highly respected vocal training text.

Brown died in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] at the age of 95.

The '''''Pentagon Papers''''', officially titled '''''Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force''''', is a [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' political and military involvement in [[Vietnam]] from 1945 to 1967. The papers were released by [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview&gt;{{cite news| title=The Pentagon Papers|publisher=[[United Press International|United Press International (UPI)]]|year=1971|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/12295509436546-7/|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Sheehan|title=Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces 3 Decades of Growing U.S. Involvement|newspaper= The New York Times|date=1971-06-13|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/13/archives/vietnam-archive-pentagon-study-traces-3-decades-of-growing-u-s.html|accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 article in ''The New York Times'' said that the ''Pentagon Papers'' had demonstrated, among other things, that the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration]] "systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Apple|first=R.W.|authorlink=R. W.

More specifically, the papers revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the [[Vietnam War]] with the [[Operation Menu|bombings]] of nearby [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], coastal raids on [[North Vietnam]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] attacks, none of which were reported in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="'70s 43"/&gt;

For his disclosure of the ''Pentagon Papers'', Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property, but the charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the [[Watergate scandal]] discovered that the staff members in the [[Nixon White House]] had ordered the so-called [[White House Plumbers]] to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Watergate Story|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/timeline.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|quote=Watergate prosecutors find a memo addressed to [[John Ehrlichman]] describing in detail the plans to burglarize the office of Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, ''The Post'' reports.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0511.html |title=Pentagon Papers Charges Are Dismissed; Judge Byrne Frees Ellsberg and Russo, Assails 'Improper Government Conduct' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 11, 1973 |accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ime Magazine Pentagon Papers.jpg|thumb|Shortly after their release in June 1971, the ''Pentagon Papers'' were featured on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] for revealing "The Secret War" of the United States in Vietnam.]]

[[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] created the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967, for the purpose of writing an "encyclopedic history of the [[Vietnam War]]".&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; McNamara claimed that he wanted to leave a written record for historians, to prevent policy errors in future administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara neglected to inform either President [[Lyndon Johnson]] or Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] about the study.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; One report claimed that McNamara planned to give the work to his friend [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who sought the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic presidential nomination in 1968]].&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rmcn 282"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara later denied this, although he admitted that he should have informed Johnson and Rusk.&lt;ref name="rmcn 282" /&gt;

Instead of using existing Defense Department historians, McNamara assigned his close aide and [[Assistant Secretary of Defense]] [[John T. McNaughton]] to collect the papers.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|1996|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNaughton died in a [[Piedmont Airlines Flight 22|plane crash]] one month after work began in June 1967, but the project continued under the direction of Defense Department official [[Leslie H. Gelb]].&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; Thirty-six analysts—half of them active-duty military officers, the rest academics and civilian federal employees—worked on the study.&lt;ref name="rmcn 280" /&gt; The analysts largely used existing files in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]]. In order to keep the study secret from others, including [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Walt W. Rostow]], they conducted no interviews or consultations with the armed forces, with the White House, or with other federal agencies.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;

McNamara left the Defense Department in February 1968, and his successor [[Clark M. Clifford]] received the finished study on January 15, 1969, five days before [[Richard Nixon]]'s inauguration, although Clifford claimed he never read it. The study consisted of 3,000 pages of historical analysis and 4,000 pages of original government documents in 47 volumes, and was classified as "Top Secret – Sensitive". ("Sensitive" is not an [[Classified information in the United States|official security designation]]; it meant that access to the study should be controlled.) The task force published 15 copies; the think tank [[RAND Corporation]] received two of the copies from Gelb, [[Morton Halperin]] and [[Paul Warnke]], with access granted if at least two of the three approved.&lt;ref name="correll200702"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Correll |first=John T. |url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx |title=The Pentagon Papers |format= |work=Air Force Magazine |date=February 2007|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Correll |first=John T. |url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.pdf |title=The Pentagon Papers |format=pdf |work=Air Force Magazine |date=February 2007|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actual objective of the Vietnam War: Containment of China ===
{{Main|China containment policy}}

[[File:Containment of China.jpg|700px|thumb|As laid out by U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], the [[China containment policy|Chinese containment policy]] of the United States was a long-run strategic effort to surround [[Beijing]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], its [[satellite state]]s, as well as:
&lt;br /&gt;
a) The [[Japan]]–[[Korea]] front,
&lt;br /&gt;
b) The [[India]]–[[Pakistan]] front, and
&lt;br /&gt;
c) The [[Southeast Asia]] front]]

Although President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] stated that the aim of the Vietnam War was to secure an "independent, non-Communist [[South Vietnam]]", a January 1965 memorandum by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] stated that an underlying justification was "not to help a friend, but to contain China".&lt;ref name="cnnpentagonpapers"&gt;{{cite web|title=COVER STORY: Pentagon Papers: The Secret War|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9606/28/index.shtml|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 28, 1971|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,905234,00.html |title=The Nation: Pentagon Papers: The Secret War |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 28, 1971 |accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1965, McNamara sent a memorandum to President Johnson, in which he explained the "major policy decisions with respect to our course of action in Vietnam". The memorandum begins by disclosing the rationale behind the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965:

{{quote|The February decision to bomb North Vietnam and the July approval of Phase I deployments make sense only if they are in support of a long-run United States policy to contain [[China]].&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Robert McNamara]]|title=Draft Memorandum From Secretary of Defense McNamara to President Johnson|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v03/d189|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|date=November 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McNamara accused China of harboring [[imperialism|imperial]] aspirations like those of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. According to McNamara, the Chinese were conspiring to "organize all of Asia" against the United States:

{{quote|China—like Germany in 1917, like Germany in the West and Japan in the East in the late 30s, and like the USSR in 1947—looms as a major power threatening to undercut our importance and effectiveness in the world and, more remotely but more menacingly, to organize all of Asia against us.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;}}

To encircle the Chinese, the United States aimed to establish "three fronts" as part of a "long-run effort to contain China":

{{quote|There are three fronts to a long-run effort to contain China (realizing that the USSR "contains" China on the north and northwest):

(a) the Japan–Korea front;

(b) the India–Pakistan front; and

(c) the [[Southeast Asia]] front.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;}}

However, McNamara admitted that the [[China containment policy|containment of China]] would ultimately sacrifice a significant amount of America's time, money and lives.&lt;ref name="mcnamarachina" /&gt;

Years before the August 2, 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] occurred, the U.S. government was indirectly or directly involved in Vietnam's affairs:
* Under President [[Harry S. Truman]], the U.S. government aided [[French Indochina|France]] in its war against the communist-led [[Viet Minh]] during the [[First Indochina War]].&lt;ref name="nytimespen1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Sheehan|title=Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces 3 Decades of Growing U.S. Involvement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/papers-overview.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 13, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the U.S. government played a "direct role in the ultimate breakdown of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva settlement]]" in 1954 by supporting the fledgling South Vietnam and covertly undermining the communist country of North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;
* Under President [[John F. Kennedy]], the U.S. government transformed its policy towards Vietnam from a limited "gamble" to a broad "commitment".&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;
* Under President Lyndon B. Johnson, the U.S. government began waging covert military operations against communist North Vietnam in defense of South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="nytimespen1" /&gt;

==== Role of the United States in the rise of President Diem ====
[[File:Ngo Dinh Diem at Washington - ARC 542189.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] greets South Vietnam's President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], whose rise to power was backed by the United States, according to the ''Pentagon Papers'']]

In a section of the ''Pentagon Papers'' titled "Kennedy Commitments and Programs," America's commitment to [[South Vietnam]] was attributed to the creation of the country by the United States. As acknowledged by the papers:

{{quote|We must note that South Vietnam (unlike any of the other countries in Southeast Asia) was essentially the creation of the United States.&lt;ref name="nara1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of the War. Counterinsurgency: The Kennedy Commitments and Programs, 1961|url=http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-1.pdf|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=October 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809120534/http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-1.pdf|archive-date=August 9, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In a sub-section titled "Special American Commitment to Vietnam", the papers emphasized once again the role played by the United States:

{{quote
|
* "Without U.S. support [[Ngo Dinh Diem|[Ngo Dinh] Diem]] almost certainly could not have consolidated his hold on the South during 1955 and 1956."
* "Without the threat of U.S. intervention, South Vietnam could not have refused to even discuss the elections called for in 1956 under the Geneva settlement without being immediately overrun by the Viet Minh armies."
* "Without U.S. aid in the years following, the Diem regime certainly, and an independent South Vietnam almost as certainly, could not have survived".&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;}}

More specifically, the United States sent US$28.4 million worth of equipment and supplies to help the Diem regime strengthen its army. In addition, 32,000 men from [[South Vietnamese Popular Force|South Vietnam's Civil Guard]] were trained by the United States at a cost of US$12.7 million. It was hoped that Diem's regime, after receiving a significant amount of U.S. assistance, would be able to withstand the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;

The papers identified General [[Edward Lansdale]], who served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), as a "key figure" in the establishment of Ngo Dinh Diem as the President of South Vietnam, and the backing of Diem's regime thereafter. As written by Lansdale in a 1961 memorandum: "We (the U.S.) must support Ngo Dinh Diem until another strong executive can replace him legally."&lt;ref name="nara1" /&gt;

==== Role of the United States in the overthrow of Diem's regime ====
[[File:Corpse of Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1963 coup.jpg|The body of President Diệm after he was assassinated in the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup]], which was backed by the United States government|right|thumb|200px]]

According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the U.S. government played a key role in the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup]], in which President Ngo Dinh Diem was assassinated. While maintaining "clandestine contact" with Vietnamese generals planning a coup, the U.S. cut off its aid to President Diem and openly supported a successor government in what the authors called an "essentially leaderless Vietnam":

{{quote|For the military [[coup d'etat]] against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government.

In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government.

Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-5.pdf |title=The Pentagon Papers, Vol. 2, Chapter 4, "The Overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, May-November, 1963" |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809132314/http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-5.pdf |archive-date=2013-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As early as August 23, 1963, an unnamed U.S. representative had met with Vietnamese generals planning a coup against President Diem.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', this U.S. representative was later identified to be CIA agent [[Lucien Conein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Weiner|title=Lucien Conein, 79, Legendary Cold War Spy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/07/world/lucien-conein-79-legendary-cold-war-spy.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 1998|quote=He ran agents behind the Iron Curtain in the early 1950's. He was the C.I.A.'s contact with friendly generals in Vietnam as the long war took shape there. He was the man through whom the United States gave the generals tacit approval as they planned the assassination of South Vietnam's President, Ngo Dinh Diem, in November 1963.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed operations ===
The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[John A. McCone]], proposed the following categories of military action:
* Category 1 – Air raids on major [[Viet Cong]] supply centers, conducted simultaneously by [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|South Vietnam's air force]] and the United States Air Force (codenamed [[Farm Gate (military operation)|Farmgate]])&lt;ref name=statepentagon&gt;{{cite web|last=John A. McCone|title=Probable Communist Reactions to Certain US or US-Sponsored Courses of Action in Vietnam and Laos|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v01/d253|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=July 28, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category 2 – Cross-border raids on major [[Viet Cong]] supply centers, conducted by South Vietnamese units and US military advisors.&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;
* Category 3 – Limited air strikes on North Vietnamese targets by unmarked planes flown exclusively by non-US aircrews.&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;

However, McCone did not believe these military actions alone could lead to an escalation of the situation because the "fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists".&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt; In a memorandum addressed to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] on July 28, 1964, McCone explained:

{{quote|In response to the first or second categories of action, local Communist military forces in the areas of actual attack would react vigorously, but we believe that none of the Communist powers involved would respond with major military moves designed to change the nature of the conflict...

Air strikes on North Vietnam itself (Category 3) would evoke sharper Communist reactions than air strikes confined to targets in Laos, but even in this case fear of escalation would probably restrain the Communists from a major military response...&lt;ref name=statepentagon /&gt;}}

Barely a month after the Gulf of Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964, National Security Advisor [[McGeorge Bundy]] warned that further provocations should not be undertaken until October, when the government of South Vietnam (GVN) would become fully prepared for a full-scale war against North Vietnam. In a memorandum addressed to President Johnson on September 8, 1964, Bundy wrote:

{{quote|The main further question is the extent to which we should add elements to the above actions that would tend deliberately to provoke a [[North Vietnam|DRV]] reaction, and consequent retaliation by us.

Examples of actions to be considered were running US naval patrols increasingly close to the North Vietnamese coast and/or [''[[sic]]''] associating them with [[Operation 34A|34A operations]].

We believe such deliberately provocative elements should not be added in the immediate future while the GVN is still struggling to its feet. By early October, however, we may recommend such actions depending on GVN progress and Communist reaction in the meantime, especially to US naval patrols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[McGeorge Bundy]]|title=Courses of action for South Vietnam|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v01/d342|publisher=[[Office of the Historian]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=September 8, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While maritime operations played a key role in the provocation of North Vietnam, U.S. military officials had initially proposed to fly a [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft over the country, but this was to be replaced by other plans.&lt;ref name="cnnpentagonpapers" /&gt;

Daniel Ellsberg knew the leaders of the task force well. He had worked as an aide to McNaughton from 1964 to 1965, had worked on the study for several months in 1967, and Gelb and Halperin approved his access to the work at RAND in 1969.{{r|correll200702}} Now opposing the war, Ellsberg and his friend [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]]&lt;ref name="ellsberg20080807"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2008/08/07/ellsberg-remembering-anthony-russo/ | title=Ellsberg: Remembering Anthony Russo | publisher=Antiwar.com | date=2008-08-07 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; photocopied the study in October 1969 intending to disclose it. Ellsberg approached Nixon's National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]], Senators [[William Fulbright]] and [[George McGovern]], and others, but none were interested.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

In February 1971, Ellsberg discussed the study with ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Neil Sheehan]], and gave 43 of the volumes to him in March. Before publication, ''The New York Times'' sought legal advice. The paper's regular outside counsel, [[Lord Day &amp; Lord]], advised against publication,&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; but in-house counsel [[James Goodale]] prevailed with his argument that the press had a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to publish information significant to the people's understanding of their government's policy.

''The New York Times'' began publishing excerpts on June 13, 1971; the first article in the series was titled "Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces Three Decades of Growing US Involvement". The study was dubbed ''The Pentagon Papers'' during the resulting media publicity.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Court Opinion on The New York Times Co. v. United States Case|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/48.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204121721/https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/48.htm|archivedate=2005-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street protests, political controversy, and lawsuits followed.

To ensure the possibility of public debate about the papers' content, on June 29, [[United States Senate|US Senator]] [[Mike Gravel]], an Alaska Democrat, entered 4,100 pages of the papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These portions of the papers, which were edited for Gravel by [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]], were subsequently published by [[Beacon Press]], the publishing arm of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] of Congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers, Senator Mike Gravel edition, Beacon Press|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/248181?tab=editions}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal [[grand jury]] was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report. Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was [[subpoena]]ed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the ''Pentagon Papers''. Gravel asked the court (in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'') to quash the subpoena on the basis of the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 6]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

That clause provides that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Senator or Representative] shall not be questioned in any other Place", meaning that Gravel could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor, and, by extension, for anything entered to the ''Congressional Record'', allowing the papers to be publicly read without threat of a [[treason]] trial and conviction. When Gravel's request was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court denied the request to extend this protection to Gravel or his legislative aide, Leonard Rodberg, because the grand jury subpoena served on them related to a third party rather than any act they themselves committed for the preparation of materials later entered into the Congressional Record. Nevertheless, the grand jury investigation was halted, and the publication of the papers was never prosecuted.

Later, Ellsberg said the documents "demonstrated unconstitutional behavior by a succession of presidents, the violation of their oath and the violation of the oath of every one of their subordinates."&lt;ref name=demnow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/02/1331255 |title=How the ''Pentagon Papers'' Came to be Published by the Beacon Press: A Remarkable Story Told by Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, Dem Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel and Unitarian Leader Robert West |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224833/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F07%2F02%2F1331255 |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he leaked the Papers to end what he perceived to be "a wrongful war."&lt;ref name=demnow /&gt;

=== The Nixon administration's restraint of the media ===

President Nixon at first planned to do nothing about publication of the study since it embarrassed the Johnson and Kennedy administrations rather than his. But Henry Kissinger convinced the president that not opposing the publication set a negative precedent for future secrets.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; The administration argued Ellsberg and Russo were guilty of a [[felony]] under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], because they had no authority to publish classified documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html|accessdate=2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to persuade ''The New York Times'' to voluntarily cease publication on June 14,&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] and Nixon obtained a federal court injunction forcing ''The New York Times'' to cease publication after three articles.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger]] said:

{{quote|Newspapers, as our editorial said this morning, we're really a part of history that should have been made available, considerably longer ago. I just didn't feel there was any breach of national security, in the sense that we were giving secrets to the enemy.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;}}

The newspaper appealed the injunction, and the case ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' (403 U.S. 713) quickly rose through the U.S. legal system to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/403us713.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 1971, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' began publishing its own series of articles based upon the ''Pentagon Papers'';&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt; Ellsberg had given portions to ''The Washington Post'' reporter [[Ben Bagdikian]]. Bagdikian brought the information to editor [[Ben Bradlee]]. That day, Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[William Rehnquist]] asked ''The Washington Post'' to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in U.S. district court. Judge [[Murray Gurfein]] declined to issue such an injunction, writing that "[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. N.Y. Times Co.]]'', 328 F. Supp. 324, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The government appealed that decision, and on June 26 the Supreme Court agreed to hear it jointly with ''The New York Times'' case.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; Fifteen other newspapers received copies of the study and began publishing it.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

=== The Supreme Court allows further publication ===
{{Main|New York Times Co. v. United States}}
On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court decided, 6–3, that the government failed to meet the heavy [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] required for [[prior restraint]] injunction. The nine justices wrote nine opinions disagreeing on significant, substantive matters.

{{quote|Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.|Justice Black&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW YORK TIMES CO. v. UNITED STATES, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=403&amp;invol=713}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Tedford and Dale Herbeck summarized the reaction of editors and journalists at the time:

{{quote|As the press rooms of the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' began to hum to the lifting of the censorship order, the journalists of America pondered with grave concern the fact that for fifteen days the 'free press' of the nation had been prevented from publishing an important document and for their troubles had been given an inconclusive and uninspiring 'burden-of-proof' decision by a sharply divided Supreme Court. There was relief, but no great rejoicing, in the editorial offices of America's publishers and broadcasters.|Tedford and Herbeck, pp. 225–226.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tedford &amp; Herbeck, Freedom of Speech in the United States, 5 ed.|url=http://www.stratapub.com/TedfordHerbeck/tedford_&amp;_herbeck_freedom_of_speech_in_the_united_states.htm|accessdate=2005-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202043033/http://www.stratapub.com/TedfordHerbeck/tedford_%26_herbeck_freedom_of_speech_in_the_united_states.htm|archive-date=2005-12-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Legal charges against Ellsberg ===

Ellsberg surrendered to authorities in Boston, and admitted that he had given the papers to the press: "I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision".&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; He was indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of stealing and holding secret documents.&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/ The Pentagon Papers] 1971 Year in Review, UPI&lt;/ref&gt; Federal District Judge [[William Matthew Byrne, Jr.]] declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] and dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973, after it was revealed that: agents acting on the orders of the Nixon administration illegally broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist and attempted to steal files; representatives of the Nixon administration approached the Ellsberg trial judge with an offer of the job of FBI directorship; several irregularities appeared in the government's case including its claim that it had lost records of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg conducted by the [[White House Plumbers]] in the contemporaneous [[Watergate scandal]]. Byrne ruled: "The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case." Ellsberg and Russo were freed due to the mistrial; they were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

In March 1972, political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin]], then assistant professor of Government at [[Harvard University]], was jailed for a week for his refusal to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the Pentagon Papers case, during a hearing before the [[Boston]] [[Federal District Court]]. The Faculty Council later passed a resolution condemning the government's interrogation of scholars on the grounds that "an unlimited right of grand juries to ask any question and to expose a witness to citations for contempt could easily threaten scholarly research".&lt;ref name=Meislin&gt;Meislin, Richard J. [https://archive.is/20130204085944/http://theharvardcrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=495202 Popkin Faces Jail Sentence In Contempt of Court Case], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', March 22, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelb estimated that ''The New York Times'' only published about five percent of the study's 7,000 pages. The Beacon Press edition was also incomplete. Halperin, who had originally classified the study as secret, obtained most of the unpublished portions under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[University of Texas]] published them in 1983. The [[National Security Archive]] published the remaining portions in 2002. The study itself remained formally classified until 2011.&lt;ref name="correll200702"/&gt;

== Impact ==
The ''Pentagon Papers'' revealed that the United States had expanded its war with the bombing of Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which had been reported by the American media.&lt;ref name="'70s 43"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most damaging revelations in the papers revealed that four administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson), had misled the public regarding their intentions. For example, the Eisenhower administration actively worked against the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Accords]]. The John F. Kennedy administration knew of plans to overthrow South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem before his death in a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup]]. President Johnson had decided to expand the war while promising "we seek no wider war" during his 1964 presidential campaign,&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt; including plans to bomb North Vietnam well before the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 Election]]. President Johnson had been outspoken against doing so during the election and claimed that his opponent [[Barry Goldwater]] was the one that wanted to bomb North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;

In another example, a memo from the Defense Department under the Johnson Administration listed the reasons for American persistence:
* 70% – To avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor).
* 20% – To keep [South Vietnam] (and the adjacent) territory from Chinese hands.
* 10% – To permit the people [of South Vietnam] to enjoy a better, freer way of life.
* ALSO – To emerge from the crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used.
* NOT – To help a friend, although it would be hard to stay in if asked out.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Perlstein|title=[[Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America]]|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4302-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy was that President Johnson sent combat troops to Vietnam by July 17, 1965, before pretending to consult his advisors on July 21–27, per the cable stating that "[[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Cyrus Vance]] informs McNamara that President had approved 34 Battalion Plan and will try to push through [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|reserve]] call-up."&lt;ref name="Mtholyoke2"&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon4/pent6.htm Chronology]. "U.S. Ground Strategy and Force Deployments, 1965-1968," (1971). Pp. 277-604 in ''The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition'' Vol. 4. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, when that cable was declassified, it revealed "there was a continuing uncertainty as to [Johnson's] final decision, which would have to await Secretary McNamara's recommendation and the views of Congressional leaders, particularly the views of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Richard Russell, Jr.|[Richard] Russell]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Burke and Fred Greenstein, ''How Presidents Test Reality: Decisions on Vietnam, 1954 and 1965''. (1989) p. 215 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Erwin N. Griswold]] later called the ''Pentagon Papers'' an example of "massive overclassification" with "no trace of a threat to the national security." The ''Pentagon Papers''' publication had little or no effect on the ongoing war because they dealt with documents written years before publication.&lt;ref name="correll200702" /&gt;

After the release of the ''Pentagon Papers'', [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] said:

{{quote|During the campaign, President Johnson kept reiterating that he would never send American boys to fight in Vietnam. As I say, he knew at the time that American boys were going to be sent. In fact, I knew about ten days before the Republican Convention. You see I was being called a trigger-happy, warmonger, bomb happy, and all the time Johnson was saying, he would never send American boys, I knew damn well he would.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;}}

Senator [[Birch Bayh]], who thought the publishing of the ''Pentagon Papers'' was justified, said:

{{quote|The existence of these documents, and the fact that they said one thing and the people were led to believe something else, is a reason we have a credibility gap today, the reason people don't believe the government. This is the same thing that's been going on over the last two-and-a-half years of this administration. There is a difference between what the President says and what the government actually does, and I have confidence that they are going to make the right decision, if they have all the facts.&lt;ref name="upi.com" /&gt;}}

It was released worldwide on 17 November 2016. Frontier had previously worked in the amusement park construction and management genre with ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'' (to which ''Planet Coaster'' is a [[spiritual successor]]), ''[[Thrillville]]'', ''[[Thrillville: Off the Rails]]'', and ''[[Zoo Tycoon (2013 video game)|Zoo Tycoon]]''.

There are three different modes in the game, namely Sandbox, Challenge, and Career. In the career mode, players assume the role of a theme park manager, and must complete tasks such as constructing unfinished roller coasters or hiring janitors. In Sandbox mode, players are tasked to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. The challenge mode is similar to the sandbox mode, but with added difficulty, as players need to take funds into account.

Originally called ''Coaster Park Tycoon'', the game was revealed on 29 January 2015 and was renamed during [[E3 2015]]. ''Planet Coaster'' is Frontier's second self-published franchise, following ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]''. Frontier organized multiple alpha and beta testings before launching in November 2016. The game was supported with free post-release [[downloadable content]] upon launch. The title received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's sandbox mode and creation tools. Criticisms were mainly directed to the game's career mode. It was a commercial success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in its first month of release.

''Planet Coaster'' is a [[construction and management simulation]] video game. Similar to its spiritual predecessor, the game allows players to build different theme park rides and roller-coasters. These player-created attractions can be shared through a mechanic called "global village".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/16/elite-dangerous-studio-debuts-planet-coaster-theme-park-simulator/|title=Elite: Dangerous studio debuts Planet Coaster theme-park simulator (update)|first=Gavin|last=Greene|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also comes with ten [[Costumed character#In theme parks, international fairs, and festivals|mascot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=The Planet Coaster mascots ranked from worst to best|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-planet-coaster-mascots-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=PC Gamer|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before starting the game, the player must create their own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. Afterwards, the player is able to choose between three game modes: sandbox, challenge, and career.

Similar to Frontier's previous game, ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', the Sandbox Mode enables players to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. In Sandbox Mode, all features and rides of the game are unlocked and your funds are unlimited. This is the mode most players use to create items (parks, coasters, scenery, etc.) and then post them to Steam's Planet Coaster Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forward|first1=Jordan|title=The best Planet Coaster creations|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/planet-coaster/planet-coaster-creations|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=PCGamesN|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Challenge Mode, the player must construct an amusement park on an empty lot (similar to Sandbox Mode) but with limited funds and research depending on chosen difficulty—Easy, Medium, or Hard. As the player develops their park, the game presents the player with challenges that the player must accept or decline. Upon completion of a challenge, the player is given a reward such as a park rating boost or a sum of money.

In the Career Mode, the player must complete objectives such as constructing [[roller coaster]]s, achieving park ratings or hiring [[janitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harker|first1=Clover|title=Gamereactor UK|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/reviews/482583/Planet+Coaster/|accessdate=23 November 2016|work=www.gamereactor.eu|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Frontier's previous game, ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', Career Mode allows players to progress by completing scenarios with objectives in different difficulties.

First unveiled at [[EGX (expo)|EGX 2016]], the game also features a dedicated mode called the "crash mode" which allows players to construct incomplete coasters and let them crash into the park's visitors.&lt;ref name="Venture"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/24/planet-coaster-announces-a-mode-dedicated-to-crashes/|title=Planet Coaster announces a mode dedicated to crashes|first=Mike|last=Minotti|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=24 September 2016|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2017, Frontier revealed the existence of several cheat codes that were previously undiscovered on their official [[Internet forum|forums]]. These included the ability to ride [[go-kart]]s and the ability for [[security guard]]s to plough through guests similarly to a [[bulldozer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Tom|last2=Fenlon|first2=Wes|title=Planet Coaster cheat lets you drive go-karts in first person|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/planet-coaster-cheat-lets-you-drive-go-karts-in-first-person-make-everyone-puke/|accessdate=27 April 2017|work=PC Gamer|date=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wales|first1=Matt|title=There's a Cheat Code That Turns Planet Coaster into a Mini Racer|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/04/26/theres-a-cheat-code-that-turns-planet-coaster-into-a-mini-racer|accessdate=27 April 2017|work=Kotaku UK|date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the development of ''Planet Coaster'', [[Frontier Developments]] had developed several other [[construction and management simulation]] video games, including 2004's commercial and critical success ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', which sold over 10 million copies.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/22/8825441/planet-coaster-is-getting-ready-for-a-big-ride|title=Planet Coaster is getting ready for a big ride|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planet Coaster'' serves only as a [[spiritual successor]] to ''RollerCoaster Tycoon 3'' instead of a direct sequel, as the company considered the use of the brand ''Tycoon'' "didn’t carry the cachet anymore" due to the releases of mainly poorly-received ''Tycoon'' games in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/roller-coaster-tycoon-spiritual-pc-successor-planet-coaster-announced-3417774|title=Roller Coaster Tycoon spiritual PC successor Planet Coaster announced|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2015|work=GameZone|first=Jason |last=Lopez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/elite-dangerous-developers-talk-to-ars-about-planet-coaster/|title=Elite: Dangerous developers talk to Ars about Planet Coaster|first=Lee|last=Hutchinson|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2016 interview with [[Cambridge News]], David Walsh (the [[Chief Operating Officer]] of Frontier Developments) said that the success of ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]''

=== Pre-release ===
The game was met with praise upon release of the alpha. Andy Kelly of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' commented that Frontier was "off to a tremendous start", adding that creating buildings with the creation tools hinted at "immense possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|title=Planet Coaster: hands-on with Frontier's theme park sim|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/planet-coaster-we-play-frontiers-theme-park-sim/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mark Walton of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' noted several small flaws including the "hard to navigate" menus and the lack of custom built roller coasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walton|first1=Mark|title=Planet Coaster: A theme park sim so good its developers forgot to develop it|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/03/planet-coaster-theme-park-sim-alpha-preview/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2016, about a month after the release of the alpha, Frontier announced that ''Planet Coaster'' had grossed nearly two million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Alex|title=Planet Coaster Has Nearly Made $2 Million Already|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/04/planet-coaster-has-nearly-made-2-million-already/|website=www.kotaku.com.au|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
Matt Wales of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' recommended the game, concluding that the game is "the finest simulator yet".&lt;ref name="EuroG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wales|first1=Matt|title=Planet Coaster review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-20-planet-coaster-review|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Eurogamer|date=21 November 2016|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ben Reeves of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game for its creative mode but criticized the game's career mode, referring it to as "boring" and "tedious".&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; TJ Hafer of ''[[IGN]]'' compared the game's integration of [[Steam Workshop]] to ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Edmond Tran of ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the game for its accessible creative tools and for its evocative tone.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Jonathan Leack of [[Game Revolution]] claimed that the game "resurrected the [theme park simulation] genre".&lt;ref name=Rev/&gt; In a critical review of the game, Jody Macgregor of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the game's challenge mode but criticized the game for not innovating enough from ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]''. The original score (70/100) was retracted due to miscommunication between Frontier Developments and ''PC Gamer'' with the game version they received; its reevaluated score is 75/100.&lt;ref name="PCGReview"/&gt; Patrick Hancock of [[Destructoid]] noted that the game suffers [[frame rate]] issues in larger parks.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; Furthermore, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' noted that the game's "fiddly" camera makes some actions harder.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;

===Sales===
Upon release, the game topped the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] "top sellers" charts.&lt;ref name="CamNews"/&gt; The game sold over 400,000 copies in the first month of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flitton|first1=Martin|title=Rocketing sales of Planet Coaster give Frontier a big revenue bump|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/business/technology/popularity-planet-coaster-gives-frontier-12462641|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=cambridgenews|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being released later in the year, ''Planet Coaster'' was featured on Steam's "Top 100 Best Sellers of 2016" chart as a "silver tier" title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Mike|title=GTA 5 and Civilization 6 Top Steam Best-Sellers of 2016|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/gta-5-and-civilization-6-top-steam-best-sellers-of-2016|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=USgamer|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the game has sold over one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Planet Coaster soars past one million sales|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-15-planet-coaster-soars-past-million-sales|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=15 August 2017|date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, a leak in [[Valve Corporation|Valve’s]] [[Application programming interface|API]] revealed that over 1.68 million Steam users owned Planet Coaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orland |first1=Kyle |title=Valve leaks Steam game player counts; we have the numbers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/steam-data-leak-reveals-precise-player-count-for-thousands-of-games/2/ |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=Ars Technica |date=6 July 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy''''' is a book by [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]], Director of Scholarly Communication at the [[Modern Language Association]] and Visiting Research Professor of English at [[New York University]], published by [[NYU Press]] on November 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;Fitzpatrick, Kathleen (2011), ''Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology and the Future of the Academy'' (1st ed.), New York, NY: NYU Press, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-0-814-72787-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book provides an overview of issues facing contemporary [[academic publishing]], including the closing of academic presses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|title=Planned Shutdown of U. of Missouri Press Underscores Shift in Traditional Publishing|url=https://chronicle.com/article/Planned-Shutdown-of-U-of/132026/|accessdate=2014-03-17|newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the increased pressure on faculty to publish to achieve tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MLA Task Force on Evaluating Scholarship for Tenure and Promotion|title=Report of the MLA Task Force on Evaluating|journal=Profession|year=2007|pages=9–70|url=http://www.mla.org/pdf/taskforcereport0608.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzpatrick's central argument is that academia should embrace the possibilities of digital publishing, which will in turn change the culture of academic writing and publishing.

==Major Themes==

The book is divided into five chapters, not including the introduction and conclusion: Peer Review, Authorship, Texts, Preservation, and The University.

===Toward a New Form of Peer Review===

Fitzpatrick starts the book by deconstructing one of the most important steps in the academic publication process - [[peer review]]. Drawing on a wide-ranging history of and problems in the process of academic peer review, she argues that much of the peer review process is about credentialing rather than about encouraging good ideas.&lt;ref name="Halavais"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halavais|first=Alex|title=Review: Planned Obsolescence|url=http://alex.halavais.net/review-planned-obsolescence|publisher=A Thaumaturgical Compendium|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital technologies allow for a review process that is more in-line with promoting good ideas: "putting them on the digital table, welcoming diverse attitudes toward them, selecting, shaping and reconfiguring them “curatorially” in imaginative response to freely offered and serious opinions".&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=Neil|title=Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Essential New Book – Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy. The CRC December 2011 Spotlight Review – by Neil Baldwin; and a Letter in Response from Gary Hall About a Revolutionary Open-Access e-Book Project|url=https://blogs.montclair.edu/crdirector/2011/11/29/kathleen-fitzpatricks-essential-new-book-planned-obsolescence-publishing-technology-and-the-future-of-the-academy-the-crc-december-2011-spotlight-review-by-neil-baldwin/|publisher=Montclair State University|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, Fitzpatrick offers a new model for peer review - '[[peer-to-peer]] review'. She uses [[MediaCommons]] as an example of a community-filtered web platform that can function as a site to comment on a draft of scholarly work.&lt;ref name="Halavais" /&gt; On such an online platform, authors can post a draft manuscript and invite comments from their peers or the public, or both.&lt;ref name="Tosi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tosi|first=Alessandra|title=Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/418126.article|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Obsolescence'' itself was posted on [[MediaCommons]] Press as a draft and comments were invited from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=How to Read this Text - Planned Obsolescence|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/plannedobsolescence/how-to-read-this-text/|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Conceptions of Authorship===

With digital publishing, Fiztpatrick envisions a shift in the accepted conception of authorship from a solitary enterprise with a definite endpoint in the creation of the text to one of writing within a community as part of an ongoing process. This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and [[version control]]. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place in a community of interested readers.

Another aspect of community or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores is related to [[remix culture]]. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways. To be viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement that this kind of work is as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also the participation of the scholarly community in a [[gift economy]] with their work. She suggests that scholars use a [[Creative Commons license]] for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.

Fitzpatrick acknowledges that online writing, and particularly the use of platforms that enable reader comments, will require authors to develop a different relationship to their work. They must be committed to supporting online discussions without dominating them, and they must accept that this will increase the amount of time that they must invest in their writing, both because online discussions require regular participation and because their duration is indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|chapter=Authorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Textual Forms===

For Fitzpatrick, [[blog]]s, [[hypertext]], and [[database]]s suggest directions in which digital scholarly publishing might move. She sees early attempts at hypertext writing as ultimately about the thought process of the author rather than the reader, but locates a possible future in the use of databases as platforms to create works by pulling together writing and media elements to create “new forms of networked arguments driven by the juxtaposition of digital objects and their analysis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned Obsolescence|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such texts might be multimodal, Fitzpatrick’s term for texts that do not simply include media objects but instead incorporate media into their analysis or use media as analysis.

===The Social Roots of Technical Problems===

Fitzpatrick continues to develop her ideas of the importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|chapter=Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as part of the process of their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to community cooperation and coordination, Fitzpatrick shows that the incorporation of open standards and built-in extensibility are crucial to the development of successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text [[Markup language|markup]], so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich [[metadata]], so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support her argument for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]], [[Digital object identifier|DOI]], and [[LOCKSS]]) and shows that each is based in the creation of a community organization that values openness and extensibility.

===Rethinking and Repurposing for Sustainable Scholarly Publishing===

At the heart of scholarly text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and repurposing its operational units. While the [[list of university presses|university press]] may have originally functioned to disseminate the work of an institution’s faculty to the larger community, in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned obsolescence: Publishing, technology, and the future of the academy|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-2896-3|pages=157–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much different from that of the university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of shuttering university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate.

For Fitzpatrick, the key to establishing financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, in addition to the production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.

Following this restructuring, Fitzpatrick suggests that the mission of the university may be further strengthened by creating new partnerships and modes of operation between the [[academic library|university library]], the [[information technology|IT]] department, and the university press. As argued throughout the book, scholarly publishing in its current as well as future forms stands to benefit from various forms of cooperation and each of these units may contribute something unique to enhance the production of scholarly work. These new interactions may lead to roles for the library, the press, and IT as service units that provide guidance during and add value to the scholarly production process.

Lastly, Fitzpatrick suggests that these shifting locations and roles of the university press may remove the financial concerns previously restricting their abilities to experiment with new modes of publishing, perhaps allowing presses to explore alternative, more sustainable and open publishing models, including [[open access]] publishing.

==Peer-review process==

Two years before publication ''Planned Obsolescence'' was openly peer-reviewed online at [[MediaCommons]] Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kathleen|title=Planned Obsolescence|url=http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/about/|publisher=Kathleen Fitzpatrick|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript is still available for open discussion on the [http://mcpress.media-commons.org/plannedobsolescence/MediaCommons website]. Putting up a draft manuscript of the book up for open public review and debate allowed Fitzpatrick to demonstrate one of the key points of the book - that scholars have a lot to gain from openly sharing their work on digital platforms, and that open debates should become a part of the publishing process itself.&lt;ref name="Tosi" /&gt;

==Reception==

''Planned Obsolescence'' has been reviewed or discussed in a number of publications by a range of writers.

Critics have written positively on Fitzpatrick's treatment of authorship. Houman Barekat in the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] described Fitzpatrick's reluctance to understand authorship as an effect of technologies and processes of production as "a sobering antidote to the vulgar technological determinism that characterizes so much of the hype around the digital revolution."&lt;ref name="Barekat"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barekat|first=Houman|title=The Read-Write Generation|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/review/the-read-write-generation|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Halavais notes that Fitzpatrick "masterfully" threads history, questions, and practical implications of technologies for writers, while neither ignoring nor relying too heavily on the theoretical concept of "[[the death of the author]]".&lt;ref name="Halavais" /&gt;

Fitzpatrick's exploration of academic peer review has received less favorable criticism. In particular, her critique of the traditional mores of academic publication, whereby texts are first reviewed by colleagues and only published if they meet certain criteria, lacks clear "requirements for a proposed alternative system".&lt;ref name="Halavais" /&gt; Fitzpatrick's outline of post-publication peer review, the suggested alternative to pre-publication peer review, has been met with mixed appraisal: One reviewer deemed her proposal "riddled with flaws",&lt;ref name="Barekat" /&gt; while another reviewer commended the public scholarship potential of such an open method.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;

''Planned Obsolescence'' has also been listed as required reading for courses on the [[digital humanities]], new media, and/or interactive technology and pedagogy in institutions such as the [[University of Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Digital Humanities|url=http://mith.umd.edu/engl668k/?page_id=42|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emory University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intro to Digital Scholarship and Media Studies|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/dsms13/syllabus/|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CUNY Graduate Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall 2012 Interactive Technology and Pedagogy Core 1|url=http://core1fall2012.commons.gc.cuny.edu/books-to-purchase/|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Praxis Seminar|url=http://dhpraxisf13.commons.gc.cuny.edu/calendar/|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Print|url=http://thefutureofprint.blogspot.com/p/syllabus.html|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[service industries]], such as [[education]], a program manager or '''program director''' [[research]]es, plans, develops and implements one or more of the firm's professional services. For example, in education, a program director is responsible for developing and maintaining [[degree (education)|degree]]-granting programs and/or other educational services.

In [[program management]], the Program Director is a senior manager responsible for the overall success of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Filicetti | first = John | title = PMO and Project Management Dictionary | publisher = PM Hut | date = August 20, 2007 | url = http://www.pmhut.com/pmo-and-project-management-dictionary | accessdate = 21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A program director's role in a company that sells [[professional services]] is similar to a [[product manager]]'s role in a company that sells tangible goods.

==Broadcasting==
{{See also|Dayparting}}

In [[radio]] or [[television]], a program director or director of programming is the person who develops or selects some or all of the content that will be [[broadcast]]. A program director's selections are based upon expertise in the media as well as knowledge of the target [[demographic]].  Typically, a program director decides what [[radio program]] or [[TV program]] will be broadcast and when.

==Non-profits==
In the context of [[non-profit organization]]s, a program director is responsible for managing one or more of the organization's programs or services in a role similar to that of a [[chief operating officer]].

'''Pyongyang Korean School for Foreigners''' ({{Korean|hangul=평양외국인학교|hanja=|rr=}}) is a primary school in [[Pyongyang]], Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a.k.a. [[North Korea]] exclusively for foreign children. It has also a facility for foreign children studying on secondary school level. The school is located at the Munsudong diplomatic compound in Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK. The children who attend are mainly dependents of the diplomatic community and the United Nations agencies in the country, although also children of foreign businessmen, mainly Chinese, have been joining the school. All teachers are Korean. The language of instruction is English. Local textbooks in English are used. English and mathematics are the two major subjects, with Korean language, music, art and physical education as minor subjects; from class 3 onwards also science is provided as minor subject. In the early 1990s the official name in English of the school was "Pyongyang Foreigners School",&lt;ref&gt;"Pyongyang Foreigners School" on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnOT4oOgmKM&lt;/ref&gt; which is the straight translation of the name of the school in Korean (평양외국인학교), which didn't change.

A school with the same name in Korean, but the English language name "Pyeng Yang Foreign School" operated as an American Presbyterian mission school, and was closed in 1940 with the greater militarization of Korea. Mrs. [[Ruth Bell Graham]], wife of evangelist [[Billy Graham]], attended this school in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bell Graham Concludes Historic Return Trip To North Korea  http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ruth-bell-graham-concludes-historic-return-trip-to-north-korea-75528907.html&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the Pyeng Yang Foreign School were destroyed during the Korean War and the site was used to build the Embassy of the Soviet Union, the present Russian Embassy complex.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Corfield, Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang, Anthem Press 2013, p.188, entry 'Russian Embassy'&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Embassy also includes a Russian School open for all foreign children of the diplomatic community, with Russian as language of instruction.

'''State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia''' (SAFAA, {{lang-hy|Հայաստանի գեղարվեստի պետական ակադեմիա}}), is a state-owned public university located in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. Founded in 1946, operating jointly with the [[Yerevan State Institute of Theatre and Cinematography]], the Fine Arts Academy had become independent since 1994.

The academy is located on 36 Isahakyan street of the central [[Kentron District]] of Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spyur.am/en/companies/yerevan-state-academy-of-fine-arts/6765 Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts at spyur.am]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rector of the academy is Professor Aram Issabekyan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iatp.am/yafa/english/_rector/index.html Academy rector]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ara Sargsyan Plaque.jpg|thumb|Ara Sargsian's Plaque on Isahakyan Street of Yerevan]]
Renowned sculptor [[Ara Sargsian]] and the father of Armenian fine arts [[Martiros Saryan]] made several trips to [[Moscow]] for negotiations with the committee leaders to get permission. Finally, in the spring of 1944 a permission by the USSR relevant committee to open Fine Arts Institute was granted, which was approved in July 1945 by a decree of the Armenian Central Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars.&lt;br /&gt;
First entrance exams were held in the summer of 1945. The sculptor Ara Sargsian was appointed the first rector of the Institute.&lt;br /&gt; 
Two departments were opened from the outset: painting and sculpture with Martiros Saryan and Ara Sargsian as the deans of each. The two departments included chairs of painting, drawing, printmaking, theory and history of fine arts, which were founded and headed by Gabriel Gyurjyan, Ara Sargsian, Hakob Kojoyan, Vramshapuh Shakaryan and Yeghishe Martikyan. They were assisted by both acclaimed masters and young artists, among them Suren Stepanyan, Aharon Khudaverdyan, Ararat Gharibyan, Ruben Drambyan, Grigor Aharonyan, [[Eduard Isabekyan]], Ara Bekaryan, Mher Abeghyan, [[Arpenik Nalbandyan]], Vahan Harutyunyan, Karapet Metsaturyan, Eda Abrahamyan and Tereza Mirzoyan.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1952 Theatre and Fine Arts Institutes were merged and moved to a former school building in Isahakyan Street by decree of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. 
The new Institute of Fine Arts and Theatre reorganized into two departments: fine arts and theatre arts each with its subdivisions. &lt;br /&gt;
The opening of ceramics department in 1955 was a major achievement in 50s and 60s. Famous decorative-applied arts master Hripsime Simonyan was the founding head of the department. Participation in the graduate exhibition of the Soviet Union Republic art universities held in Moscow (1956), the opening of the department of textile and tapestry, folk art and traditional crafts (1961), as well as the establishment of a new chair of design (1963) marked the series of important events of the period. Chief painter of [[Yerevan Opera Theatre|Yerevan Opera and Ballet Theatre]] Ashot Mirzoyan became the first Head of the Chair.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1994 Fine Arts and Theatre Institutes split up. Fine Arts Institute remained in the old building in Isahakyan Street. Aram Issabekyan was appointed as the rector of the new institute. 
In 1997 a new building next to the main one was acquired through great efforts. Dilapidated building was repaired and given to the Department of Design and Decorative-Applied Arts.&lt;br /&gt;
The branch of Fine Arts Institute opened in [[Gyumri]] in 1997 and in [[Dilijan]] in 1999.
As an encouragement to the institute’s research activity and promotion of its students’ potential, Fine Arts Institute launched post-graduate studies in 1999.&lt;br /&gt; 
In 2000 after long and persistent efforts of Aram Issabekyan and by decree of the RA Government, Fine Arts Institute was renamed into Yerevan State Fine Arts Academy and entered a new development phase through the Bologna Process.
Opening of the Albert and Tove Boyajian Exhibition Hall in 2001 next to the institute building marked another important step to promote artistic life of the Institute (Irina Isabekyan - Head of “Alber and Tove Boyadjian” Exhibition-Hall).
Scientific research is very important for any university. It enables professors to combine pedagogical skills with science activity. The result of the research is the Collection of Scientific Articles issued since 1971, which was reissued in 2004 as a Yearbook. Other than that, in 2013 a Fine Arts Academy Yearbook: Art Historical and Humanitarian Researches was published in a new format and layout.

In 2017 Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts was renamed into State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yafa.am/en/  State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculties and programmes==
The Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts is a three-tier system that offers bachelor, master and researcher programmes with four, two and three-years courses respectively.

The academy has 2 faculties: the Faculty of Fine Arts, and the Faculty of Design and Decorative Applied Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iatp.am/yafa/ YSAFA departments]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned with psychological recovery, creation of job opportunities for young people and as an encouragement of the population in the disaster area in 1988, the branch of Fine Arts Institute opened in Gyumri in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yafa.am/en/?page_id=1603 Gyumri Branch of YSAFA]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has five chairs: Painting, Sculpture and Decorative-applied Arts, Printmaking, Outfit Modeling, Arts and Humanities
 
The second branch opened in Dilijan in 1999, which aimed at promoting the arts and crafts typical of the region. The main focus of studies is carpet weaving, ornamental art, stylized textiles and outfit modeling.

==Study==
Alongside its branches, the Academy adopted the cycles of higher education since the year 2004-2005 (YSAFA has moved onto a three-tier system that offers bachelor, master and researcher programmes (four, two and three years respectively)). Educational programs were sufficiently upgraded aimed at the development of students’ analytical and critical skills, as well as encouragement of independent research. The system of credits was introduced; international collaboration of universities was launched and developed.

'''''Catastrophic Consequences: Civil Wars and American Interests'''''

"In the post-Cold War world, war between states has been extraordinarily rare, but civil war and armed conflict within states has been widespread. Indeed, in the last two decades, fully one-third of all countries have endured some form of civil conflict. In this sobering study, David argues that domestic upheaval and state collapse are replacing rising states and great-power rivalry as the chief threats to U.S. interests and global security. In one sense, this book offers an eloquent statement of a widely shared view—namely, that in the age of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, it is the weakness of states, rather than their strength, that is most threatening. What is distinctive about David's book is its focus on four critical states—China, Mexico, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia—in which civil war or political upheaval could "unleash catastrophic harms that transform global politics and endanger vital American interests." In each case, David sketches a portrait of regime breakdown and ensuing chaos. Blazing oil fields, loose nuclear weapons, refugee floods, and great-power collapse are catastrophes that could upend global stability and bring peddlers of violence to the United States' doorstep. Provocatively, David argues that spreading democracy or intervening to build better states are not good options. Rather, civil war must be seen as a problem akin to natural disasters: you assume disasters will occur and prepare for the worst.

'''''Choosing Sides: Alignment and Realignment in the Third World'''''

"A book that seeks to explain why third world leaders change alignment between the USA and the USSR may well seem redundant in the post-Cold War world. In fact, this welcome and stimulating study remains highly relevant to the analysis of third world foreign policies. David's central argument is that alliance decisions must be considered in relation, not merely to a classical 'balance of power' theory concerned only with national security, but rather to the overall balance of political forces with which the leader has to contend, including domestic threats which are often more important than external ones. Given this perspective, which he awkwardly entitles 'omnibalancing', David concludes that changes in alliance can generally be explained as a rational response to the ruler's personal security needs. Though much of the argument is slanted to appeal to US policymakers operating in a bipolar framework, this theme remains as relevant as ever, and could equally be applied to third world states' reactions to IMF structural adjustment policies or demands for democratization. The case studies, taken from northeast Africa in the 1970s, are also convincingly handled."

'''''Third World Coups d'État and International Security'''''

"Coups provide a cheap and inviting means to promote external interests in Third World states, where foreign policy-making is generally the preserve of a small governing elite which is sometimes easy to topple. So cheap they are, indeed, that this means is available not only to the major powers but even to a tiny state like Libya, which would be quite unable to exercise similar influence through conventional military methods. Since all this is obvious enough, and external involvement in coups is frequently alleged, it is surprising that no one has apparently thought to look in any systematic way at the international factor in Third World coups. This is a gap which Steven David has now filled.
	
One of the problems, of course, is data. David wisely confines himself to cases where there is reasonably firm public evidence of external involvement. On this basis, out of a total of 183 successful and 174 attempted coups between 1945 and 1985 he identifies a significant foreign role in backing twenty-four and suppressing fourteen – a total of just over 10 per cent. This is a minimum figure, but the overwhelming majority of coups are evidently internal affairs – though even so they may have significant foreign policy implications. The ‘external’ coups nonetheless include some important cases, such as the Anglo-American-orchestrated overthrow of Mossadeq in Iran in 1953 or the US involvement in the Brazilian coup of 1964. One finding that may well be due to the availability of data is that nine coups have been backed by the United States, Britain, and France and only two by the Soviet Union, the remaining thirteen cases involving mercenaries, or other Third World states. Surprisingly, the most recent coup for which David can find good evidence of US involvement is Cambodia in 1970, and he shows convincingly (by a comparison of Iran in 1953 and 1979, and of Guatemala in 1954 with Sandinista Nicaragua) that US capacity to promote coups has significantly declined. Nor has the United States been notably successful in protecting its allies against coups, though it has been better at deterring right-wing than left-wing ones. The Soviet Union has only been able to foment coups in states where it already has a strong presence, but has been extremely effecting in protecting its allies, at any rate against anti-Soviet coups. No Third World state with a Soviet-style vanguard party has yet been overthrown by a right-wing coup, though states with regimes which already lean towards the Soviet Union of Marxism–Leninism may be subject to coup attempts intended to put a move reliably pro-Soviet regime in power.
	
Workmanlike rather than outstanding, this study also exemplifies the most exclusive concern of American academics with subjects of interest to US policy-makers. Three of the six chapters are explicitly about the American role, one is about the Soviet Union, and even the other two are couched on the whole in East-West terms. The role of the Third World states in destabilizing their neighbours is largely neglected. But within these limits the book is fair and well presented, and a useful contribution to the literature."

{{Underlinked|date=September 2016}}
The '''UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network''', or '''ASPNet''' for short, is a programme established in 1953 to encourage schools worldwide to educate students on issues related to [[UNESCO]]'s "overarching goal of promoting peace and international understanding". {{asof|2008}}, it includes nearly eight thousand educational institutions in over 170 countries. ASPnet schools conduct their own projects, often linking with schools from other countries, or may become involved in a UNESCO-coordinated activity, such as the "[[World Heritage]] in Young Hands" project. A national coordinator, typically housed at the National Commission, serves as the liaison between the schools and UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.state.gov/p/io/unesco/c18952.htm|publisher=Department of State|publication-place=United States|title=UNESCO Associated Schools Project - ASPnet|date=2008-03-08|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== American International School, Dubai, United Arab Emirates ===
In 2014-2015, the American International School in Dubai carried out the project “I have the right to...?” that promoted human rights and freedom of expression. The ASPnet school developed an action plan to raise students’ awareness of their rights in relation to learning, health care and expressing their opinions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atheneum Koekelberg, Brussels, Belgium ===
Singing together to make a difference – an inspiration for 53 students from the UNESCO ASPnet school Atheneum Koekelberg in Brussels, Belgium to found a choir and participate in the international project “Thousand voices for peace”. “Thousand voices for peace” brought together 39 choirs from 18 countries for a series of concerts in Belgium in November 2014 in commemoration of [[World War I]]. One hundred years ago, their countries were confronting each other in World War I. Now, more than 1,000 professional and non-professional singers were standing side by side to raise their voices for peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inspired by a workshop with the Thousand voices for peace project manager Anthony Heidweiller and Brussels Philharmonic first cellist Luc Tooten, 53 ASPnet students started their own choir “Colom” (dove in Catalan) in spring 2014. Singing can make a real difference, they discovered, when discussing how the [[Baltic states]] regained their independence through the 1989 Singing Revolution. Even though they had never sung or listened to classical music before, the diverse group of young students from Brussels set out to prepare their participation in the international project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 3 to 9 November 2014, the young singers mingled with the Estonian choir Voces Musicales. A week of exchange and singing together culminated in a common concert. All 1,300 participating singers, accompanied by the Brussels Philharmonic, joined in an inspired plea for peace in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Koekelberg Basilica) in Brussels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Centro de Formação Dr Rui Grácio, Lagos, Portugal ===
Schools from London, the United Kingdom and [[Algarve]], Portugal used school radio broadcasting as a means to promote [[global citizenship]]. Two new radio programmes in [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] school clusters were set up during the project, Radio Naus and Radio Tecnodantas FM. The “school radio for learning” project was designed to support teachers in developing the necessary [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] skills and methodologies to undertake broadcasting activities with their students. Students and teachers focused on producing content on peace and global citizenship education for their school radio. As part of the project, schools from both regions celebrated [[World Radio Day]] on 13 February. Teachers networked and exchanged good practices at joint conferences. The Aculco Radio of London (Ambassadors for Peace), and the Dr Rui Grácio Teacher Training Centre of Lagos (UNESCO Associated School) provided training for the schools’ teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colegio Carol Baur, Mexico City, Mexico ===
Ecological projects created by students from Colegio Carol Baur in [[Mexico City]] aim to offer sustainable solutions to the problems the world faces today. Starting in kindergarten, children actively discover the joys of learning and knowledge through games. They observe, investigate and research, becoming creative and innovative. Activities are focused on transforming our environment, using science to serve humanity and helping to preserve the planet. Some Carol Baur high school students, for example, constructed a [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] river, making compost with organic trash, and then planted vegetables and strawberries. Given increasing pollution and a fast- growing population, they tried to find solutions not only to reduce trash and promote recycling, but also provide a cheap alternative way to produce healthy food. Other students developed a project on the domestic production of mushrooms as an alternative food source related to urban water management. Their homegrown mushrooms are easy and cheap to produce. After 30 to 35 days the mushrooms, rich in protein and low in fat, can be harvested and used for many dishes, including tortillas. Yet another group of students produced ecological homemade tiles, which at the same time help diminish air and water pollution. Highlighting the importance of relating to nature to inspire feelings of love and responsibility for its protection, the Piensa Verde project takes students out of the classroom to clean the lake in the Carol Baur Ecological Park, using canoes to reach and collect the trash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Gambia ===
The Gambian ASPnet developed the Adopt a Village Project for inland ASPnet schools to raise awareness in village schools and communities on local climate and environmental changes and on ways to preserve and conserve natural resources. Targeting non-coastal communities that are affected by environmental problems like sand and gravel mining, [[deforestation]], bush burning, hunting and waste management, the project aims to build capacities of local teachers, students, youth and senior citizens to reduce human activities that promote climate change in the village, and to empower them to observe, analyze and wisely manage their environment. The Adopt a Village Project was a key activity under the 2012-2013 UNESCO Participation Programme in the Gambia that mobilized ASPnet schools in the country to address issues relating to [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] and to strengthen their capacities to respond to contemporary challenges such as climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Le Likès, Quimper, France ===
To raise the awareness of students and the local population in [[Quimper]], Brittany (France) regarding the protection and development of the local coastal areas at the tip of Western Europe, the ASPnet school Le Likès has been partnering with the Iroise Natural Marine Park. Every year, Le Likès students start off the project with a visit to local companies and the Marine Life center Haliotika in Le Guilvinec, to get their first insight into sea protection activities on Brittany’s coasts. Afterwards, all participating teachers discuss various aspects of coastal protection with their students in the classroom. This includes not only science teachers, but also those teaching economics, history, geography and English. The classroom activities are followed by a one-day workshop session with scientists from the Iroise marine park, giving students the opportunity to meet different park staff members, learn from their experience and also exchange ideas with people living in and around the park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nesibe Aydın, Ankara, Turkey ===
On [[World Philosophy Day]] 2014, students from the ASPnet school Nesibe Aydın, Turkey engaged in discussions on what it means to be a global citizen and reflected on how to take action to help find solutions to current and future global challenges. Issues discussed included the responsibility for helping others, respecting the rights of others, learning new things about the world, and treating people fairly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== O.P. Jindal School-Raigarh, Raigarh, India ===
O.P. Jindal School-Raigarh, India undertakes a wide range of activities related to environmental protection, responsible consumption and ecological awareness. With ecological sustainability being a mainstay of the school’s [[curriculum]], O.P. Jindal provides its students with an inspiring educational environment. Its “green school” project comprises different activities throughout the year on water conservation, [[biodiversity]] and [[consumer education]]. For example, the environmental service learning programme helps to improve students’ academic performance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects) by inspiring students’ reflection on their environment and innovative greening methods. As part of an exchange with the [[Abbey Grange Church of England Academy]] in [[Leeds]], United Kingdom, students designed and presented posters on the importance of preventing water pollution, saving electricity etc. Within the “green school” project, students produce green bags to help their community replace plastic grocery bags, thus reducing waste and promoting recycling. To increase the activity’s impact, O.P. Jindal students encourage partner schools to participate in the green bag production. Students also visited the local consumer forum to learn about its activities in support of consumer protection. After the interactive exchange with the president and two members of the forum, many students resolved to be more aware of their rights and duties as consumers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Wedge document cover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the Wedge Document.]]

The '''Wedge Strategy''' is a [[creationist]] political and social action plan authored by the [[Discovery Institute]], the hub of the pseudoscientific [[intelligent design movement]]. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute [[manifesto]] known as the '''Wedge Document'''. Its goal is to change American culture by shaping public policy to reflect politically conservative fundamentalist [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] values. The wedge metaphor is attributed to [[Phillip E. Johnson]] and depicts  a metal [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]] splitting a log.

"From our vantage, materialism is not a neutral, value-free, minimalist position from which to pursue inquiry. Rather, it is itself an ideology with an agenda. What's more, it requires an evolutionary creation story to keep it afloat. On scientific grounds, we regard that creation story to be false. What?s more, we regard the ideological agenda that has flowed from it to be destructive to rational discourse. Our concerns are therefore entirely parallel to the evolutionists?. Indeed, all the evolutionists? worst fears about what the world would be like if we succeed have, in our view, already been realized through the success of materialism and evolution. Hence, as a strategy for unseating materialism and evolution, the term "Wedge" has come to denote an intellectual and cultural movement that many find congenial."

"But there are deeper motivations. I think at a fundamental level, in terms of what drives me in this is that I think God's glory is being robbed by these naturalistic approaches to biological evolution, creation, the origin of the world, the origin of biological complexity and diversity.

Johnson. DarwinReconsidered.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy was originally brought to the public's attention when the Wedge Document was leaked on the Web. The Wedge strategy forms the governing basis of a wide range of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns]].

==Overview==
The Wedge Document outlines a [[public relations]] campaign meant to sway the [[opinion of the public]], popular [[Mass media|media]], [[foundation (charity)|charitable funding agencies]], and public policy makers. 

The document sets forth the short-term and long-term goals with milestones for the intelligent design movement, with its governing goals stated in the opening paragraph:
* "To defeat [[science|scientific]] materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies"
* "To replace materialistic explanations with the [[theistic]] understanding that [[nature]] and [[human being]]s are created by [[God]]"

There are three Wedge Projects, referred to in the strategy as three phases designed to reach a governing goal:
* Scientific Research, Writing and Publicity
* Publicity and Opinion-making
* Cultural Confrontation &amp; Renewal

Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms the strategy's Christian, [[evangelism|evangelistic]] orientation:

{{quote|Alongside a focus on the influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidences that support the faith, as well as to popularize our ideas in the broader culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunflower.com/~jkrebs/JCCC/05%20Wedge_edited.pdf |title=THE WEDGE STRATEGY |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64gzl5tH9?|archivedate=January 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The wedge strategy was designed with both five-year and twenty-year goals in mind in order to achieve the conversion of the mainstream. One notable component of the work was its desire to address perceived social consequences and to promote a [[social conservative]] agenda on a wide range of issues including [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and other social reform movements.  It criticized "materialist reformers [who] advocated coercive government programs" which it referred to as "a virulent strain of [[utopianism]]".

Beyond promotion of the Phase I goals of proposing Intelligent Design related research, publications, and attempted integration into [[academia]], the wedge strategy places an emphasis on Phases II and III advocacy aimed at increasing popular support of the Discovery Institute's ideas. Support for the creation of popular level books, newspaper and magazine articles, [[op-ed]] pieces, video productions, and [[apologetics]] seminars was hoped to embolden believers and sway the broader culture towards acceptance of intelligent design. This in turn would lead the ultimate goal of the wedge strategy; a social and political reformation of American culture.

In 20 years, the group hopes that they will have achieved their goal of making intelligent design the main perspective in science as well as to branch out to ethics, politics, philosophy, theology, and the fine arts. A goal of the wedge strategy is to see intelligent design "permeate religious, cultural, moral and political life." By accomplishing this goal the ultimate goal as stated by the [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC) of the "overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural legacies" and reinstating the idea that humans are made in the [[image of God]], thereby reforming American culture to reflect conservative Christian values, will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970514072337/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 14, 1997 |title= |access-date=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson]], and features in his book ''The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism''.

===Wedge Document===
Drafted in 1998 by Discovery Institute staff, the Wedge Document first appeared publicly after it was posted to the World Wide Web on February 5, 1999, by Tim Rhodes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofvirus.org/virus.1Q99/0510.html virus: A Peek Behind Enemy Lines] Tim Rhodes. ChurchOfVirus.org, February 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; having been shared with him in late January 1999 by Matt Duss, a part-time employee of a Seattle-based international human-resources firm. There Duss had been given a document to copy titled ''The Wedge'' and marked "Top Secret" and "Not For Distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0605/discovery-darwin.php Discovery's Creation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207030634/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0605/discovery-darwin.php |date=2006-02-07 }} Roger Downey. ''Seattle Weekly'', February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Meyer once claimed that the Wedge Document was stolen from the Discovery Institute's offices.&lt;ref name="forrest_wedge"&gt;"Q. Now is it true that that document was purportedly stolen from the office of Discovery Institute? A. According to Dr. Meyer that's what happened." [[Barbara Forrest]], 2005, testifying in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial. {{cite web |url=http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day6AM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206075308/http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Day6AM.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovery Institute co-founder and CSC Vice President [[Stephen C. Meyer]] eventually acknowledged the Institute as the source of the document.&lt;ref name="forrest_wedge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mooney |first=Chris |title=Survival of the Slickest: How anti-evolutionists are mutating their message |newspaper=[[The American Prospect]] |volume=13 |issue=22 |date=2002-12-16 |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=survival_of_the_slickest}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute still seeks to downplay its significance, saying "Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the [[urban legend]] of the 'Wedge' document".&lt;ref name="so_what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2101 |title=The "Wedge Document": So What? |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427143857/http://www.discovery.org/a/2101 |archivedate=April 27, 2010 |df= }}, Discovery Institute staff, February 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also portrays the scientific community's reaction to the Wedge document as driven by "Darwinist Paranoia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=450 The "Wedge Document": How Darwinist Paranoia Fueled an Urban Legend] Discovery Institute staff, July, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite insisting that intelligent design is not a form of [[creationism]], the Discovery Institute chose to use an image of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Creation of Adam]],'' depicting God reaching out to impart life from his finger into [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/evolving-banners-at-discovery-institute |accessdate=2011-08-01 |title=Evolving Banners at the Discovery Institute |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2002-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement and strategy===
According to [[Phillip E. Johnson]], the wedge movement, if not the term, began in 1992:
{{quote|The movement we now call the wedge made its public debut at a conference of scientists and philosophers held at Southern Methodist University in March 1992, following the publication of my book ''[[Darwin on Trial]]''. The conference brought together key wedge and intelligent design figures, particularly Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer, William Dembski, and myself.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=12-04-018-f The Wedge Breaking the Modernist Monopoly on Science] [[Phillip E. Johnson]]. Touchstone. July/August, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1993, a year after the SMU conference, "the Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars met at Pajaro Dunes. Here, Behe presented for the first time the seed thoughts that had been brewing in his mind for a year--the idea of 'irreducibly complex' molecular machinery."&lt;ref&gt;''Meeting Darwin's Wager'' Christianity Today Magazine. April 28, 1997 Vol. 41, No. 5, Page 14. quoted in ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics'', [[Robert T. Pennock]], p8&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Pearcey, a CSC fellow and Johnson associate, acknowledges Johnson's leadership of the intelligent design movement in two of her most recent publications. In an interview with Johnson for World magazine, Pearcey says, "It is not only in politics that leaders forge movements. Phillip Johnson has developed what is called the 'Intelligent Design' movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/arn/pearcey/np_world-wedge0800.htm Wedge Issues, Phillip Johnson Interview, July 29, 2000.World Magazine: Pearcey, Nancy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Christianity Today'', she reveals Johnson's religious beliefs and his animosity toward evolution and affirms Johnson as "The unofficial spokesman for ID."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowview.org/science/arn.files/notinkansasanymor.html Access Research Network in the WindowView&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110033847/http://windowview.org/science/arn.files/notinkansasanymor.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1997 book &lt;cite&gt;''Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds''&lt;/cite&gt; Johnson summed up the underlying philosophy of the strategy:
{{quote|If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. With the assistance of many friends I have developed a strategy for doing this... We call our strategy the "wedge.|pg. 91-92|&lt;cite&gt;''Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds''&lt;/cite&gt;}}

At the 1999 "Reclaiming America for Christ Conference" called by Reverend [[D. James Kennedy]] of [[Coral Ridge Ministries]], Johnson gave a speech called &lt;cite&gt;How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |date=* |title=How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he summed up the theological and [[epistemological]] underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for winning the battle:

{{quote|To talk of a purposeful or guided evolution is not to talk about evolution at all. That is slow creation. When you understand it that way, you realize that the Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the Book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a creator brought about our existence for a purpose. That is the first thing I realized, and it carries tremendous meaning." He goes on to state: "I have built an intellectual movement in the universities and churches that we call The Wedge, which is devoted to scholarship and writing that furthers this program of questioning the materialistic basis of science. One very famous book that's come out of The Wedge is biochemist Michael Behe's book, Darwin's Black Box, which has had an enormous impact on the scientific world." ..."Now the way that I see the logic of our movement going is like this. The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth? When I preach from the Bible, as I often do at churches and on Sundays, I don't start with Genesis. I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right. And the materialist scientists are deluding themselves.}}

Johnson cites the foundation of intelligent design as [[Book of John|The Gospel According to Saint John]], in the [[New Testament]], specifically, Chapter 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"  ([[King James Bible|King James Version]]).

The 1999 establishment of the [[Michael Polanyi Center]] at [[Baylor University]] by Baylor president [[Robert B. Sloan]] was a major step forward in the wedge strategy the center was by [[William Dembski]] and [[Bruce L. Gordon]], with funding from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] via the Discovery Institute.  The center was disbanded the next year in the face of protests from Baylor's faculty and the recommendation of an outside advisory council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gross |first1=Barbara |title=The Wedge at Work |url=https://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/wedge-at-work |work=NCSE |date=3 December 2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 Baylor had also hired two other wedge proponents, [[Walter Bradley (engineer)|Walter Bradley]] and [[Francis J. Beckwith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |title=Wedging Creationism into the Academy |journal=Academe |date=2005 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=36–41 |doi=10.2307/40252735 |jstor=40252735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on the goals and methods of wedge strategy, Johnson stated in an interview conducted in 2002 for &lt;cite&gt;Touchstone Magazine&lt;/cite&gt; that "The mechanism of the wedge strategy is to make it attractive to Catholics, Orthodox, non-fundamentalist Protestants, observant Jews, and so on." He went on to elaborate:

{{quote|So the question is: "How to win?" That's when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the "wedge" strategy: "Stick with the most important thing" —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, "Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?" and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.|&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html |date=* |title=Berkeley's Radical }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other statements of Johnson's acknowledge that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic and creationist agenda cast as a scientific concept.
{{quote|Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.|[http://www.christianity.ca/news/social-issues/2004/03.001.html]}}

{{Quote|This isn't really, and never has been a debate about science. Its about religion and philosophy.|[http://www.leaderu.com/pjohnson/world2.html]}}

Critics claim that Johnson's statements validate claims leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping religious content from their anti-evolution, creationist assertions as a means of avoiding the separation of church and state mandated by the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 138 of 139|Ruling, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'']], page 138&lt;/ref&gt; The statements, when viewed in the light of the Wedge document and the US District Court's [[Kitzmiller v. Dover|Kitzmiller]] decision, show ID and the ID movement is an attempt to put a gloss of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 29 of 139|Ruling, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'']], page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedge strategy details a simultaneous assault on state boards of education, state and federal legislatures and on the print and broadcast media.&lt;ref name=opinionmakers_constituency&gt;"Alongside a focus on the influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians.

The Discovery Institute fellows have significant advantages in money, political sophistication, and experience over their opponents in the scientific and educational communities, who do not have the benefit of funding from wealthy benefactors, clerical and technical support staff, and expensive advertising campaigns and extensive political networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050911%2FOPINION02%2F509110732%2F1087%2Fopinion |title=Intelligent design group is just a religious front |accessdate=2006-07-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627201715/http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050911%2FOPINION02%2F509110732%2F1087%2Fopinion |archivedate=June 27, 2006 |df= }}, Fred Barton, ''Lansing State Journal''.

The Discovery Institute's "Teach the Controversy" campaign is designed to leave the scientific establishment looking close-minded, appearing as if it is attempting to stifle and suppress new scientific discoveries that challenge the status quo. This is made with the knowledge that it's unlikely many in the public understand advanced biology, or can consult the current scientific literature or contact major scientific organizations to verify Discovery Institute claims. This part of the strategy also plays on undercurrents of [[anti-intellectualism]] and distrust of science and scientists that can be found in particular segments of American society.&lt;ref&gt;"some hair-splitting that could only look ridiculous to outsider observers." What looks to scientists to be a very compelling rebuttal to Dembski's arguments made by Dr. Schneider is portrayed to non-scientists, and especially the public, as "ridiculous hair-splitting" [http://www.designinference.com/documents/2004.04.Backlash.htm Dealing with the Backlash Against Intelligent Design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227021047/http://www.designinference.com/documents/2004.04.Backlash.htm |date=2011-02-27 }} [[William A. Dembski]]. Designinference.com, April 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a noticeable conflict between what intelligent design backers tell the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Forrest. Expert Testimony. ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial transcript, Day 6 (October 5) "What I am talking about is the essence of intelligent design, and the essence of it is theistic realism as defined by Professor Johnson. Now that stands on its own quite apart from what their motives are. I'm also talking about the definition of intelligent design by Dr. Dembski as the Logos theology of John's Gospel. That stands on its own." ... "Intelligent design, as it is understood by the proponents that we are discussing today, does involve a supernatural creator, and that is my objection. And I am objecting to it as they have defined it, as Professor Johnson has defined intelligent design, and as Dr. Dembski has defined intelligent design. And both of those are basically religious. They involve the supernatural."&lt;/ref&gt; This is studied and deliberate as advocated by wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Johnson. ''Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity''. July/August 1999."...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact." [http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/le_wedge.htm The Wedge]&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking to a mainstream audience and to the media, ID proponents cast ID as a secular, scientific theory. But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their "natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians," ID proponents express themselves in unambiguously religious language. This in the belief that they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr|Howard Ahmanson]].&lt;ref name=opinionmakers_constituency/&gt;

Having written extensively about ID, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock|Robert Pennock]] says "When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about the identity of the designer. It is ironic that their political strategy leads them to deny God in the public square more often than Peter did."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert T. Pennock|Pennock, Robert T.]]. [http://www.msu.edu/~pennock5/research/papers/Pennock*DNAbyDesign.pdf DNA by Design?: Stephen Meyer and the Return of the God Hypothesis]. In Ruse, Michael and William Dembski (eds) ''Debating Design''. New York: Cambridge University Press, (pp. 130 - 148, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "intelligent design" has become a liability for wedge advocates since the ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"In a country in which more than 50 percent of adults consistently tell pollsters that they believe God created humans in their present form within the past 10,000 years, however, there will undoubtedly be a fourth wave that will feature yet another strategy to promote creationism by questioning evolution. It looks as if this next wave will jettison the creationist and intelligent-design baggage and concentrate exclusively on a "teach the controversy" strategy." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging — Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', Volume 354:2277-2281  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the success of the Discovery Institute's public relations campaign to make "intelligent design" a household phrase, and the ruling in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' that ID is essentially religious in nature&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Conclusion]]&lt;/ref&gt; more people recognize it as the religious concept of creationism. Having come closest to accomplishing getting ID into public school science classes in Kansas and Ohio where they succeeded in getting the State Board of Education to adopt ID lesson plans, intelligent design proponents advocated "teach the controversy" as a legally defensible alternative to teaching intelligent design. The Kitzmiller ruling also characterized "teaching the controversy" as part of the same religious ploy as presenting intelligent design as an alternative to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"has the effect of implicitly bolstering alternative religious theories of origin by suggesting that evolution is a problematic theory even in the field of science." . . . The effect of Defendants' actions in adopting the curriculum change was to impose a religious view of biological origins into the biology course, in violation of the Establishment Clause. [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 134 of 139|Ruling, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Page 134]]&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted a move to a fallback position, teaching "critical analysis" of evolutionary theory. Teaching "critical analysis" is viewed as a means of teaching all the ID arguments without using that label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html No one here but us Critical Analysis-ists...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906051325/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html |date=2015-09-06 }} [[Nick Matzke]]. The Panda's Thumb, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It also picks up the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the "strengths and weaknesses" of evolutionary theory and "arguments against evolution," which they falsely portray as "a theory in crisis."

Before, he has worked as a producer for multiple other television programs, mostly for [[PBS]].

== Career ==
Brangham studied English language and literature at [[Colorado College]] between 1986 and 1990, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]].&lt;ref name="Alumni"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://alumnius.net/colorado_college-7994-61 |title =Colorado College |website =Alumni US |access-date =18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as a research assistant and later as an associate producer and field producer for a number of [[Bill Moyers]] documentaries and series in the 1990s and early 2000s. Those included ''Listening to America with Bill Moyers'' (1992)'',''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/series/listening-america-1992/|title=Listening to America {{!}} Shows {{!}} BillMoyers.com|work=BillMoyers.com|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Close to Home: Moyers on Addiction'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/series/moyers-on-addiction-close-to-home-1998/|title=Moyers on Addiction: Close to Home {{!}} Shows {{!}} BillMoyers.com|work=BillMoyers.com|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying in America'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/series/on-our-own-terms-moyers-on-dying/|title=On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying {{!}} Shows {{!}} BillMoyers.com|work=BillMoyers.com|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; Additionally, Brangham worked on a variety of documentary films and projects for [[ABC News]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic's]] ''[[National Geographic Explorer|Explorer]]'' series, several segments of PBS's ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' (1995/1996), and ''[[The New York Times]]'' documentary series ''Science Times'' (2001).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

After 9/11, Brangham re-joined Moyers' production company for the PBS newsmagazine ''[[Now on PBS|Now]]'', where he shot, wrote, and produced dozens of broadcast stories and interviews over a period of six years.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt; After that, he was a producer on ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'', when it was revived in 2007, and later joined the PBS magazine show ''[[Need to Know (PBS)|Need to Know]]'' after the former program went off the air in 2010.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1000494/ |title =William Brangham |website =[[IMDb]] |access-date =18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brangham was a producer, cameraman, and occasional correspondent on ''Need to Know'' for its entire run. Besides, he served as an [[Adjunct professors in the United States|adjunct professor]] at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] for a year.&lt;ref name="Alumni"/&gt;

The role of a '''youth ice hockey coach''' is a combination of [[teacher]], motivator, organizer, listener, and [[disciplinarian]].&lt;ref&gt;"Coaching Hockey for Dummies"; Don MacAdam, Gail Reynolds; 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, there are many responsibilities that a [[youth hockey]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] will fulfill.  Some responsibilities include: facilitator, demonstrator, evaluator, supporter, and planner.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of the Coach, Topendsports.com, retrieved November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In [[sport]], the role of an expert coach entails more than teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, A., Gordon, Durand-Bush, Natalie, Schinke, J. Robert, Salmela, H. John, (1998). The Importance of Mentoring in the Development of Coaches and Athletes, International Journal of Sport Psychology, 29: 267-281.&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth coaches influence the degree of enjoyment experienced by [[youth]] and their desire to continue participating in sport.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, T.K., &amp; Lewthwaite, R. (1986). Social psychological aspects of the [[competition|competitive]] sport experience for male youth sport participants: IV. Predictors of enjoyment. Journal of Sport Psychology, 8, 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This influence occurs through the coaches’ goals, values, attitudes, and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R.E., &amp; Smoll, F.L., (1990). [[Self-esteem]] and children’s reactions to youth sport coaching behaviors: A field study of self-enhancement processes. Developmental Psychology, 26, 987-993. Smith, R.E., &amp; Smoll, F.L., (2002).

Prior to coaching on the ice in the [[United States]], coaches must complete a certification course and age specific modules sanctioned by [[USA Hockey]] and register with USA Hockey.  Coaching [[class_(education)|clinics]] for [[certification]] are offered at various locations across the country, broken down by districts.  Registering with USA Hockey and for a coaching clinic can be completed online at USA Hockey.com.&lt;ref&gt;USA Hockey.com, retrieved November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;   Formal coaching [[education]] programs are not the only way coaches develop.  Other learning opportunities, such as playing experience, [[mentor]]ing, and discussions with other coaches play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Lemyre, F., Trudel, P. &amp; Durand-Bush, N. (2007), How Youth-Sport Coaches Learn to Coach. The Sports Psychologist, 21, 191-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

A coach should focus his/her attention on individual skill development first.  Individual skill development should be mastered prior to focusing on competition.  For players to become successful in a team situation, they should develop their [[Ice skating|skating]], stick handling, passing, and shooting skills.  Individual skill development is the foundation for every [[player (game)|player]] and of primary importance before advancing in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Rebecca, "Ultimate Guide to Coaching Youth Hockey", Howstuffworks.com, retrieved November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
