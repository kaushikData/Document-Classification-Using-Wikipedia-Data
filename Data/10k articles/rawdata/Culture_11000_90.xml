[[File:Arts District, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pink Cadillac in the Downtown Arts District.]]

The '''Las Vegas Arts District''', or the '''18b''' in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] was created in 1998 as an 18 block zone set aside to encourage art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downtown Arts District  | url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/nevada/las-vegas/review-178016.html | work=[[Fodor's Travel]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district won [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'s ''Best of Las Vegas'' award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ken |last = White| title=Downtown Arts District finally taking hold | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/bestoflv/2005/bestartsdistrict.jsp;jsessionid=BMGLLJLEFKAA | work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the 18b, the Las Vegas Arts District contains a mix of independent businesses including [[vintage clothing]] boutiques, antique stores, art galleries, hair salons, restaurants,  
The 18b is located halfway between the Fremont East Entertainment district and the Stratosphere Resort, clustered around Main and Charleston, bounded loosely by Commerce Street to the West, Hoover Avenue to the North, Fourth Street to the East and Wyoming Avenue at the south. It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street.  The name, "18b," represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.

The "First Friday" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.

== Events ==
The district hosts a ''First Friday'' art walk on the first Friday of every month.  First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as "entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Artsy Schmartzy | url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=148648 | publisher=[[United Jewish Communities]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''First Friday'', Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.

== Boundaries ==
The district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the ''City of Las Vegas'' website.

{{IPA notice}}
'''Albina Hakimovna Girfanova''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Гирфанова, Альбина Хакимовна) (1 February 1957&amp;nbsp;– 2 February 2018),  was a Russian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]]. She worked at Institute for Linguistic Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, and later at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], where she attained the rank of [[Docent]] ([[Associate professor]]). Girfanofa is most known for her work on [[Udege language|Udege]] and [[Oroch language|Oroch]] languages, as well as on a number of other [[Tungusic languages]] and [[Balkan languages]]. She is the author of the most significant vocabulary of Udege, published in Russia, as well as other important studies and reference sources of Udege, Oroch and Balkan languages.

==Early life and education==
Girfanova was born in [[Weimar]], which was then a city in [[East Germany]] (DDR), where her family was, probably, stationed at this time, working with the Soviet military. Later family moved to Saint Petersburg, and Girfanova started her undergraduate studies at the Department of General Linguistics (Faculty of Philology) at the [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. She majored in Albanian philology at the chair of Albanian language and literature, established at 1957 by initiative of Prof. Agnia Vasilevna Desnickaja. Albina Girfanova formed as a philologist and albanologist under the guidance of professors A. V. Desnickaja, G. I. Entrej, I. I. Voronina, etc. She graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg State University]], majoring in [[Albanian language]], in 1981. However, she did not continue studies in Albanian language, but joined Department of [[Altaic languages]] at the Leningrad Branch of the [[:ru:Институт языкознания РАН|Institute for Linguistic Studies]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in [[Saint Petersburg]] (at that time, [[Leningrad]]), and devoted herself to study of [[Tungusic languages]] and cultures of [[Tungusic peoples]].

==Academic career==
===Writing and research===
====Fellowship at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1981-1983)====
Immediately upon graduation from [[Saint Petersburg State University]] Girfanova obtains a fellow position as a junior researcher (стажер-исследователь) at the department of Altaic languages at the Institute  for Linguistics Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in years 1952 - 1991: the Leningrad branch of Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR). She was majoring in Albanian language at college, but now switches to study of [[Tungusic languages]], primarily [[Udege language|Udege]] and [[Oroch language|Oroch]]. At the same time, she continues studying Turkish and Albanian languages, modern Greek language - in time being, she becomes a veritable [[Polyglotism|polyglot]].

====Post-graduate studies at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1983-1986)====
After three years as a junior researcher, Girfanova secures a post-graduate position in her department. In the Soviet Academy's context at that time, successful graduation from this position practically guaranteed a life-time tenure with the institution; therefore, obtaining such position in the humanities at that time was considered a career success. Girfanova publishes several articles on Udege language. Upon graduation from her post-graduate studies, she is promoted to research fellow position at the same department.

====Research at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1986-2003)====
It took another two years for Girfanova to write and defend her Candidate of Science Dissertation (equivalent of PhD. thesis), entitled "Indicative Verb Forms in Udege Language", in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Гирфанова|first=Альбина Хакимовна|title=Индикативные формы глагола в удэгейском языке : автореферат дис. кандидата филологических наук : 10.02.02|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mWzJV73JuCEJ:https://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01000034922&amp;num=1&amp;hl=ru&amp;gl=ca&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0|year=1988|publisher=АН СССР. Ленингр. отд-ние ин-та языкознания}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pinnacle of her studies of Udege language becomes the most significant "Vocabulary of Udege Language", published in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Гирфанова|first=Альбина|title=Словарь удэгейского языка|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/%D0%A1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C_%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%8D%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%8F.html?id=4RDcAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|year=2001|publisher=«Наука»|location=СПб.|isbn=9785020285200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lexicographic studies=====
Girfanova have invested considerable time into lexicography of Udege and Oroch languages. She will be mostly known as the author of the best "Vocabulary of Udege Language". It is not the first and only vocabulary of Udege language, but, according to the review by A.A.Byrykin, it is the most linguistically solid vocabulary of Udege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=А.А.Бурыкин|title= Рец. на: Гирфанова А.Х. Словарь удэгейского языка|journal=Язык и речевая деятельность|date=2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=253–255|url=http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/burykin/burykin_review_of_Girfanova.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her lexicographic and etymological studies were not limited to Tungusic languages. She studied cross-linguistic connections of Balkan toponyms, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last1=Гирфанова|first1=Альбина|last2=Сухачев|first2=Н.

=====Grammar and Syntax studies=====
Alongside time-consuming lexicographic work, Girfanova continued grammatical and syntactic studies of Tungusic languages, and devoted some time to the history of studying of these languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Гирфанова|first=Альбина|chapter= Из истории изучения удэгейского языка|title=Remota Relata.

=====Anthropology studies=====
Girfanova's interest to Tungusic peoples was not limited by language studies. She conducted folkloristic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Удэгейский фольклор|author=Альбина Гирфанова|journal=Северная энциклопедия|date=2000|location=М.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entnographic studies (marriage rites, kinship terminology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Удэгейские термины родства|author=Альбина Гирфанова|journal=Алгебра родства|date=2000|pages=271–278|publisher=«Наука»|volume=1|location=СПб.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Girfanova|first=Albina|chapter=“The Taz Ethnic Group: Its Past and Future”|title=Ex Oriente Lumina.

Abstracts of the Papers|year=2003|pages=31–32|publisher=ISSR|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girfanova was a member of International Society for Shamanistic Research.

===Teaching and lecturing===
====Department of General Linguistics, [[Saint Petersburg State University]]====
While in the Soviet Union position of a researcher at an institute of the Academy of Sciences used to be a life-time tenure position, there was no job security in the new Russia, and financing of the Academy decreased dramatically. In 2003, changes happened at Institute for Linguistic Studies, the Altaic departmen effectively stopped to exist, and Girfanova was let go. That was, in her own words in 2005, a painful crisis of her academic career: "two years ago the author, the only specialist in Udege language in the country was fired from the Altaic department of ILI of RAS living out the rest of its days, abandoned by researchers and later abolished, in spite of the position of a scientific researcher successfully acquired three months before the department’s abolishment (I am the author of the only thesis of C. Sc. devoted to Udege language, written and defended in this country, 70 publications, including 5 monographs on the mentioned above Udege language)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Girfanova|first=Albina|chapter=The Present Day Situation of the Udege and Oroch Languages|title=Endangered Languages of Indigenous Peoples of Siberia|year=2005|publisher=Department of the North and Siberia, IEA RAS|location=Saint Petersburg|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/round_table/papers/girfanova.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortunately, she was immediately hired by her alma mater, [[Saint Petersburg State University]], as an associate professor ([[docent]]). Unfortunately, she had to revert to teaching Albanian and Turkish languages, which considerably diminished time for academic research and publications.

====Courses and lectures====
* [[Albanian language]] (workshop)
* Theoretical grammar of [[Albanian language]]
* [[Turkish language]] (workshop)
* [[General linguistics]] (for foreign students)

Girfanova did not only teach Tungisic and Balkan languages, she is also an author of popular books, presenting Udege and Albanian cultures to the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Гирфанова|first1=Альбина|last2=Воронина|first2=И.И.|title=Албания|year=2002|publisher=«Европа»|location=СПб.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Girfanova|first=Albina|title=Udeghe|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/udeghe/oclc/50993450|year=2002|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=München; Newcastle|isbn= 9783895865244}}&lt;/ref&gt; so she was honoured by an obituary from Albanian Embassy in Russia - it is not something that done for a regular language professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albina Girfanova's obituary by Albanian Embassy in Russia|url=http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/russia/ru/article/%D1%81-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9/|website=Albanian Embassy in Russia|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside being an academic scholar, she gave full assistance to the educational system in Russia, to educate students in Tungusic languages, publishing a few textbooks for elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Гирфанова|first=Альбина|title=Удэгейский язык в таблицах.|year=2002|publisher=«Дрофа»|location=СПб.|isbn=5-94745-088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Гирфанова|first=Альбина|title=Удэгейский язык в таблицах.|year=2002|publisher=«Дрофа»|location=СПб.|isbn=5-94745-088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was really concerned about well-being of endangered Tungusic languages, and was socially active to help them to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harvid|last=Girfanova|first=Albina|chapter=The Present Day Situation of the Udege and Oroch Languages|title=Endangered Languages of Indigenous Peoples of Siberia|year=2005|publisher=Department of the North and Siberia, IEA RAS|location=Saint Petersburg|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/round_table/papers/girfanova.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Oliver Corff mentioned in his obituary for Girfanova, "Her critical understanding of the intentions and outcomes of Russia’s minority policies allowed her to come forward with substantial suggestions for improvements acknowledged by politicians. In autumn 2017 she was invited by the Department of Interior Politics of Primorsky Krai as moderator for a course on the revival of the Udege language in the framework of a larger nationality policy programme from 2018 to 2020. Pavel Yasevich, Director of the Department, lauds her as the foremost authority on Udege and Oroch languages in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albina Girfanova's obituary by Oliver Corff|url=http://www.altaist.org/obituary-albina-h-girfanova-1957-2018/|website=Permanent International Altaistic Conference|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable toys are the Telepods, created by [[Hasbro]].

=== Video games ===

=== Education ===
Rovio also launched the Angry Birds Playground in partnership with [[University of Helsinki]]. Based on the Finnish national curriculum the program covers maths, science, music, language, arts &amp; crafts, physical education and social interaction. Focused on preschoolers of kindergarten age, the program introduced interactive learning material including books, posters, games and digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/16/angry-birds-playground-education-rovio|title=Angry Birds Playground: Rovio catapults gaming into the classroom|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=16 September 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a spin-off from the Rovio Angry Birds Playground was established as [https://funacademy.fi/ Fun Academy] by co-founder and CEO Sanna Lukander, former Rovio's vice president of learning and book publishing, and co-founder [[:fi:Peter_Vesterbacka|Peter Vesterbacka]], former Rovio's ‘Mighty Eagle’. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160128005521/en/Rovio-Entertainment-Rovio-Spins-Education-Business-Create|title=Rovio Entertainment: Rovio Spins off Education Business to Create Fun Academy|last=|first=|date=28 January 2016|website=Business Wire|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fun Academy is currently present in 9 countries across the world.

== Controversy ==
=== Leaking user data ===
In January 2014, it was revealed that ''Angry Birds'' was considered a "leaky app" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's Web site. Claims were made by [[Edward Snowden]] that the app was ''leaky'' and that they were capable of [[siphon]]ing data.&lt;ref name="crashingdown"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2548134/Angry-Birds-come-crashing-Maker-Rovios-site-hacked-NSA-spy-scandal-revealed-leaky-app-used-gather-data-users.html |title=Angry Birds come crashing down: Rovio's site hacked after NSA spy scandal revealed it was a 'leaky app' used to gather data on users |date=29 January 2014 |work= [[Daily Mail]]|access-date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Register]]'', the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by [[One by AOL|Millennial Media]]: "Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or 'swinger'. This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/01/27/leaking_smartphone_apps_nsa_gchq/|title=Fancy a little kinky sex?

Following this revelation, on 29 January, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with "Spying Birds" via a [[DNS hijacking]] attack. According to Rovio, "The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately".&lt;ref name="spybirds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2092560/hackers-deface-angry-birds-website-following-nsa-spying-claims.html|title=Hackers transform Angry Birds website into 'Spying Birds' following NSA claims|author=Lucian Constantin|date=29 January 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syrian Electronic Army]] tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by "a friend" of theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2430080,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Website Defaced After NSA Spying Allegations|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Antarleena''''' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] novel by [[Narayan Sanyal]], published in 1962 with a cover design by [[Gautam Ray]]. This novel is placed in the background of psychiatry and psychoanalysis, hence the name{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. The psychoanalytic intrigue between Krishanu and Swaha, the main characters, makes this novel unique in Bengali literature.

The story deals with the protagonist's strange psychological condition and his attempts to deal with it.  Meanwhile, his life becomes intertwined with three women, who are drawn by his mysterious behaviour and are dealing with their own past. Finally the story turns into a thriller when the protagonist has to retire from his job at the intelligence department due to a life-threatening accident resulting in a nervous breakdown and vertigo making his prevailing condition more complex, while one of the women from his past is facing split personality and murder attempts.

'''Bellevue Literary Press''' (BLP) is an American publisher. It was founded in 2007 as a sister organization of [[Bellevue Literary Review]], located at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York City. It became an independent nonprofit in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Bellevue Literary Press Goes Solo| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2018-11-04| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/78210-bellevue-literary-press-goes-solo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their website, "[Bellevue Literary Press] is the first and only nonprofit press dedicated to literary fiction and nonfiction at the intersection of the arts and sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blpress.org/about/|title=About|website=Bellevue Literary Press|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a small press that publishes only a handful of titles per year, BLP garnered a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 2010 for ''[[Tinkers (novel)|Tinkers]]'' by [[Paul Harding (author)|Paul Harding]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' abashedly admitted that it failed to review the novel when it was first published, noting that ''Tinkers'' was the first novel from a small press to win a Pulitzer since ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' in [[1981 Pulitzer Prize|1981]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/the-one-that-got-away/ "The One That Got Away"], ''The New York Times'' Papercuts blog, April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

BLP gained more attention in 2011 when ''[[The Sojourn]]'' by Andrew Krivak became a finalist for the [[National Book Award for Fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2011_f_krivak.html#.UTY7K44sq20/ Andrew Krivak, ''The Sojourn'', 2011 National Book Award Fiction Finalist], The National Book Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; BLP has published books written by the likes of [[Eduardo Halfon]], [[Jonathan D. Moreno]], [[Jerome Charyn]], [[A Mathematician's Lament|Paul Lockhart]], and [[Melissa Pritchard]], among others.

[[File:Brazilian Waxing.jpg|thumb|A woman's genitals with and without [[pubic hair]].]]

'''Bikini waxing''' is the removal of [[pubic hair]] using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and pulls them out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the practice is mainly associated with women, [[male waxing]] is sometimes done to remove men's pubic hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Barker|first=Olivia|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-08-23-waxing_x.htm|title=The male resistance to waxing is melting away|magazine=USA Today|date=August 23, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bikini line''' is the area of the upper leg and inner thigh in which pubic hair grows that is normally not covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit.&lt;ref name="Embod1" /&gt; In some cultures, visible pubic hair in this region is disliked and/or considered embarrassing and so it is sometimes removed.&lt;ref name="Embod1"&gt;{{citation|first1=Heinz|last1=Tschachler|first2=Maureen|last2=Devine|first3=Michael|last3=Draxlbauer|title=The EmBodyment of American Culture|pages=61–62|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2003|isbn=3-8258-6762-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people remove pubic hair that will not be exposed for reasons like aesthetics, personal grooming and hygiene, culture, religion or fashion.

== Technique ==
Pubic hair can be removed in a number of ways, such as [[waxing]], [[shaving]], [[Sugaring (epilation)|sugaring]], [[electrology|electrolysis]], [[laser hair removal]] or with [[chemical depilatory]] creams. Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a [[cosmetologist]] at a salon or spa.&lt;ref name=Cosmo/&gt;

[[File:Ceretta a calo inguinale.jpg|thumb|left|Wax being applied to female pubic hair]]

If a person has never been waxed before, or has not been waxed for a long time, it may be necessary to trim the pubic hair using scissors or an electric razor prior to waxing.&lt;ref name="milady"&gt;Helen Bickmore; ''Milady's Hair Removal Techniques: A Comprehensive Manual''; Thomson Delmar Learning; 2003; {{ISBN|1-4018-1555-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ovat"&gt;Lia Schorr, Shari Miller Sims &amp; Shari Sims, ''SalonOvations' Advanced Skin Care Handbook'', pages 94–95, 117-118, Cengage Learning, 1994, {{ISBN|1-56253-045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patch test is recommended, usually on the upper thigh, to test for allergies or skin sensitivities to the ingredients in the wax. Sometimes a hair growth inhibitor is applied after waxing, which slows the regrowth of hair if applied daily for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=Cosmo&gt;{{citation|title=Get a Perfect Bikini Line|author=Staff writers|magazine=Cosmopolitan|year=2005|volume=238|issue=5|pages=248–251, published online March 10, 2009|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/advice/a2857/bikini-line-hair-removal/|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to apply an antiseptic cleaner and powder to the area prior to waxing. Wax is applied with a spatula in the direction of hair growth the size of a strip about {{convert|2|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|4|in|cm}} long. When the wax is set but still pliable, the wax strips are pulled away against the direction of hair growth while keeping the skin taut. The strip is ideally pulled off as swiftly as possible.&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;

The pubic area is one of the most sensitive areas in the body and during the procedure special attention must be paid to avoid irritation.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Pain directly resulting from the procedure can be slight or severe and can continue from several seconds to several minutes. Some people experience less pain during subsequent treatments. It can be helpful to take a mild anti-inflammatory medication (such as [[ibuprofen]]) an hour or so before waxing to reduce potential pain from the waxing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Klag, ''Johns Hopkins Family Health Book'', page 769, HarperCollins, 1999, {{ISBN|0-06-270149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products such as topical anesthetics are available to lessen the pain involved.&lt;ref name=Cosmo/&gt; A bikini wax during pregnancy is generally more painful, due to increased sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Murray, Leah Hennen &amp; Jim Scott, ''The Babycenter Essential Guide to Pregnancy and Birth'', page 576, Rodale, 2005, {{ISBN|1-59486-211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of wax used for bikini lines is often made from a mixture of [[beeswax]] and [[tall oil]] rather than the more common synthetic [[wax]]es used for waxing regular leg hair. Beeswax is considered stronger and more effective at removing the thicker and coarser pubic hair.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cressy &amp; Margaret Rennie, ''Beauty Therapy Fact File'', page 293, Heinemann, 2004, {{ISBN|0-435-45142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes bumps or in-grown hair can result from waxing. Isolated hairs can be removed with tweezers or electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Ovat" /&gt; Discomfort following the procedure generally lasts two to five days or less.&lt;ref&gt;Hilda Hutcherson, ''Pleasure'', page 190, Perigee, 2006, {{ISBN|0-399-53286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[egg oil]] for a few days post-waxing can help moisturize the skin and reduce inflammation, pain or growth of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|title=Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of egg yolk: a comparison between organic and machine made|pmid=23467945|author1=Mahmoudi M|author2=Others|work=nih.gov|volume=17|year=2013|pages=472–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With repeated removal over time, pubic hair becomes weaker and grows more slowly, leading to easier removal with less pain and less frequent waxing.&lt;ref name=WomansDay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womansday.com/style/beauty/tips/a4944/waxing-101-tips-tricks-for-beginners-108331/|title=Waxing 101: Tips and Tricks for Beginners|first=Alexandra|last=Gekas|date=October 18, 2013|magazine=Woman's Day|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The full bikini'' or ''the European'' is the removal of pubic hair except for a small amount on the [[mons pubis]].
* ''The moustache'' is the removal of pubic hair except for a wide, rectangular patch just above the hood at the top of the genital slit. This is sometimes called "Hitler's moustache", or "Chaplin's moustache".
* ''The heart'' is the shaping of the main pubic tuft into a heart symbol and may be dyed pink.

=== American waxing ===
''American waxing'' is the removal of only the pubic hair that is exposed by a swimsuit, depending on the style of the swimsuit. For a bikini, it would be hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel. It is also known as a "basic bikini wax",&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;&lt;ref name=essort /&gt;&lt;ref name=BrBi /&gt; "triangle", or "bikini line", as it involves waxing hair from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair cannot be seen while wearing a swimsuit.&lt;ref name=landingstrip&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grey|first1=Maggie|title=Basic Pubic Hairstyles|url=http://www.landingstrip.org/basic-pubic-hairstyles/|website=The Landing Strip|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bikini bottoms or underwear are usually worn while getting an American wax. A normal American waxing job takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;

=== {{anchor|The Landing Strip}} French waxing ===
''French waxing'' (sometimes called a ''landing strip'' or a ''partial Brazilian wax'') leaves a vertical strip of pubic hair about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|3|in|cm}} long just above the [[vulva]].&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;&lt;ref name=essort /&gt;&lt;ref name=SalE /&gt; Hair around the anus area and [[labia (genitalia)|labia]] may be removed. The landing strip wax has become popular with models who must wear garments of an extreme narrowness in the crotch region.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} To create the "landing strip" (a line of hair) practitioners and clients prefer either lying face up or lying face down. Sometimes hard wax is used, though strip wax works as effectively.&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;

In a 2016 [[JAMA (journal)|the Journal of the American Medical Association]] published a study in which it was found that out of 3,316 American women surveyed, 84% reported a history of lifetime pubic hair grooming, with 59% reporting that the primary motivations for grooming were for hygienic purposes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowen TS|last2=Gaither TW|last3=Awad MA|last4=Osterberg E|last5=Shindel AW|last6=Breyer BN|date=October 2016|title=Pubic Hair Grooming Prevalence and Motivation Among Women in the United States|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.2154|journal=JAMA Dermatology|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.2154|issn=2168-6068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/most-women-prefer-to-go-bare-citing-hygiene-and-baffling-doctors/|title=Most Women Prefer to Go Bare, Citing Hygiene (and Baffling Doctors)|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|publisher=New York Times|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikini waxing has been credited with a significant global reduction in cases of [[pubic lice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-13/brazilian-bikini-waxes-make-crab-lice-endangered-species-health.html|title=Brazilian Bikini Waxes Make Crab Lice Endangered Species|date=January 13, 2013|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=October 26, 2013|author=Jason Gale|author2=Shannon Pettypiece}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the medical community has also seen a recent increase in [[folliculitis]], or infection around the hair follicle, in women who wax or shave their bikini areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Barbara|last1=Hackley|first2=Jan M.|last2=Kriebs|first3=Mary Ellen|last3=Rousseau|title=Primary Care of Women: A Guide for Midwives and Women's Health Providers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFEk3HShnRUC|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9781449666156|page=833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social attitudes ==
In Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body hair has been considered proper hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kutty, Ahmad (13/Sep/2005) [http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1126012472670 Islamic Ruling on Waxing Unwanted Hair] Retrieved March 29, 2006   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192038/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1126012472670 |date=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], this is known as an act of ''[[fitrah]]''. According to ethnologist F. Fawcett, writing in 1901, he had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the [[vulva]], as a custom of women from the [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. Fawcett|title=Nâyars of Malabar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eF-pMrcqw5UC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=June 23, 2011|year=2004|origyear=1901|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0171-0|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western world|Western]] societies, removal of female body hair (except for head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows) has traditionally been considered appropriate when it was visible. Visible pubic hair of women continues to be widely culturally disapproved and considered [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], and so is at times removed.&lt;ref name=Embod1 /&gt;

In relation to pubic hair, with the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and popularity of the [[bikini]] since 1946, and the elimination of the skirt on swimsuits, the styling of pubic hair has also come into vogue.&lt;ref name=Embod1 /&gt; The practice to remove more pubic hair continued with the popularity or fashion of even briefer swimwear, such as the [[Thong (clothing)|thong]], which exposed the buttocks.

Changes in lingerie styles also encouraged the removal of pubic hair,&lt;ref name=milady /&gt;{{Rp|page=139}} and the nude crotch{{nsmdns}}i.e., the total removal of pubic hair, such as in a full Brazilian or the Sphinx style{{nsmdns}}became considered by many to be [[erotic]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]]. A nude crotch is considered by some to be more youthful looking.&lt;ref name=Embod1 /&gt;{{Rp|59}} According to Tschachler, Devine and Draxlbauer, removal of all visible body hair has come to be seen as an important aspect of femininity.&lt;ref name=Embod1 /&gt;{{Rp|60}}

The '''Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities''' ('''CRASSH''') is an interdisciplinary research centre within the [[University of Cambridge]] for collaboration between researchers from the [[arts]], [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].  The Centre is independent of any university department but works with both the School of Arts and Humanities, and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Founded in 2001, CRASSH celebrated its 10th anniversary by welcoming professor [[Simon Goldhill]] as its new director and moving from Mill Lane, to the Alison Richard Building at 7 West Road, as well as inaugurating a new series of public lectures, which in 2011 were on [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1804/ The Idea of the University] and in 2012 [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/11 Understanding Society].

==New Building: 7 West Road==
At beginning of 2012, CRASSH moved into the new [[Alison Richard]] building at the West Road gateway to the University’s [[Sidgwick Site]], the main base for humanities and social science teaching and research at Cambridge. The building was designed by [[Nicholas Hare Architects]] and received a commendation at the 2013 [[Civic Trust Awards]]. The move into [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/1006/new-building.htm 7 West Road]  provides in-house space for larger conferences, but also creates greater interaction with old and new constituencies. The Centre’s relocation puts CRASSH alongside the major regional studies centres and POLIS, the Department of Politics and International Studies. The building is also home to [[Edmund de Waal]]'s first piece of public sculpture, A Local History, a commission of three vitrines filled with porcelain and sunk into the pavement outside the building.

==Graduate/faculty research groups==
The graduate/ faculty programme supports students and faculty working together around shared interdisciplinary research interests. The groups act as a barometer for disciplinary development and curriculum change. This programme is funded by the Isaac Newton Trust and the Andrew W Mellon.

==Conferences==

The conference support programme functions as a showcase for arts, social sciences and humanities research in action. It provides the opportunity for Cambridge scholars to broker local and international collaborations. Recent and upcoming conferences include [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1321/ The Future University], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1700/ Migration in Legal and Political Theory], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1703/ Art, Memory and Dictatorship in Latin America], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1705/ Languages of Citizenship in Translation], [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1707/ Still Architecture] and [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1711/ Medieval Church Screens].

==Fellowships and postdoctoral researchers==

The Centre offers a number of programmes to bring scholars from all over the world to CRASSH: the fellowship schemes allow a community of scholars – from postdoctoral and early career researchers to more established visiting fellows – to interact in an interdisciplinary research environment.

==Media and outreach==
The Centre reaches out globally through its Facebook site and through making available recordings of an increasing number of events online, in our Media Gallery and via the Cambridge YouTube and iTunesU channels:

'''Charro Days''', also known as '''Charro Days Fiesta''' or '''Charro Days Festival''', is a two-nation [[Festival|fiesta]] and an annual four-day pre-Lenten celebration held in [[Brownsville, Texas]], [[United States]] in cooperation with [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. The [[Grito Mexicano|grito]]—a joyous Mexican shout—opens the festivities every year. This festival is a shared heritage celebration between the two border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. The Charro Days festivals usually have about 50,000 attendants each year. This celebration includes the [[Sombrero Festival]] as well as a parade that goes down Elizabeth St. through Historic Downtown Brownsville, TX.

==History==
The festival was first organized and celebrated 1937 by the ''Brownsville Chamber of Commerce'' to recognize Mexican culture and honor the [[charros]], or the "dashing Mexican gentlemen cowboys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charro Days|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lkc02|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is mentioned in the official webpage that the Charro Days festival was also created to bring people together during the effects of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Charro Days|url=http://www.charrodaysfiesta.com/history.htm|publisher=Charro Days Fiesta - Brownsville, Texas|accessdate=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208023031/http://www.charrodaysfiesta.com/history.htm#|archive-date=2012-02-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not proven, it is rumored that the first “unofficial” Charro Days was realized in the early to mid-1800s, when people from the city of [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], just across the [[Rio Grande]] in [[Mexico]], came together to celebrate a cooperative cultural festival to honor the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Danno|title=Brownsville Fiesta Has Linked Texas And Mexico For Decades|url=http://gotexas.about.com/od/festivals/a/CharroDays.htm|publisher=Charro Days - A South Texas Tradition|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

The four-day festival has daily parades, food stands and music, people dancing in the street, boat races, fireworks, bull fights, and a rodeo in Brownsville and in its sister city of Matamoros. 

===Costumes===
Costumes reflecting Mexico's tradition have been used by those who partake in the occasion.  Men, for the most part, wear traditional Mexican costumes—whether it is the [[charro]] costume or a [[cowboy]] one—while women wear the colorful [[Huipil]] costume.  The traditional costume is often worn by adults, elders, and children on all four days to celebrate and honor borderland heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://charrodaysfiesta.com/history.html|website=charrodaysfiesta.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===

'''Mr. Amigo Association''', an organization that works for the friendly relationship with [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville, Texas, United States]] and to preserve the Charro Days and [[Sombrero Festival]] celebrations, became a part of Charro Days in 1967. [[Sombrero Festival|Sombrero Fest]], a three-day ''Washington Park'' street party with popular rock, country and Tejano performers, was added in 1986. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the first president of the Mr. Amigo Association was the former [[President of Mexico|president]] of [[Mexico]], [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]].

During the creation of [[NAFTA]] agreement in 1988-1989, Congressman [[Solomon P. Ortiz|Solomon Ortiz]] presented the Mr. Amigo Association with the Mr. Amigo Review Award for the distinction of being one of the first organizations to extend friendship and mutual understanding between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. The Mr. Amigo Review Award remains on exhibit at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as a model of bi-national friendliness between these two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Mr. Amigo|url=http://mramigo.com/About|publisher=Mr. Amigo Association|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chinese Poetry Congress''''' ({{zh|c=中国诗词大会|p=Zhōngguó Shīcí Dàhuì}}) is an ongoing game show on China Central Television that tests competitors' memory and reciting of [[Chinese poetry]], including classical and modern forms of ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'', ''[[ci (poetry)|ci]]'' and ''[[qu (poetry)|qu]]''. As a spin-off of other shows ''Chinese Characters Dictation Competition'' and ''Chinese Idioms Congress'', all characters within the games are in simplified Chinese.

==Opening poetry==
Every episode of the show starts with quotations from a piece of classical Chinese poetry. By far ten pieces have been quoted. Note: the following pinyin tones show original, or standard pronunciation, not including [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones on special syllables|tone sandhis on special syllables]].

In the second season, the off-stage contestants no longer read poems, and the presenter of the show reads instead.

==Gameplay==
The show follows a two-part game. In the first part, there are 105 contestants competing, 5 that have done best in the previous episode on stage and 100 off stage (called "百人团", lit. ''hundred people team''). The ones on stage select their set of ten questions one by one, and answer them in order. If they answer correctly in 10 seconds, the population that does incorrectly adds to their mark, otherwise their game is over. When a contestant's mark surpasses another's, the latter is eliminated.

The second part sees the best of the five challenging the contestant that has done best during the season, and they have to answer a series of more tough questions in order to win the challenge.

The second season introduces a more "reasonable" gameplay: every episode four contestants are selected from the hundred-contestants team, and follow part one from the first season; then the best of them has to challenge the fastest and most correct off-stage contestant to decide who would be the best of the episode, and may accept challenge from people that competes later. The first four contestants (in the opening episode) were chosen as the best performers of a non-broadcast written test and subsequent auditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kejiao.cctv.com/2017/01/25/ARTIyqIiYOOXKDlAxu8rcb7O170125.shtml|title=Rules of the ''Chinese Poetry Congress''|date=January 25, 2017|access-date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Question format===
====Round 1====
The first round contains nine questions:
*'''Identify the line'''. Choose the correct characters from 9 or 12 characters to form a line of a poem.
*'''Missing character/line'''. Fill in the missing character or complete the missing line.
*'''Multiple choice'''.

====Round 2====
Each of the two contestants must alternatively give two poem lines, containing a chosen character. The game ends when one of the two contestants cannot name another sentence.

====Championship Round====
Winner of Round 2 and the returning champion play a best-of-nine final, all the questions are on the buzzer. First to score 5 points will be determined as the champion, and return for the next episode.

==Cast==
===Presenter===
The presenter of ''Chinese Poetry Congress'' is Dong Qing, known for co-hosting [[CCTV New Year's Gala]] for years. She serves as both a host and a narrator. During a re-recording, Dong, by accident, fell off the stage and hurt her kneecap; however she insisted to continue recording under a cold compression, and eventually completed the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20160408/42602688_0.shtml|title=超敬业！董卿主持节目踩空摔伤 忍痛坚持录制|website=ifeng.com|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong also performed reciting a poem in [[Shanghainese]], singing Su Shi's ''[[Shui diao ge tou]]'', and quoting numerous [[chengyu|Chinese idioms]] on air.

===Judges===
* [[Li Bo (scholar)|Li Bo]] ({{zh|s=郦波|t=|labels=no}}) is a [[Nanjing Normal University]] literature professor, having been giving lessons at CCTV's ''[[Lecture Room]]'', a program on which scholars share their works and make statements of various subjects. Li was also a judge on ''Chinese Idioms Congress''.
* [[Meng Man]] ({{zh|s=蒙曼|t=|labels=no}}) is a master-advisor of [[Minzu University of China]], working on ancient Chinese women. Meng was also a lecturer on ''Lecture Room'' and a judge on ''Chinese Idioms Congress''.
* [[Wang Liqun]] ({{zh|s=王立群|t=|labels=no}}) is a [[Henan University]] professor and Doctor-advisor and a pioneer on studying ancient Chinese literature and culture.
* [[Kang Zhen]] ({{zh|s=康震|t=|labels=no}}) is a [[Beijing Normal University]] professor and Doctor-advisor.

===The Hundred Contestants Team===
The people that answer questions off-stage are from all walks of life such as teachers, students, peasants and the police, not restricted to Chinese residents. The age ranges from 7 to 55. They follow the narrator's reciting opening poetry and count to the points that an on-stage contestant gets if their answer is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.zzxu.cn/fanwen/dangtuan/194831.html|title=中国诗词大会2016百人团咋选的}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the limited time of 10 seconds to answer on a [[tablet computer]], a large quantity of contestants failed to complete verses that are usually taught in China's primary schools, for example [[Meng Haoran]]'s ''Ode to the Willow'' ({{zh|s=咏柳|t=詠柳|p=Yǒng Liǔ|links=no|first=t}}), leading to criticism on the team, as they were described as "The regular studio audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.sohu.com/n/439343287/|title=《中国诗词大会》"百人团"被指"路人团"？|website=sohu.com|date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In the 22nd [[Shanghai Television Festival]], ''Chinese Poetry Congress'' is awarded the best variety show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stvf.com/shlj/n96/n172/u1ai4222.html|title=Award list of the 22nd Shanghai Television Festival|date=June 11, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804035021/http://www.stvf.com/shlj/n96/n172/u1ai4222.html|archivedate=August 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|This article concerns Chinese units of measurement as generally used in [[mainland China]]. For local modifications of it, see [[Taiwanese units|Taiwanese]], [[Hong Kong units|Hong Kong]], and [[Singaporean units of measurement]].}}

'''Chinese units of measurement''', known in Chinese as the '''''shìzhì''''' ("market system"), are the traditional [[units of measurement]] of the [[Han Chinese]]. Although [[Chinese numerals]] have been [[decimal]] (base-10) since the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], several Chinese measures use [[hexadecimal]] (base-16). Local applications have varied, but the [[Chinese dynasties]] usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor's systems in [[Chinese dynastic histories|their histories]]. 

In the present day, the [[People's Republic of China]] maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the [[metric system]], for example the common ''jin'' or [[catty (unit)|catty]] of exactly 500{{nbsp}}[[gram (unit)|g]]. The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word "market" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|市}}}}, ''shì'') is used to specify the traditional unit and "common" or "public" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|公}}}}, ''gōng'') is used for the metric value. [[Taiwan]], like [[Korean units|Korea]], saw [[Taiwanese units of measurement|its traditional units]] standardized to [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese values]] and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese ''[[ping (unit)|ping]]'' of about 3.306{{nbsp}}m² based on the square ''[[Ken (unit)|ken]]''. The [[Hong Kong SAR]] continues to use [[Hong Kong units of measurement|its traditional units]], now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely 604.78982{{nbsp}}g.

Note: The names ''lí'' ({{lang|zh|厘}}) and ''fēn'' ({{lang|zh|分}}) for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.

==History==
[[File:Bronze ruler. Han Dynasty 206 BCE to CE 220. Excavated in Zichang County. Shaanxi History Museum, Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Bronze ruler from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE to CE 220); excavated in [[Zichang County]]; [[Shaanxi History Museum]], [[Xi'an]]]]
{{History of science and technology in China}}
According to the ''[[Liji]]'', the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] created the first measurement units. The ''[[Xiao Erya]]'' and the ''[[Kongzi Jiayu]]'' state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', these human body units caused inconsistency, and [[Yu the Great]], another legendary figure, unified the length measurements. [[Ruler]]s with decimal units have been unearthed from [[Shang Dynasty]] tombs.

In the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the [[Warring States period]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the [[Han Dynasty]], these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the [[Book of Han]].

Astronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the [[Ming Dynasty]] that the traditional system was revised.

===Republican Era===
{{see also|Taiwanese units of measurement}}
On 7 January 1915, the [[Beiyang Government]] promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement.&lt;ref name="ROC1915"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/eng/detail.jsp?sysid=D1500002 |contribution=權度法 [''Quándù Fǎ''] |title=''政府公報 [''Zhèngfǔ Gōngbào'', ''Government Gazette'']'' |location=Beijing |volume=No. 957 |publisher=Office of the President |date=7 January 1915 |pp=85–94 }}. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 1929, the [[Nationalist Government]] adopted and promulgated ''The Weights and Measures Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=J0100052 |title=The Weights and Measures Act: Legislative History |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Republic of China)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to adopt the [[metric system]] as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement ({{zh|c=市用制|p=shìyòngzhì|l=market-use system}}) to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930.&lt;ref name="ROC1930"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425025351/http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-25 |title=The Weights and Measures Act (1929) |publisher=[[Legislative Yuan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] on 25 June 1959, but 1 [[catty]] being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) [[tael]]s, instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province to province]], while exempting [[Chinese herbology|Chinese prescription drugs]] from the conversion to prevent errors.&lt;ref name="PRC1959"&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2011-11/09/content_1988933.htm 1959 Gazette of the State Council of the People's Republic of China], [http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/shuju/1959/gwyb195916.pdf No. 180], pages 311 to 312&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable till the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but [[Agricultural land|farmland]] measures would be exempt from this mandatory [[metrication]] until further investigation and study.&lt;ref name="PRC1984"&gt;[http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html Decree of the State Council Concerning the Use of Uniform Legal Measures in the Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409152907/http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html |date=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Hong Kong units of measurement}}
In 1976 the [[Hong Kong]] [[Metrication Ordinance]] allowed a gradual replacement of the system in favor of the [[International System of Units]] (SI) metric system.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook HK. "[http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/1997/ch7/e7s.htm Yearbook]." ''Metrication.'' Retrieved on 26 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Weights and Measures Ordinance defines the metric, Imperial, and Chinese units.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap68 Cap. 68 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ORDINANCE]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, all three systems are legal for trade and are in widespread use.

===Macau===
On 24 August 1992, [[Macau]] published ''Law No. 14/92/M'' to order that Chinese units of measurement similar to those used in Hong Kong, [[Imperial units]], and [[United States customary units]] would be permissible for five years since the effective date of the Law, 1 January 1993, on the condition of indicating the corresponding SI values, then for three more years thereafter, Chinese, Imperial, and US units would be permissible as secondary to the SI.&lt;ref name="MO"&gt;''Law No. 14/92/M'' ({{zh icon}} {{lang|zh|[http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/92/34/lei14_cn.asp 第14/92/M號法律]}}; {{pt icon}} [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/92/34/lei14.asp Lei n.º 14/92/M])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Length===
[[File:Gilded Bronze Ruler - 1 chi = 231 cm. Western Han (206 BCE - CE 8). Hanzhong City.jpg|thumb|Gilded Bronze Ruler - 1 ''[[chi (length)|chi]]'' = 231 mm. [[Western Han]] (206 BCE–8 CE). [[Hanzhong City]]]]
Traditional units of length include the ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]'' ({{lang|zh|尺}}), ''bu'' ({{lang|zh|步}}), and ''[[li (length)|li]]'' ({{lang|zh|里}}). The precise length of these units, and the ratios between these units, has varied over time. 1 ''bu'' has consisted of either 5 or 6 ''chi'', while 1 ''li'' has consisted of 300 or 360 ''bu''.

====Metric length units====
The Chinese word for [[metre]] is {{lang|zh|米}} ''mǐ''; this can take the [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "kilo-", "centi-", etc.). A [[kilometre]], however, may also be called {{lang|zh|公里}} ''gōnglǐ'', i.e. a metric ''[[li (Chinese unit)|lǐ]]''.

In the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units.For example, the Chinese word {{lang|zh|丝}} sī is used to express 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Metric volume units====
In the case of volume, the market and metric ''shēng'' coincide, being equal to one litre as shown in the table. The [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "milli-", "centi-", etc.) may be added to this word ''shēng''.

Units of volume can also be obtained from any standard unit of length using the prefix {{lang|zh|立方}} ''lìfāng'' ("cubic"), as in {{lang|zh|立方米}} ''lìfāng mǐ'' for a cubic metre.

====Metric mass units====
The Chinese word for [[gram]] is {{lang|zh|克}} ''kè''; this can take the [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "milli-", "deca-", etc.). A kilogram, however, is commonly called {{lang|zh|公斤}} ''gōngjīn'', i.e. a metric ''[[catty|jīn]]''.

==Historiography==
As there were hundreds of unofficial measures in use, the bibliography is quite vast. The editions of Wu Chenglou's 1937 ''History of Chinese Measurement''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wu |first=Chenglou |authormask=吳承洛 |title=''《中國度量衡史》 [''Zhōngguó Dùliànghéng Shǐ'']'' |date=1937 }}, 2nd ed. in 1957, 3rd ed. in 1993. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the usual standard up to the 1980s or so, but rely mostly on surviving literary accounts. Newer research has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2000"/&gt; [[Qiu Guangming]] &amp; Zhang Yanming's 2005 bilingual ''Concise History of Ancient Chinese Measures and Weights'' summarizes these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Qiu |first=Guangming |authorlink=Qiu Guangming |authormask=丘光明 |editor-first=Yanming |editor-last=Zhang |editor-mask=张延明 |title=''《中国古代计量史图鉴》 [''Zhōngguó Gǔdài Jìliàng Shǐ Tújiàn'']'' |location=Hefei |publisher=Hefei University Press |date=2005 |isbn=7-81093-284-5 }}. {{zh icon}}{{nbsp}}&amp; {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively recent and comprehensive bibliography, organized by period studied, has been compiled in 2012 by Cao &amp; al.;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cao |first=Jin |authormask=Cao Jin |author2=Ulrich Theobald |author3=Hans Ulrich Vogel |author4=others |display-authors=1 |url=https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/47035 |title=Chinese, Japanese and Western Research in Chinese Historical Metrology: A Classified Bibliography (1925-2012) |publisher=Institute for Chinese and Korean Studies at the University of Tübingen |location=Tübingen |date=2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a shorter list, see [[Endymion Wilkinson|Wilkinson]]'s year 2000 ''Chinese History''.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2000"&gt;{{citation |first=Endymion |last=Wilkinson |authorlink=Endymion Wilkinson |title=Chinese History: A Manual |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] |isbn=978-0-674-00249-4 |pages=244–245 |edition=2nd }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Novial]] was created by [[Otto Jespersen]], who had also been a co-author of Ido.  Both languages base their vocabularies primarily on the Germanic and Romance languages but differ grammatically in several important respects. Comparisons among Ido, Novial, and other notable [[International Auxiliary Language|international auxiliary languages]] have formed an important part of interlinguistic studies. For example, both Ido and Novial were among the languages investigated by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA), which developed [[Interlingua]]. This article is intended to provide an overview of the salient differences and similarities of Ido and Novial. 

Novial is more [[Analytic language|analytic]] than [[Ido (language)|Ido]], and in [[Otto Jespersen|Jespersen]]'s view more natural.

==Alphabets and pronunciation==

Both [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Novial]] are written using the modern [[Latin alphabet]] with no [[diacritic]]s. 

In the Phonetic Novial spelling system (1928, 1930) the main differences between the Novial vocabulary and those of other systems come from the suppression of the letters c and z. The letter ''s'' plays an important part but tends to distort the visual appearance of some words (sientie = science, sesa = cease, sivil(i) = civil).

==Verbal systems==

The grammars of Novial and Ido differ substantially in the way that the various [[grammatical tense|tense]]s, [[grammatical mood|mood]]s and [[grammatical voice|voice]]s of [[verb]]s are expressed. Both use a combination of [[auxiliary verb]]s and verb endings. However, Novial uses many more auxiliary verbs and few endings, while Ido uses only one auxiliary verb and a greater number of verb endings.

As with most international auxiliary languages, all verb forms in Ido and Novial are independent of person (1st, 2nd or 3rd persons) and number (singular or plural).

==Language sample for comparison==
Here is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in both languages:

{|
|-
||'''Ido version:'''
:Patro nia, qua esas en la cielo,
:tua nomo santigesez;
:tua regno advenez;
:tua volo facesez
:quale en la cielo tale anke sur la tero.
:Donez a ni cadie l'omnidiala pano,
:e pardonez a ni nia ofensi,
:quale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,
:e ne duktez ni aden la tento,
:ma liberigez ni del malajo.
||'''Novial version:'''
:Nusen Patre, kel es in siele,
:mey vun nome bli sanktifika,

:mey on fa vun volio
:kom in siele anke sur tere.
:Dona a nus disidi li omnidiali pane,

:e non dukte nus en tentatione,
:ma liberisa nus fro malu.

The '''crafts of India''' are diverse, rich in history ,culture 
and religion.  The craft of each state in [[India]] reflect the influence of different empires. Throughout centuries, crafts have been embedded as a culture and tradition within rural communities.

'''[[Crafts]]'''

[[Metal Crafts]] includes metal work using [[Zinc]], [[Copper]], [[Brass]], [[Silver]], [[Gold]]. Some of the traditional ancient handicraft styles are [[Bidriware]], [[Pembarthi Metal Craft]], [[Dhokra]], [[Kamrupi crafts|Kamrupi]]

:[[Bidriware]] The term 'Bidriware' originates from the township of Bidar, which is still the chief centre for the manufacture of the unique metalware. Due to its striking inlay artwork, Bidriware is an important export handicraft of India and is prized as a symbol of wealth. The metal used is a blackened alloy of zinc and copper inlaid with thin sheets of pure silver.

:[[Pembarthi Metal Craft]] Pembarthi Metal Craft is a metal handicraft made in Pembarthi, Warangal district, Telangana State, India. They are popular for their exquisite sheet metal art works. This meticulous brass work art flourished during the reign of Kakatiyas empire. Kakatiyas extensively used sheet metal art to adorn chariots and temples.

:[[Dhokra]] is non–ferrous metal casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro.[1] The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.

:[[Kamrupi crafts|Kamrupi]] Brass and Bell Metal products of Kamrup are famous for their beauty and strength of form and utility. Brass is an important cottage industry, with highest concentration in Hajo, while Sarthebari is well known for its bell metal craft. The principal items of brass are the kalah (water pot), sarai (a platter or tray mounted on a base), kahi (dish), bati (bowl), lota (water pot with a long neck) and tal (cymbals). Gold, silver and copper too have formed part of traditional metalcraft in Kamrup, and the State Museum in Guwahati has a rich collection of items made of these metals. Gold is generally used in ornaments.

== Crafts of Bihar ==
[[Bihar]] , recognised by its [[Madhubani/Mithila Painting]], [[Bhagalpur]] painting which is also known as [[Manjusha Art]] &amp; extra ordinary delicacy of quilting.

== Crafts of Rajasthan ==

{{Culture of India}}
[[Rajasthan]], recognized by its Royal heritage is a prominent and well-established craft industry. Craft remains a tradition in Rajasthan, preserved over centuries by the stronghold of the Royal Rajput family.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Within the craft industry are smaller occupations. These include, fabric colouration and embellishment, decorative painting and puppetry. Craft workers see this not as an occupation, but rather a mark of respect to their heritage. In the process of fabric colouration, woven fabrics are treated by methods such as tie-dyeing, resist dyeing and direct application. The [[dupatta]] worn by women show the popularity of dyeing. In 2008, traditional Jodhpur garments inspired designer [[Raghavendra Rathore]]'s collection, Rathore Jodhpur.&lt;ref name="Rajasthan is now on the world ramp"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rajasthan is now on the world ramp|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jun 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabric dyeing belongs to the Chippa caste of Rajasthan. Fabrics are embellished with mirror embroidery, symbolic to Rajasthan and wooden beading once dyed. The trend of mirror embroidery is also visible on dupattas in Punjab, known as the phulkari. Decorative patterns adorn all surfaces in Rajasthan. Interiors of homes are painted with floral motifs; similar [[bindi (decoration)|bindi]] (dotted) designs are seen on garments. The clipped camel is unique to Rajasthan. In this, patterns are imprinted on the hide of the camel, taken place during the Pushkar and Nagaur festivals by the Rabari caste.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Puppetry and theatre has remained a popular form of entertainment in Rajasthan. Recently, its popularity has reduced with increased interest in film and television amongst rural communities. The nat bhat caste produces these [[marionette]] style puppets.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 182-183"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Facial expressions are painted on a mango wood head and the body is covered in decorative, Rajasthani clothing. The strings loosely bind the arms and torso together to give flexibility for movement. These puppets usually perform in legends and mythology conveying a moral message. The Rajasthani craft industry is iconic to the identity of India with many of its styles reaching the international market. [[Tie-dyeing]] is an example of how international fashion aesthetics have rooted from simple crafts methods of Rajasthan.

== Crafts of Gujarat ==
Gujarat is renowned for its textile production methods. Bordering Rajasthan, the two states share similarities in culture and identity. The ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]] inhabited the entire region, including Rajasthan and Punjab during Medieval India.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Dress of Gujarat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Eiluned|title=Textiles and Dress of Gujarat|year=2011|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=978-81-89995-52-2|pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They embarked on this textile industry in Gujarat. Within textile production, each caste is assigned to an occupation of its own. These are, weaving, dyeing and printing. For example, the [[Salvi (caste)|Salvi]] caste is assigned to weaving.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Dress of Gujarat pages 45-47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Eiluned|title=Textiles and Dress of Gujarat|year=2011|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=978-81-89995-52-2|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garment producers bring these elements together to form the identity of Gujarati textiles. Direct application is a method also symbolic to Gujarati garments. Paint and other applicants are used to form patterns on fabric for dupattas, ghagras (long skirt) and turbans. Block printing is a widely used form of direct application. In [[Bandhani]], a unique Gujarati craft, fabric is tied at different sections before dyeing to create patterns.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Dress of Gujarat pages 116-119"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Eiluned|title=Textiles and Dress of Gujarat|year=2011|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=978-81-89995-52-2|pages=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This foundation of forming patterns through dyeing has emerged from the rural communities of this state. Along with the complete image of a Gujarati woman are large bangles made of ivory and plastic, these are symbols of a married woman. Conch shell and shellac bangles are the most common. Conch shell bangles are plain white with a light shade of a brighter colour where as shellac bangles are shaped as a shell, painted and decorated with glitter.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India pages 104-105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Craft of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These have in recent years become an accessory in both domestic and international markets..

== Crafts of Assam ==
To the far eastern region of India is Assam. A state recognized for its creative use of raw materials in textiles and crafts. Assam was one of the states whose craftwork was exhibited in the National Handicrafts and Handborn Museum in 2010, showcased to first lady, Michelle Obama.&lt;ref name="Crafts village waits for Michelle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Basu|first=Indrani|title=Crafts village waits for Michelle|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-07/delhi/28236979_1_michelle-obama-first-lady-sumar-bhura|accessdate=3/10/2011|newspaper=The Times of India|date=7/11/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Production of silk fabrics is iconic of Assamese textiles. Silk is the most valued raw material of Assam, with the Antheraea assama worm producing the unique muga silk.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India page 105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandari, Dhingra|first=Dr. Vandana, Sudha|title=Textiles and Crafts of India|year=1998|publisher=Prakash Book Depot|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7234-021-4|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is mostly the duty of women to construct silk fabrics, using a domestic [[Loom|backstrap loom]].&lt;ref name="Indian Textiles pages 176-177"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillow, Barnard|first=John, Nicholas|title=Indian Textiles|year=1991|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-51432-0|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mahatma Gandhi had noted ‘Assamese women are born weavers, they weave fairy-tales in their cloth’.&lt;ref name="Indian Textiles pages 176-177" /&gt;  Domestic weaving is an important craft for Assamese women, their marriage and future is seen as reliant upon this skill. At some stage, an unmarried girl would present a hand made bihuan to her beloved.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India page 108"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandari, Dhingra|first=Dr. Vandana, Sudha|title=Textiles and Crafts of India|year=1998|publisher=Prakash Book Depot|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7234-021-4|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving holds a significant moral and cultural value in Assam. The silk and textile industry is also an economic resource to the state with over 25000 families associated with this craft.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India page 105" /&gt;  Cane and bamboo crafts are also unique to Assam, the result of heavy physical work. Ridang, suli, lezai and long cane are a natural resource to the state.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India pages 118-119"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhandari, Dhingra|first=Dr. Vandana, Sudha|title=Textiles and Crafts of India|year=1998|publisher=Prakash Book Depot|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7234-021-4|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finest cane is chopped and reduced to thin strips then woven into sheets. It is attached to the frame of a furniture piece, usually made out of bamboo sticks. They are also used as mats, providing comfort in summer.&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India pages 118-119" /&gt;  The trend of this sitalpati&lt;ref name="Textiles and Crafts of India pages 118-119" /&gt;  mat is also seen in Punjab in which a woven mat attached to a frame becomes a [[charpai]]. The crafts of Assam are reliant upon the raw materials of the state also making them unique.

== Crafts of South India ==
The diversity of religious beliefs has had a great impact on the crafts of Southern India. The region has seen the rule of various empires such as the Mughal, Portuguese, Dutch, French and British.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each has left their mark of style on traditional crafts. The craft industry of South India has established itself commercially in the nation, whilst reflecting a long history of foreign rule. [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] style, stone carved temples reflect the influence of Hinduism whilst Roman Catholic churches echo the impact of the British rule.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 36" /&gt;  Temple carvings are symbolic of the craft skills in the Tamil Nadu region. The Meenakshi temple of Madurai typifies the skills and devotion put into this craftwork.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India page 34"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each section of the temple is a sacred shrine to a deity. North of Tamil Nadu is Karnataka, a region renowned for its wood and stone craftwork. The forests of this region provide extensive supplies of raw materials, mostly rosewood. For wood workers, crafting statues for large temples is a major source of income. The forms of characters from Hindu mythology are carefully shaped with a chisel. [[Soapstone]] is also commonly used to carve statues giving them a unique textural quality and smooth finish.&lt;ref name="Arts and Crafts of India pages 41-55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Nicholas|title=Arts and Crafts of India|year=1993|publisher=Conran Octopus Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85029-504-2|pages=41–43, 46–49, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crafts today ==
The crafts of India have been valued throughout time; their existence today proves the efforts put into their preservation. Contemporary designers such as Ritu Kumar and Ritu Virani are constantly embedding traditional crafts into their designs.  Also, there is a complete educational institute, Indian Institute of Crafts and Design (IICD) which is established in Jaipur, Rajasthan, which mainly educates for the crafts and their existence with design. Despite these efforts, the roots of these crafts, which are the rural craftsmen, are in decline. This argued by the India Foundation for the Arts organisation.&lt;ref name="India Foundation for the Arts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vellani|first=Anmol|title=Sustaining Crafts Development in India|url=http://www.indiaifa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=26|work=India Foundation for the Arts|publisher=Icarus Design Consultants|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rising costs of materials and supplies have placed many of these craft communities in financial struggle. A recent article in the Times of India predicts the price of steel to rise between Rs 600 and 1000 per tonne.&lt;ref name="Steel cos to raise prices on rising input costs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pandey|first=Piyush|title=Steel cos to raise prices on rising input costs|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-01/india-business/29608321_1_steel-prices-coking-coal-automobile-and-consumer|accessdate=24 October 2011|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, statistics from the All India Handicrafts Board show that craft export has risen from 23 crores to over 9000 crores since the past 50 years.&lt;ref name="From then till Now"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dhamija|first=Jasleen|title=From then till Now|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/2003/jun/eco-craftsnow.htm|work=India Together|publisher=Civil Society Information Exchange Pvt. Ltd|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With rising economic and political issues in India, the craft sector is struggling to uphold. Although an interest to retain the culture of crafts is seen in designers and institutions.
Handicrafts are the creative products made by the skill of the hand without the help of modern machinery and equipment. Nowadays, hand-made products are considered to be a fashion statement and an item of luxury.

India’s rich cultural heritage and centuries of evolutionary tradition is manifested by the huge variety of handicrafts made all over the country. Handicrafts are a mirror of the cultural identity of the ethnic people who make it. Through the ages, [[Handicrafts in India|handicrafts]] made in India like the Kashmiri woollen carpets, Zari embroidered fabrics, terracotta and ceramic products, silk fabrics etc. have maintained their exclusiveness. In the ancient times, these handicrafts were exported to far off countries of Europe, Africa, West Asia and Far East via the ‘silk route’. The entire wealth of timeless Indian handicrafts has survived through the ages. These crafts carry the magnetic appeal of the Indian culture that promises exclusivity, beauty, dignity and style.

&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribesindia.com/answers-to-your-questions/ Indian handicrafts] could be broadly divided into three categories: folk crafts, religious crafts and commercial crafts. Popular folk crafts that are modified according to the demands of the market become commercial crafts. Myriads of handicrafts are made for the diverse rites and rituals associated with the religious faiths of the varied ethnic groups of India. Some of the handicrafts basically meant for the religious purposes are also liked by the people for their aesthetic value.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46097">The '''Critical Psychiatry Network''' (CPN) is a [[psychiatric]] organization based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was created by a group of British psychiatrists who met in [[Bradford]], England in January 1999 in response to proposals by the British government to amend the [[Mental Health Act|1983 Mental Health Act]] (MHA). They expressed concern about the implications of the proposed changes for human rights and the civil liberties of people with mental health illness. Most people associated with the group are practicing consultant psychiatrists in the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]] (NHS), among them Dr [[Joanna Moncrieff]]. A number of non-consultant grade and trainee psychiatrists are also involved in the network.

Participants in the Critical Psychiatry Network share concerns about psychiatric practice where and when it is heavily dependent upon diagnostic classification and the use of [[psychopharmacology]]. These concerns reflect their recognition of poor construct validity amongst psychiatric diagnoses  and scepticism about the efficacy of anti-depressants, mood stabilisers and anti-psychotic agents.&lt;ref name="Ref_p"/&gt; According to them, these concerns have ramifications in the area of the use of psychiatric diagnosis to justify civil detention and the role of scientific knowledge in psychiatry, and an interest in promoting the study of interpersonal phenomena such as relationship, meaning and narrative in pursuit of better understanding and improved treatment.

CPN has similarities and contrasts with earlier criticisms of conventional psychiatric practice, for example those associated with [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Thomas Szasz]]. Features of CPN are pragmatism and full acknowledgment of the suffering commonly associated with mental health difficulties. As a result, it functions primarily as a forum within which practitioners can share experiences of practice, and provide support and encouragement in developing improvements in mainstream NHS practice where most participants are employed.

CPN maintains close links with service user or survivor led organisations such as the [[Hearing Voices Network]], Intervoice and the [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria Network]], and with like-minded psychiatrists in other countries. It maintains its own website. The network is open to any sympathetic psychiatrist, and members meet in person, in the UK, twice a year.  It is primarily intended for psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees and full participation is not available to other groups.

==Key issues==
CPN is concerned with a number of issues, including the problem of coercion and the role of psychiatry in social control, the role of biological science in psychiatry, and the implications of the decontextualisation of experience in [[psychiatry]].

===Coercion and social control===
CPN recognises that the practice of psychiatry in Britain involves a delicate balance between respecting individual rights and freedoms, and the need to protect other people. The publication of the British Government’s green paper containing proposals to amend the 1983 MHA raised serious concerns within the CPN that the balance would shift too far in the direction of public protection, thus emphasizing the social control function of psychiatry. The green paper contained two proposals that raised particular concern for members of CPN. One involved the introduction of new legislation to enable psychiatrists to detain indefinitely people with so-called dangerously severe personality disorders (DSPD), even though they had not committed or been convicted of an offence.

The other involved the introduction of [[community treatment order]]s (CTOs) to make it possible to treat people against their wishes in the community. CPN submitted evidence to the Scoping Group set up by the government under Professor [[Genevra Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence submitted to the Scoping Study Committee for Review of Mental Health Act|url=http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51:evidence-submitted-to-the-scoping-study-committee-for-review-of-mental-health-act&amp;catid=35:documents&amp;Itemid=56|website=Critical Psychiatry|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set out ethical and practical objections to CTOs, and ethical and human rights objections to the idea of reviewable detention. It was also critical of the concept of personality disorder as a diagnosis in psychiatry. In addition, CPN’s evidence called for the use of advance statements, crisis cards and a statutory right to independent advocacy as ways of helping to sustain autonomy at times of crisis. CPN also responded to government consultation on the proposed amendment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bradford Group|title=Response of the Bradford Group to the Draft Outline Proposals of the Scoping Study Committee|url=http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52:response-of-the-bradford-group-to-the-draft-outline-proposals-of-the-scoping-study-committee&amp;catid=35:documents&amp;Itemid=56|website=Critical Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to the Consultation Document: Reform of the Mental Health Act 1983|url=http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=134:response-to-the-consultation-document-reform-of-the-mental-health-act-1983&amp;catid=35:documents&amp;Itemid=56|website=Critical Psychiatry|date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern about these proposals caused a number of organizations to come together under the umbrella of the Mental Health Alliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Mental Health Alliance|url=http://www.mentalhealthalliance.org.uk/aboutus/index.html|website=Mental Health Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; to campaign in support of the protection of patients’ and carers’ rights, and to minimise coercion. CPN joined the Alliance’s campaign, but resigned in 2005 when it became clear that the Alliance would accept those aspects of the House of Commons Scrutiny Committee’s report that would result in the introduction of CTOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Phil|last2=Moncrieff|first2=Joanna|title=Letter of resignation from the Mental Health Alliance|url=http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=121:letter-of-resignation-from-the-mental-health-alliance&amp;catid=35:documents&amp;Itemid=56|website=Critical Psychiatry|date=12 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists not identified with CPN shared the Network’s concern about the more coercive aspects of the government’s proposals, so CPN carried out a questionnaire survey of over two and a half thousand (2,500) consultant psychiatrists working in England seeking their views of the proposed changes. The responses (a response rate of 46%) indicated widespread concern in the profession about reviewable detention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=MJ|last2=Hopkins|first2=W|last3=Thomas|first3=P|last4=Moncrieff|first4=J|last5=Bindman|first5=J|last6=Gray|first6=AJ|title=Most psychiatrists oppose plans for new mental health act|journal=BMJ|date=7 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7290|page=866|pmid=11321020|pmc=1120033|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7290.866/a|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CTOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=MJ|last2=Hopkins|first2=W|last3=Henderson|first3=C|title=Concerns over reform of the Mental Health Act|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|date=December 2000|volume=177|issue=6|page=563|doi=10.1192/bjp.177.6.563|pmid=11102334|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/177/6/563.1.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPN was paid attention by Thomas Szasz who wrote: “Members of the CPN, like their American counterparts, criticize the proliferation of psychiatric diagnoses and ‘excessive’ use of psychotropic drugs, but embrace psychiatric coercions.”&lt;ref name=Szasz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=Varieties of psychiatric criticism|journal=[[History of Psychiatry (journal)|History of Psychiatry]]|year=2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1177/0957154X12450236|url=http://www.aepsi.it/Szasz_Psy_critic_.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2012|citeseerx=10.1.1.674.8694}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of scientific knowledge in psychiatry===
There is a general concern in CPN about the dominant role played by biological science in contemporary psychiatry. It is concerned with two aspects of the use of science in psychiatry. One relates to the improper use of scientific evidence by the [[pharmaceutical]] industry and those psychiatrists with links to it. The other concerns the limitations of biological science in understanding distress and madness.

There is a strong view by CPN that contemporary psychiatry relies too much on the medical model, and attaches too much importance to a narrow biomedical view of diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Double|first1=DB|title=Critical Psychiatry|url=http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=146:critical-psychiatry-double-db&amp;catid=34:members-publications&amp;Itemid=56|website=Critical Psychiatry|accessdate=16 March 2010|date=15 December 2010}} Reprinted from {{cite journal|title=Critical Psychiatry|url=http://rila.co.uk/site/modules.php?name=Journals&amp;file=journal2&amp;func=showab&amp;jid=022&amp;aid=1822&amp;iid=132|journal=CPD Bulletin Psychiatry|date=2000|volume=2|issue=1|pages=33–36|issn=1463-046X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can, in part, be understood as the response of an earlier generation of psychiatrists to the challenge of what has been called ‘anti-psychiatry’. Psychiatrists such as [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Thomas Szasz]] (although the latter two rejected the term) were identified as part of a movement against psychiatry in the 1960s and 1970s. Stung by these attacks, as well as accusations that in any case psychiatrists could not even agree who was and who was not mentally ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenhan|first1=D|title=On being sane in insane places|journal=Science|date=19 January 1973|volume=179|issue=4070|pages=250–258|doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250|pmid=4683124|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2384&amp;context=lawreview}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; academic psychiatrists responded by stressing the biological and scientific basis of psychiatry through strenuous efforts to improve the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis based in a return to the traditions of one of the founding fathers of the profession, [[Emil Kraepelin]].&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;Klerman, G. (1978) The evolution of a scientific nosology. In Shershow, J. (ed.) Schizophrenia: Science and Practice. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|9780674791121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signaled the rise of what has been called neo-Kraepelinianism as evident in DSM-III and DSM-IV.

The use of standardized diagnostic criteria and checklists may have improved the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis, but the problem of its validity remains. The investment of huge sums of money in Britain, America and Europe over the last half-century has failed to reveal a single, replicable difference between a person with a diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and someone who does not have the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Ref_j"&gt;Boyle, M.

(1997) [http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=160:psychiatric-imperialism-the-medicalisation-of-modern-living-joanna-moncrieff&amp;catid=34:members-publications&amp;Itemid=56 Psychiatric Imperialism]: The Medicalisation of Modern Living. Soundings, 6, Summer 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This has a number of consequences:

First, the aggrandisement of biological research creates a false impression both inside and outside the profession of the credibility of the evidence used to justify drug treatments for disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Reading clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression, for example, such as that produced for the UK National Health Service by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), one might be fooled into believing that the evidence for the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is established beyond question. In reality this is not the case, as re-examinations of drug trial data in meta-analyses, especially where unpublished data are included (publication bias means that researchers and drug companies do not publish negative findings for obvious commercial reasons), have revealed that most of the benefits seen in active treatment groups are also seen in the placebo groups.&lt;ref name="Kirsch, I. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Irving|last1=Kirsch|first2=Brett J.|last2=Deacon|first3=Tania B.|last3=Huedo-Medina|first4=Alan|last4=Scoboria|first5=Thomas J.|last5=Moore|first6=Blair T.|last6=Johnson|title=Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration|journal=PLOS Medicine|date=26 February 2008|volume=5|issue=2|page=e45|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045|pmid=18303940|pmc=2253608}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moncrieff|first1=J|author1-link=Joanna Moncrieff|last2=Kirsch|first2=I|title=Efficacy of antidepressants in adults|journal=BMJ|date=16 July 2005|volume=331|issue=7509|pages=155–157|pmid=16020858|pmc=558707|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7509.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=EH|last2=Rosenthal|first2=R|title=Efficacy of antidepressants|journal=BMJ|date=8 Mar 2008|volume=336|issue=7643|pages=516–517|doi=10.1136/bmj.39510.531597.80|pmid=18319297|pmc=2265347}}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE itself says that the difference between antidepressant medication and placebo is not clinically significant, yet continues to recommend them.

As far as schizophrenia is concerned, neuroleptic drugs may have some short-term effects, but it is not the case that these drugs possess specific ‘anti-psychotic’ properties, and it is impossible to assess whether or not they confer advantages in long-term management of psychoses because of the severe disturbances that occur when people on long-term active treatment are withdrawn to placebos. These disturbances are traditionally interpreted as a ‘relapse’ of schizophrenia when in fact there are several possible interpretations for the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Ref_p"&gt;Moncrieff, J. (2008) The Myth of the Chemical Cure: A critique of Psychiatric Drug Treatment. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9780230574311}} (see especially chapters six and 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consequence of the domination of psychiatry by biological science is that the importance of contexts in understanding distress and madness is played down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Philip|last2=Romme|first2=Marius|last3=Hamelijnk|first3=Jacobus|title=Psychiatry and the politics of the underclass|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|date=October 1996|volume=169|issue=4|pages=401–404|doi=10.1192/bjp.169.4.401|pmid=8894187|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/169/4/401.full.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_r"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bracken|first1=P|last2=Thomas|first2=P|title=Postpsychiatry: A new direction for mental health|journal=BMJ|date=24 March 2001|volume=322|issue=7288|pages=724–727|pmid=11264215|pmc=1119907|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7288.724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has a number of consequences. First, it obscures the true nature of what in fact are extremely complex problems. For example, if we consider depression to be a biological disorder remediable through the use of antidepressant tablets, then we may be excused from having to delve into the tragic circumstances that so often lie at the heart the experience. This is so in adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timimi|first1=S|title=Rethinking childhood depression|journal=BMJ|date=11 December 2004|volume=329|issue=7479|pages=1394–1396|pmid=15591567|pmc=535460|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7479.1394}}&lt;/ref&gt; To disregard the reality of suffering in this way is ethically unacceptable both for critical psychiatrists and many patients, who reject the idea that their experiences are to be explained in terms of psychiatric symptoms, and putative biochemical disturbances.

===Meaning and experience in psychiatry===
There is a common theme, here, with the work of David Ingleby whose chapter in Critical Psychiatry: The Politics of Mental Health&lt;ref name="Ref_t"&gt;Ingleby, D. (1981) Understanding ‘mental illness’. In Critical Psychiatry: The Politics of Mental Health (ed. D. Ingleby), pp. 23–71. Harmondsworth: Penguin. {{ISBN|9780140803082}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out a detailed critique of positivism (the view that epistemology, or knowledge about the world is best served by empiricism and the scientific method rather than metaphysics). A common theme running through Laingian antipsychiatry, Ingleby’s critical psychiatry, contemporary critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry is the view that social, political and cultural realities play a vital role in helping us to understand the suffering and experience of madness. Like Laing, Ingleby stressed the importance of hermeneutics and interpretation in inquiries about the meaning of experience in psychiatry, and (like Laing) he drew on psychoanalysis as an interpretative aid, but his work was also heavily influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Philip|last2=Bracken|first2=Patrick|title=Critical Psychiatry in Practice|journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment|date=September 2004|volume=10|issue=5|pages=361–370|doi=10.1192/apt.10.5.361|url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/10/5/361.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both critical and post psychiatry are concerned with the way in which interest in [[hermeneutics]] has waned in late twentieth century psychiatry. There is within critical psychiatry a variety of views about the relevance of [[psychoanalysis]].  One strand of thought is that psychoanalysis itself does not possess any special knowledge of the mind; others value the hermeneutic role of psychoanalytic theory, if not practice, as a way of taking social and cultural factors into account in understanding experience. There are many factors responsible for the waning of interest in hermeneutics in mainstream psychiatry, including the ascendancy of clinical neuroscience, the preoccupation with an increasingly narrow, ‘neo-Kraepelinian’ view of diagnosis, and the waning influence of psychodynamic and other forms of insight-orientated psychotherapy. In addition, there is a long-established tradition in clinical psychiatry that sees limits in the extent to which it is possible to understand experience in schizophrenia. In part this may be traced back to the work of the German psychiatrist and philosopher, [[Karl Jaspers]], and his interpretation of [[Edmund Husserl]]’s phenomenology.&lt;br /&gt;Jaspers’ work was enormously influential in twentieth century psychiatry. His view of phenomenology is one that dwells on the ‘form’ of experience rather than its content, and thus separates it from the contexts that help to render experience meaningful. Thus it has been argued that the ‘unnunderstandability’ of some psychotic experiences primarily relates to the way in which psychiatrists, informed by Jaspers, approach experience. If we regard [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as a ‘rigorous science’ of human experience as did Jaspers, and focus on the form of experience, then it will be inevitable that meaning and understandability will be of lesser consequence.

The most forceful critic of this view was R. D. Laing, who famously attacked the approach enshrined by Jaspers’ and Kraepelin’s work in chapter two of The Divided Self,&lt;ref name="Ref_v"&gt;Laing. R. D. (1959) The Divided Self. London, Tavistock.&lt;/ref&gt; proposing instead an existential-phenomenological basis for understanding psychosis. Laing always insisted that schizophrenia is more understandable than is commonly supposed. Mainstream psychiatry has never accepted Laing’s ideas, but many in CPN regard The Divided Self as central to twentieth century psychiatry. Laing’s influence continued in America through the work of the late Loren Mosher, who worked at the Tavistock Clinic in the mid-1960s, when he also spent time in Kingsley Hall witnessing Laing’s work. Shortly after his return to the USA, Loren Mosher&lt;ref name="Ref_w"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moshersoteria.com/ | title=Schizophrenia Treatment Without Antipsychotic Drugs and the Legacy of Loren Mosher}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed Director of Schizophrenia Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, and also the founding editor of the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin.

One of his most notable contributions to this area was setting up and evaluating the first [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria House]], an environment modeled on Kingsley Hall in which people experiencing acute psychoses could be helped with minimal drug use and a form of interpersonal phenomenology influenced by Heidegger. He also conducted evaluation studies of the effectiveness of Soteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bola|first1=JR|last2=Mosher|first2=LR|title=Treatment of Acute Psychosis Without Neuroleptics: Two-Year Outcomes From the Soteria Project|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|date=April 2003|volume=191|issue=4|pages=219–229|pmid=12695732|url=http://www.moshersoteria.com/bola.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2010|format=PDF|doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061148.84257.f9|citeseerx=10.1.1.564.2860}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent systematic review of the Soteria model found that it achieved as good, and in some areas, better, clinical outcomes with much lower levels of medication (Soteria House was not anti-medication) than conventional approaches to drug treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calton|first1=Tim|last2=Ferriter|first2=Michael|last3=Huband|first3=Nick|last4=Spandler|first4=Helen|title=A Systematic Review of the Soteria Paradigm for the Treatment of People Diagnosed With Schizophrenia|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=January 2008|volume=34|issue=1|pages=181–192|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm047|pmid=17573357|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/181.long|pmc=2632384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
There is currently no research base for the efficacy of the critical psychiatry approach.

One comparison study showed 34% of patients of a 'medical model' team were still being treated after two years, compared with only 9% of patients of a team using a 'non-diagnostic' approach (less medication, little diagnosis, individual treatment plans tailored to the person's unique needs). However the study comments that cases may have left the system in the 'non-diagnostic' approach, not because treatment had worked, but because (1) multi-agency involvement meant long-term work may have been continued by a different agency, (2) the starting question of ‘Do we think our service can make a positive difference to this young person’s life?’ rather than ‘What is wrong with this young person?’ may have led to treatment not being continued, and (3) the attitude of viewing a case as problematic when no improvement has occurred after five sessions may have led to treatment not being continued (rather than the case ‘drifting’ on in the system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timimi|first1=S|last2=Tetley|first2=D|last3=Burgoine|first3=W|last4=Walker|first4=G|title=Outcome Orientated Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (OO-CAMHS): a whole service model|journal=Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=April 2013|volume=18|issue=2|pages=169–184|doi=10.1177/1359104512444118|pmid=22548827}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Psychiatry and Postpsychiatry==
Peter Campbell first used the term ‘postpsychiatry’ in the anthology ''Speaking Our Minds'', which imagines what would happen in a world after psychiatry.&lt;ref name="R%f_z"&gt;Campbell, P. (1996) Challenging loss of power. In (eds J Read and J Reynolds) Speaking Our Minds: An Anthology. London, Macmillan, Open University (pp.56-62). {{ISBN|9780333678497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, Patrick Bracken and Philip Thomas coined the word later and used it as the title of a series of articles written for Openmind. This was followed by a key paper in the [[British Medical Journal]] and a book of the same name.&lt;ref name="Ref_r"/&gt; This culminated with the publication by Bradley Lewis, a psychiatrist based in New York, of ''Moving Beyond Prozac, DSM, and the New Psychiatry: The Birth of Postpsychiatry''.&lt;ref name="Ref_ab"&gt;Lewis, B. (2006) ''Moving Beyond Prozac, DSM, and the New Psychiatry: The Birth of Postpsychiatry''. Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|9780472114641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant developments in mental health over the last thirty years has been the emergence of vocal and critical service-users and survivor movements.Examples of such organisations include ''Survivors Speak Out'', the ''National Self Harm Network'', ''Mad Pride'', ''Mad Women'' and the'' Hearing Voices Network.'' British postpsychiatry can be understood as an attempt to respond to these groups Although these groups disagree on many issue with mainstream psychiatry, and instead seek a more equal relationship with mental health services. These groups were supported by the Labour government commitment to democracy and accountability in the NHS on its election in 1997. This created a political environment in which doctors and nurses in all areas of health care were expected to relinquish paternalistic ways of relating to patients and relatives, and to work with them on a more equal footing.

For Bracken and Thomas, postpsychiatry represents an attempt to move beyond the dichotomies that characterised the anti-psychiatry era, and to engage constructively and positively with the concerns of service users and carers. Postpsychiatry identifies the central problem of the mental health field not necessarily in psychiatry, but in the modernist search for technical solutions to life's problems. This modernist impulse drives changes in psychiatry, psychology and nursing. It existed before the biological or DSM shift of the 1980s, and has been skillfully manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry subsequently. (citation needed)

According to Bracken, progress in the field of mental health is presented in terms of 'breakthrough drugs',  ‘wonders of neuroscience', ‘the Decade of the Brain’ and 'molecular genetics'. These developments suited the interests of a relatively small number of academic psychiatrists, many of whom have interests in the pharmaceutical industry, although so far the promised insights into psychosis and madness were yet to be realized. Some psychiatrists have turned to another form of technology, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, although this does draw attention to the person’s relationship with their experiences (such as voices or unusual beliefs), and focuses on helping them to find different ways of coping, it however, it is based on a particular set of assumptions about the nature of the self, the nature of thought, and how reality is constructed. The pros and cons of this have been explored in some detail in a recent publication.&lt;ref name="Ref_ac"&gt;House, R. and Loewenthal, D. eds (2008) Against and For CBT: Toward a constructive dialogue? Ross-on-Wye, PCCS Books. {{ISBN|9781906254100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"&gt;Bracken, P. &amp; Thomas, P. (2008) Cognitive Therapy, Cognitivism and the Moral Order. Chapter Eight in (eds R. House &amp; D. Loewenthal), Against and For CBT: Toward a constructive dialogue? Ross-on-Wye, PCCS Books. {{ISBN|9781906254100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Framing mental health problems as 'technical' in nature involves prioritising technology and expertise over values, relationships and meanings, the very things that emerge as important for service users, both in their narratives, and in service user-led research.&lt;ref name="Ref_ae"&gt;Faulkner, A. &amp; Layzell, S. (2000) Strategies for Living: A Report of User-led Research into People’s Strategies for Living with Mental Distress. London: Mental Health Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; For many service users these issues are of primary importance. Recent meta-analyses into the effectiveness of antidepressants and cognitive therapy in depression confirm that non-specific, non-technical factors (such as the quality of the therapeutic relationship as seen by the patient, and the placebo effect in medication) are more important than the specific factors.&lt;ref name="Kirsch, I. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_n"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews|first1=Gavin|title=Placebo response in depression: bane of research, boon to therapy|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|date=March 2001|volume=178|issue=3|pages=192–194|doi=10.1192/bjp.178.3.192|pmid=11230026|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/178/3/192.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elkin|first1=Irene|last2=Shea|first2=M.

Postpsychiatry tries to move beyond the view that we can only help people through technologies and expertise. Instead, it 
prioritises values, meanings and relationships and sees progress in terms of engaging creatively with the service user movement, and communities. This is especially important given the considerable evidence that in Britain, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities are particularly poorly served by mental health services. For this reason an important practical aspect of postpsychiatry is the use of community development in order to engage with these communities.&lt;ref name="Ref_aj"&gt;Thomas, P. &amp; Yasmeen, S. (2007) Choice and Diversity: Developing real alternatives for people from non-Western (and Western) cultures. Chapter in (eds. P. Lehmann &amp; P. Stastny) Alternatives Beyond Psychiatry. Berlin, Peter Lehmann publishing. (pp. 256-267).&lt;/ref&gt; The community development project Sharing Voices Bradford is an excellent example of such an approach.&lt;ref name="Ref_ak"&gt;[http://www.sharingvoices.org.uk/ Sharing Voices web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many commonalities between critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry, but it is probably fair to say that whereas postpsychiatry would broadly endorse most aspects of the work of critical psychiatry, the obverse does not necessarily hold. In identifying the modernist privileging of technical responses to madness and distress as a primary problem, postpsychiatry has looked to postmodernist thought for insights. Its conceptual critique of traditional psychiatry draws on ideas from philosophers such as Heidegger,&lt;ref name="Ref_al"&gt;Bracken, P. (2002) Trauma: Culture, Meaning and Philosophy. London: Whurr Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Merleau-Ponty,&lt;ref name="Ref_am"&gt;Thomas, P. &amp; Bracken, P. (2010) Dualisms in The Myth of Mental Illness. Chapter in (Ed. J.

Postpsychiatry is not anti-science, but is critical of the dualism implicit in Cartesianism, body-mind, mind-society, and body-society, and thus the failure of medical science to engage fully with the embodied and encultured reality of human experience in disease and illness. The Critical Psychiatry Network or movement on the other hand encompasses a range of philosophical positions and is not conceptually wedded to postmodernism. Members of the Network are particularly concerned with the political and ethical basis of the clinical practice of psychiatry, and countering the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the psychiatric profession and mental health care in general. At root, there is a conceptual issue about the nature of mental illness. Critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry maintain that psychiatry can be practiced without postulating brain pathology as the basis for functional mental illness.

==Anti-psychiatry and Critical Psychiatry==
{{Main|Anti-psychiatry}}
The word [[anti-psychiatry]] is associated with the South African psychiatrist David Cooper, who used it to refer to the ending of the ‘game’ the psychiatrist plays with his or her victim (patient).&lt;ref name="Ref_aq"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=David G. |author-link=David Cooper (psychiatrist) |date=1967 |title=Psychiatry and Anti-psychiatry |location=London |publisher=Tavistock Publications |series=Studies in existentialism and phenomenology |oclc=242826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=November 2016}} It has been widely used to refer to the writings and activities of a small group of psychiatrists, most notably R.D. Laing, Aaron Esterson, Cooper, and Thomas Szasz (although he rejects the use of the label in relation to his own work, as did Laing and Esterson), and sociologists (Thomas Scheff). Szasz discards even more what he calls the quackery of ‘antipsychiatry’ than the quackery of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Ref_ar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Szasz |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Szasz |date=2009 |title=Antipsychiatry: Quackery squared |edition=1st |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY |oclc=798917081 |isbn=978-0-8156-0943-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=November 2016}}

Anti-psychiatry can best be understood against the counter-cultural context in which it arose. The decade of the 1960s was a potent mix of student rebellion, anti-establishment sentiment and anti-war (Vietnam) demonstrations. It saw the rise to prominence of feminism and the Civil Rights movement in the USA and Northern Ireland. Across the world, formerly colonised peoples were throwing off the shackles of colonialism. Some of these themes emerged in the Dialectics of Liberation, a conference organized by Laing and others in the Round House in London in 1968.&lt;ref name="Ref_as"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bracken |first1=Pat |last2=Thomas |first2=Philip |date=2006 |chapter=Democracy, Citizenship and the Radical Possibilities of Postpsychiatry |editor-first=D.B. |editor-last=Double |title=Critical Psychiatry: The Limits of Madness |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=149–164 |oclc=64230499 |isbn=978-0-230-00128-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as psychiatry is concerned, we have already seen how, in The Divided Self, Laing argued for an existential (or hermeneutic) phenomenology as the basis for understanding and helping people with schizophrenia, an influence that can be seen in the work of Loren Mosher and Soteria in America. Recent years have seen the emergence of a Soteria Network in Britain  to promote the development of minimum drug therapeutic environments for people experiencing psychosis, an initiative supported by some involved with CPN.

Anti-psychiatry as practiced by Laing and Cooper, that is, anti-psychiatry as an approach to psychiatry, or as a school of psychoanalysis, might today be better subsumed under the category Critical Psychiatry. Anti-psychiatry itself however, that is, the prefix anti attached to the word psychiatry, and meaning a movement against, or in opposition to, the field of psychiatry itself is still very much alive and kicking, and it is certainly no throwback to the sixties. Anti-psychiatry activists today include psychiatric survivors and dissident professionals who are not afraid to oppose the practice of psychiatry, with its cozy relationship to the pharmaceutical industry, and its monitoring function on behalf of government, and who envision an end to the field of psychiatry itself, or, at the very least, an end to harmful and coercive psychiatric practices. The thing these activists call for, rather than an endless cycle of reforms, some more repressive, some less, is the complete and total abolition of forced psychiatric treatment.  Today, although mostly a movement of activists with centers notably in Toronto, New York, and London, antipsychiatry is returning to academia as a field of study and critique.  This is exemplified at OISE, the University of Toronto, with the recent endowment of the Bonnie Burstow Antipsychiatry Scholarship for students engaging in Masters and PhD level research.

==Critical Psychiatry Network - Activities==
CPN is involved in four main areas of work, writing and the publication of academic and other papers, organizing and participating in conferences, activism and support. A glance at the members’ publication page on the CPN website reveals in excess of a hundred papers, books and other articles published by people associated with the network over the last twelve years or so. These cover a wide range of topics, from child psychiatry, psychotherapy, the role of diagnosis in psychiatry, critical psychiatry, philosophy and postpsychiatry, to globalization and psychiatry. CPN has also organized a number of conferences in the past, and continues to do so in collaboration with other groups and bodies. It has run workshops for psychiatrists and offers peer supervision face to face and via videolink.  It also supports service user and survivor activists who campaign against the role of the pharmaceutical industry in psychiatry, and the campaign for the abolition of the schizophrenia label.  The CPN has published a statement in support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46:the-case-against-schizophrenia&amp;catid=35:documents&amp;Itemid=56 "The Case against Schizophrenia"]. Critical Psychiatry Network. Retrieved 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It has formal links with the [[Hearing Voices Network]].

One of the most important aspects of CPN’s work has been that of mutual support. In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to practise psychiatry flexibly, in ways that recognize the limitations of the scientific evidence that underpins a great deal of contemporary psychiatry. There are many reasons for this, including the rise of evidence-based medicine and the risk-averse culture in which we live. Consequently, anyone whose practice is seen to diverge even modestly from clinical practice guidelines is likely to attract unwelcome attention, criticism from peers and managers, or worse. It has thus become increasingly difficult to hold views that differ from what is claimed to be mainstream opinion, even though there are legitimate grounds for doing so based in carefully argued critiques of existing evidence. For example, many critical psychiatrists are highly sceptical about the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs and other forms of physical treatments, the use of diagnoses such as schizophrenia, or the use of the Mental Health Act in social control. CPN thus has a vital role in justifying and supporting those who espouse a critical position in relation to psychiatric theory and practice, and in recent years has supported a number of colleagues who have fallen foul of their peers because their work is wrongly seen not to follow clinical practice guidelines. This is one of the main reasons why membership is restricted to psychiatrists.

Psychiatrists from USA, Canada, Australia, with similar understanding regarding mental health issues have joined the UK CPN creating The International Critical Psychiatry Network (ICPN).

From 1827,  '''[[Mechanics' Institutes]]''', '''Literary Institutes''', '''Athenaeums''' and '''Schools of Arts''' played an important role in the life of early Australian communities. Among their roles was the provision of libraries and reading rooms, but as community institutions they also provided lectures and adult education.

The '[[Art school|School of Arts]]' movement began in Britain in the beginning of the nineteenth century. The first School of Arts opened in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in 1821, with others in [[Glasgow]] and London in 1823.  The first [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] was established in [[Glasgow]] in 1821.

The first such institution in Australia was the ''Van Diemen's Land Mechanics' Institute'', [[Hobart]], which opened in 1827. This was soon followed by the [[Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts]] in 1833. By 1900 there were 1000 Mechanics' Institutes in Australia with memberships of between 100 and 200 people. Most of these Institutes did not have large libraries, usually having less than 1,000 books. Their role in a country town was more a general focus for the community's cultural activities, not just that of a library. As well as membership subscriptions, the Institutes were supported by colonial governments and sometimes by local government, usually by [[land grants]] and cash assistance. The institution generally had a purpose built building in the town.&lt;ref name="AustLib"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/libraries/ | title = Libraries in Australia | work = Culture and Recreation Portal | publisher = Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia) | accessdate = 20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these buildings are no longer home to those institutions but are used for other purposes.

The first Mechanics' Institute founded in Victoria was in [[Melbourne]] in 1839. The Institute at [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] was founded in 1843 and [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong's]] Institute in 1846. Institutes were established at [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]], [[Kyneton, Victoria|Kyneton]], [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Sandhurst (later known as Bendigo)]] in 1854, [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] and [[Eldorado, Victoria|Eldorado]] in 1855, [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] in 1857, [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Creswick, Victoria|Creswick]] in 1859, [[Berwick, Victoria|Berwick]] in 1862, and [[Maldon, Victoria|Maldon]] in 1863. The increasing numbers of Mechanics' institutes in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] seems to have been a consequence of the expansion of settlement, in particular associated with the gold rushes, rather than from meeting any specific cultural, educational or recreational need.  The Victorian government between 1860 and 1895 spent around £220,000 on grants. The increase in the number of institutes founded after 1860, especially in the country areas, was a direct result of the grants which were made available. The conditions attached to the grant, for the purchase of books and for public access, was influential in making the library the main activity of the institutes and achieved the aim of allowing many Victorians in the late 19th century to enjoy access to a reasonable library service.&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;{{cite web | last = Barker | first = Donald | authorlink =  | author2 =  | year = 2002 | url = http://alia.org.au/publishing/alj/51.3/full.text/communal.culture.html | title = Funding communal culture: opportunism and standardisation of funding for Mechanics' Institutes in colonial Victoria | work = volume 51 issue 3 | publisher = The Australian Library Journal | accessdate = 20 August 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060829082328/http://www.alia.org.au/publishing/alj/51.3/full.text/communal.culture.html | archivedate = 29 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, a New South [[Wales]] committee was set up to examine whether the £10,000 subsidy paid annually by the government to Schools of Arts and similar institutions was money well spent. The committee determined it was not well spent and recommended phasing out or reducing the subsidy in metropolitan areas and municipalities and that local authorities take over schools of arts.  There were not enough books, especially non-fiction, and services were limited under the current arrangements. However, lobbying saw the recommendations not implemented. Subsidies continued until the [[Great Depression in Australia|1930s depression]].&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite web | last = Jones | first = David J. | authorlink =  | author2 =  | year = 2005 | url = http://alia.org.au/publishing/alj/54.2/full.text/jones.html | title = Public library development in New South Wales | work = volume 54 issue 2 | publisher = The Australian Library Journal | accessdate = 20 August 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060829064953/http://www.alia.org.au/publishing/alj/54.2/full.text/jones.html | archivedate = 29 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few of these cultural institutions have survived to this day, their roles having been assumed by government organisations such as [[Public library|public libraries]] and [[TAFE]]. They have however left behind many historical buildings in cities and towns throughout Australia, some of which have been converted into community halls. For instance, over 1,200 Mechanics' Institutes were built in Victoria but just over 500 remain today, and only six still operate their lending library services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lowden, Bronwyn |title=Mechanics' Institutes, Schools of Arts, Athenaeums, etc.: An Australian Checklist – 3rd edition |publisher=Lowden Publishing Co. |location=Donvale, Australia |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-920753-16-0 | pages = 64–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* '''Danger Mouse''' (voiced by [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]])
: The main [[protagonist]] and [[titular character]], Danger Mouse is the world's greatest secret agent. Supremely confident in his abilities, Danger Mouse's vanity sometimes leads him to take actions that unnecessarily create risky situations. 
* '''Penfold''' (voiced by [[Kevin Eldon]])
: A [[hamster]] who works as Danger Mouse's assistant. A cowardly type, and very meek, he is often known for shouting "Oh, Crumbs!" when frightened. This version is not as misinterpretive as his original counterpart.
* '''Colonel K''' (voiced by [[Stephen Fry]])
: A [[chinchilla]] who serves as Danger Mouse and Penfold's boss. In the episode "The Return of Danger K", it is revealed that the Colonel was once an agent himself called Danger K. A running gag is he either forgets Penfold's name or who he is.
* '''Professor Squawkencluck''' (voiced by [[Shauna Macdonald]])
: A chicken who is chief scientist of the secret service. She gets annoyed with Danger Mouse when he doesn't pay attention to her, uses her inventions without her permission, or breaks/messes with her latest creation, to the point of a love-hate relationship with him. 
* '''[[Baron]] Silas von Greenback''' (voiced by [[Ed Gaughan]])
: The [[main antagonist]], a criminal mastermind and Danger Mouse's [[archenemy]]. Though Greenback was a mainstay of the 1981 series, in the 2015 series, the prefix "von" has been incorporated into his name. He is given a German accent to match.
* '''Nero''' (vocal effects by [[Marc Silk]])
: Greenback's pet fluffy white caterpillar, whose intelligence and cunning is often underestimated.
* '''Stiletto Mafiosa''' (voiced by [[Dave Lamb]])
: Greenback's Italian crow sidekick.
* '''The Narrator''' (voice of [[Dave Lamb]])
: As with the original series, The Narrator, an unseen character, frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]], interacting with both the viewer and the other characters and often finds himself in danger from the episode's antagonist.

===Recurring characters===
* '''Pandaminion''' (voiced by [[Ed Gaughan]]): A Panda and Greenback's unintelligent minion.
* '''Dr. Loo-cifer''' (voiced by [[Kayvan Novak]]): An advanced robotic toilet gone rogue.
* '''Dawn Crumhorn'''/'''The Princess''' (voiced by [[Morwenna Banks]]): A young spoiled poodle who becomes powerful after her tiara comes into contact with personality-amplifying mind gel. She is later revealed to be the daughter of Doctor Augustus P. Crumhorn IV in "Mousefall".
* '''Isambard King Kong Brunel''' (voiced by [[Kayvan Novak]]): A scientist monkey who comes up with impractical inventions. He once created a time machine to replace all useful inventions with his own.
* '''Quark''' (voiced by [[Ed Gaughan]]): A money-hungry alien huckster who tries to use DM in get-rich-quick schemes.
* '''The Snowman''' (voiced by [[Richard Ayoade]]):&lt;ref name="Chortle1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2015/09/04/23171/richard_ayoade_joins_danger_mouse|title=Richard Ayoade joins Danger Mouse|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions|website=chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; An embarrassingly inept living snowman with the ability to freeze things with his left arm and fire explosive carrots from his nose.
* '''Count Duckula''' (voiced by [[Rasmus Hardiker]]): A stardom-obsessed vampire duck. This incarnation of the character combines aspects of both his villainous counterpart from the original ''Danger Mouse'' series, and his more amicable vegetarian counterpart from his own [[Count Duckula|spin-off series]].
* '''Baron Silas von Penfold''' (voiced by [[Kevin Eldon]]): An evil version of Penfold from an alternate reality known as the Twystyverse. He is often seen working alongside his enforcer,  Sinister Mouse, as that dimension's greatest supervillains.
*'''Sinister Mouse''' (voiced by [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]]): The world's greatest Evil Agent and DM's Twin from the Twystyverse.
* '''The Queen of Weevils''' (voiced by [[Miranda Richardson]]): An evil beetle witch from Arthurian Legend, who was sealed away inside a gem over a thousand years ago by [[Merlin]] before accidentally being released into the modern world.
* '''[[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Morwenna Banks]]): The Queen of [[England]].
* '''Jeopardy Mouse''' (voiced by [[Lena Headey]]):&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The female American equivalent of Danger Mouse. Clad in a slick military jumpsuit and working under orders from General E. Normous Schwartznut, she performs her missions professionally and without fuss-- but has a tendency to be overbearing and take herself too seriously.
* '''Doctor Augustus P. Crumhorn IV''' (voiced by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]): The father of The Princess and the son of Doctor Augustus P. Crumhorn III, he is an ambitious trillionaire [[Dobermann Pinscher]] who vows to defeat Danger Mouse in order to make his daughter happy and buy up all the companies in the world.

A '''Diaspora Jew''' ([[Hebrew]]: יהודי גלותי) is a [[stereotypical]] term derived from the antithesis attitude created by [[Zionism]] towards the [[Judaism]] of the [[Jewish diaspora]], especially in Europe, and as part of the greater concept of the [[Negation of the Diaspora]]. The Diaspora Jew was described by Zionists&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Vitkin]], "[http://www.benyehuda.org/vitkin/articles_03.html Conquest of land and labor]", published in 1908&lt;/ref&gt; as a passive, weak Jew, engaged in ''Luftgesheft'' ([[Yiddish]] for "Air Business"), i.e. occupations that are not a real job or without integrity, brokering or bookkeeping, professions such as law and accounting, and one that suffers from the bullying of the non-Jew without responding. Zionism sought to create the antithesis of this image and build a [[Sabra (person)|new Jew]] in the [[Land of Israel]]: active, strong, engaged in cultivation of land, and defending himself against attacks from the [[Gentiles]].

The use of this expression appears in the early days of Zionism, in an article by [[Joseph Vitkin]], "[http://www.benyehuda.org/vitkin/articles_03.html Conquest of land and labor]", published in 1908:

{{quote
 |text= And the farmers that are absorbed in "Life by the Hour" have forgotten the "life-world" – the future of their great grandsons and sons… The gentile laborer is convenient for them for several reasons: He is healthy and able to work, cheaper and less demanding; At times he will be used not only as laborer to our farmers, but also as a teacher of many jobs which they are still a novice at, and yet he is almost always a submissive servant, a servant which you may use freely, and one that receives with love, the revelation of power and lordship, from his master… And such submission from the part of the laborer is, we must admit, very fond of the Diaspora Jew, which he himself has been all his life like the passage: "and my soul be as the dust to all"
 |sign=
 }}

A presention of the idea of the antithesis basic of this expression appears in the description given by the publisher of the book by Yisrael Zamir, "My father, [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]":

{{quote
 |text= For 20 years, since the child Yisrael has been five years old, his father, the writer and Nobel laureate, Isaac Bashevis Singer, had not see him. When the two were reunited and met again in New York, in 1955, they stood face to face as foreigners. The father, a Diaspora Jew, a [[Mysticism|Mystic]] who believes in demons, ghosts and Providence, and the son, a socialist and materialist [[Kibbutz]] member, who despises the superstitions of his father. 
 |sign=
 }}

Nowadays the term is used mainly by [[Politics of Israel|Israeli rightists against leftists]] as a derogatory nickname (cf. "[[Self-hating Jew]]"), when the rightist Israelis compare the leftists' attitude towards security, the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] with the approach of the time immemorial Diaspora Jew, who [[Useful Jew|groveled before]] the [[Poland|Polish]] nobleman.

An '''ethnoreligious group''' (or '''ethno-religious group''') is an [[ethnic group]] whose members are also unified by a common [[Religion|religious background]].

== Defining an ethnoreligious group ==

In general ethnoreligious communities define their ethnic identity not only by [[Ancestor|ancestral]] heritage nor simply by religious affiliation but normally through a combination of both. An ethnoreligious group has a shared history and a cultural tradition - which can be defined as religious - of its own. In many cases ethnoreligious groups are ethno-cultural groups with a traditional [[ethnic religion]]; in other cases ethnoreligious groups begin as communities united by a common faith which through [[endogamy]] developed cultural and ancestral ties.&lt;ref name="Yang and Ebaugh"&gt;Yang and Ebaugh, p.369: "Andrew Greeley (1971) identified three types of relationships in the United States: some religious people who do not hold an ethnic identity; some people who have an ethnic identity but are not religious; and cases in which religion and ethnicity are intertwined. Phillip Hammond and Kee Warner (1993), following Harold J. Abramson (1973), further explicated the “intertwining relationships” into a typology. First is “ethnic fusion,” where religion is the foundation of ethnicity, or, ethnicity equals religion, such as in the case of the Amish and Jews. The second pattern is that of “ethnic religion,” where religion is one of several foundations of ethnicity. The Greek or Russian Orthodox and the Dutch Reformed are examples of this type. In this pattern, ethnic identification can be claimed without claiming the religious identification but the reverse is rare. The third form, “religious ethnicity,” occurs where an ethnic group is linked to a religious tradition that is shared by other ethnic groups. The Irish, Italian, and Polish Catholics are such cases. In this pattern, religious identification can be claimed without claiming ethnic identification. Hammond and Warner also suggest that the relationship of religion and ethnicity is strongest in “ethnic fusion” and least strong in “religious ethnicity.” Recently, some scholars have argued that even Jews’ religion and culture (ethnicity) can be distinguished from each other and are separable (Chervyakov, Gitelman, and Shapiro 1997; Gans 1994)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond and Warner"&gt;Hammond and Warner, p.59: "1. Religion is the major foundation of ethnicity, examples include the Amish, Hutterites, Jews, and Mormons. Ethnicity in this pattern, so to speak, equals religion, and if the religious identity is denied, so is the ethnic identity. [Footnote: In actuality, of course, there can be exceptions, as the labels "jack Mormon," "banned Amish," or "cultural Jew" suggest.] Let us call this pattern "ethnic fusion."&lt;br&gt;
2. Religion may be one of several foundations of ethnicity, the others commonly being language and territorial origin; examples are the Greek or Russian Orthodox and the Dutch Reformed. Ethnicity in this pattern extends beyond religion in the sense that ethnic identification can be claimed without claiming the religious identification, but the reverse is rare. Let us call this pattern "ethnic religion."&lt;br&gt;
3. An ethnic group may be linked to a religious tradition, but other ethnic groups will be linked to it, too. Examples include Irish, Italian, and Polish Catholics; Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Lutherans. Religion in this pattern extends beyond ethnicity, reversing the previous pattern, and religious identification can be claimed without claiming the ethnic identification. Let us call this pattern "religious ethnicity""&lt;/ref&gt; The legal assignement what is an ethnoreligious group can differ from the above given definition.

Some ethnoreligious groups' identities are reinforced by the experience of living within a larger community as a distinct [[Minority group|minority]]. Ethnoreligious groups can be tied to [[ethnic nationalism]] if the ethnoreligious group possesses a historical base in a specific region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/84714/1/zef_dp72.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In many ethnoreligious groups emphasis is placed upon religious endogamy, and the concurrent discouragement of interfaith marriages or intercourse, as a means of preserving the stability and historical longevity of the community and culture.

Prior to the [[Babylonian exile]] the [[Israelites]] had already emerged as an ethnoreligious group, probably before the time of [[Hosea]].&lt;ref name ="Sparks"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KztVonFGqcsC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=ethno+religious+israelites&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ-feI6preAhWC24MKHfwtDLkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ethno%20religious%20israelites&amp;f=false | title = Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the Study of Ethnic Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible |author= Kenton L. Sparks|publisher =Eisenbrauns | year = 1998| pages = 146-148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century [[Reform Judaism]] has adopted theology that differs from traditional Judaism, although in recent years the reform movement has readopted some traditional practices. By the end of the 20th century the reform movement had become dominant in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In the United States rising mixed marriage rates has lead to attempts to facilitate conversion of the spouse. Despite conversion in order to facilitate marriage being strongly discouraged by traditional Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/387726/jewish/Conversion-and-Marriage.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If the spouse does not convert the reform movement will recognize paternal descent. Traditional Jews only recognizes descent along the maternal line. Many children of mixed marriages do not identify as Jews and the reform movement only recognizes children of mixed marriages as Jewish if they "established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people."&lt;ref&gt;https://reformjudaism.org/practice/ask-rabbi/how-does-reform-judaism-define-who-jew&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly relating to the inherited status of [[mamzer]], the marriage of males from the priestly line, persons not recognized as Jewish by the rabbinate and [[Agunah|agunot]]. The Israeli rabbinate only recognizes certain approved Orthodox rabbis as legitimate which has lead to friction with Diaspora Jews who for centuries never had an overarching authority.

=== The Anabaptist case ===
{{Main|Ethnic Mennonite}}

Other classical examples for ethnoreligious groups are traditional [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups like the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], the [[Hutterites]], the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s and traditional groups of [[Russian Mennonite|German speaking Mennonites from Russia]], like the [[Old Colony Mennonites]]. All these groups have a shared German background, a shared German dialect as their every day language ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], [[Hutterite German|Hutterisch]], [[Plautdietsch]]) and a shared version of their Anabaptist faith, a shared history of several hundred years and they have accepted very few outsiders into their communities in the last 250 years. Modern proselytizing Mennonite groups, like e.g. the [[Evangelical Mennonite Conference]] whose members have lost their shared ancestry, their common ethnic language Plautdietsch, their traditional dress and other typical ethnic traditions, are not seen as ethnoreligious groups anymore.&lt;ref&gt;John H.

==As legal concept==
===Australia===
In [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], the [[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]] of [[New South Wales]] defines "race" to include "ethnic, ethno-religious or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s4.html|title=Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 Section 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to "ethno-religious" was added by the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 (NSW).&lt;ref name="Cunneen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Faces of hate: hate crime in Australia |last=Cunneen |first=Chris |author2=David Fraser |author3=Stephen Tomsen |year=1997 |publisher=Hawkins Press |isbn=1-876067-05-5 |page=223 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nmw1wlgeUC |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hannaford]], the NSW Attorney-General at the time, explained, "The effect of the latter amendment is to clarify that ethno-religious groups, such as Jews, Muslims and Sikhs, have access to the racial vilification and discrimination provisions of the Act.... extensions of the Anti-Discrimination Act to ethno-religious groups will not extend to discrimination on the ground of religion".&lt;ref name="Anti-Discrimination (Amendment Act 1994 Second Reading"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19940512044 |title=Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Bill: Second Reading |date=2007-05-12 |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedition"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/57ba30f38d3c969cca25710f0023442f/$FILE/Sedition%20FINAL.pdf |title=Sedition, Incitement and Vilification: Issues in the Current Debate |author=Gareth Griffith |date=February 2006 |publisher=NSW Parliamentary Library Research Service |isbn=0-7313-1792-0 |page=52 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 made reference to ''Mandla v Dowell-Lee'', which defined ethnic groups as:

# a long shared history, of which the group is conscious as distinguishing it from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive;
#a cultural tradition of its own, including family and social customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance. In addition to those two essential characteristics the following characteristics are, in my opinion, relevant:
#either a common geographical origin, or descent from a small number of common ancestors;
#a common language, not necessarily peculiar to the group;
#a common literature peculiar to the group;
#a common religion different from that of neighbouring groups or from the general community surrounding it;
#being a minority or being an oppressed or dominant group within a larger community. For example, a conquered people (say, the inhabitants of England shortly after the [[Norman conquest]]) and their conquerors might both be ethnic groups.

The significance of the case was that groups like Sikhs and Jews could now be protected under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].&lt;ref name="equalrightstrust.org"/&gt;

'''Francis Parker Yockey''' (September 18, 1917 &amp;ndash; June 16, 1960) was an [[Americans|American]] [[lawyer|attorney]], [[political philosophy|political philosopher]], and [[polemics|polemicist]] best known for his neo-[[Oswald Spengler|Spenglerian]] book '''''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics''''', published under the [[pen name]] '''Ulick Varange'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/carto.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=carto#f1 Willis Carto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012171404/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/carto.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=carto |date=2006-10-12 }}, ADL.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948. This book, described in its introduction as a "sequel" to Spengler's [[The Decline of the West]], argues for a culture-based, totalitarian path for the preservation of Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;ADL Research Report 'Poisoning the Airwaves: The Extremist Message of Hate on Shortwave Radio' U.S. Newswire February 1, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Yockey actively supported many [[far-right politics|far-right]] causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences of many [[white nationalist]] and [[New Right]] movements.&lt;ref name="spotlight1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Linda P.|last=Campbell|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-01-12/news/9201040093_1_buchanan-and-duke-david-duke-ku-klux-klan-leader|title=Liberty Lobby in the spotlight with Duke, Buchanan in race|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|date=January 12, 1992|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yockey was a passionate proponent of [[antisemitism]], and expressed a reverence for [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|National Socialism]], and a general affinity for [[Fascism|fascist]] causes. Yockey contacted or worked with the Nazi-aligned [[Silver Shirts]] and the [[German-American Bund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Brad|last1=Steiger|first2=Sherry|last2=Hansen Steiger|title=Conspiracies and Secret Societies: The Complete Dossier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h6_na9j0tcC&amp;pg=PA511|year=2006|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=[[Canton Township, Michigan]]|isbn=978-1-57859-174-9|page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in [[World War II]], Yockey became even more active in [[neo-Fascism|neo-Fascist]] causes.

Yockey believed that the United States was an engine of liberalism, controlled by [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jews]]. Yockey also met [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], and wrote [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] [[propaganda]] on behalf of the Egyptian government, seeing the [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] nationalist movement as another ally to challenge "the Jewish-American power." While in prison for falsified passports, he was visited by American [[Right-wing politics|right-winger]] [[Willis Carto]], who ultimately became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's writings.

==Early life==
Many biographical facts about Yockey cannot be known with absolute certainty. The majority comes from the accounts of those who knew him and from [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] efforts to gain intelligence in regard to his activities, as recorded by his biographer [[Kevin Coogan]] in his book ''Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International.''
 
Yockey was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the youngest of four siblings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis Parker|last=Yockey|title=''Imperium'' (Abergele: The Palingenesis Project)|publisher=Wermod and Wermod Publishing Group|location=London|year=2013|page=799}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his family returned to their original homestead in [[Ludington, Michigan]] during the [[Great Depression]]. His parents were [[Anglophile]]s who raised Yockey to appreciate [[Europe]] and high culture. Subsequently, Yockey's mother introduced him to [[European classical music|classical music]]. Young Francis had a prodigious talent for the [[piano]] and developed his repertoire to include pieces by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]. Yockey claimed that his ideas about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] were initially the result of a car accident, wherein he was assaulted by several [[African Americans]]. As a result of this attack he lost his front teeth and wore [[dentures]] for the rest of his short life.

Before becoming a devotee of [[elitism|elitist]] and [[Anti-consumerism|anti-materialist]] [[Oswald Spengler]], he briefly flirted with [[Marxism]]. Aside from Spengler, he was heavily influenced by the ideas of German legal scholar [[Carl Schmitt]].  Like Spengler, he rejected the strict biological view of race, instead preferring a spiritual conception of race married with [[Karl Haushofer]]'s idea of [[geopolitics]]; but unlike Spengler, who disregarded the Nazis for being too bourgeois and anti-Semitic, Yockey believed in [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|National Socialism]], and supported various [[Fascism|Fascist]] and neo-Fascist causes for the remainder of his life, including [[anti-Semitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/mel-mermelstein-survived-auschwitz-then-sued-holocaust-deniers-court-180970123/|title=Mel Mermelstein Survived Auschwitz, Then Sued Holocaust Deniers in Court|last=Sauer|first=Patrick|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a university student in the late 1930s, Yockey had his first political essay published in ''[[Social Justice]]'', a periodical distributed by [[Charles Coughlin|Fr. Charles Coughlin]], known as the "radio priest," At the time Coughlin was widely known for his sympathetic view of the anti-[[Bolshevist]] policies associated with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]], and [[Francisco Franco|Gen. Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]].

Yockey attended at least seven universities. He studied for two years (1934–36) as an undergraduate at the [[University of Michigan]], and then transferred to [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]'s [[School of Foreign Service]]. He completed his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Arizona]], and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from the [[Notre Dame Law School]] in 1941.

==Later life and works==

Over time, Yockey contacted or worked with many of the far-right figures and organizations of his day. These included the [[German-American Bund]], the [[National German-American Alliance]], [[William Dudley Pelley]]'s [[Silver Shirts]], [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley's]] [[Union Movement]], [[George Sylvester Viereck]], the American [[H. Keith Thompson]], [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], and [[James H. Madole]]'s [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]]. After the war Thompson and Madole became advocates of Yockey's worldview and published some of his essays. While Yockey's pro-Fascist activities began in the late 1930s, they did not end there. Unfazed by the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yockey actually became even more active in [[neo-Fascism|neo-Fascist]] causes after 1945. From this point forward, he remained dedicated solely to his cause of reviving Fascism. He dispensed with any semblance of an ordinary life, and remained constantly on the move, travelling to wherever he felt he could pursue his goals most effectively, and cultivating countless contacts along the way.

Yockey's ideas were usually embraced only by those, however, who could countenance the necessity of an alliance between the far Left and the far Right, which was a fundamental pillar of Yockey's ideas. The [[American Nazi Party]] of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], for example, rejected Yockey on the basis of his anti-American attitude, as well as his willingness to work with [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] [[Communist]] governments and movements, as the ANP adhered solely to the ideals of absolute anti-[[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] National Socialism, as had been advocated by Hitler. (Yockey, however, seems to have remained unaware of Rockwell, as he told [[Willis Carto]] that he had never heard of the ANP when Carto visited him in prison in 1960.) Other proponents of Universal [[Nazism]], such as Rockwell's ally [[Colin Jordan]], disagreed with Yockey's views on race, and saw Yockeyism as advocating a kind of "New [[Strasserism]]" which would undermine true Nazism.

In early 1946, Yockey began working for the [[United States War Department]] as a post-trial review attorney for the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in Germany. He soon began agitating against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] occupation of Germany, as well as what he perceived to be the biased procedures of the Nuremberg tribunal. Eventually, he was fired for "abandonment of position" in November 1946.

Without notes, Yockey wrote his first book, ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'', in [[Brittas Bay]], [[Ireland]] over the winter and early spring of 1948. It is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century [[materialism]] and [[rationalism]]. It is dedicated to 'The hero of the twentieth century'; allegedly, he intended that description to apply to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. O'Keefe of the Journal of Historical Review makes this assertion in his review of Kevin Coggan's 1999 study of Yockey. According to the late Doris Foster Lessard, an historian for many years in [[Ludington, Michigan]], this information about ''Imperium'' was apparently known to Ludington residents of Yockey's parents' social circle.&lt;/ref&gt; In a rebuttal to the accusations of [[Arnold Leese]], Yockey stated that the "hero" of which he spoke was indeed Hitler{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. The views expressed in ''Imperium'' were endorsed by far-Right thinkers around the world including former German General [[Otto Remer]]; Professor of [[Classics]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[Revilo P. Oliver]]; and [[Italy|Italian]] [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Julius Evola]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Citation needed for claims of endorsement}}. Yockey became embittered with Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] after the latter refused to publish or review ''Imperium'' upon its completion, after having promised to do so. [[Guy Chesham]], one of the leaders of Mosley's movement, actually resigned from it, in part because of Mosley's treatment of Yockey. ''Imperium'' subscribes to Spengler's suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the 'Roman' role in Western Civilization by uniting all its constituent states into one large empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McNaughton, D.L.|title=Spengler's Philosophy, and its implication that Europe has 'lost its way'|journal=Comparative Civilizations Review|publisher=ISCSC, Michigan, USA|volume=67|year=2012|pages=7–15|url=http://DLMcN.com/oswaldspengler.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlmcn.com/YockeyReview.html ''Brief Review of "Imperium"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with former Mosleyites [[Guy Chesham]] and [[John Gannon (Mosleyite)|John Gannon]], Yockey formed the [[European Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1948-49. The ELF issued a newsletter, ''Frontfighter'', and published Yockey's virulent  [[anti-American]], [[anti-communist]] and [[anti-semitic]] text ''The Proclamation of London''.&lt;ref name="alphalink.com.au"&gt;[http://www.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/proclamation.html ''The Proclamation of London'', full text]&lt;/ref&gt; In Yockey's view, "social decay" was permeated by the Jew, who as a "Culture-distorter" and a "bearer of Culture-disease", "instinctively allied himself with all forms, theories, doctrines and practices of decadence in every sphere of life". "America is [the Jew and the liberal-communist-democrat]'s programme in process of actualization, and its example shows Europe what the liberal-communist-democratic regime of Culture-distortion is preparing for it during the coming generations".&lt;ref name="alphalink.com.au"/&gt; Yockey was also approached by the group around the anti-Communist Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1951. He was asked to ghost-write a speech for McCarthy which stressed the importance of greater friendship between Germany and the [[United States]], although McCarthy never delivered it as the theme of the speech, when it was announced, aroused a great deal of controversy.
 
In late 1952, Yockey traveled to [[Prague]] and witnessed the [[Prague Trials]].  He believed they "foretold a [[Russia]]n break with [[Jewry]]", a view he put forward in his article ''What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/prague.html ''What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?'', full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, that prediction was vindicated by the fact that the last Jewish member of the Soviet Presidium, [[Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich|Lazar Kaganovich]], was expelled in 1957 - having been sidelined as early as 1953. (In addition, after sympathizing with [[Israel]] in its [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948-49 war]], the USSR switched sides and supported Arabs in subsequent conflicts.) Yockey believed that [[Stalinism]] had purged [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] [[Communism]] of [[Jew| Jewish influence]]. He spent the remainder of his life attempting to forge an alliance between the worldwide forces of Communism and the international network of the extreme Right of which he was a part, with an aim toward weakening or overthrowing the government of the United States.

Yockey met [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], whom he called "a great and vigorous man", in [[Cairo]] in 1953.  He worked briefly for the Egyptian [[Information Ministry]], writing [[anti-Zionist]] [[propaganda]].  Yockey saw the rise of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] states in the [[Third World]], and in particular [[Arab nationalism]], as significant [[geopolitical]] challenges to "the Jewish-American power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Francis Parker|last=Yockey|url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/world.html |title=The World in Flames: An Estimate of the World Situation|date=February 1961|accessdate=September 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/world.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:28:00|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that Yockey made clandestine trips during the 1950s into [[East Germany]], and possibly even into the USSR itself, attempting to cultivate Communist ties. It is also known that Yockey visited [[Cuba]] shortly after the revolution of [[Fidel Castro]], in the hopes of winning Cuban support for his anti-American alliance. He met with some lower-level officials, but nothing is known to have come of it.

==Arrest and death==

Yockey was continuously pursued by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) for over a decade, which he avoided by adopting numerous aliases. He was finally arrested in 1960 after returning to the United States from abroad, as his suitcase was sent to the wrong airport. When the authorities opened it to determine whose suitcase it was, they discovered several of Yockey's falsified passports and birth certificates. When this was reported to the federal government, the FBI tracked him down in Oakland, California and arrested him.  While in prison, he was visited by the American Rightist [[Willis Carto]], who later became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's ideas. Yockey was soon after found dead with an empty [[cyanide]] capsule nearby while in a jail cell in [[San Francisco]] under FBI supervision, leaving a note in which he claimed that he was committing suicide in order to protect the anonymity of his political contacts.

==Impact of ideas==
Yockey was rather unusual among thinkers of the far-right post-[[World War II|Second World War]]. 
Most European and American neo-Fascists and other [[Right-wing politics|rightists]] of the post-war period advocated an alliance with the [[United States of America|United States]] as the best hope for the survival of Western culture under the threat of communism, but Yockey felt that an alliance of the right with the left was a far more desirable course. This proposed alliance is referred to as a ''Red-Brown Alliance'' (the color red representing the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] and the color brown representing the [[Far-right politics|far-right]]). Yockey felt that American universalism, democracy, and consumer culture, which was by then spreading into western Europe and much of the rest of the world, as well as its alliance with [[Zionism]], was far more corrosive and deadly to the true spirit of the West than was the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Fascist and the Preacher"&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Mostrom|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-fascist-and-the-preacher-gerald-l-k-smith-and-francis-parker-yockey-in-cold-war-era-los-angeles/#!|title=The Fascist and the Preacher: Gerald L. K. Smith and Francis Parker Yockey in Cold War–Era Los Angeles|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=May 13, 2017|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yockey believed that the USSR had become genuinely anti-Zionist under [[Joseph Stalin]], that in its authoritarianism it preserved something of the traditional European concept of hierarchy, and he felt it could more easily be adapted to a rightist orientation over time than was possible in the egalitarian United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Goodricke-Clarke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=francis+yockey+soviet+union+anti-zionism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtIJSPsr3g&amp;sig=1ANkftjszKhZm2yYOdhaPOwTp3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz_a7228fZAhXIKGMKHTviA8QQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20yockey%20soviet%20union%20anti-zionism&amp;f=false|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity|publisher=NY University Press|location=New York|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus believed that true rightists should aid the spread of communism and [[Third World]] anti-colonial movements wherever possible, and he remained staunchly opposed to the government and culture of the United States, which he did not even consider to be truly Western in nature.&lt;ref name="Fascist and the Preacher"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Yockey himself did not have a very significant influence on the American Right, however, which, throughout the [[Cold War]], for the most part remained staunchly anti-Communist and liberal. He had a much greater impact in Europe, where intellectuals of the Right, especially the current of thought sometimes called the [[European New Right]], including the Belgian [[Jean Thiriart]], the Russian [[Aleksandr Dugin]], and French writers [[Alain de Benoist]] and [[Guillaume Faye]], adopted positions similar to Yockey's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tomislav|last=Sunic|first2=Alain|last2=De Benoist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=francis+yockey+european+new+right&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vYdIqHZE2X&amp;sig=HOFebtn9kUBzPR5ibohQ6YEYMX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixqPeQ4cfZAhUD9GMKHUMuCGcQ6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20yockey%20european%20new%20right&amp;f=false|title=Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right|publisher=Arktos Media Limited|location=United Kingdom|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is little evidence his work influenced them in this.

Yockey's present influence is reflected mostly through the work of [[Willis Carto]] and his [[Liberty Lobby]] and successor organizations. Carto ran the ''Youth for George Wallace'' group supporting segregationist [[George Wallace]]'s 1968 presidential campaign. That group formed the basis for the [[National Youth Alliance]] which promoted Yockey's political philosophy and his book ''Imperium''. Many supporters of Yockey, such as [[H. Keith Thompson]], claim that Carto failed to understand Yockey's ideas on their deepest level.

The cut glass on chandeliers and girandoles is cut in the style of a [[Prism (optics)|prism]].

A '''Girandole''' (from French, in turn from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''girandola'') is an ornamental branched [[candlestick]] or [[light fixture]] consisting of several lights, often resembling a small [[chandelier]]. Girandoles came into use about the second half of the 17th century, and were commonly made and used in pairs.

A girandole has always been, comparatively speaking, a luxurious appliance for lighting, and in the great 18th century period of French house decoration, the famous ciseleurs designed some exceedingly beautiful examples. A great variety of metals have been used for the purpose. Sometimes, as in the case of candlesticks, girandoles have been made in [[hardwood]]s. Gilded [[bronze]] has been a very frequent medium, but for table use silver is still the favorite material.

Girandoles, or lighting devices, have also been attached to looking glasses and furniture. Some popular mirrors, especially the convex style, and some large dressing glasses of the 19th century were known as "girandoles" because of the lighting devices mounted to their sides.

The word Girandole (pl. ''żyrandol'') is also used in Poland to describe a traditional folk art. Poland’s “Traditional decorative forms included spider girandoles.”,
which are decorative objects hung from the ceiling. Various materials are used to make them, including tissue paper cut, wrapped or manipulated into flowers or [[garland]]. “It was probably this enormous variety of form of spider girandoles that caused them to occur practically universally throughout Poland.”  “The most recent version of spider girandoles were [[festoons]] and garlands of tissue which were stretched starwise at the ceiling."&lt;ref&gt;Frys, Ewa. Iracka, Anna. Pokropek,  Marian   Folk Art in Poland  page #75 Arkady  1988 {{ISBN|83-213-3478-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The term '''Given Circumstances''' is a principle from [[Russia|Russian]] theatre practitioner [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s methodology for [[actor]] training, formulated in the first half of the 20th century at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. 

The term given circumstances is applied to the total set of environmental and situational conditions which influence the actions that a [[character (arts)|character]] in a [[drama]] undertakes. Although a ''character'' may make such choices unconsciously, the ''actor'' playing the character is aware of such conditions on a conscious level to help him or her deepen his or her understanding of the [[motivation]] behind the character's actions. Given circumstances include conditions of the character's world (e.g. specifics of time and place: in [[Hamlet]] for instance, being in [[Elsinore]] at a specific time in history is a given circumstance), elements from the history of the character's environment (''cf'' Hamlet: the death of the old King Hamlet preceding the play's plot is a given circumstance), and elements from the character's personal situation (''cf'' Hamlet: the character Hamlet is a crown prince). 

In his own writing on his theatre practice, Stanislavski describes given circumstances as ''"The plot, the facts, the incidents, the period, the time and place of the action, the way of life. [...] The Given Circumstances, just like "if", are suppositions, "products of the imagination."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl.

'''God’s Own Country''', is a phrase meaning an area, region or country supposedly favoured by God, that was first used to describe the [[Wicklow Mountains]] in [[Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.godzone.com/gods-own-country/|title=God's Own Country, Godzone and Good Old New Zealand |website=Godzone.com |date=2 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently been used to refer to various places, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England]] ([[Cornwall]], [[Surrey]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Northumberland]]), [[United States]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Term uses==
===Ireland===
[[File:Glendasan River, Wicklow Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wicklow Mountains]]
The expression was first used to describe the [[Wicklow Mountains]] of [[Ireland]] by the [[Georgian Era|Georgian]] British writer [[Edward Dubois (wit)|Edward du Bois]], writing under the pseudonym "A Knight Errant" in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, E. (1805) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5clAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22god's+own+country%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fC_HTeHtD4_GvQODv5yWAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22god's%20own%20country%22&amp;f=false My pocket book: or, Hints for "A ryghte merrie and conceitede" tour by "A Knight Errant"]'', p. 23. ''Google Books''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
When used in reference to England, "God's own country" refers to the legend that as a boy [[Jesus of Nazareth]] visited England with his great uncle, [[Joseph of Arimathea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35304508|title=The strange myth about Jesus coming to England|date=23 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event itself inspiring the musical prelude to [[William Blake]]'s "''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]''", the piece ''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]'' also known as 'Jerusalem' which has become an unofficial anthem of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/english-national-anthem-is-jerusalem-the-hymn-weve-been-looking-for-a6921961.html|title=English national anthem: Is Jerusalem the hymn we've been looking for?|date=9 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem asks did Jesus visit England in ancient times, and in so doing created the [[New Jerusalem]], or heaven in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poemanalysis.com/jerusalem-william-blake-poem-analysis/|title=Analysis of Jerusalem by William Blake|date=29 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another first usage of the term by Edward du Bois was in a poem describing the English county of [[Surrey]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, W. (ed) (1839) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YzRMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=%22god's+own+country%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fC_HTeHtD4_GvQODv5yWAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw The year book, of daily recreation &amp; information]'', p. 469. ''Google Books.''&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in its more literal meaning to refer to [[Heaven]], in a poem by Elizabeth Harcourt Rolls Mitchell in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, E.H.R. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=raYOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22god's+own+country%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TDTHTaP1DYfsvQOT-sSsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22god's%20own%20country%22&amp;f=false To The memory of J.C.S.]" in ''First Fruits: Poems'', p. 79. ''Google books.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used to describe [[Yorkshire]], England's largest county.&lt;ref name="gods"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1443745,00.html|publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''|title=An ark park for God's own country|date=24 October 2007 | location=London | first=David | last=Ward | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/olympics/908092-yorkshire-up-to-12th-in-olympic-medal-table-after-nicola-adams-victory|publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''|title=Yorkshire back up to 12th in Olympic medal table after Nicola Adams's gold|date=10 August 2012 | first=Hannah | last=Duncan | accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/londonspy/yorkshire-10th-olympic-medal-table-135654936.html|publisher=''[[Yahoo]] [[Eurosport]]''|title=Yorkshire 10th in Olympic medal table|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=2012-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811145207/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/londonspy/yorkshire-10th-olympic-medal-table-135654936.html|archivedate=11 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is used interchangeably with God's Own County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jun/02/travelnews.shortbreaks.unitedkingdom|publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''|title=God's own county|date=2 June 2006 | location=London | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5234444.stm|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|title=What's so special about Yorkshire?|date=1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184030/Olympics-2012-If-Yorkshire-country-higher-medal-table-SA-Japan-Australia.html|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|title=Ee bah gum!

===United States===
The phrase later found sporadic use to describe several American regions. Most known is the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. It was also used by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate army]] to describe parts of [[Tennessee]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Loring, F.W., and Atkinson, C.F. (1869) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ0OTeCVBWMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22god's+own+country%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fC_HTeHtD4_GvQODv5yWAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22god's%20own%20country%22&amp;f=false Cotton culture and the South considered with reference to emigration]'', p. 71.

''Google Books''.&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these remain widely used to describe a region, though it is still occasionally used to describe the United States overall.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the title of Stephen Bates' book ''God's Own Country: Power and Religion in the USA: Religion and Politics in the USA''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Christopher Hitchens]]|title=Rushdie: Free at last|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/09/29/news_119/|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=salon.com|date=30 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi]] propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] sarcastically mocked the USA as "''Aus Gottes eigenem Land''" (From God's Own Country) in an essay that appeared in the German newspaper [[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]] on August 9, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb5.htm|title=Goebbels on the USA (1942)|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|date=|website=research.calvin.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels ridiculed America as a young land that lacked culture, education and history in contrast with Germany. In 1943, the Nazis published an [[anti-American]], [[anti-semitic]] propaganda book written by ''Erwin Berghaus'' called "''USA - nackt!: Bilddokumente aus Gottes eigenem Land''" (USA naked! Photo documents from God's own country) which also mockingly characterized the USA with the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/usa-nackt-bilddokumente-aus-gottes-eigenem-land/oclc/255345439|title=USA - nackt!

===New Zealand===
The earliest recorded use of the phrase as applied to New Zealand was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by [[Thomas Bracken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogBr-By.html|title=Dictionary of Australian Biography Br-By|author=|date=|website=gutenberg.net.au|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and again in 1893 in a book entitled ''Lays and Lyrics: God's Own Country and Other Poems.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=2B35|title=Dictionary Of New Zealand Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=dnzb.govt.nz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; God's Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand's longest serving prime minister, [[Richard John Seddon]]. He last quoted it on 10 June 1906 when he sent a telegram to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] premier, [[Thomas Bent]], the day before leaving [[Sydney]] to return home to New Zealand. "Just leaving for God's own country," he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship ''Oswestry Grange''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116121416/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/taylorma/SkeletonWatchFeb04.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=16 January 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bracken's ''God's Own Country'' is less well known internationally than ''[[God Defend New Zealand]]'' which he published in 1876. The latter poem, set to music by [[John Joseph Woods]], was declared the country's national hymn in 1940, and made the second national anthem of New Zealand along with ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' in 1977.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the phrase "God's own country" was often used to describe the country in the early 1900s, but it appears to have gradually fallen out of favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61385036 "God's Own Country", A Word Picture of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "God's Country" is often used to describe [[Queensland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41003568|title="TRULY GOD'S OWN COUNTRY"|date=27 June 1938|publisher=|pages=5|via=Trove}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drivenow.com.au/blog/great-driving-holidays-brisbane-to-townsville-qld/|title=Great driving holidays - Brisbane to Townsville (Qld) - DriveNow Blog|date=27 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/22622924|title=God's own country : the Johnstone Shire story|first=Delia|last=Birchley|date=23 April 1986|publisher=Bowen Hills, Qld. : Boolarong Publications|via=Trove}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sutherland Shire]] in southern [[Sydney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climb.org.au/index.php?page_id=10&amp;action=subregion&amp;region_id=22|title=.: The Australian Route Register :.|author=|date=|website=www.climb.org.au|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kerala===
[[File:Kerala God's Own Country Logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Kerala tourism logo.]] 
Kerala is a state in south [[India]]; the phrase was adopted by [[Kerala Tourism Development Corporation|the tourism department of the state's government]] in the 1980s. Kerala is famous for its Ayurvedic treatments, high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys, lush and evergreen rain forests, coconut palms, backwaters, and food items. According to Hindu mythology, Kerala was created by Lord Parashurama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu by throwing his axe across the sea to create new land for his devotees to live peacefully, hence the expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/How-Kerala-became-Godrsquos-Own-Country/article15345460.ece|title=How Kerala became God’s Own Country|date=2008-11-20|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keralaaffairs.com/gods-own-country-kerala/|title=God's Own Country Kerala - Best Tourist Places in Kerala|author=|date=3 August 2015|website=keralaaffairs.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The phrase "God's own country" was heard during the 1970s in [[Rhodesia]] (formerly: [[Southern Rhodesia]], now: [[Zimbabwe]]), where most people perceived the land as beautiful despite the ongoing [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] of the time. Evidence of the phrase being used earlier in reference to Rhodesia is found in ''Chartered Millions: Rhodesia and the Challenge to the British Commonwealth'' by John Hobbis Harris, published 1920 by Swarthmore Press (refer to page 27). The phrase "Godzone" is distinctly different and was not used in Rhodesia.

{{Nihongo|'''''Heavy Object'''''|ヘヴィーオブジェクト|Hevī Obujekuto}} is a Japanese [[light novel]] series, written by [[Kazuma Kamachi]] and illustrated by Ryō Nagi. [[ASCII Media Works]] have published fourteen volumes since 2009 under their [[Dengeki Bunko]] label. It has received three [[manga]] adaptations. A 24-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[J.C.Staff]] (with 3DCG provided by [[Sanzigen]]) aired from October 2 to March 25, 2016.&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt;

==Plot==
In the future, the development of massive war machines called Objects have rendered conventional warfare and even tactical nuclear weapons seemingly obsolete. As a consequence of this military upheaval, all of the nations of the world have fractured into four coalitions which constantly wage war on each other; the "Legitimate Kingdom", focused on tradition; the "Capitalist Corporation" (in the anime the "Capitalist Enterprise"), which values profit; the "Information Alliance" (in the anime the "Intelligence Union"), focused on knowledge; and the "Faith Organization", which values religion above everything else. With the perception that only Objects can destroy Objects, modern warfare is reduced to duels between Objects, resulting in shorter, cleaner, and safer wars. However, this all changes when two regular soldiers from the Legitimate Kingdom, Qwenthur Barbotage and Havia Winchell, use their smarts and ingenuity to destroy the "Water Strider" Object of the Faith Organization all by themselves. Having proven that Objects created by man can also be destroyed by man, Qwenthur and Havia are thrown into a new world of harrowing adventures and dangerous [[Forlorn hope|suicide missions]], while together with Qwenthur befriending and saving the Legitimate Kingdom's Elite Melinda Brantini, of the Object the "Baby Magnum".

:Qwenthur, the main protagonist, is a young military cadet studying to be a Heavy Object engineer due to his fascination with Objects. His kindness and chivalry is only second to his quick wit.

He is Qwenthur's best friend and partner in their missions and typically handles all of the fighting. It is later revealed that he wishes to take control of the Winchell family in order to end its feud with the rival Vanderbilt family, so that he can marry his fiance who is part of the Vanderbilts.

:Frolaytia is Qwenthur and Havia's strict and heartless commanding officer. She's often happy to throw the pair into extremely dangerous missions and is quick to punish them for any disobedience. However, she secretly does care for Qwenthur and Havia and does whatever she can to make sure they complete their missions and survive. Her reason for joining the military is because she wants to avoid an arranged marriage with a long list of suitors who want to use her to produce a male heir offspring. Qwethur's actions help end the pressure of her 3rd suitor, Halreed Copacabana, who had just become 1st on the list.

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

An '''invocation''' (from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] ''invocare'' "to call on, invoke, to give") may take the form of:
[[File:Gustave dore crusades invocation to muhammad.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Invocation'' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

*[[Supplication]], [[prayer]] or [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]].
*A form of [[Spirit possession|possession]].
*[[wikt:command|Command]] or [[conjuration]].
*[[Self-identification]] with certain spirits.

These forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. 
See also [[Theurgy]].

== Supplication or prayer ==
As a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon [[God]], a god, [[goddess]], or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for [[worship]], this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the [[Lord's Prayer]].

All religions in general use invoking prayers, [[liturgies]], or [[hymns]]; see for example the [[mantra]]s in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Egypt]]ian ''Coming Out by Day'' (aka ''[[Book of the Dead]]''), the [[Orphic]] Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] characters on clay tablets, addressed to [[Shamash]], [[Ishtar]], and other deities.

=== As alternative to prayer ===
An invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=19423373|title = Atheist Delivers Invocation At Tulsa City Council Meeting For First Time Ever|date = Aug 30, 2012&lt;!-- 9:27 PM EDT--&gt;|publisher = KOTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in [[South Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2938|title = Andrew Lovley's Secular Invocation|publisher = Secular Students Alliance|date = 2009-12-15 &lt;!-- - 10:08 --&gt; |author = Lyz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this usage, it is comparable to an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking [[oath]]s of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or [[non-belief]].

== A form of possession ==
The word "possession" is used here in its neutral form to mean "a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'.  This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with [[demonic possession]].

In some religious traditions including [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Wicca]], "invocation" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from "[[evocation]]", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, [[Aleister Crowley]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To "invoke" is to "call in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth". This is the essential difference between the two branches of [[Magic (paranormal)|Magick]]. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the [[consciousness]]. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]], ''Magick, Book 4'', p.147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a [[religious vision]]). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the [[ritual]] of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].

The ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to [[loa]] possession in the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] tradition where devotees are described as being "ridden" or "mounted" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] journalist [[Carol Beckwith]] described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Beckwith |title=The African Roots of Voodoo |publisher= National Geographic 188.2 |date=August 1995 |pages=102–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where [[Odin]] is invoked to "ride" workers of [[seidr]] (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].  Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J Wallis]], ''Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans'', p.96 {{ISBN|0-415-30202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Command or conjuration ==
{{main|Conjuration}}
Some have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities.  These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.

The following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in [[cuneiform]] on a statue of the Assyrian [[demon]] [[Pazuzu]].  Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective [[amulet]] with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.{{citation needed|reason=this is a potentially dangerous invocation, and its true purpose should be verified|date=March 2010}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is found in the book [[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]] during the Conjuration of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt,
Nor do I cook the honey with the wine,
I bake the body and the blood and soul,
The soul of (great) Diana, that she shall
Know neither rest nor peace, and ever be
In cruel suffering till she will grant
What I request, what I do most desire,
I beg it of her from my very heart!
And if the grace be granted, O Diana!
In honour of thee I will hold this feast,
Feast and drain the goblet deep,
We will dance and wildly leap,
And if thou grant'st the grace which I require,
Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps
Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Self-identification with certain spirits ==
Invocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of [[Aphrodite]] or the ferocity of [[Kali]]. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an [[archetype]]) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories.  See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the [[Songs of Bilitis]], first attributed to a contemporary of [[Sappho]] (but actually written by [[Pierre Louÿs]] in the 1890s):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, [[Astarte]]! 
Oh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! 
Thou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. 
Oh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!&lt;ref&gt;From the Songs of Bilitis&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[traditional grammar]] and guide books, a '''linking verb''' is a [[verb]] that describes the subject by connecting it to a predicate [[adjective]] or predicate [[noun]] (collective known as [[Subject complement|subject complements]]).&lt;ref name=Lester&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester |first=Mark |title=Grammar and Usage in the Classroom|edition=2 |year=2001 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0205306551 |pages=82–91 |chapter=Linking Verbs and Their Complements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the majority of verbs, they do not describe any direct action taken or controlled by the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Linking-Verbs.htm|title=Linking Verbs|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking verbs includes [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] such as the English verb ''be'' and its various forms, as well as verbs of perception such as ''look'', ''sound'', or ''taste'' and some other verbs that describe the subject, such as ''seem'', ''become'', or ''remain''.&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt; In addition to predicate adjectives and predicate nouns,&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt; English allows for predicate prepositional phrases as well: ''John is behind the cocktail cabinet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurford|first=James R.|title=Grammar: A Student's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaBKd8pT6kgC&amp;pg=PA185|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=9780521456272|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following sentences include linking verbs.
*Roses ''are'' red.
*The detective ''felt'' sick.
*The soup ''tasted'' weird.
*Frankenstein's monster ''resembles'' a zombie.
*He quickly ''grew'' tired.
*You are ''becoming'' a nuisance.

This is a '''list of festival-related list articles''' on Wikipedia. A [[festival]] is an event ordinarily staged by a [[community]], centering on and celebrating some unique aspect of that community and its [[traditions]], often marked as a local or national [[holiday]], [[mela]], or [[Muslim holidays|eid]]. A festival is a special occasion of feasting or celebration, usually with a religious focus. Aside from religion, and sometimes [[folklore]], another significant origin is [[agriculture|agricultural]]. Food (and consequently agriculture) is so vital that many festivals are associated with [[harvest]] time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in [[autumn]] such as [[Halloween]] in the northern hemisphere and [[Easter]] in the southern.

[[File:CanberraSimpsonMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Simpson Kirkpatrick|Simpson and his donkey]] exemplify the spirit of mateship.]]

'''Mateship''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Culture|cultural]] [[idiom]] that embodies [[social equality|equality]], [[loyalty]] and [[friendship]], usually among men. [[Russel Ward]], in ''The Australian Legend'' (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. ''Mateship'' derives from ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]'', meaning ''friend'', commonly used in Australia as an amicable [[form of address]].

== Military context ==
Mateship is regarded as an Australian military virtue. For instance, the [[Australian Army Recruit Training Centre]] lists the "soldierly qualities" it seeks to instill as including "a will to win, dedication to duty, honour, compassion and honesty, mateship and teamwork, loyalty, and physical and moral courage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gov.au/artc/aim.html |title=The Aim of Recruit Training |publisher=[[Army Recruit Training Centre (Australia)|Army Recruit Training Centre]] |accessdate=2007-10-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831230108/http://www.army.gov.au/artc/aim.html |archivedate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''mate'' bloomed during [[World War I]], when lots of trenches were being built because of the machine gun. Many trenches were built which often stretched miles across war grounds. The words “diggers” and “mate” gained the same meaning and became interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/mateship-diggers-and-wartime|title=Mateship, diggers and wartime {{!}} australia.gov.au|last=Cabinet|first=Department of the Prime Minister and|website=www.australia.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australian Constitutional preamble ==
During the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|1999 Australian constitutional referendum]] there was some consideration regarding the inclusion of the term "mateship" in the [[preamble]] of the [[Australian constitution]]. This proposed change was drafted by the Australian poet [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]], in consultation with the [[Prime minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time, [[John Howard]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Australians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free to realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes and ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence as dearly as mateship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murray was not supportive of the inclusion of "mateship" in the preamble, stating that it was "blokeish" and "not a real word", but the Prime Minister insisted it be included as the term, he said, had "a hallowed place in the Australian lexicon".&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, Jill: [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s25262.htm Mateship...], ''Lingua Franca'' ([[Radio National]]), 24 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard reluctantly dropped the term from the preamble, after the [[Australian Democrats]] refused to allow it to be passed by the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] where they held the balance of power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/418548.stm Mateship: Hit for six], [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], August 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the referendum the Australian government has introduced the concept of mateship as a possible part of an Australian citizenship test, although it was unclear how endorsement of the values of mateship would be tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/migrants-need-to-learn-mateship-pm/2006/12/12/1165685651880.html Migrants need to learn mateship: PM], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== More than friendship ==
Mateship is a concept that can be traced back to early colonial times. The harsh environment in which convicts and new settlers found themselves meant that men and women closely relied on each other for all sorts of help. In Australia, a 'mate' is more than just a friend and is a term that implies a sense of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/mateship-diggers-and-wartime|title=Mateship, diggers and wartime {{!}} australia.gov.au|last=Cabinet|first=Department of the Prime Minister and|website=www.australia.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term includes use in ways other than friendship like getting someone's attention, replacing a name, questioning a statement, letting one know to calm down and referring to someone in a rash or harsh way. The use of such in a harsh or negative way can be traced back to the word "bastard". Around the 16th century, the word "mate" adopted a similar meaning. Only within the last two centuries, has the term connected itself with a meaning of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MX49AAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=the+word+mate+as+slang&amp;ots=8ydiu5Z9SR&amp;sig=ItNBChVV8cQPCWcdNmMXGbn1Vkg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=English in Australia|last=Blair|first=David|last2=Collins|first2=Peter|date=2001-06-15|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9789027297990|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Alfrédo Sixto''' (May 23, 1919, [[Gonaïves]], [[Haiti]] – May 12, 1984, [[Philadelphia]], USA) was a professor, a translator, tour guide and ambassador.

The son of an engineer, Maurice Alfredo Sixto and Maria Bourand, he attended St Louis de Gonzague for his secondary studies; upon graduation he attended ''l'Academie Militaire'' where he remained for only three months. He eventually studied at the ''Faculte de Droit'' from 1945–1948 while working for Radio HHBM (now MBC).

Sixto is remembered in [[Haitian culture]] for his contributions to oral literature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} His ability to use rich, descriptive, and iconic [[Haitian Creole]] create a narrative that displays the true face of Haitian culture.

Sixto prefaces every story with ''Regards sur choses et gens entendu'' (Regarding things [seen] and People Heard).

[[File:Mittelniederdeutsch.jpg|thumb|right|A Middle Low German inscription on a [[Timber framing|half-timbered house]] in [[Hameln]], Lower Saxony, Germany: '''"Alle der warlde herlicheyt is alse ene blome de huete wasset un morgen vorgheit. Des herrn wort blift yn ewicheit".''' [[German language|German]]: ''All der Welt Herrlichkeit ist wie eine Blume, die heute wächst und morgen vergeht. Des Herren Wort bleibt in Ewigkeit.'' English translation: ''All the world's magnificence is like a flower that grows today and vanishes tomorrow; the Lord's word remains in eternity.'' (cf. ''[[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 1:24-25'')]]

'''Middle Low German''' or '''Middle Saxon''' ([[ISO 639]]-3 code &lt;code&gt;gml&lt;/code&gt;. In German: ''Mittelniederdeutsch'') is a developmental stage of [[Low German]]. It developed from the [[Old Saxon]] language in the [[Middle Ages]] and has been documented in writing since about 1225/34 (''[[Sachsenspiegel]]''). The Middle Low German language was in the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] period from about 1300 to about 1600 the leading written language in the north of [[Central Europe]] and served as a [[lingua franca]] in the northern half of Europe. It was used parallel to [[medieval Latin]] also for purposes of [[diplomacy]] and for [[deed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbuch zur niederdeutschen Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft |last1=Cordes |first1=Gerhard |last2=Möhn |first2=Dieter |date=1983 |page=119 |publisher=Erich Schmidt Verlag |isbn=3-503-01645-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related languages==
''Middle Low German'' is a term used with varying degrees of inclusivity. It is distinguished from [[Middle High German]], spoken to the south, which was later replaced by [[Early New High German]]. It is sometimes taken to mean the [[dialect continuum]] of all the other high medieval Continental West Germanic dialects, from [[Flanders]] in the West to the eastern Baltic, but it is sometimes seen as separate from western varieties such as [[Middle Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Nicholas, 2009. ''The Northern Lands: Germanic Europe, c. 1270–c.1500''. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 180-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Low German provided a large number of [[loanword]]s to languages spoken around the [[Baltic Sea]] as a result of the activities of Hanseatic traders. It is considered the largest single source of loanwords in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

==History==
Sub-periods of Middle Low German are:&lt;ref&gt;Hilkert Weddige, ''Mittelhochdeutsch: Eine Einführung.'' 7th ed., 2007, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Early Middle Low German ([[Standard German|Modern Standard German]]: {{lang|de|Frühmittelniederdeutsch}}): 1200–1370
* Classical Middle Low German ({{lang|de|klassisches Mittelniederdeutsch}}): 1370–1530
* Late Middle Low German ({{lang|de|Spätmittelniederdeutsch}}): 1530–1650

Middle Low German was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]], spoken all around the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. It used to be thought that the language of [[Lübeck]] was dominant enough to become a normative standard (the so-called {{lang|de|Lübecker Norm}}) for an emergent spoken and written standard, but more recent work has established that there is no evidence for this and that Middle Low German was non-standardised.&lt;ref&gt;Mähl, S. (2012). Low German texts from late medieval Sweden. In L. Elmevik and E. H. Jahr (eds), Contact between Low German and Scandinavian in the Late Middle Ages: 25 Years of Research, Acta Academiae Regiae Gustavi Adolphi, 121. Uppsala: Kungl. Gustav Adolfs Akademien för svensk folkkultur. 113–22 (at p. 118).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of the importance of Middle Low German can be seen by the many [[loanword]]s found in the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], [[Finnic languages|Finnic]], and [[Baltic languages]], as well as [[standard German]] and [[English language|English]].

In the late Middle Ages, Middle Low German lost its prestige to Early New High German, which was first used by elites as a written and, later, a spoken language. Reasons for this loss of prestige include the decline of the Hanseatic League, followed by political heteronomy of Northern Germany and the cultural predominance of Middle and Southern Germany during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Luther Bible|Luther's German translation of the Bible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">[[File:Moonlight Clan.jpg|thumb|Moonlight Clan]]
'''Moonlight Clan''', or ''Yue Guang Zu'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:月光族|月光族]]}}) is a Chinese term used to describe a large group of people who expend their entire salary before the end of each month, especially young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/09/us-china-consumer-idUSTRE6B81BV20101209|title=Special Report: The Chinese consumer awakens |last1=Reuters |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=9 Dec 2010 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term is derived from a [[lunar cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/moonlight-clan/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |title= Moonlight Clan|last1= New York Times|first1= |last2= |first2= |date=12 Jan 2011 |website= |publisher= |accessdate= 28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''yue guang'' translates directly to "moonlight", it is also a pun derived from the combination of its individual words, ''yue'' (月; month or moon) and ''guang'' (光; empty, used up, or light). ''Zu'' (clan, race) refers to a group of people who shares this characteristic. In the [[United States]], a comparable notion is referred to as "living paycheck to paycheck".

==Categories==

===Type 1: People who have a relatively high income===
This group of people can not only meet the basic needs but can also pursue a higher standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp |title=Standard of Living Definition |last1=Investopedia |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group include [[white collar workers]] and the [[middle class]].

====Behavior and lifestyle====
Members of the Moonlight Clan who earn a relatively high income tend towards [[economic materialism]]. Most of them lack financial discipline (i.e. [[overspend]]ing) and fail to plan for the future.

People earning a relatively high income are usually brand-loyal consumers who pursue pleasure-seeking and luxurious lifestyles. They tend to have strong consumption confidence.

===Type 2: People who can barely make ends meet and possibly rely on welfare===
This group of people struggle to meet basic needs, thus having a lower [[standard of living]] in comparison to Type 1. This group is mainly constituted by low [[socio-economic]] groups including people who are paid low hourly wages [[minimum wage]], such as [[blue-collar workers]].

====Behavior and lifestyle====
Lower-income consumers spend mostly on necessities and rent as they are burdened by the rising cost of living. They do not have extra money for expensive pleasure-seeking activities and luxurious goods.

==Causes==

===Low income and high cost of living===
With reference to the 2011 Population Census in Thematic Report: Youth, the median income monthly of teenagers aged from fifteen to twenty-four remained at [[HKD]] $8,000 unchanged for 10 years since 2001. The median monthly income of the whole population had increased to HKD$9,000 over the past ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census2011.gov.hk/pdf/youths.pdf |title=Population Census Thematic Report: Youths |last1=Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=Jan 2013 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consumer Price Index]] of Hong Kong increased by thirteen percent, from 96 to 109 index points, during 2001 and 2011. The lower income group could hardly afford the progression of standard of living of the society. As a result, the high cost of living leads to an increase in the number of Moonlight Clan members.

===Poor money management===
Lacking knowledge in money management, personal budgeting and saving, people seldom track their spending habits and savings to review their expenses. According to a survey conducted by the [[University of Hong Kong]], less than one third of the respondents would save their income before spending, or even spend more than what they are earning in a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.massmutualasia.com/en/Whats-New/Newsroom/Hong-Kong/2013/0709.aspx |title= MassMutual Asia Announces "Study on the post-80s/90s" Survey Findings Average Rating of Confidence Level in Realizing Dreams is only 5.9. One out of Seven Young People is "Moonlight Clan" |last1=Mass Mutual Asia |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=9 July 2013 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer culture===
Being bombarded by commercial advertisements, people with relatively high incomes feel compelled to pursue personal wellbeing and happiness through material possessions. An easy access to a variety of entertainment and activities may be the reason for the increase in [[consumerism]] for Moonlight Clan as they tend to spend and enjoy the present instead of saving for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmb.ac.lk/academic/other_centers/sparc/Links/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Globalization%20&amp;%20Consumerism-%20Praveena%20Final.pdf |title=Globalization, Consumerism and Unsustainable Consumption |last1=Rajkobal, Praveena |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 March 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced technology and convenience===
By using [[credit cards]], people can spend money they have not earned. In recent years, the credit card industry has been burgeoning, making credit cards available for almost everyone with insufficient screening. In Hong Kong, the credit card rates are rising and the debt they are carrying is 30% or above for annualized interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hongkongbusiness.hk/financial-services/news/hong-kongs-credit-card-rates-rising |title=Hong Kong’s Credit Card Rates Rising |last1=HONG KONG BUSINESS |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=17 Aug 2001 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, online buying is becoming more and more popular. People can frequent online shopping and auction sites like [[Amazon.com]], [[Taobao.com]], [[eBay.com]],  and make online payments via acquirers like [[Paypal]]. This may affect their financial discipline and foster overspending behavior, becoming one of the underlying causes of compulsive or obsessive consumerism.

==Population==

===Hong Kong===
In 2012, MassMutual Asia Ltd commissioned the Public Opinion Programme of the [[University of Hong Kong]] to conduct a telephone survey about [[post-80s]] and [[post-90s]]. The survey findings revealed that one out of seven respondents represented the Moonlight Clan, as they spent as much as they earned monthly, or even spent more than they earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.massmutualasia.com/en/Whats-New/Newsroom/Hong-Kong/2013/0709.aspx |title= MassMutual Asia Announces "Study on the post-80s/90s" Survey Findings Average Rating of Confidence Level in Realizing Dreams is only 5.9. One out of Seven Young People is "Moonlight Clan" |last1=Mass Mutual Asia |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=9 July 2013 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple.

''Mother!'' was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[74th Venice International Film Festival]], and premiered there on September 5, 2017.&lt;ref name="Venice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tartaglione|first1=Nancy|title=Venice Film Festival Sets Lido Launch For Aronofsky, Clooney, Del Toro, Payne &amp; More As Awards Buzz Begins&amp;nbsp;– Full List|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/venice-film-festival-2017-lineup-full-list-1202137114/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=July 27, 2017|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, by [[Paramount Pictures]], and grossed $44 million worldwide against its $30 million budget.

==Plot== 
In the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.

One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.

Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.

Upon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.

The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.

Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.

Mother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.

[[File:Upper Rhenish Master - The Garden of Eden (detail) - WGA23764.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[Paradiesgärtlein]]'' (''Little Garden of Paradise''), by an unknown artist active {{Circa|1410–20}}, possibly in [[Strasbourg]]. [[Jennifer Lawrence]] has said the film's setting sometimes resembles the [[Garden of Eden]], which this work depicts.]]

In an interview, Lawrence said that the film is an allegory; she said that the film "depicts the rape and torment of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] ... I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of [[God]], a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an [[Eve]] to Ed Harris's [[Adam]], there's [[Cain and Abel]] and the setting sometimes resembles the [[Garden of Eden]]".&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mother-meaning-spoilers-biblical-references-ending-explained/|title=Mother! explained: what does it all mean, and what on earth is that yellow potion?|last=White|first=Adam|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 16, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aronofsky said that the exclamation mark in the title "reflects the spirit of the film" and corresponds to an "exclamation point" of the ending. The director discussed the film's unusual capitalisation in a [[/r/IAmA|Reddit interview]], saying, "To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that isn't capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?" The characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

The lighter which appears throughout the film bears the [[Wendehorn]], a symbol believed to represent "the cooperation between nature's eternal laws, working in effect and in accordance with each other." One of the film's unexplained elements is the yellow powder Lawrence's character drinks, which ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' suggests is a reference to [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Production==
After 2014's ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'', Aronofsky began working on a children's film. During that process, he came up with a new idea. He ended up writing the ''Mother!'' screenplay in five days, much faster than his usual pace.&lt;ref name="Fallpreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/darren-aronofsky-mother.html |title=Darren Aronofsky Doesn’t Want You to Know Anything About Mother! |last=Riseman |first=Abraham |website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |publisher=New York Media |access-date=September 7, 2017 |date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses a dream-logic narrative, of which Aronofsky has noted, "if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart," and that "it's a psychological freak-out. You shouldn't over-explain it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Xan|title=Darren Aronofsky on Mother! - ‘Jennifer Lawrence was hyperventilating because of the emotion’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/07/darren-aronofsky-on-mother-jennifer-lawrence-was-hyperventilating-because-of-the-emotion|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=September 7, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting for the film began on June 13, 2016, and concluded on August 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What’s Shooting|url=http://www.actramontreal.ca/whats-shooting/|publisher=[[ACTRA]] Montreal|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2018}} Prior to the start of principal photography, the cast rehearsed for three months in a warehouse, during which time Aronofsky was able to "get a sense of movement and camera movement, and learn from that." During this time, Lawrence was relatively laid-back, and Aronofsky has said that as a result he "didn't get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up."&lt;ref name="Fallpreview" /&gt;

{{Anchor|Score}}

''Mother!'' is the first Aronofsky film without composer [[Clint Mansell]]'s involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cabin |first1=Chris |title=Darren Aronofsky Teases Details of His New, Enigmatic Drama; Won't Be Collaborating with Clint Mansell |url= http://collider.com/darren-aronofsky-new-movie-jennifer-lawrence/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|ComplexMedia]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 |date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film originally had a score composed by [[Jóhann Jóhannsson]], but after seeing the 90-minute score synced up with a rough cut of the film, Aronofsky and Jóhannsson agreed not to use the original score. They experimented with using the score at only a few moments, or instead using a new minimal score focused on [[sound design]] that incorporated noises into the soundscape of the house. Ultimately, they went with the second choice, and Jóhannsson's work merged with the sound design of Craig Henighan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/mother-movie-jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-score-johann-johannsson|title=Inside the Dreamy Nightmare of Mother!’s Music-Free Soundscape|first=Greg|last=Noone|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Ólafur Arnalds]] recounted the following story about the decision:

{{Quote

He proceeded to convince Darren to delete everything. It takes a real, selfless artist to do that. To realise the piece is better without you. 
The most important part of creating art is the process, and Jóhann seemed to understand process. The score needed to be written first in order to realise that it was redundant. So in my view, ''Mother!'' still has a score by Jóhann. The score is just silence... deafening, genius silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfDwiTfF0bd/|first=Ólafur |last=Arnalds |title=My favorite Jóhann story is when he had spent a year writing the score for Darren Aronofsky's "Mother" and at some point realised that the…|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Mother!'' grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $26.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $44.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;

In North America, the film was released alongside ''[[American Assassin]]'' and was projected to gross $12–14 million from 2,368 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/can-american-assassin-or-mother-poke-a-hole-in-it-box-office-balloon/|title=Can ‘Mother!’ or ‘American Assassin’ Poke a Hole in ‘It’ Box Office Balloon?|website=[[TheWrap]]|last=Fuster|first=Jeremy|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made $700,000 from Thursday night previews and $3.1 million on its first day. It went on to open to just $7.5 million, finishing third at the box office and marking the worst debut for Lawrence in a film where she had top billing. [[Deadline Hollywood]] attributed the film's underperformance to its controversial narrative, misleading advertisements, and "F" [[CinemaScore]] grade.&lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/it-stephen-king-movie-jennifer-lawrence-mother-dylan-obrien-american-assassin-weekend-box-office-1202170367/|title=‘It’ Becomes Biggest-Ever September Release With $218.8M As ‘Mother!’ Gets F Report Card &amp; Dismal $7.5M – Monday Final |first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=September 18, 2017|date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications wrote that the film's CinemaScore grade, which is extremely rare, is associated with "a movie that goes out of its way to artfully alienate or confuse audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/darren-aronofksys-mother-banished-infamous-f-cinemascore-club-1039885|title=Darren Aronofksy's 'Mother!'

Aronofsky responded to the film's CinemaScore rating by saying that it was meant to be difficult viewing for audiences: "How if you walk out of this movie are you not going to give it an 'F'? … We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you.

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', in his positive review of the film, wrote: "By all means, go to 'Mother!' and enjoy its roller-coaster-of-weird exhibitionism. But be afraid, very afraid, only if you're hoping to see a movie that's as honestly disquieting as it is showy." Gleiberman labelled ''Mother!'' as "a piece of ersatz humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/mother-review-jennifer-lawrence-venice-film-festival-1202545924/|title=Film Review: 'Mother!'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=September 5, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing the film and Aronofsky's direction as an "artist's cry from his own corrupt heart" and "a work of a visionary".

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film 5 stars, saying, "Darren Aronofsky’s toweringly outrageous film leaves no gob unsmacked.

The horror, the dark comedy, the biblical elements, the cautionary fable — they're all there, but they're elements in the total experience, which engulfs the characters and the viewers along with them. Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Martin | last=Scorsese | title=Martin Scorsese on Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Obsession and Why 'Mother!'

[[Rex Reed]] gave the film zero stars in ''[[The New York Observer]]'', and wrote that despite some good cinematography, "Nothing about ''Mother!'' makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky's corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the 'Worst movie of the year' when 'Worst movie of the century' fits it even better." Reed further dismissed other critics' positive reviews of the film as "equally pretentious" and "even nuttier than the film itself. ... they all insist ''Mother!'' is a metaphor for something, although they are not quite sure what it is."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Rex|last=Reed|authorlink=Rex Reed|url=http://observer.com/2017/09/darren-aronofsky-mother-worst-movie-of-the-year/|title=‘Mother!’ Is the Worst Movie of the Year, Maybe Century|date=September 15, 2017|work=[[New York Observer]]|publisher=[[Observer Media]]|location=New York City|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[The New Republic]]''’s Josephine Livingstone states that the film has "no human center to hold it down."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/144917/aronofskys-mother-mess-biblical-proportions|title=Aronofsky’s ''Mother!'' is a Mess of Biblical Proportions|work=[[The New Republic]]|first=Josephine |last=Livingstone|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review wrote, "My patience was tested beyond repair, I am afraid, by the nimbus of nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/25/mother-and-battle-of-the-sexes|title="Mother!" and "Battle of the Sexes"|work=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=NYP Holdings|accessdate=May 7, 2018|first=Anthony |last=Lane|date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' review, John Anderson said, "it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mother-review-giving-birth-to-madness-1505407913|title=‘Mother!’ Review: Giving Birth to Madness|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=May 7, 2018|first=John |last=Anderson|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}} [[Richard Roeper]] rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while he appreciated Lawrence's performance, he questioned whether Aronofsky was mocking certain biblical passages featured in the film or presenting a commentary on an artistic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/o-mother-what-art-thou-odd-jennifer-lawrence-film-pounds-senses/|title=O ‘mother!,’ what art thou?

Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star Ledger]]'' wrote, "one part early [[Roman Polanski]], one part pseudo [[Harold Pinter]], and two parts apology-from-a-driven-artist. And none of it adds up. The feeble idea behind "Mother!" isn't strong enough to bear the weight of all the overwrought style he hangs on it.

The '''naming convention used in Eritrea and Ethiopia''' does not have [[family name]]s and typically consists of an individual personal name and a separate [[patronymic]]. This is similar to [[Arabic name|Arabic]], [[Icelandic name|Icelandic]], and [[Somali name|Somali]] naming conventions. Traditionally for the [[Abyssinian people]], the lineage is traced paternally; legislation has been passed in Eritrea that allows for this to be done on the maternal side as well.

In this convention, children are given a name at birth, by which name they will be known.&lt;ref name=Eritrea&gt;{{cite book|last=Tesfagiorgis G.|first=Mussie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=Eritrean+patronymics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ylNLmdcSUW&amp;sig=TjZEEEee2qvS7nSAbnRntvwvhRI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1k_tUNi6AdHy0QHc7IFQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Eritrean%20patronymics&amp;f=false|title=Eritrea|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-59884-231-9|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate from others in the same generation with the same name, their father's first name and sometimes grandfather's first name is added. This may continue ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=bay&gt;{{cite book|last=Spencer|first=John H|title=Ethiopia at bay : a personal account of the Haile Selassie years|year=2006|publisher=Tsehai|location=Hollywood, CA|isbn=1-59907-000-6|pages=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5q7NV-vSPwC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Ethiopian+Patronymics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pWq8coDGER&amp;sig=vqOSosI0FEjxhRq-nInSxZ2Y7kc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lcjsUKGwD-rG0QGT9ICoAQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethiopian%20Patronymics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Ethiopia, this is often mistaken for a [[surname]], but unlike [[Europe]]an names, different generations do not have the same second or third names.&lt;ref name=Hadiya&gt;{{cite web|last=Helebo|first=Fikru|title=Ethiopian Naming System|url=http://www.enset.org/2007/03/ethiopian-naming-system.html|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marriage, unlike in some Western countries, women do not change their name, as the second name is not a surname.

[[File:Eritrean family 2.png|  left|frame |Example Eritrean family tree explained below. Blue: male; red: female.]]   
{{clear}}

In the example above, the progenitors, ''Feiven'' and ''Senai'', may be differentiated from others in their generation by their father's name. In this example, Feiven's and Senai's fathers' first names are ''Tewolde'' and ''Abraham'' respectively.

Feiven and Senai have a daughter and a son, each of whom is married and has a child. The first to have a child (a son) is their daughter, Yordanos Senai; she and her husband name the boy ''Ammanuel''. The next sibling to have a child is Yordanos' brother, Zerezghi Senai; this child is also a son. As it is against custom to name a child after a living family member, his parents give him a different first name than his cousin: ''Afwerki''. 
Ammanuel and Afwerki would each get their father's first name for their last.

In the diaspora, this method is sometimes dropped in favor of adopting the grandfather's name (the father's "last name") as a surname in accordance with [[Personal name#Naming conventions|Western naming conventions]]. In contemporary Eritrea (post-Independence from Ethiopia), a person's legal name consists of their given name, followed by the given name of a parent and the given name of a parent of that parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tesfagiorgis |first=Mussie G. |date=October 29, 2010 |title=Eritrea |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=236 |isbn=978-1598842319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in modern Ethiopia, a person's legal name includes both the father's and grandfather's names (the father's full name), so that the father's name becomes the child's "middle name." &lt;ref name=Hadiya/&gt;

The '''state emblem of [[Azerbaijan]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution of Azerbaijan | Article 23]]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan gerbi}}) mixes traditional and modern symbols. The focal point of the emblem is the fire symbol, and this comes from the fact that Azerbaijan has many everlasting fires which also gives the name "land of eternal fire" – in representation of its original roots in [[Zoroastrianism]].

At the bottom of the emblem is a stalk of [[wheat]], representing the main agricultural product of the nation, which was also part of the earlier arms. The other plant represented at the bottom is oak.

==History==
[[File:Emblem of the Azerbaijan SSR.svg|200px|thumb|left|The emblem of Azerbaijan under the Soviet Union (Azerbaijan S.S.R.)]]
The government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] declared a competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 30 January 1920 and made a decision to present the emblem model on May of the same year. However, due to the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the emblem was not approved.

The Supreme Medjlis of the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]] discussed the issue connected with the national emblem and raised petition in the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR on declaration of a new competition on the national emblem of Azerbaijan on 17 November 1990.

The competition was declared by the decision of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic on 5 February 1991. Tens of projects of the emblem were presented during the competition of 1991–1992 and it was also proposed to approve one of the projects developed between 1919–1920.

By the Constitutional Law of the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan Republic, approved on 19 January 1993, one of the projects, developed between 1919–1920 with certain alterations was confirmed the national emblem of Azerbaijan.

Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the [[October Revolution]], the current emblem retained partial components of the Soviet one such as the wheat and the color red on the shield previously seen in the banners.

==Meaning==
The colours used in composing the emblem are taken from the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|national flag]]. The green represents Islam; red represents the development and democracy of Azerbaijan; and blue represents that the Azerbaijanis are a [[Turkic people]]. The eight-pointed star ([[octagram]]) itself stands for the eight branches of the Turkic peoples, and between each point of the star, there is a smaller yellow circle found.

The National Emblem symbolizes the independence of Azerbaijan. It is the image of an oriental shield and a semicircle formed by the branches of an oak-tree and ears resting on it. The shield contains the image of a [[The Land of Fire|fire]] that resemble the "land of fire" – in the center of an eight-point star against a background of the colors of the National flag.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/topcontent/20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The Azerbaijani emblem is shown on:

*The residence and the private office of the President of the Azerbaijan republic;
*The building of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Republic, its conference hall and the private office of the chair of the parliament;
*All courts, buildings of military tribunals, halls of judicial assembly; private offices of the chairs of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court of the Azerbaijan Republic;
*Buildings of state bodies in cases stipulated in the legislative system of the Azerbaijan Republic;
*Buildings of diplomatic and trade representations and consulates of the Azerbaijan Republic.

{{Nihongo foot|'''''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'''''|New スーパーマリオブラザーズ Wii|Nyū Sūpā Mario Burazāzu Wī|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[2D side-scrolling]] [[platform video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. It is a sequel to ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and a part of the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series. It was released in 2009. A [[High-definition television|high-definition]] remastered port for the [[Nvidia Shield (set-top box)|Nvidia Shield TV]] was released in China in December 2017.&lt;ref name="NSMBWAndroid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wii-and-gamecube-games-are-being-remaster/1100-6455380/|title=Nintendo Wii And GameCube Games Are Being Remastered For Nvidia Shield--But Only In China|author=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=December 5, 2017|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's plot is similar to other side-scrolling ''[[Super Mario]]'' games. The player controls [[Mario]] as he travels eight worlds and fights [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]'s henchmen to rescue [[Princess Peach]]. ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' is the first ''Super Mario'' game to feature simultaneous [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[gameplay]]; up to four people can play in [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive multiplayer modes, taking control of Mario as well as [[Luigi]] and one of two multicolored [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]s. The game also introduces "Super Guide", which allows the player to watch a computer-controlled character complete a level.

[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had held desires to create a ''Super Mario'' game with cooperative multiplayer since the series' synthesis. After failed attempts to integrate it into ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' due to hardware limitations, he was able to fully explore the concept with the advent of the Wii and its more advanced hardware capabilities. Having developed ''New Super Mario Bros.'' and feeling that it was not as challenging as he hoped, Miyamoto designed ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' with the intent of accessibility for players of all skill levels. Features such as Super Guide and the ability to enter a floating [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] on command and opt out of doing a certain part of a level was added to cater to beginners, whereas other details, such as an award for not prompting the Super Guide block to appear in any level, were added to provide a layer of difficulty. [[Shiho Fujii]] and [[Ryo Nagamatsu]] composed the game's soundtrack, whereas [[Koji Kondo]], the series' regular composer, served as sound advisor.

The game was announced following a slight drop in profits, with Nintendo hoping that its release would help to rejuvenate sales of the Wii console. ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' was both critically and commercially successful, receiving particular praise for its multiplayer aspect, though some critics were disappointed by the game's lack of new content compared to previous ''Super Mario'' titles. As of March 2018, it is the fourth [[List of best-selling Wii video games|best-selling game on the Wii]], selling 30.20 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/wii.html|title=IR Information : Financial Data - Top Selling Title Sales Units - Wii Software|website=Nintendo.co.jp|accessdate= April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received several honors, including the Best Wii Game award from the [[Spike Video Game Awards|2009 Spike Video Game Awards]], [[IGN]], and [[GameTrailers]]. A sequel, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', was developed for the [[Wii U]] console and released as a [[launch game]] for the system in November 2012.

''New Super Mario Bros.

In addition to gold coins, which the player can collect to earn [[Life (gaming)|extra lives]], levels contain [[power-up]]s encased in floating blocks&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; which aid Mario in his quest. For instance, the Super Mushroom makes Mario increase in size and allows him to absorb more damage; the Fire Flower lets Mario shoot fireballs at enemies; and the Super Star gives the player temporary invincibility and increases running speed. The Mini Mushroom, which reappears from ''New Super Mario Bros.'', causes Mario to shrink in size, letting him jump higher, run on water and fit through small spaces, albeit while making him vulnerable to enemies and other obstacles.&lt;ref name="man16"&gt;"New Super Mario Bros.

==Plot==
When [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], Blue [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], and Yellow Toad are celebrating [[Princess Peach]]'s birthday in her castle, a large cake appears. [[Bowser Jr.]] and the [[Koopalings]] emerge from the cake and trap Peach inside. The cake is loaded onto Bowser's airship and it takes off, with Mario, Luigi, and the two Toads giving chase. The Toads in the castle grant them access to the new items, the Propeller Mushrooms and Penguin Suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/newsupermariobroswii/video/6211673/new-super-mario-bros-wii-stage-demo|title=New Super Mario Bros. Wii Stage Demo|date=June 4, 2009|format=Flash|publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After traveling through several worlds fighting the Koopalings, Bowser Jr., and [[List of Mario franchise characters#Kamek|Kamek]] the Magikoopa, the Mario Bros. and the Toads arrive at Bowser's castle. Bowser is defeated but is revived by Kamek, who casts a magical spell that transforms him into a giant. Bowser chases after Mario and the others, destroying everything in his path, until Mario finds a large switch and triggers it, causing Bowser to fall through the ground and releasing Peach from her cage. Peach and Mario depart from the castle in a hot-air balloon, with Luigi and the Toads following behind.

The credits are shown as a [[minigame]] where the letters in the credits are written on blocks, which can be broken by the playable characters to get coins (all four characters appear, but only the ones controlled by players can get coins). [[Post-credits scene|After the credits]], Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings help Bowser out of his unstable castle, which falls over and traps them.

==Development==
''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' was created out of a desire to recreate the [[Super Mario|''Super Mario'' series]]' single-player gameplay experience for multiple players.&lt;ref name="Roundtable"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 2009: Shigeru Miyamoto Roundtable LiveBlog|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate= June 7, 2009|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/989/989996p1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the head game developer at [[Nintendo]], had been interested in creating a ''Super Mario'' game with multiplayer features since the series' beginnings with the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' Attempts to integrate cooperative multiplayer into ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', the first 3D game in the series, ultimately failed due to the hardware limitations of the [[Nintendo 64]]. With the faster [[CPU]] and enhanced graphical and memory capabilities of the [[Wii]], Miyamoto and the rest of the development team were able to revisit this idea, as the hardware allowed the smooth display of enough enemies and items on the screen at once, and allowed a camera that could dynamically adapt to the players' movements, ensuring they constantly know what is the situation of their character.&lt;ref name="Iwata5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Patrick|last=Klepek|title=New Super Mario Bros.

Miyamoto wanted the game to be accessible to all players, and thus tried to balance its difficulty via features catering both to casual and hardcore ''Super Mario'' fans. After the release of ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], which Miyamoto felt had not been hard enough in retrospect, he wanted to create a new ''Super Mario'' game which would provide a higher level of challenge for players who desired one. Simultaneously, the Super Guide feature, which would allow a player to watch a level get completed before trying again after failing a certain number of times, was included with the game in order to make the game accessible to unfamiliar players as well.&lt;ref name="Iwata4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/4 |title=Iwata Asks- New Super Mario Bros.

''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' was worked on by several developers, some of whom had varying understandings of the design principalities of ''Super Mario'' games. Miyamoto, who served as the game's producer, helped the directors out with creating a general understanding of the ground rules for the game's design, writing out specification documents explaining the "rules" of how the game would work. This led to discussions and decisions over what was considered "natural" and "unnatural" for a Mario game; for instance, with the advent of the Ice Flower's ability to freeze enemies, the developers decided that it would be logical for the ice blocks to melt when shot with fireballs, and to float to the surface when submerged in water.&lt;ref name="Iwata6"/&gt;

The music for ''New Super Mario Bros.

===Piracy lawsuit===
In November 2009, 24-year-old Australian James Burt purchased a copy of ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' several days before its release, as the store had mistakenly put it up for sale early, and ripped and uploaded the game disk online. Nintendo took down the game and sued Burt shortly afterwards, accusing him of violating copyright laws and depriving Nintendo of potential sales. The case was ultimately settled in January 2010, with Burt receiving a fine of AU$1.5 million as compensation for lost sales, as well as an additional fine of AU$100,000 as a part of Nintendo's legal fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/nintendo-scores-1-3m-piracy-win-mario-leak-article-1.196688 |title=Nintendo scores $1.3M piracy win in 'Mario' leak |publisher=NY Daily News |date=February 9, 2010 |first=Michael |last=Sheridan |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burt was also forced to disclose the locations of all of his computers and electronic storage devices, as well as give access to his email, social networking and website accounts.&lt;ref name="1.5m"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/james-burt-to-pay-nintendo-15m-for-illegal-uploading-of-new-super-mario-bros/news-story/5180a33e6282bcfc30de195ca62441b3?sv=5529a1815f2981c8a6a6985824ff1a8b |title=James Burt to pay Nintendo $1.5m for illegal uploading of New Super Mario Bros |date=February 9, 2010 |publisher=The Australian |author=AAP |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo of Australia]] managing director Rose Lappin called the incident "a global issue", noting that thousands of copies of the game had been downloaded across the world before it was taken down. Burt later commented on the incident, calling his actions "very stupid" and asserting that the crime's repercussions were something that he would have to deal with for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamezone.com/originals/australian-media-outlets-latch-on-to-new-super-mario-bros-wii-pirate/ |title=Australian Media Outlets Latch on to New Super Mario Bros.

==Reception==
===Pre-release===
The game received praise for its multiplayer features following its showcase at E3, with critics praising its competitive aspects as well as its cooperative aspects,&lt;ref name="DestructoidHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EngadgetHO"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/10/08/hands-on-new-super-mario-bros-wii/|title=Hands-on: New Super Mario Bros Wii|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|date=August 10, 2009|work=[[Engadget]]|access-date=June 17, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArsHO"/&gt; though the game's lack of [[online game|online play]] was criticized as a missed opportunity. Many favorably compared the game to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure]]'', which similarly took its respective series' traditional gameplay and interlaced it with cooperative multiplayer.&lt;ref name="DestructoidHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WiredHO"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/new-super-mario-bros-wii/|title=Hands-On: New Super Mario Bros.

The game's presentation was another point of praise for some critics. CNET's Jeff Balakar called seeing a ''Super Mario'' game in 480p "an eye-opening experience", and praised the worlds' attentions to detail.&lt;ref name="CNETHO"/&gt; IGN's Craig Harris also praised the [[widescreen]] graphics, noting that the game looked smooth in progressive widescreen mode despite the version of the game being displayed being an incomplete build,&lt;ref name="Thomas1"/&gt; while Matt Cassamassina said that it looked "crisp, clean [and] colorful".&lt;ref name = "GC 2009: New Super Mario Bros. Hands-on"/&gt;

Some reviewers were slightly critical of the game's multiplayer. Although [[CNET]]'s three reviewers enjoyed the game, Balakar mused that the multiplayer gameplay was occasionally frustrating due to the chaos and tight screen space.&lt;ref name="CNETHO"/&gt; CNET's Dan Ackerman, whilst praising ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii''{{'}}s overall enjoyability, noted its strong similarity to its side-scrolling predecessors, musing that it felt "firmly planted in the 2D era."&lt;ref name="CNETHO"/&gt; [[MTV]] writer Russ Frushtick commented on the game's difficulty, comparing it to that of the NES game ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2459991/new-super-mario-bros-wii-is-as-hard-as-contra/|title='New Super Mario Bros.

The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' called it a "masterpiece of 2D action" and gave it a perfect 40/40, making it only the 13th game and the fourth Wii game to receive this score in the publication's 23-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-smb-assassin|title=Japan Review Check: New SMB, Assassin's, Left 4 Dead 2|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|date=November 25, 2009|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate= December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5411569/famitsu-awards-new-super-mario-bros-wii-a-perfect-score|title=Famitsu Awards New Super Mario Bros.

Critics continued to praise the game's multiplayer features, with several singling it out as one of the game's most potent and worthwhile features. Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia called it the funnest 4-player experience since ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', and stated that it exceeded their initial expectations despite strong suspicions.&lt;ref name="IGNAU"/&gt; Matt Wales of IGN UK lamented that the game worked as both a single-player and a multiplayer experience, but stated that it was at its best when played with multiple people.&lt;ref name="IGNUK"/&gt; Nick Chester of Destructoid called the cooperative mode fun despite occasional frustrations, and stated that players would likely have more fun playing alongside other friends.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; GameSpot's Randolph Ramsay called the multiplayer "initially great fun", but also admitted that they found it tedious at times due to the sheer chaos that it led to.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Craig Harris of IGN US praised the bubble system, calling it a smart design choice; however, he criticized the game's lack of any online multiplayer features, highlighting it as a particular point of dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="IGNUS"/&gt; Kolan also saw this as a shortcoming, criticizing a lack of online leaderboard features for the competitive multiplayer modes.&lt;ref name="IGNAU"/&gt; Conversely, Wales did not see this omission as a major issue, arguing that sociality was a primary aspect that made the multiplayer enjoyable and that it was wise not to include the feature because of Nintendo's poor-quality online service, though they noted that a leaderboard would have been an admirable addition.&lt;ref name="IGNUK"/&gt; ''[[GameSpy]]'' also gave the game leeway for its lack of online play, arguing that the medium is a primarily competitive experience whereas ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' required a cooperative experience in order to be thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott|first=Ryan|title=The Consensus: New Super Mario Bros.

Gameplay and controls were praised for their reminiscence of older 2D ''Super Mario'' titles; many singled out the use of the Wii Remote held sideways as the best way to play the game and praised it for calling back to the layout of the rectangular-shaped controller of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].&lt;ref name="IGNUS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNAU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; Ramsay lamented that the game's lack of support for the Wii's Classic Controller was disappointing.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Thoughts on the game's integration of motion controls were varied. Kolan praised them as being "easy, intuitive and unobtrusive – the three most critical aspects in any motion-controlled game",&lt;ref name="IGNAU"/&gt; while Ramsay stated that they were occasionally intrusive on general gameplay.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Chester mostly praised the motion controls for being natural, taking exception with the need to hold a button and shake in order to carry items.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; Elston stated that the game's handling was "compromised" by the motion-controlled spin jump, which they stated the review team kept repeatedly activating by accident while trying to play the game.&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt;

Some writers criticized ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' for feeling streamlined and banking off of the gameplay of its predecessors. Although Harris awarded the game an 8.9 out of 10 and deemed it a fun experience overall, he also was highly critical of it for "playing it safe", and, comparing it to ''Super Mario Galaxy'', called it a "missed opportunity" for Nintendo in terms of content.&lt;ref name="IGNUS"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', while giving the game a positive score of 7/10, criticized it for having a lack of traditional ''Mario'' charm and low difficulty level.&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"&gt;''Edge'', Dec 2009, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; Elston argued that the game lacked the creativity of others in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/wii/new-super-mario-bros-wii/review/new-super-mario-bros-wii/a-20091113105237874009/g-2009060211259405068/p-3|title=New Super Mario Bros Wii|last=Elston|first=Brett|date=November 13, 2009|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|page=3|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

Corbie Dillard of [[Nintendo Life]] pointed out the game's visual polish and smooth animations, but also stated that it did not hold the same level of splendor as other first party Wii releases.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Life review"/&gt; Ramsay also compared the game's graphics to other Nintendo-developed titles, stating that it lacked the level of polish that the previously-released ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' had despite utilizing a bright and varied array of colors.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Kolan praised the game's music as one of the best in the series, and lauded the game's sound design for calling back to previous ''Super Mario'' entries.&lt;ref name="IGNAU"/&gt; Elston also shed praise on the game's soundtrack, as well as the enemy interaction with the in-game music.&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8137">[[File:Pandanus julianettii nuts.png|thumb|[[Karuka]] nuts (''Pandanus julianettii'')]]
A '''pandanus language''' is an elaborate [[avoidance language]] among several of the peoples of the eastern [[New Guinea Highlands]], used when collecting ''[[Pandanus]]'' nuts.

==Use==
Annually, people camp in the forest to harvest and cook the [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] of [[karuka]] (both ''[[Pandanus julianettii]]'' and ''[[Pandanus brosimos]]''). Many normal words are thought to be unhealthy for the plants, as they carry associations inimical to the proper growth of the nuts. An elaborate [[vocabulary]] of up to a thousand words and phrases has developed to replace the [[taboo]] vocabulary.  The new vocabulary focuses on words involved with trips to harvest karuka nuts, and changes as words become known outside an area.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  The language is often spoken to control the magical properties of the higher elevations where the karuka grows, and to placate dangerous [[nature spirit]]s like ''Kita-Menda'' (also called {{lang|imo|Giluwe yelkepo}}&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;), the ritual keeper of the [[Free-ranging dog|wild dogs]].&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  ''Pandanus'' language generally should never be used outside the area where the trees grow, for fear of mountain spirits hearing it and coming down to investigate.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

All ages and genders are expected to know the ritual language before entering the taboo areas, but outsiders who do not know the language may be allowed to speak [[Tok Pisin]] instead.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  As Tok Pisin has become more widely spoken in the area, pandanus languages have been spoken less.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;  Newer generations also seem to be less afraid of the deep forest, and do not see much need for the protective talk.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;  The Kewa and Imbongu pandanus languages are already thought to be dying out.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;

==Structure==
The grammar and vocabulary of pandanus language is based on the mother tongue, but a restricted and consolidated form, especially for names of living organisms.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  Often words are grouped into umbrella terms which do not have an equivalent concept in ordinary speech.&lt;ref name="Pawley"/&gt;  Pandanus language words can also be [[loanword]]s from other languages.&lt;ref name="Pawley"/&gt;

'Karuka,' as a term, is not treated consistently across all pandanus languages.  For example, in standard [[Kewa language]] it is ''aga'',&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lim |first1=Tong Kwee |title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-4053-2 |pages=128–130 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4053-2_17 |language=English |chapter=''Pandanus julianettii'' |volume=4 |oclc=822591349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite book |last1=French |first1=Bruce R. |authorlink=Bruce French (agricultural scientist) |title=Growing food in the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea |date=1982 |publisher=AFTSEMU (Agricultural Field Trials, Surveys, Evaluation and Monitoring Unit) of the World Bank funded project in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea |pages=64–71 |url=https://docplayer.net/42672690-Growing-food-in-the-southern-highlands-province-of-papua-new-guinea-bruce-r-french.html |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; but in the Kewa pandanus language it is ''rumala agaa''.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;  Conversely, in both ordinary [[Kalam language]] and its pandanus register, the word is the same: {{lang|kmh|alŋaw}}.&lt;ref name="Pawley"/&gt;

The Kalam pandanus language, called {{lang|kmh|alŋaw mnm}} ({{transl|kmh|pandanus language}}) or {{lang|kmh|ask-mosk mnm}} ({{transl|kmh|avoidance language}}), is also used when eating or cooking [[cassowary]],&lt;ref name="Majnep"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majnep |first1=Ian Saem |last2=Bulmer |first2=Ralph |authorlink2=Ralph Bulmer |others=illustrations by Christopher Healey |pages=150, 152 |title=Birds of my Kalam Country |trans-title=Mn̄mon Yad Kalam Yakt |date=1977 |publisher=Aukland University Press |location=New Zealand |isbn=9780196479538 |language=English |oclc=251862814}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to speaking {{lang|kmh|monmon mnm}} ({{transl|kmh|ordinary/free language}}).&lt;ref name="Pawley"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pawley |first1=Andrew |authorlink1=Andrew Pawley |editor1-last=Dutton |editor1-first=Tom E. |editor2-last=Ross |editor2-first=Malcolm |editor3-last=Tryon |editor3-first=Darrell |editor2-link=Malcolm Ross (linguist) |editor3-link=Darrell Tryon |title=The Language Game:  Papers in Memory of Donald C.

The [[Huli language]] has an avoidance register called {{lang|hui|tayenda tu ha illili}} ({{transl|hui|bush divide taboo}}) used for collecting ''Pandanus'' as well as hunting or traveling.&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldman |first1=Laurence |title=Talk Never Dies: The Language of Huli Disputes |date=1983 |publisher=Tavistock Publications |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0422782104 |pages=254–257 |language=English |chapter=Talking about talk |oclc=993340993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{lang|hui|Tayenda}}, like many of the above, is used to evade malevolent bush spirits.&lt;ref name="Goldman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5040">'''Pedagogical patterns''' are high-level patterns that have been recognized in many areas of training and pedagogy such as group work, [[software design]], [[human computer interaction]], [[education]] and others. The concept is an extension of [[pattern language]]s. In both cases, the patterns seek to foster best practices of teaching.

According to [[Joseph Bergin]]:

:''“The intent [of pedagogical patterns] is to capture the essence of the practice in a compact form that can be easily communicated to those who need the knowledge. Presenting this information in a coherent and accessible form can mean the difference between every new instructor needing to relearn what is known by senior faculty and easy transference of knowledge of teaching within the community“.''

Although widespread in the software industry, the use of patterns is still emerging in the educational field. Whereas software developers make regular use of mature patterns, the educational community as a whole is still far from including patterns in the everyday tool-box. 

Mitchell Weisburgh has made an effort to define pedagogical content in terms of design patterns. In [http://ifets.ieee.org/discussions/discuss_june2004.html Documenting good education and training practices through design patterns], he proposes nine aspects to documenting a pattern for a certain skill. Not every pattern needs to include all nine. His listing is reproduced below:

* ''Name'' – single word or short phrase that refers to the pattern. This allows for rapid association and retrieval.
* ''Problem'' – definition of a problem, including its intent or a desired outcome, and symptoms that would indicate that this problem exists.
* ''Context'' – preconditions which must exist in order for that problem to occur; this is often a situation. When forces conflict, the resolutions of those conflicts is often implied by the context.
* ''Forces'' – description of forces or constraints and how they interact. Some of the forces may be contradictory. For example: being thorough often conflicts with time or money constraints.
* ''Solution'' – instructions, possibly including variants. The solution may include pictures, diagrams, prose, or other media.
* ''Examples'' – sample applications and solutions, analogies, visual examples, and known uses can be especially helpful, help user understand the context
* ''Resulting Context'' – result after the pattern has been applied, including postconditions and side effects. It might also include new problems that might result from solving the original problem.
* ''Rationale'' – the thought processes that would go into selecting this pattern, The rationale includes an explanation of why this pattern works, how forces and constraints are resolved to construct a desired outcome.
* ''Related Patterns'' – differences and relationships with other patterns, possibly predecessor, antecedents, or alternatives that solve similar problems.

[[File:WiltonChurch.jpg|thumb|300px|Church of SS Mary and Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, by TH Wyatt, 1841–4]]
In the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and part of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicist or Historismus]] styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as [[Rundbogenstil]] or round arched style.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=54–56}} In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.

== The origins of the Romanesque Revival or Norman Revival in the United Kingdom ==

[[File:North Scarle, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|150px|North Scarle, Lincolnshire]] 
The development of the ''Norman'' revival style or ''Neo-Norman'' took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with [[Inigo Jones]]‘s [[Window|re-fenestration]] of the White Tower of the [[Tower of London]] in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by [[Hugh May]] for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building,&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=587}}

In the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being [[Saxon]] rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include [[Shirburn Castle]] in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and [[Enmore Castle]] in Somerset. At [[Allerton Mauleverer]] in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a ''proto-Neo-Norman''. While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam]] nave roof. The architect is thought to have been [[John Vardy]] surveyor to the Office of Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leach|Pevsner|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|thumb|225px|Tickencote Church 1792 Early example of church Romanesque revival]]
A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for the conservation and rebuilding of [[St Peter's Church, Tickencote]] in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate [[chancel]] arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The [[nave]] was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian)
 |year=1935 |chapter=Tickencote |title=A History of the County of Rutland |volume=II |series=[[Victoria County History]] |place=London |publisher=St Catherine Press |pages=275–281 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/rutland/vol2/pp275-281 |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of Romanesque revival architecture is very similar to the style that emerges in the 1840’s under architectects such as [[Thomas Penson]] and [[Benjamin Ferrey]]. Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. [[File:Front entrance to Eastnor Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1468597.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, combining Romanesque and Gothic features]] In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at [[Inverary]], started in 1744, and castles by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Culzean]] (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and [[Seton Palace]] (1792). In England [[James Wyatt]] used round arched windows at [[Sandleford Priory]], Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild [[Arundel Castle]], while [[Eastnor Castle]] in Herefordshire was built by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1981 |title=The Norman Revival in British Architecture 1790–1870}} PhD Thesis, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Development of ''Archaeologically Correct'' Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of the ''archaeological correctness'' was popularised by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] in his many writings and he was using the term by 1950 in his Broadcast Talks (page 190) to describe architecture and designs based closely on illustrations of actual buildings or objects.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8eaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Pevsner+archaeologically+correct&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkM10Y0f1I&amp;sig=gKtc0zp0nG3E71Al_PHmcJZFk5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKPAvJfKAhXIYQ4KHR3hCJwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pevsner%20archaeologically%20correct&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[File:GosfordCastle.jpg|thumb|left|GosfordCastle, Armagh by Thomas Hopper]] 
[[File:Penrhyn Castle - geograph.org.uk - 206536.jpg|thumb|Penrhyn Castle - by Thomas Hopper 1820–37]]
It was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in ''Archaeologia'' (1832–33), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickman |first=Thomas |title=` |journal=Archaeologia |volume=XXV |publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]] |pages=159–185}} esp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1991 |chapter=Penrhryn and the Norman Revival |series=National Trust Guide |title=Penrhryn Castle, Gwynedd |place= |publisher=National Trust |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Architecture and the Romanesque Revival==

[[File:Rhosllanerchrugog Church.jpeg|thumb|Rhosllanerchrugog Church, 1852]]
[[File:Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar.JPG|thumb|Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar]]
However, the ''Norman Revival'' did catch on for church architecture. It was [[Thomas Penson]], a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German [[Brick Gothic]]. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]], Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are [[Christ Church, Welshpool]], 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|p=13}} Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], Wrexham of 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=E |series=The Buildings of Wales |title=Clwyd |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |page=264 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Losh and Wreay Church===
A most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was [[St Mary's Church, Wreay|St Mary’s Church at Wreay]], near Carlisle.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/losh/1.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=St Mary's Church, Wreay, by Sarah Losh (1785–1853) |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed by [[Sarah Losh]] and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read [[Thomas Hope (architect)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''Historical Study of Architecture'' (1815), which uses the term ''Lombardic'' for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an ''unpolished mode of building'' that ''most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |year=2012 |title=The Pinecone: the Story of Sara Losh |place=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0571269501 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, while the arcading of the [[apse]] certainly has a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] feel to it.&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt;

==Other Early Victorian Architects working in the Romanesque revival style==
The early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas [[high church]]es and [[Anglo-Catholic]], which were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]]; low churches and [[Broad church]]es of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|pages=170–73|title=The Gothic Revival|edition=3rd|year=1962
|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn= 0719502330}}, and also Cambridge Camden Society (1841),''A Few Words to Church-builders''[https://archive.org/details/fewwordstochurch00camb].&lt;/ref&gt; The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.

===Edmund Sharpe===
Another architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was [[Edmund Sharpe]], who set up his practice at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of [[William Whewell]] and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]]. He was awarded a travelling scholarship to study the early architecture of Germany and Southern France and supplied [[Thomas Rickman]] with information.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M. (1897), rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 18 February 2012 ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharpe despite being an architectural historian of some note, built churches that were much freer interpretations of the Romanesque and [[Brick Gothic|German Brick Gothic]] and might be considered less ''archaeologically correct''.

[[File:St Paul's Parish Church, Scotforth, Doorway - geograph.org.uk - 904970.jpg|thumb|St Paul's, Scotforth, Doorway, 1874–6]]
Four of Sharpe's earliest churches&amp;nbsp;– [[St Saviour's Church, Cuerden|St&amp;nbsp;Saviour, Bamber Bridge]] (1836–37);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=116}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Mark's Church, Blackburn|St&amp;nbsp;Mark, Witton]] (1836–38); and [[St Paul's Church, Farington|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Farington]], near [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] (1839–40)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=125}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because ''no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque''. They ''turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged''. The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements [[St Mary's Church, Conistone]] in [[Wharfedale]] (1846); and [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Scotforth]] in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth]], was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a ''strange building'' and ''an anachronism, almost beyond belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1969 |title=Lancashire |volume=2 The Rural North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=29, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M., rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood, (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] , Retrieved on 18 August 2009 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, when he was aged 68, he returned to architecture and designed this church which was opened in 1876.{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=401}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=47}} The church had used terracotta in a similar fashion to his earliest churches and it can only be assumed that its anachronistic appearance was that he had used a design that he had prepared at least 20 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;See Stratton, 1993, pages 50–52 for a discussion of the early use of [[architectural terracotta]] in the ''pot'' churches of Sharpe and Penson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Ferrey===
[[File:East Grafton - St Nicholas Church - geograph.org.uk - 1448466.jpg|thumb|left|East Grafton - St Nicholas Church, 1842–44]]
[[File:Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great - geograph.org.uk - 223562.jpg|thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844–46]] The work of [[Benjamin Ferrey]] can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at [[East Grafton]] in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Wiltshire Community History|title=Church of St. Nicholas, East Grafton|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getchurch.php?id=1184|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque [[Lych gate]].

A more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of [[Monreale]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweddle |first=Marilyn |title=A Historical Guide to the Church of St James the Great |place=Morpeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the [[portico]] at the cathedral at [[Monreale]], but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in [[Melplash]] in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.

===William Perkin of Leeds===
St Michael and All Angels [[Barton le Street]], North Yorkshire.
This church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by [[Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram|Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1966 |title=Yorkshire: the North Riding |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071029-9 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE| num=1148993 |desc=Church of St Michael |grade=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for [[Dissenting]] chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to [[Anglican]] churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the [[Baptists]]. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of [[Italianate]] Romanesque as seen at the [[Potters Bar|Potter's Bar]] Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbbc.org.uk/home Potters Bar Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist Church in Brown Street [[Salisbury]] of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more ''archaeologically correct'' in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects [[Michael Drury|Drury and Mortimer]], the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the [[castellated]] Gothic style.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=521–2}}

[[File:Grimsby Synagogue - geograph.org.uk - 141647.jpg|thumb|Grimsby Synagogue]]

===Synagogues===
The Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. 
One of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at [[Grimsby]] in Lincolnshire.

===Later Romanesque Revival Churches in Scotland===

[[File:West Kirk (geograph 1866764).jpg|thumb|West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr, by William Gale 1844–45]] 
The earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.
In Scotland the [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]]s occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. 
[[St Conan’s Kirk]] Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1082 |title=St Conan's Kirk |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another church is Cranshaws in [[Berwickshire]]. Here the 1739 church was rebuilt in 1899 by architect George Fortune in Romanesque Revival style.

==Sir Alfred Waterhouse and developed Romanesque Architecture==

Interest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Natural History Museum]] in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=70–77}} It was built in shades of buff coloured [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the [[Wrexham]] and [[Ruabon]] area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.

[[File:Silver Street, Lincoln.jpg|160px|thumb|42 Silver Street, Lincoln]]
Waterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by [[William Watkins (architect)|William Watkins]], a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red [[Ruabon]] terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=509}} An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln. This uses artificial stone for Romanesque columns and arches to embellish the frontage. &lt;ref&gt;Survey of Lincoln, City Building Applications no. 413- 04/03/1873&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Aidans Font Leeds.jpg|thumb|Font at St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[File:St Aidans 2754.jpg|thumb|left|St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[St Aidan's Church, Leeds]] is a massive [[basilica]] church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the [[Corbel table]] or moulded [[stringcourse]] below the eaves was based on that of [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s in the Byzantine style.{{sfn|Leach|Pevsner|2009|pp=525–7}}

===20th Century===
[[File:Former church of All Saints, Petersham - geograph.org.uk - 794800.jpg|thumb|left|Former church of All Saints, Petersham]]
[[File:St Francis' Church, Linden Road, Bournville - geograph.org.uk - 315175.jpg|thumb|St Francis' Church, Linden Road, Bournville]]
In the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine revival style]], which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. 
Churches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.

An even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate

"'''Special Edna'''" is the seventh episode in the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of the American [[Animated cartoon|animated television]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 5, 2003. In the episode, [[Edna Krabappel]] begins to lose faith in her relationship with [[Principal Skinner]] and becomes depressed. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], wanting to raise her spirits, decides to nominate her for the [[Teacher of the Year]] Award. Edna and the Simpsons are flown to [[Orlando, Florida]] for the event.

==Plot==
[[Edna Krabappel]] tells her students to write a paper on [[World War I]], due in three weeks. After class, Edna and [[Principal Skinner]]'s [[apple picking]] date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, [[Agnes Skinner|Agnes]], interrupts. At the Simpson house, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is distracted from writing his paper, and at the end of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] for help. Edna rejects Bart's paper and tells him that he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie.

At home, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] suggests that Bart nominate Edna for the [[Teacher of the Year]] Award. When Edna is informed of her Teacher of the Year nomination, she thanks Bart at the ensuing press conference. Skinner is about to congratulate Edna when Agnes calls again. Bart informs his family that, as nominator, he and his family are going to [[Orlando, Florida]].

At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at the thought that Edna could leave the school. [[Groundskeeper Willie]] lends Skinner his [[sports car]] so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the fireworks display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to [[blackmail]] after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: "I’ve liked episodes that focus on Krapappel, but on the other hand, her relationship with Skinner has always been a bit of a dud. Those two factors cancel each other out to leave this as an average show, though the mockery of EPCOT scores some points. I think the real EPCOT is pretty fun, actually, but the program delivers some amusing pokes at it."&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt; "Special Edna" was named the best episode of the fourteenth season of ''The Simpsons'' by ''[[IGN]]'' writers Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski. They commented: "First and foremost, this episode, as the title implies, is a nice spotlight on poor, overworked, underpaid Mrs. Krabappel. Krabappel's relationship with Principal Skinner takes center stage [...] But there's a ton more to this episode, including Grampa's story about serving as a four year old in World War I; Milhouse showing up with his uncle to give Bart a ride in a Blackhawk Helicopter; and a trip to a very thinly veiled parody of Disney World's EPCOT Center [...] that is filled with spot on parodies like the World of Tomorrow ride, which is a horribly dated 1960s take on the far future of the year 1984."&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web |last=Canning |first=Robert |title=The Simpsons: 20 Seasons, 20 Episodes |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p2.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2011-11-04 |date=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tamariki School.JPG|thumb|School sign]]
'''Tamariki''' is the oldest ‘free school’ in [[New Zealand]] and one of the oldest in the world. It was founded in 1966 by a group of parents and teachers interested in preventative [[mental health]]. It is located in the [[Christchurch]] suburb of [[Linwood, New Zealand|Linwood]].

Its name is the [[Māori people|Māori]] word for young children.

==Special Character==
Mistakes are regarded as important learning information and grading is never done.  No adult has the right to demand to see the child’s work and such access is always under the child’s control.  The children also have a very large measure of control over the environment; the adults in the school defer their need for a tidy environment to the child’s need to experience cause and effect; to experience why order is desirable.

The school is loosely modelled on [[Summerhill School]].

Originally a private school, owned and operated by the parents, Tamariki integrated into the state system as a [[Designated Special Character schools|Special Character school]] in 1990.

"'''The Coon'''" is the second episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 183rd episode of the series, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 18, 2009. In the episode, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] poses as a [[superhero]] [[vigilante]] named "The Coon", who grows increasingly jealous of the popularity and success of a rival superhero named "Mysterion".

The episode was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. It was originally conceived as an episode about the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]], but those elements were later adapted into the future episode, "[[Margaritaville (South Park)|Margaritaville]]". "The Coon" generated a great deal of speculation about the true identity of Mysterion. Parker and Stone originally said there was no specific answer to the question. However, his identity is finally revealed in the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] episode "[[Mysterion Rises]]".

The episode parodied several dark-toned comic book films that had been recently released at the time, including ''[[The Spirit (film)|The Spirit]]'', ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. It received generally positive reviews and, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], was seen by 3.27 million households the week it aired. Comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]], who is mocked in the episode, sent a thank you card to Parker and Stone after the episode aired. "The Coon" was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]] along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010. "The Coon" was also released on DVD in ''The Little Box of Butters'' on September 28, 2010. "The Coon" was re-released once more on DVD and Blu-ray as a "bonus episode" with the complete fourteenth season.&lt;ref name="season 14 DVD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cabin|first=Chris|title=South Park: The Complete Fourteenth Season|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/south-park-the-complete-fourteenth-season/2004|publisher=Slant Magazine|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Donning a disguise modeled after a [[raccoon]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] becomes a [[vigilante]] dubbed "The Coon", who attempts to wipe out crime in South Park. Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth, nobody pays much attention to the Coon's efforts. When he reports "crimes" (such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist) to the police department, he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off. During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on roof of a [[Walgreens]] later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child [[superhero]] named "Mysterion", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping [[icon]] from the police and South Park citizens who want to know just "Who is Mysterion?"  Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving.

Coon decides to rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) and his sidekick General Disarray ([[List of students at South Park Elementary#Dougie|Dougie]]). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as familiar to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten the destruction of a hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' [[aluminum foil]] armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.

Despite the threat of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself,&lt;!--***NOTE*** DO NOT include here that Kenny is Mysterion. This information is not revealed until season 14, so it is inappropriate for the plot summary of this episode. A reference to Kenny being Mysterion is already included elsewhere in the article.--&gt; showing the television viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of [[Mr. Garrison]]'s 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives that he is the superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.

"The Coon" was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]]. It first aired on March 18, 2009 in the United States on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-16-2009/0004989196&amp;EDATE= |title='Who is The Coon?'

They started working on sketches of the other superhero costumes, but Cartman and his alter-ego, the Coon, were finished first. From the start, Parker and Stone wrote Cartman as caring more about his superhero image than fighting crime, but as they worked further on the episode, it began to take up more and more of the story until they decided to make Cartman the only superhero of the four boys.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2010|title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season: "The Ring" |format=Audio commentary |medium= Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Stone long planned to create an episode about the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]], and originally planned for Cartman to dress as a superhero named "The Coon" and fight the economy. This is why the opening scene of "The Coon" involves Cartman discussing the poor economic state of the nation and the election of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. Eventually, Cartman would discover the recession stemmed from the sale of [[Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville|Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville blenders]], and he would have to battle singer [[Jimmy Buffett]] and investor [[Warren Buffett]], who would be portrayed as Jimmy's brother. Eventually, the idea was scrapped, and "The Coon" turned into an episode revolving entirely around a comic book film parody. Elements of the economic recession and the Margaritaville blenders were eventually incorporated into future episode "[[Margaritaville (South Park)|Margaritaville]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2010|title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season: "Margaritaville" |format=Audio commentary |medium= Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of Mysterion is never revealed in "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question "Who is Mysterion?" became a frequently asked question at the FAQ for the official ''South Park'' website, ''South Park Studios''. The answer posted at that site was that "there is no answer", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=2&amp;year=2010 |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |title=FAQ |work=South Park Studios (official)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker said it was one of the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the identity of Cartman's father, which was resolved in the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The superhero characters from "The Coon" returned in the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] episodes "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and "[[Coon vs. Coon and Friends]]", in which Mysterion is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=SOUTH PARK: "Mysterion Rises" |work=[[The A.V.

Cartman and Mysterion both refer to themselves as "the symbol this town needs", a line from ''The Dark Knight'', and Cartman encourages Butters to film a video threatening to blow up a hospital, the same as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] from a scene in that film. The opening shot of "The Coon" is also inspired by a sequence from ''Watchmen'': both feature a close-up of a city sidewalk and zoom out to someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman's Coonicon 2009 is inspired by the front cover of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', the Batman [[graphic novel]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]. Other common comic book film traits parodied in "The Coon" include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities, trophies adorning superhero secret lairs, and sudden disappearing exits and entrances.&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt;

Cartman's Coonicon 2009 convention is held at the [[Hilton Hotels|Airport Hilton]], the same place where he holds his "[[Red hair#Prejudice/discrimination towards redheads|ginger]] pride" event in the episode "[[Ginger Kids]]" and the AIDS benefit in the episode "[[Tonsil Trouble]]".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Butters dresses up as Professor Chaos, and Dougie dresses as General Disarray, both of which are the supervillain alter egos they first take on in the [[South Park (season 6)|sixth season]] episode "[[Professor Chaos]]".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Based on the physique of the Coon, Butters considers heavyset gay entertainers [[Bruce Vilanch]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]] as suspects for his secret identity.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone after "The Coon" aired, thanking them for referring to him in the episode.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Cartman plans to purchase detonators for his TNT from [[Ace Hardware]], a real-life [[Illinois]]-based hardware company chain.&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Cartman refers to the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]] as one of the primary factors that has led to an increase in crime.&lt;ref name="ScreenRant" /&gt; News footage of a group of South Park residents talking about Mysterion which focuses on a man with gold teeth and a blue baseball cap was inspired by the [[Crichton Leprechaun]] sighting YouTube video.&lt;ref name="Tufts"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Geller |first=Mitchell |title="South Park" takes on the Jonas Brothers and costumed superheroes in new season |work=[[The Tufts Daily]] |location=Medford, Massachusetts |date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/south-park-takes-on-the-jonas-brothers-and-costumed-superheroes-in-new-season-1.1623939 |accessdate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In its original American broadcast, "The Coon" was watched by 3.27 million overall households, according to the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]]. The episode received a 1.8 rating/5 share among adults aged between 18 and 49, making it the most watched cable entertainment program in that age group for the week of March 16 to 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kissell|first=Rick|title=Fox leads TV ratings in key demos|date=March 24, 2009|work=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001587.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of ''iF'' magazine said, "The mockery of comic book based movies is perfectly done...Though not quite as funny as last week’s '[[The Ring (South Park)|The Ring]]', 'The Coon' is right up there as a classic episode, ... A beacon of hope in the sometimes drab world of television,"&lt;ref name="IfMag"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park – Season 13 – "The Coon |work=If Magazine |date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time, he believed the episode title, "The Coon" (being a well-known [[List of ethnic slurs#C|ethnic slur]] against [[black people]]) was a jab intended for [[Barack Obama]], the first African American [[President of the United States|U.S. President]].&lt;ref name="IfMag" /&gt;

Percy Olsen, television editor for ''[[Student Life (newspaper)|Student Life]]'', said "The Coon" was an improvement over "The Ring" because it was less heavy-handed in its morals. Olsen also said it raised the question, "What ever happened to the goofy superhero movies? From Batman to the Hulk, it seems like every comic book hero movie has been given a splotch of mud and some dim lighting before being sent out the door."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Olsen |first=Perry |title="South Park" starts 13th season |work=[[Student Life (newspaper)|Student Life]] |date=March 20, 2009 |location=St. Louis, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B+ grade, although she did not like the "non-reveal" ending. She also said the target material for "The Coon" is too easy, but she said the episode was "really likable" and she particularly liked Cartman's growing frustration when his superhero persona is ignored.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Travis Fickett of [[IGN]] also said he did not like the ending and, although he liked Butters' part in the episode and the riffing on comic book stereotypes, Fickett felt the episode lacked any "brilliant moments" and "ultimately runs out of steam with the super-hero riff".&lt;ref name="IGN0319"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fickett |first=Travis |title=South Park: "The Coon" Review |date=March 19, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/964/964509p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell Geller of ''[[The Tufts Daily]]'' said the episode would be more enjoyable to people familiar with the comic book film franchise it was spoofing than it would be for those who are not, although he said Cartman "never ceases to be funny". Comic book writer and creator of [[Watchmen]], Alan Moore, was reported to have appreciated the episode.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsarama.com/8127-tripping-to-the-dcnu-with-alan-moore-part-three.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Tufts" /&gt;

'''Thematic teaching''' (also known as '''thematic instruction''') is the selecting and highlighting of a theme through an instructional unit or module, course, multiple courses. It is often interdisciplinary, highlighting the relationship of knowledge across academic disciplines and everyday life. Themes can be topics or take the form of overarching questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Vacation and Etiquette Themes in Social Studies, Primary Source Inquiry for Middle and High School|last=Resor|first=Cynthia Williams|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3198-6|location=Maryland|pages=10-11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic learning is closely related to [[Interdisciplinary teaching|interdisciplinary]] or integrated instruction, topic-, [[Project-based learning|project-]] or [[phenomenon-based learning]].  Thematic teaching is commonly associated with elementary classrooms and middle schools using a team-based approach, but this pedagogy is equally relevant in secondary schools and with adult learners. Thematic instruction assumes students learn best when they can associate new information holistically with across the entire curriculum and with their own  lives, experiences, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* '''Choosing a theme:''' Themes should be of interest to students and relevant to the curriculum. In some situations, students can choose the thematic topic. Themes should also be topics of interest to the teacher(s) because successful thematic instructions often requires additional research and preparation. Interdisciplinary themes related to multiple academic disciplines such as science, social studies, math, language/writing, and other courses or subjects can be reinforced in lessons throughout the school day.
**Themes relevant to students' interests encourage active participation. For example, students may express interest in current popular music. This interest can be developed into thematic instructional units and lessons that span across time and cultures, how cultures interact and impact one another, music as a social or political commentary in social studies or history classes.

*'''Doing the research:''' Effective interdisciplinary thematic instruction requires extensive knowledge and research by the teacher. Without a broad knowledge base on which to design relevant activities and lessons, thematic lessons can become randomly selected activities loosely related to a topic that fail to demand higher level thinking from students.
*'''Design an essential question(s) relevant to the theme.''' Essential questions are open-ended, intellectually engaging questions that demand higher-order thinking. Essential questions focus a thematic inquiry, helping the teacher chose the most important facts and concepts relative to the theme and focus planning efforts. For students, essential questions require student both learn the key facts and concepts related to the theme as well as analyze and evaluate the importance and relevance of that information. Good essential questions can not be answered with a simple yes/no or true/false; students must discuss, defend, and debate issues related to the theme. Designing thematic instruction around essential questions requires that students learn both content and develop critical analysis skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/109004/chapters/What-Makes-a-Question-Essential%A2.aspx|title=What Makes a Question Essential?|last=McTighe|last2=Wiggins|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Designing instructional units and activities that guide students in answering the essential question'''. Teachers must choose teaching and learning strategies, activities, classroom materials, and experiences related to the wider theme and guide students in answering the essential question. Strategies can be individual or cooperative;stress various skills such as reading, writing, or presenting. 

==Curriculum==
For thematic learning to be successful among learners, the following should be considered: 
* Thematic learning consists of a curriculum that is unified and dwells on an identified theme or topic, ideally guided by essential questions.
* The sources are not limited to textbooks. For example, in the social studies or history classroom, primary source texts and images encourage the development of critical reading skills. For themes related to current events, analysis of modern media hones [[media literacy]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Investigating Family, Food, and Housing Themes in Social Studies|last=Resor|first=Cynthia Williams|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3202-0|location=Maryland|pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Various teaching and learning methods can be used. Projects, cooperative learning, active participation, [[experiential learning]] are often highlighted. 
* Thinking and problem solving skills, observation, critical reasoning, analysis and drawing conclusions are key skills in thematic learning.&lt;ref name="Seefeldt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Seefeldt|title=How to Work with Standards in the Early Childhood Classroom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaAuwVyhVV8C&amp;pg=PA47|year=2005|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-4587-8|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

* Students learn better when experiencing knowledge in a larger context. They begin to see relationships and connections across time, place, and disciplines.
* Learning about wider themes and related concepts and facts more closely resembles how life is experienced outside of school and the classroom.
* Themes can be chosen that are current and student-centered, incorporating the needs, interests and perspectives of the students. 
* Carefully selecting topics and information related to a theme helps teachers narrow the overwhelming amount of information of any discipline.
* Thematic instructions aligns with current popular pedagogies and standards including place-based education, project-based education, and cooperative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teachingwiththemes.com/index.php/thematic-instruction/|title=Thematic Instruction in the Social Studies Classroom|last=|first=|date=|website=Teaching With Themes, Social History through Primary Sources|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When thematic instruction takes place along with cooperative learning, the advantages include the following:
** Thematic cooperative learning activities encourage authentic communication.
** The learner shares one's ideas with others in the group.
** Interaction encourages the values of respect and cooperation, thus building effective peer learning groups.
**The teacher becomes the facilitator, reduces the role of dispenser of learning.&lt;ref name="Thematic Integration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paterson.k12.nj.us/departments/curr/curriculum/FCS-TED/Column%20I%20NJCCCS9.1-FCS/Thematic%20Integration%20-%20FCS.pdf|title=Thematic Integration|website=www.paterson.k12.nj.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5689">[[File:Turonie Krakow 01.jpg|alt=A kind of costume-effigy, that represents aurochs-like creature. It's massive, coated with black fur, and with a flopping jaw.|thumb|Turons]]
[[File:Chodzenie-z-turoniem pocztowka.jpg|thumb|[[Koliada]] walkers with Turoń|alt=|324x324px]]

In [[Polish folklore]], '''Turoń ''' ('''Turuń''', '''Toruń''') is a kind of festive monstrosity in the form of a black, horned and shaggy animal with a flopping jaw. Its appearance can be noticed at folk events during the period after [[Christmas]], yet most likely in times of [[Carnival]] and before the [[Lent]] begins. the name is dereved from the word ''tur'', i.e., "[[aurochs]]".

A person that played the role of Turoń, covered himself with a cloth sheet or sheep skin, holding a wooden pole in front of him, ended with a bull’s head with flopping jaw, horns (sometimes real ones – bovine – or simply, wooden ones), the head covered with rabbit skin or some other animal skin.

== Customs ==
A person playing the part of Turoń has to walk hunched and covered with cloth sheet or sheep skin so the whole appearance would remind of a real animal. Sometimes, Turoń was led on a rope.

Whenever the [[Carol (music)|carolers]]’ group entered a house, the Turoń started his play by jumping around, dancing, neighing like a donkey. Turoń is especially fond of playing tricks on women, which he chases around the house, provokes and sometimes hits with its jaw. During the carol singing Turoń claps his jaw to the rhythm of the song and rings the bell hung on its neck.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polona.pl/item/tarnowskie-rzeszowskie,MTQyNzQ1OTM/104/#item|title=Dzieła wszystkie, tom 48, Tarnowsko-Rzeszowskie|last=Kolberg|first=Oskar|publisher=Ludowa Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza|year=1967|isbn=|location=Warszawa|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turoń’s muzzle is made of thin wood, covered with rabbit skin and it’s made so big so it can swallow an apple whole or drink a glass of vodka in one shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polona.pl/item/krakowskie-cz-1,MTQyNjk2NTQ/277/#item|title=Dzieła wszystkie, tom 5, Krakowskie cz.I|last=Kolberg|first=Oskar|publisher=Drukarnia Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego|year=1871|isbn=|location=Kraków|pages=249-250}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the alcohol, consumed by the beast in nearly every visited household, makes its behavior that insolent. In its hands Turoń’s holding two sticks which he uses to smack the floor with every move, it jumps over them and over the stools in the house as well.

At some point of its play there comes an important moment in singing: the Turoń faints, and then everyone tries to resuscitate it by massage, lighting the hay as a kind of an incense, blowing wind under its tail, pouring vodka into the muzzle of effigy and undoing hexes. After that part Turoń gets back up and begins to frolic again, which often announces the coming end of the carolers’ visit.

In every region of Poland, where the custom occurs, it differs in its form. The [[Kraków|Cracow]]’s Turoń accompanies the carolers that are carrying a star during the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] 

(6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of January). It follows the carolers and when they enter a household, the Turoń tackles anyone who stares for too long at the star or its bearers.

In [[Kielce County|Kieleckie]] region, town folks walk around the village with an [[aurochs]] (also called as “turuń”) during the last week of the Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://polona.pl/item/kieleckie-cz-1,MTQyNjk3MTg/55/#item|title=Dzieła wszystkie, tom 18, Kieleckie cz. I|last=Kolberg|first=Oskar|publisher=Drukarnia Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego|year=1885|isbn=|location=Kraków|pages=44-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar custom is known in [[Tarnów]], where the Turoń is accompanied by other figures: Tatar (Turkish man) and Żyd (Jew). In vicinity of [[Mielec]], people walk with Turoń on [[Christmas Eve]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Whenever the Turoń becomes unbearable for the householder and his family, they sing a song to banish the Turoń:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Idź, turoniu, do domu,
[[File:Turoń head from Stary Sącz.png|alt=Turoń's head. Made with real fur, hedgehog skin and bovine horns.|thumb|Turoń's head from [[Stary Sącz]]]]
nie zawadzaj nikomu,

nie tuś się wychował,

nie tu będziesz nocował."

Which loosely translates into:

„Go now, Turoń, go home

Don’t you bother any more souls

Here’s not the place you live

This not the place you shall sleep.”

After that song, the householder gives to the carolers a “get off ransom” in the form of money and a gift from the pantry. Then, the carolers thank for the treats and they go to the next house.

== Etymology ==
According to [[Oskar Kolberg]]: “(…) I recall a research about aurochs, brought up by a German – Harius. Aurochs as an animal is a foreign name to the eastern languages and it refers to a bull – hence it belongs to terminology and customs of pagan Slavic culture, in which the aurochs was an emblem of the Sun and in its name there was  a holiday called Turzyce. Nonetheless Turuń has to be considered as such; since the day of Christmas a new Sun is born, brighter and longer it shines with coming of    a new summer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dzieła wszystkie, tom 18, Kieleckie cz.I|last=Kolberg|first=Oskar|publisher=Drukarnia Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego|year=1885|isbn=|location=Kraków|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Turoń is a symbol of fertility, it’s a way of wishing through gestures. It poked the householders with his horns to pass on the fertility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">'''Upuh Ulen-Ulen,''' also known as '''kerawang gayo,''' is a traditional cloth of the [[Gayonese]] people in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]].
[[File:Upuh Ulen-Ulen.jpg|thumb|300 px| Upuh Ulen-Ulen from the collection of the Indonesian poet [[Deknong Kemalawati]]]]

The cloth is traditionally placed on a young couple during a wedding ceremony, as well as on the shoulders of guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodamim-tniad.mil.id/2016/11/21/kenakan-upuh-ulen-ulen-pangdam-im-dan-ibu-jadi-warga-kehormatan-gayo/ Kenakan Upuh Ulen-Ulen, Pangdam IM dan Ibu Jadi Warga Kehormatan Gayo]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2018, the Acheh poet [[Lesik Kati Ara]] presented [[Joko Widodo]], the president of Indonesia, with a cloth in the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|State Palace]] in [[Jakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt; Fikar W Eda. [http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2018/04/07/penyair-lk-ara-baca-puisi-bandara-rembela-lalu-serahkan-upuh-ulen-ulen-kepada-presiden-jokowi Penyair LK Ara Baca Puisi «Bandara Rembela» Lalu Serahkan Upuh Ulen-Ulen kepada Presiden Jokowi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth has many components. Traditionally, the background is meant to be the same as 'the contrast and color of the Earth'. According to a Gayonese proverb, God created man from the earth, who then lives on the earth and ultimately returns to the earth after death. The white circle in the center symbolizes a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrian Kausyar. [http://www.lintasgayo.com/7936/upuh-ulen-ulen.html Upuh Ulen-Ulen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other motifs found in Upuh Ulen-Ulen are: 

# A fence (''jang''), since everything in the world has a certain limit, beyond which one should not go.
# Sprouts of bamboo (''tuwis''), which are symbols of persistence, longevity, and happiness.
# A string of clouds (''enum beriring''), which is an allegory of our path through life.&lt;ref&gt; Rosmala Dewi, Irsanti.

However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%).&lt;ref name=WHO_Childlab/&gt; Approximately 2.4 million [[adolescents]] aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007].

==Work that poses special risks for young workers==
[[File:Teen Workers - Real Jobs, Real Risks (Mallory's Story) (2009).webm|thumb|A young worker describing a severe occupational injury]]
Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and [[child labor laws]] prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.

[[Child labor]] is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of [[public education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during [[industrialization]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[worker's rights|workers']] and [[children's rights]]. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in agriculture===
There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrinewspubs.com/Content/Default/Machinery/Article/Keep-kids-safe-on-farm-/-3/102/13392|title=Keep kids safe on farm  - AgriNews|website=www.agrinewspubs.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southwestfarmpress.com/equipment/farm-related-childhood-deaths-are-down-still-too-many|title=Farm-related childhood deaths are down, but still too many|website=southwestfarmpress.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the [[agriculture]] sector.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite journal|last = Windau|first = Janice|author2=Samuel Meyer  |title = Occupational injuries among young workers|journal = Monthly Labor Review|pages = 11–23|date=October 2005|url = http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/10/art2full.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these [[death|fatalities]] could be attributed to [[transportation]] [[accidents]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; According to the "Occupational injuries among young workers" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; There are fewer [[child labor]] restrictions on family-owned or operated [[farm]]s; workers as young as 13 can legally operate [[tractor]]s on farms if their family owns it or operates it.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html|title=Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com|website=CNN|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in construction===
Between the years 1998 and 2002, [[construction]] accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities,&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not [[Legal (disambiguation)|legally]] authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Additionally, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = U.S. Census Bureau|title = Population of the United States by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin, Census 2000 and July 1, 2005| work = National Population Estimates|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| year = 2007|url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762156.html|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in retail trades===
The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the [[retail trade]]s (e.g., [[restaurants]] and retail stores).&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to [[assaults]] and violent acts, most of which were [[homicides]]. Homicide associated with [[robbery]] is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.&lt;ref&gt;Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH [1996a].

Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.&lt;ref&gt;NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current [[child labor laws]] are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], independence, or maturity,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens. Newsletter from the teens at work: injury surveillance and prevention project. Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program.&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.

==U.S. federal and state programs==

===OSHA===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.

=== U.S. Public Health Service ===
The [[U.S. Public Health Service]] has a [[Healthy People 2010|Healthy People 2020]] objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Occupational-Safety-and-Health/objectives#5044|title=Occupational Safety and Health {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) within the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.

The NIOSH funds the [[National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youth.gov/federal-links/national-childrens-center-rural-and-agricultural-health-and-safety|title=National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshfieldresearch.org/nccrahs|title=Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation - National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety|website=www.marshfieldresearch.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal child labor laws===
A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|a}} The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.

===State child labor laws===

States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|b}}

The '''{{okina}}Ai Noa''' ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: literally ''free eating''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Dictionary |author=[[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and [[Samuel Hoyt Elbert|Samuel H. Elbert]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHdRhjL9Y9EC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=ai+Noa+fee+eating}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a period of taboo-breaking which convulsed the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in October 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalākaua|first=David|authorlink=Kalākaua|editor-last=Daggett|editor-first=Rollin Mallory|editor-link=Rollin M. Daggett|title=The Legends and Myths of Hawaii: The Fables and Folk-lore of a Strange People|publisher=C. L. Webster &amp; Company|year=1888|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smIuAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were allowed to eat forbidden food and to eat with men; the priests were no longer to offer human sacrifices; the many prohibitions surrounding the high chiefs were relaxed. 

[[Kamehameha I]], the conqueror of the islands, had just died; his son [[Liholiho]] succeeded him (and was later known as King Kamehameha II). He came to power amid scenes of grief and licence. 

The usually strict rules of the [[Hawaiian religion]] and social system, known as [[kapu]], were in abeyance during the usual mourning period. Women ate pork and bananas; people had sexual intercourse with whomever they pleased; routine life was completely overthrown. When a new high chief came to power, he usually re-imposed the kapu. 

Liholiho did attempt to reestablish the kapu, but he was opposed by his mother, [[Keopuolani|Keōpūolani]], and the other wives of Kamehameha, notably [[Ka'ahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]], the powerful [[Maui]] chiefess. He took refuge in his canoe and after sailing about aimlessly for two days on the west coast of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]], he landed and ate the feast of dogmeat (ordinarily reserved for women) that the chiefesses had prepared for him. Messengers were then sent over the islands announcing that eating was free and the kapu had fallen.
The downfall of the old religion was further hastened by the arrival of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|Christian missionaries]] a few months later.
