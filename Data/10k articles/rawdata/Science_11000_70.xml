{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
'''''Accident of birth''''' is a phrase pointing out that no one has any control of, or responsibility for, the circumstances of their [[birth]] or [[parenting|parentage]]. With a modern scientific understanding of [[genetics]], one can reasonably call any human being's entire [[genome]] an accident of birth. The [[Jus soli|place of birth]] of a baby has an effect in [[immigration law]] of many nations, so that an "accidental" birth in an [[airport lounge]] may entitle a person to a [[passport]] in later life.

More broadly, gender, family circumstances, cultural background, access to education, [[inheritance]] rights, are all examples of accidents of birth.

'''BOINC client–server technology''' refers to the model under which [[BOINC]] works. The BOINC framework consists of two layers which operate under the [[client–server]] [[Network architecture|architecture]]. Once the BOINC software is installed in a machine, the [[Server (computing)|server]] starts sending tasks to the [[Client (computing)|client]]. The operations are performed [[client-side]] and the results are uploaded to the [[server-side]].

==Design and structure of BOINC==
* BOINC is designed to be a free structure for anyone wishing to start a distributed computing project.
* BOINC consists of a server system and client software that communicate with each other to distribute, process, and return workunits.

== Server structure ==
A major part of the BOINC system is the backend server. The server can run on one or many machines to allow BOINC to scale easily to projects of any size. BOINC servers run on Linux-based computers and use [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[PHP]], and [[MySQL]] for their web and [[database]] systems.

Scientific computations run on participants' computers. After uploading from the user's client to a science investigator's database, the backend server validates and analyzes the results. The validation process involves running all tasks on multiple contributor PCs and comparing the results.

BOINC servers also provide these features: 
* '''homogeneous redundancy''' (sending workunits only to computers of the same [[Platform (computing)|platform]] — for example: ''Win XP SP2'' only)
* '''workunit trickling''' (sending information to the server before the workunit completes)
* '''locality scheduling''' (sending workunits to computers that already have the necessary files and creating work on demand)
* '''work distribution based on host parameters''' (workunits requiring 512 MB of RAM, for example, will only be sent to hosts having at least that much RAM&lt;ref&gt;[http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/transition.php SETI@home's transition to BOINC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The server consists of two [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] programs and (normally) five [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]], written in [[C++]]. Computations to be performed by clients are called '''workunits'''. A '''result''' describes an instance of a workunit, even if it hasn't been completed. A project does not explicitly create results; the server creates them automatically from workunits.

The scheduler CGI program handles requests from clients, receiving completed results and sending new work to compute. The scheduler doesn't get available results directly from the database. Instead, a '''feeder''' daemon loads tasks from the database and keeps them in a [[shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared-memory]] block, which the scheduler reads. The feeder periodically fills empty "slots" in the shared-memory block after the scheduler has sent those results to a client.

When all the results from a workunit are completed and returned, the '''validator''' checks them. One popular method would be to compare the results against each other. The validator can have custom project-code to do fuzzy comparison between results, or it can perform a bitwise comparison. If the validator determines that at least some of the results are valid, it marks the work unit and the valid results as valid, users who returned legitimate results are granted [[BOINC Credit System|credit]] for it, and a "canonical result" is chosen{{by whom?|date=March 2016}}. If the validator cannot determine which results are valid or declares all of the results as invalid, new results can be generated and the cycle repeated until the validator can determine which results are valid.

Next, the '''assimilator''' daemon processes the canonical result using project-specific code. For example, some projects may parse the file and store information in a database, others may just copy the file somewhere else. An assimilator may also generate more workunits based on the returned data.

The '''file_deleter''' daemon deletes output files after the assimilator has processed them, and deletes input files that aren't needed anymore.

The '''transitioner''' daemon handles state transitions of workunits and results. It also generates results from workunits when they are first created, and when more are needed (for example, if a result turns out invalid).

=== Server design weaknesses ===

* BOINC Servers are not as simple to deploy as the BOINC Client as{{cn|date=February 2015}} they require a large number of scripts.
* The BOINC Server project website does a bad job of storing a compiled database of server-side scripts for those wishing to create a BOINC project.{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* The BOINC Server can be deployed on [[Windows Vista]] (or higher) systems{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (as they are [[POSIX]] compliant and may be able to run UNIX applications) but the design structure of Windows makes this difficult and more expensive than just using "off-the-shelf" Linux.

== Client structure ==
[[File:BOINC screenshot.png|thumb|A screenshot of the [[BOINC Account Manager|BOINC manager application]]]]

BOINC on the client is structured into a number of separate applications. These intercommunicate using the BOINC [[remote procedure call]] (RPC) mechanism. 

These component applications are:

* The program &lt;tt&gt;boinc&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;boinc.exe&lt;/tt&gt;) is the core client.
* The core client is a [[process (computing)|process]] which:
** Takes care of communications between the client and the server.
** The core client also downloads science applications, provides a unified logging mechanism, makes sure science application binaries are up-to-date, and schedules CPU resources between science applications (if several are installed).
** Although the core client is capable of downloading new science applications, it does not update itself. BOINC's authors felt doing so posed an unacceptable security risk{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, as well as all of the risks that automatic update procedures have in computing.
** On [[Unix]], the core client is generally run as a [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] (or occasionally as a [[crontab|cron]] job).
** On Windows, BOINC initially was not a Windows service, but an ordinary application.  BOINC Client for Windows, Versions 5.2.13 and higher add, during installation, the option of "Service Installation".
** Depending on how the BOINC client software was installed, it can either run in the background like a daemon, or starts when an individual user logs in (and is stopped when the user logs out).  The software version management and work-unit handling provided by the core client greatly simplifies the coding of science applications.
* One or several science applications. Science applications perform the core scientific computation.  There is a specific science application for each of the distributed computation projects which use the BOINC framework.  Science applications use the BOINC daemon to upload and download workunits, and to exchange statistics with the server.
* &lt;tt&gt;boincmgr&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;boincmgr.exe&lt;/tt&gt;), a [[graphical user interface|GUI]] which communicates with the core application using [[remote procedure call]]s. By default a core client only allows connections from the same computer, but it can be configured to allow connections from other computers (optionally using password authentication); this mechanism allows one person to manage a farm of BOINC installations from a single workstation. A drawback to the use of RPC mechanisms is that they are often felt to be security risks because they can be the route by which hackers can intrude upon targeted computers (even if it's configured for connections from the same computer).
* The GUI is written using the cross-platform [[WxWidgets]] toolkit, providing the same user experience on different platforms. Users can connect to BOINC core clients, can instruct those clients to install new science applications, can monitor the progress of ongoing calculations, and can view the BOINC system message logs.
* The BOINC [[screensaver]]. This provides a [[software framework|framework]] whereby science applications can display graphics in the user's screensaver window.  BOINC screensavers are coded using the BOINC graphics API, [[Open GL]], and the [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit|GLUT]] toolkit. Typically BOINC screensavers show animated graphics detailing the work underway, perhaps showing graphs or charts or other data visualisation graphics.
* Some science applications do not provide screensaver functionality (or stop providing screensaver images when they are idle). In this circumstance the screensaver shows a small BOINC logo which bounces around the screen.

Since BOINC has features that can render it invisible to the typical user, there is risk that unauthorized and difficult to detect installations may occur. This would aid the accumulation of BOINC-credit points by hobbyists who are competing with others for status within the BOINC-credit subculture.

'''Bharat B. Aggarwal''' is an Indian-American [[biochemist]]. His research has been in the areas of [[cytokine]]s, the role of inflammation in cancer, and the anti-cancer effects of spices and herbs, particularly those of [[curcumin]] (a chemical constituent of the spice [[turmeric]]). He was a professor in the Department of Clinical Immunology, Bioimmunotherapy, and Experimental Therapeutics at [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=HC1/&gt;

In 2012, MD Anderson launched a review of Aggarwal's research after the federal government notified them of allegations of fraud by academic [[whistleblower]]s in as many as 65 of Aggarwal's published papers; the concerns were about data images that had been reused and [[Scientific misconduct#Photo manipulation|manipulated]] to represent different results.&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientist1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grens|first1=Kerry|title=Author Nets Seven Retractions|journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=February 22, 2016|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45417/title/Author-Nets-Seven-Retractions/|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BioTx"/&gt; He retired at the end of 2015; his departure was not made public until February 2016.&lt;ref name=HC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=oransky/&gt;

{{as of|2018|September}}, 28 papers published by Aggarwal have been retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer journals retract 10 papers, flag 8 more, and apologize for the delay|url=https://retractionwatch.com/2018/09/04/cancer-journals-retract-10-papers-flag-8-more-and-apologize-for-the-delay/#more-70872|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=2018-09-04|accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aggarwal holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[University of Delhi]] (1970), a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Banares Hindu University]] (1972) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1977), all in [[biochemistry]]. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] and was employed as a scientist at [[Genentech]] from 1980 to 1989, where his team characterized the cytokines [[TNF-alpha]] and [[lymphotoxin alpha|TNF-beta]]. Aggarwal then served as Chief of the Cytokine Research Section, Department of Clinical Immunology, Bioimmunotherapy, Experimental Therapeutics at [[MD Anderson Cancer Center]] of the [[University of Texas]] in Houston from 1989 to 2015.&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n2/full/scientificamerican0207-66.html|title=Spice Healer|last=Stix|first=Gary|work=Scientific American|date=February 2007|volume=296|pages=66–9|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0207-66|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/2009-12/pioneering-biochemist-bharat-b-aggarwal-phd-md-anderson-cancer-center-discovering|title=Pioneering Biochemist Bharat B.

==Scientific misconduct==

In 2012, MD Anderson initiated a review of Aggarwal's research after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' [[Office of Research Integrity]] notified the institution that academic whistleblowers had found evidence of [[Scientific misconduct#Photo manipulation|image manipulation]] in 65 published papers by Aggarwal.&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/M-D-Anderson-professor-under-fraud-probe-3360037.php|title=M.D. Anderson professor under fraud probe|first=Todd|last=Ackerman|date=February 24, 2012|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prominent Indian-American researcher under probe|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/229961/prominent-indian-american-researcher-probe.html|accessdate=October 10, 2016|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggarwal's lawyer proposed legal action against the blog [[Retraction Watch]] in 2013 after they wrote about several of his article corrections and [[Retraction#Retraction in science|retractions]].&lt;ref name="USCA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heisel|first1=William|title=Doctor Goes After Retraction Watch, Unleashes Streisand Effect|url=http://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/2013/04/18/doctor-goes-after-retraction-watch-unleashes-streisand-effect|accessdate=October 6, 2016|publisher=[[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]] -- Center for Health Journalism|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the journal ''[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]]'' retracted seven research articles with Aggarwal as a co-author, him being senior or first author on six of these.&lt;ref name="BioTx"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nybo|first1=Kristie|title=Seven Papers Retracted for Lack of Data Integrity|journal=[[Biotechniques]]|date=February 24, 2016|url=http://www.biotechniques.com/news/biotechniquesNews/biotechniques-363309.html|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction notices stated this was "because the data integrity has become questionable".&lt;ref name="Scientist1"/&gt;

In January 2016, an article in ''[[The Times of India]]'' listed Aggarwal as the founder director of the Anti-inflammation Research Institute in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref name=timesofindia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofindia.com/city/pune/Expert-backs-three-spices-in-diet-to-keep-cancer-away/articleshow/50780645.cms|title=Expert backs three spices in diet to keep cancer away|work=Times of India|date=January 30, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retraction Watch noted that the institute does not have a functioning website.&lt;ref name="RW2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Author with seven retractions makes Thomson Reuters list of top scientists — plus another twist|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/03/author-with-seven-retractions-makes-thomson-reuters-list-of-top-scientists-plus-another-twist/|publisher=[[Retraction Watch]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed to Retraction Watch that Aggarwal retired from the institute on December 31, 2015.&lt;ref name="oransky"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal retracts 7 papers by MD Anderson cancer researcher long under investigation|last=Oransky|first=Ivan|url = http://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/22/journal-retracts-7-papers-by-md-anderson-researcher-long-under-investigation/|work = Retraction Watch|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Todd|title=M.D. Anderson scientist, accused of manipulating data, retires|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/M-D-Anderson-scientist-accused-of-falsifying-6865704.php|accessdate=October 6, 2016|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=March 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010052727/http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/M-D-Anderson-scientist-accused-of-falsifying-6865704.php|archivedate=October 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, following an investigation by MD Anderson Cancer Center, the journal ''[[Molecular Pharmacology]]'' retracted two papers coauthored by Aggarwal, citing “inappropriate” or “unacceptable” image manipulation.&lt;ref name="Scientist2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Tanya|title=More Retractions for Cancer Researcher|journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=June 22, 2016|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46394/title/More-Retractions-for-Cancer-Researcher/|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2018 19 of Aggarwal's articles, published in 7 research journals, were ultimately retracted by the publishers.&lt;ref name=orensky2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientist1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven retractions for prominent cancer researcher brings total to 18|url=http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/bharat-aggarwal/|publisher=[[Retraction Watch]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC1"/&gt;
In September 2018, an additional nine articles by Aggarwal were retracted in journals published by the American Association for Cancer Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publisher's Note |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/78/17/5178 |website=Cancer Research |publisher=AACR Publications |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brassite''' is a rare [[arsenate mineral]] with the chemical formula Mg(AsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). It was named brassite, in 1973, to honor French chemist R`ejane Brasse, who first synthesized the compound. The [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] for brassite is [[Jáchymov]] of the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=mindat/&gt;

It occurs as an alteration of magnesium carbonate minerals by arsenic bearing solutions. It occurs associated with [[pharmacolite]], [[picropharmacolite]], [[weilite]], [[haidingerite]], [[rauenthalite]], native arsenic, [[realgar]] and [[dolomite]].&lt;ref name=HBOM/&gt;

Two entities are in '''causal contact''' if there may be an event that has affected both in a causal way.  Every object of [[mass]] in [[space]], for instance, exerts a field [[force]] on all other objects of mass, according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[law of universal gravitation]]. Because this force exerted by one object affects the motion of the other, it can be said that these two objects are in causal contact.

The only objects not in causal contact are those for which there is no event in the history of the universe that could have sent a beam of light to both.  For example, if the universe were not expanding and had existed for 10 billion years, anything more than 20 billion light-years away from the earth would not be in causal contact with it.  Anything less than 20 billion light-years away ''would'' because an event occurring 10 billion years in the past that was 10 billion light-years away from both the earth and the object under question could have affected both. 

[[Image:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A [[worldline]] through a light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension.]]

A good illustration of this principle is the [[Light cone]]:

The light cone is constructed as follows. Taking as event &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; a flash of light (light pulse) at time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;, all events that can be reached by this pulse from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; form the '''future light cone''' of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, whilst those events that can send a light pulse to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; form the '''past light cone''' of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Given an event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, the light cone classifies all events in spacetime into 5 distinct categories:

* Events '''''on the future light cone''''' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Computer-aided production engineering''' (CAPE) is a relatively new and significant branch of engineering. Global manufacturing has changed the environment in which goods are produced.  Meanwhile, the rapid development of electronics and communication technologies has required design and manufacturing to keep pace.{{ref|intro1}}

==Description of CAPE==

CAPE is seen as a new     type of [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided]] engineering environment which will improve the productivity of manufacturing/industrial engineers. This environment would be used by engineers to design and implement future manufacturing systems and subsystems. Work is currently underway at the United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) on CAPE systems. The NIST project is aimed at advancing the development of software environments and tools for the design and engineering of manufacturing systems.{{ref|desc1}}

==CAPE and the Future of Manufacturing==

The future of [[manufacturing]] will be determined by the efficiency with which it can incorporate new [[technologies]]. The current process in engineering manufacturing systems is often [[ad hoc]], with computerized tools being used on a limited basis. Given the costs and resources involved in the construction and operation of manufacturing systems, the engineering process must be made more efficient. New computing environments for engineering manufacturing systems could help achieve that objective.

Why is CAPE important? In much the same way that [[Industrial design|product designers]] need computer-aided design systems, manufacturing and industrial engineers need sophisticated computing capabilities to solve complex problems and manage the vast data associated with the design of a manufacturing system.

In order to solve these complex problems and manage [[Data-driven design|design data]], computerized tools must be used in the application of [[scientific]] and engineering methods to the problem of the
design and implementation of manufacturing systems. [[Engineers]] must address the entire [[factory]] as a system and the interactions of that system with its surrounding environment.
Components of a factory system include:
* the [[physical plant]] housing the manufacturing facility;
* the production facilities which perform the manufacturing operations;
* the technologies used in the production facility;
* the work centers/stations, [[machinery]], equipment, tools, and materials which comprise or are used by the production facilities;
* the various support facilities;
* the relationship between the factory and its environment.

CAPE must not only be concerned with the initial design and engineering of the factory, it must also address enhancements over time. CAPE should support standard engineering methods and problem-solving techniques, [[automation|automate]] mundane tasks, and provide reference data to support the decision-making process.

The environment should be designed to help engineers become more productive and effective in their work. This would be implemented on [[personal computers]] or engineering workstations which have been configured with appropriate peripheral devices. Engineering tool developers will have to integrate the functions and data used by a number of different disciplines, for example:
* manufacturing, industrial and plant engineering;
* materials processing and quality engineering;
* environmental engineering,
* mathematical modeling/simulation, statistical process control and computer science,
* economic and cost analysis and management science,

Many of the methods, formulas, and data associated with these technical areas currently exist only in engineering handbooks. Although some computerized tools are available, they are often very specialized, difficult to use, and do not share information or work together. Engineering tools built by different vendors must be made compatible through [[open systems architecture]]s and interface standards.{{ref|fut1}}

==What CAPE will look like==

CAPE will be based upon computer systems providing an integrated set of design and engineering tools.  These software tools will be used by a company’s manufacturing engineers to continuously improve its production systems. They will maintain information about manufacturing resources, enhance production capabilities, and develop new facilities and systems. Engineers working on different workstations will share information through a common database.

Using CAPE, an engineering team will prepare detailed plans and working models for an entire factory in a matter of days. Alternative solutions to production problems could be quickly developed and evaluated. This would be a significant improvement over current manual methods which may require weeks or months of intensive activity.

To achieve this goal, a new set of engineering tools are needed. Examples of functions which should be supported include:
* identification of product specifications and production requirements;
* producibility analysis for products and modification of product designs to address manufacturability issues and management, scheduling and tracking of projects;
* modeling and specification of manufacturing processes and plant layout and facilities planning;
* consideration of various economic/cost tradeoffs of different manufacturing processes, systems, tools, and materials;
* analysis supporting selection of systems/vendors and procurement of manufacturing equipment and support systems;
* task and work place design;
* compliance with various regulations, specifications, and standards, and control of hazardous materials.

The tools implementing these functions must be highly automated and integrated; and will need to provide quick access to a wide range of data. This data must be maintained in a format that is accessible and usable by the engineering tools. Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include:
* production process models and data and generic manufacturing systems configurations;
* machinery and equipment specifications, and vendor catalogs;
* recommended methods, practices, algorithms, etc., and benchmarking data;
* typical plant/system layouts,
* cost estimation models, labor rates, other cost data and budget templates,
* time standards, industrial standards, project plans, and laws/government regulations.

These on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others.

Another critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which
can best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost "off-the-shelf" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software. The basic engineering environment must be affordable. For both cost and technical reasons, it must be designed to be able to support incremental upgrades. Incremental upgrades would allow companies to add capabilities as they are needed. Commercial software products must be easy to install and integrate with other software already in use. These capabilities exist to a limited extent in some general purpose commercial software today, e.g., word processors, databases, spreadsheets.{{ref|look}}

==Technical Concerns==

Many technical issues must be considered in the design and development of new engineering tools for CAPE. These issues include:
* required functionality of the tools themselves;
* formalization and refinement of engineering methods;
* development of on-line technical reference libraries, and user engineering and graphics visualization; 
* user engineering and graphics visualization techniques;
* system connectivity and information sharing, and integration standards for the computing environment;
* incorporation of intelligent behavior in the tools.

There are three critical elements to be addressed: creating a common manufacturing systems information model; using an engineering life cycle approach; and developing a software tool integration framework.

Resolution of these elements will help ensure that independently developed systems will be able to work together.  The common information model should identify the elements of the manufacturing system and their relationships to each other; the functions or processes performed by each element; the tools, materials, and information required to perform those functions; and measures of effectiveness for the model and its component elements.

There have been many efforts over the years to develop information models for different
aspects of manufacturing, but no known existing model fully meets the needs of a CAPE ernviroment. Therefore, a [[New product development|life cycle]] approach is needed to identify the different processes that a CAPE environment must support, and must define all phases of a manufacturing system or subsystem’s existence. Some of the major phases which may be included in a system life cycle approach are, requirements identification; system design specification; vendor selection; system development and upgrades; installation, testing, and training; and benchmarking of production operations.

Management, coordination, and administration functions need to be performed during each phase of the life cycle. Phases may be repeated over time as a system is upgraded or re-engineered to meet changing needs or incorporate new technologies.

A software tool integration framework should specify how the tools could be independently designed and developed. The framework would define how CAPE tools would deal with common services, interact with each other and coordinate problem solving activities. Although some existing software products and standards currently address the common services issue, the problem of tool interaction remains largely unsolved. The problem of tool interaction is not limited to the domain of computer-aided manufacturing systems engineering—it is pervasive across the software industry.{{ref|techc}}

==CAPE's current state==

An initial CAPE environment has been established from [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) software packages. This new environment is being used to demonstrate commercially available tools to perform CAPE functions, to develop a better understanding and define functional requirements for individual engineering tools and the overall environment, and to identify the integration issues which must be addressed to implement compatible environments in the future.

Several engineering demonstrations using COTS tools are under development. These demonstrations are designed to illustrate the various types of functions that must be performed in engineering a manufacturing system.

Functions supported by the current COTS environment include: system specification/diagramming,
process [[flowchart]]ing, information [[computer model|modeling]], computer-aided design of products, plant layout, [[material flow analysis]], ergonomic workplace design, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, line balancing, manufacturing simulation, investment analysis, project management, knowledge-based system development, spreadsheets, document preparation, user interface development, document illustration, forms and database management.{{ref|curr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12496">'''Computer audition''' (CA) or '''machine listening''' is general field of study of [[algorithm]]s and systems for audio understanding by machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.igi-global.com/book/machine-audition-principles-algorithms-systems/40288|title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/596085/1/Wang_Preface_MA_2010.pdf |title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the notion of what it means for a machine to "hear" is very broad and somewhat vague, computer audition attempts to bring together several disciplines that originally dealt with specific problems or had a concrete application in mind. The engineer Paris Smaragdis, interviewed in ''Technology Review'', talks about these systems --"software that uses sound to locate people moving through rooms, monitor machinery for impending breakdowns, or activate traffic cameras to record accidents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/VideoPosts.aspx?id=17438 Paris Smaragdis taught computers how to play more life-like music]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by models of [[Hearing (sense)|human audition]], CA deals with questions of representation, [[transduction (machine learning)|transduction]], grouping, use of musical knowledge and general sound [[semantics]] for the purpose of performing intelligent operations on audio and music signals by the computer. Technically this requires a combination of methods from the fields of [[signal processing]], [[auditory modelling]], music perception and [[cognition]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[machine learning]], as well as more traditional methods of [[artificial intelligence]] for musical knowledge representation.

== Applications ==
Like [[computer vision]] versus image processing, computer audition versus audio engineering deals with understanding of audio rather than processing. It also differs from problems of [[speech recognition|speech understanding by machine]] since it deals with general audio signals, such as natural sounds and musical recordings.

Applications of computer auditions are widely varying, and include search for sounds, [[music genre|genre]] recognition, [[acoustic monitoring]], [[music transcription]], score following, [[audio texture]], [[music improvisation]], emotion in audio and so on.

== Related disciplines ==
Computer Audition overlaps with the following disciplines:
* [[Music Information Retrieval]]: methods for search and analysis of similarity between music signals.
* Auditory Science Analysis: understanding and description of audio sources and events. 
* Machine listening: methods for extracting auditory meaningful parameters from audio signals.
* Computational [[musicology]] and mathematical music theory: use of algorithms that employ musical knowledge for analysis of music data.
* [[Computer music]]: use of computers in creative musical applications.
* Machine musicianship: audition driven interactive music systems.

== Areas of study ==

Since audio signals are interpreted by the human ear-brain system, that complex perceptual mechanism should be simulated somehow in software for "machine listening". In other words, to perform on par with humans, the computer should hear and understand audio content much as humans do. Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields: electrical engineering (spectrum analysis, filtering, and audio transforms); artificial intelligence (machine learning and sound classification);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Daniel|last2=Caulfield|first2=Brian|title=Pervasive Sound Sensing: A Weakly Supervised Training Approach|journal=IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics|date=Feb 2015|doi=10.1109/TCYB.2015.2396291|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7035063&amp;tag=1|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychoacoustics (sound perception); cognitive sciences (neuroscience and artificial intelligence);&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Purwins, Perfecto Herrera, Maarten Grachten, Amaury Hazan, Ricard Marxer, and Xavier Serra. Computational models of music perception and cognition I: The perceptual and cognitive processing chain. Physics of Life Reviews, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 151-168, 2008. [http://www.mtg.upf.edu/node/938]&lt;/ref&gt; acoustics (physics of sound production); and music (harmony, rhythm, and timbre). Furthermore, audio transformations such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and sound object filtering, should be perceptually and musically meaningful. For best results, these transformations require perceptual understanding of spectral models, high-level feature extraction, and sound analysis/synthesis. Finally, structuring and coding the content of an audio file (sound and metadata) could benefit from efficient compression schemes, which discard inaudible information in the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/Classes/MAS.945/technical.html Machine Listening Course Webpage at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; Computational models of music and sound perception and cognition can lead to a more meaningful  representation, a more intuitive digital manipulation and generation of sound and music in musical human-machine interfaces.

The study of CA could be roughly divided into the following sub-problems:
# Representation: signal and symbolic. This aspect deals with time-frequency representations, both in terms of notes and spectral models, including pattern playback and audio texture.
# Feature extraction: sound descriptors, segmentation, onset, [[Pitch detection algorithm|pitch]] and [[Envelope detector|envelope]] detection, [[Pitch class|chroma]], and auditory representations.
# Musical knowledge structures: analysis of [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and [[harmony|harmonies]].  
# Sound similarity: methods for comparison between sounds, sound identification, novelty detection, segmentation, and clustering. 
# Sequence modeling:  matching and alignment between signals and note sequences. 
# Source separation: methods of grouping of simultaneous sounds, such as multiple pitch detection and time-frequency clustering methods.
# Auditory cognition: modeling of emotions, anticipation and familiarity, auditory surprise, and analysis of musical structure.
# Multi-modal analysis: finding correspondences between textual, visual, and audio signals.

=== Representation issues ===
Computer audition deals with audio signals that can be represented in a variety of fashions, from direct encoding of digital audio in two or more channels to symbolically represented synthesis instructions. Audio signals are usually represented in terms of [[analog recording|analogue]] or [[Digital data|digital]] recordings. Digital recordings are samples of acoustic waveform or parameters of [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] algorithms. One of the unique properties of musical signals is that they often combine different types of representations, such as graphical scores and sequences of performance actions that are encoded as [[MIDI]] files.

Since audio signals usually comprise multiple sound sources, then unlike speech signals that can be efficiently described in terms of specific models (such as source-filter model), it is hard to devise a [[parameter|parametric]] representation for general audio. Parametric audio representations usually use [[filter bank]]s or [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al models to capture multiple sound parameters, sometimes increasing the representation size in order to capture internal structure in the signal. Additional types of data that are relevant for computer audition are textual descriptions of audio contents, such as annotations, reviews, and visual information in the case of audio-visual recordings.

=== Features ===
Description of contents of general audio signals usually requires extraction of features that capture specific aspects of the audio signal. Generally speaking, one could divide the features into signal or mathematical descriptors such as energy, description of spectral shape etc., statistical characterization such as change or novelty detection, special representations that are better adapted to the nature of musical signals or the auditory system, such as logarithmic growth of sensitivity ([[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) in frequency or [[octave]] invariance (chroma).

Since parametric models in audio usually require very many parameters, the features are used to summarize properties of multiple parameters in a more compact or salient representation.

=== Musical knowledge ===
Finding specific musical structures is possible by using musical knowledge as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Examples of this include detection of tonality according to distribution of frequencies that correspond to patterns of occurrence of notes in musical scales, distribution of note onset times for detection of beat structure, distribution of energies in different frequencies to detect musical chords and so on.

=== Sound similarity and sequence modeling ===
Comparison of sounds can be done by comparison of features with or without reference to time. In some cases an overall similarity can be assessed by close values of features between two sounds. In other cases when temporal structure is important, methods of dynamic time warping need to be applied to "correct" for different temporal scales of acoustic events. Finding repetitions and similar sub-sequences of sonic events is important for tasks such as texture synthesis and machine improvisation.

=== Source separation ===
Since one of the basic characteristics of general audio is that it comprises multiple simultaneously sounding sources, such as multiple musical instruments, people talking, machine noises or animal vocalization, the ability to identify and separate individual sources is very desirable. Unfortunately, there are no methods that can solve this problem in a [[wikt:robust|robust]] fashion. Existing methods of source separation rely sometimes on correlation between different audio channels in [[multi-channel recording]]s. The ability to separate sources from stereo signals requires different techniques than those usually applied in communications where multiple sensors are available. Other source separation methods rely on training or clustering of features in mono recording, such as tracking harmonically related partials for multiple pitch detection.

=== Auditory cognition ===
Listening to music and general audio is commonly not a task directed activity. People enjoy music for various poorly understood reasons, which are commonly referred to the emotional effect of music due to creation of expectations and their realization or violation. Animals attend to signs of danger in sounds, which could be either specific or general notions of surprising and unexpected change. Generally, this creates a situation where computer audition can not rely solely on detection of specific features or sound properties and has to come up with general methods of adapting to changing auditory environment and monitoring its structure. This consists of analysis of larger repetition and [[self-similarity]] structures in audio to detect innovation, as well as ability to predict local feature dynamics.

=== Multi-modal analysis ===
Among the available data for describing music, there are textual representations, such as liner notes, reviews and criticisms that describe the audio contents in words. In other cases human reactions such as emotional judgements or psycho-physiological measurements might provide an insight into the contents and structure of audio. Computer Audition tries to find relation between these different representations in order to provide this additional understanding of the audio contents.

'''Dextrose equivalent''' ('''DE''') is a measure of the amount of [[reducing sugars]] present in a [[sugar]] product, expressed as a percentage on a [[dry basis]] relative to [[dextrose]]. The dextrose equivalent gives an indication of the average [[degree of polymerisation]] (DP) for starch sugars, it is another word for gelatine. As a rule of thumb, DE × DP = 120.

In all [[glucose]] [[polymers]], from the native [[starch]] to [[glucose syrup]], the molecular chain begins with a reducing sugar, containing a free [[aldehyde]]. As the starch is [[hydrolysed]], the molecules become shorter and more reducing sugars are present. Therefore, the dextrose equivalent describes the degree of conversion of [[starch]] to [[dextrose]]. The standard method of determining the dextrose equivalent is the [[Lane-Eynon titration]], based on the [[redox|reduction]] of [[copper(II) sulfate]] in an alkaline [[tartrate]] solution,&lt;ref name="isbn0-7514-0269-9"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of starch hydrolysis products and their derivatives|publisher=Blackie Academic &amp; Professional|year=1995|isbn=0-7514-0269-9|location=London|pages=230|doi=|oclc=|author1=Dziedzic, S. Z.|author2=Kearsley, M. W.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an application of [[Fehling's test]].

Examples:
*A [[maltodextrin]] with a DE of 10 would have 10% of the reducing power of dextrose which has a DE of 100.
*[[Maltose]], a [[disaccharide]] made of two glucose (dextrose) molecules, has a DE of 52, correcting for the water loss in molecular weight when the two molecules are combined. Glucose (dextrose) has a molecular mass of 180, while water has a molecular mass of 18. For each 2 glucose monomers binding, a water molecule is removed.
Therefore, the molecular mass of a glucose polymer can be calculated by using the formula (180*n - 18*(n-1)) with n the DP (degree of polymerisation) of the glucose polymer. The DE can be calculated as 100*(180 / Molecular mass(glucose polymer)). In this example the DE is calculated as 100*(180/(180*2-18*1)) = 52.

*[[Sucrose]] actually has a DE of zero even though it is a [[disaccharide]], because both reducing groups of the monosaccharides that make it are connected, so there are no remaining reducing groups.

Because different [[reducing sugars]] (e.g. [[fructose]] and [[glucose]]) have different sweetness, it is incorrect to assume that there is any direct relationship between dextrose equivalent and sweetness.

Physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler]] stated that:

The approach does require prior knowledge of an appropriate invariance principle or data.

== EPI principle ==

The EPI principle builds on the well known idea that the observation of a "source" phenomenon is never completely accurate. That is, information present in the source is inevitably lost when observing the source. The random errors in the observations are presumed to define the probability distribution function of the source phenomenon. That is, "the physics lies in the fluctuations."  The information loss is postulated to be an extreme value.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Denoting the [[Fisher information]] in the data{{clarify|date=February 2015}} as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, and that in the source as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt;, the EPI principle states that

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}
-
\mathcal{J}
=
\mathrm {Extremum}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the data are generally imperfect versions of the source, the extremum for most situations is a minimum.{{why|date=February 2015}} Thus there is a comforting tendency for any observation to describe its source faithfully.{{why|date=February 2015}} The EPI principle may be solved for the unknown system amplitudes via the usual [[Euler-Lagrange]] equations of variational calculus.

'''''Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets''''' is a book by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] that deals with the fallibility of human knowledge. An updated edition was released in the late 2000s with more material than the 2001 edition.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The book is the first part of Taleb's multi-volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled the ''Incerto'', which also includes ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]'' (2007–2010), ''[[The Bed of Procrustes]]'' (2010–2016), ''[[Antifragile]]'' (2012), and ''[[Skin in the Game (book)|Skin in the Game]]'' (2018).

==Thesis==
Taleb sets forth the idea that modern humans are often unaware of the existence of [[randomness]]. They tend to explain random outcomes as [[non-random]].

Human beings:
# overestimate [[causality]], e.g., they see elephants in the clouds instead of understanding that they are in fact randomly shaped clouds that appear to our eyes as elephants (or something else);
# tend to view the world as more [[explanation|explainable]] than it really is. So they look for explanations even when there are none.

Other misperceptions of [[randomness]] that are discussed include:
* [[Survivorship bias]]. We see the winners and try to learn from them, while forgetting the huge number of losers.
* Skewed distributions. Many real life phenomena are not 50:50 bets like tossing a coin, but have various unusual and [[Benford's law|counter-intuitive distributions]]. An example of this is a 99:1 bet in which you almost always win, but when you lose, you lose all your savings. People can easily be fooled by statements like "I won this bet 50 times". According to Taleb: "Option sellers, it is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants", which is to say, option sellers may earn a steady small income from selling the options, but when a disaster happens they lose a fortune.

'''''Forma specialis''''' (plural: ''formae speciales''), abbreviated '''f. sp.''' (plural '''ff. spp.''') without italics, is an informal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] grouping allowed by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that is applied to a parasite (most frequently a fungus) which is adapted to a specific host. This classification may be applied by authors who do not feel that a [[subspecies]] or [[Variety (botany)|variety]] name is appropriate, and it is therefore not necessary to specify morphological differences that distinguish this form. The literal meaning of the term is 'special form', but this grouping does not correspond to the more formal botanical use of the [[taxonomic rank]] of [[Forma (botany)|''forma'' or form]].

An example is ''[[Stem rust|Puccinia graminis]]'' f. sp. ''avenae'', which affects [[oat]]s.

An alternative term in contexts not related to [[Nomenclature codes|biological nomenclature]] is '''[[physiological race]]''' (sometimes also given as '''biological race''', and in that context treated as synonymous with '''biological form'''),&lt;ref name="Chambers bio f"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Biological form |title=Chambers Dictionary of Science and Technology |editor-last=Walker |editor-first=Peter M.

''avenae''" example.

==History, and use with "pathotype"==
The ''forma specialis'' category was introduced and recommended in the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' of 1930, but was not widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Hagborg, W.A.F. |year=1942 |title=Classification revision in ''Xanthomonas translucens'' |journal=Canadian Journal of Research |volume=20c |issue=5 |pages=312–326 |doi=10.1139/cjr42c-028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal pathogens within ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'' species have also been called '''pathotypes''' (not to be confused with [[pathotype]] as used in bacteriology) by author Syoyo Nishimura&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Nishimura, S. |author2=Kohmoto, K. |year=1983 |title=Host-Specific Toxins and Chemical Structures from ''Alternaria'' Species |journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=87–116 |doi=10.1146/annurev.py.21.090183.000511|pmid=25946338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[E]ach pathogen should be called a distinct pathotype of ''A. alternata''"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Host Specific Toxins from ''Alternaria alternata'': Problems and Prospects |journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B | year=1980 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=362–366 |doi=10.2183/pjab.56.362|last1=Nishimura |first1=Syoyo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some authors have subsequently used ''forma specialis'' and "pathotype" together for the species ''A. alternata'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"Currently there are seven pathotypes of ''A. alternata'' described ..., but this term is not widely adopted. ... To further standardise the taxonomic terms used, the trinomial system introduced by Rotem (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Rotem, J. |year=1994  |title=The Genus ''Alternaria'': Biology, Epidemiology and Pathogenicity (as cited by Woudenberg et al. 2015) |publisher=APS Press, American Phytopathological Society  |isbn=9780890541524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is favoured. When differences in host affinity are observed within the isolates of one ... species, the third epithet, the ''forma specialis'', defines the affinity to this specific host in accordance with the produced toxin causing this affinity. When different toxins are produced on the same host, but these toxins affect different host species, the term pathotype should be used in addition. All isolates which are not confined to specific hosts and / or toxins should retain only the binomial name until such specificity is found."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Woudenberg, J.H.C. |author2=Seidl, M.F. |author3=Groenewald, J.Z. |author4=de Vries, M. |author5=Stielow, J.B. |author6=Thomma, B.P.H.J. |author7=Crous, P.W. |year=2015 |title=''Alternaria'' section ''Alternaria'': Species, ''formae speciales'' or pathotypes? |journal=Studies in Mycology |volume=82 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166061615000123

'''GMO conspiracy theories''' are [[conspiracy theories]] related to the production and sale of [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified food]] (also referred to as [[genetically modified organism]]s or "GMOs"). These conspiracy theories include claims that agribusinesses, especially [[Monsanto]], have suppressed data showing that GMOs cause harm, deliberately cause food shortages to promote the use of GM food, or have co-opted government agencies such as the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] or scientific societies such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Critics charge that GMO conspiracy theories are largely promulgated by those opposing the production and sale of GMOs, and instances of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories have lately occurred in the context of public health issues that are mostly unrelated to GMOs, including the [[Zika virus outbreak (2015–present)|2015–16 Zika virus outbreak]] and concerns over [[Chipotle Mexican Grill#Food safety|food safety at Chipotle Mexican Grill]].

==Context==
The existence of conspiracy theories relating to the fear over GMOs has been attested to by scientists, journalists, and skeptics who oppose much [[anti-GMO activism]]. Such commentators include [[Michael Shermer]] (writer of a monthly ''Skeptic'' column series for ''[[Scientific American]]''),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shermer, Michael. "Conspiracy Central." Scientific American 311.6 (2014): 94–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Lynas]] (an environmental activist and writer who opposed GMOs for years and recently switched positions),&lt;ref name="Lynas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marklynas.org/2013/04/time-to-call-out-the-anti-gmo-conspiracy-theory/ | title= 
Time to call out the anti-GMO conspiracy theory|publisher=marklynas.org|author=Mark Lynas|date= 29 April 2013|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jon Entine]] (the founder and head of an advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the case in favor of genetic engineering in agriculture and biotechnology).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/05/11/why-gmos-challenging-anti-technology-conspiracy-theories/ |title=Why GMOs? Challenging anti-technology conspiracy theories|publisher=geneticliteracyproject.org|author=Jon Entine| date=11 May 2015|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics writing about bioethics and science communication have also taken note. A 2013 paper published in the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]'' found statistical evidence that linked conspiracy theorist ideation as being a significant factor in the rejection of scientific propositions about genetically engineered food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewandowsky|first=Stephan|last2=Gignac|first2=Gilles E.|last3=Oberauer|first3=Klaus|title=The Role of Conspiracist Ideation and Worldviews in Predicting Rejection of Science|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075637|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075637|pmc=3788812|pmid=24098391}}&lt;/ref&gt; One GMO conspiracy theory was identified by biochemist Paul Christou and horticulturalist Harry Klee as a claim that development and promotion of GMOs was done by pesticide companies to cause crops to become more vulnerable to pests and therefore require more pesticides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Christou|author2=Harry Klee|title=Handbook of plant biotechnology|chapter=Chapter 50: Political and Social Risk Amplification of GMOs|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/0470869143|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-85199-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while philosopher Juha Räikkä identified a conspiracy theory that claims the lack of any reliable scientific evidence that show harmful effects of GMOs is due not to a lack of evidence but rather to a conspiracy to hide that evidence.&lt;ref name=Raikka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Räikkä |first=Juha |date=2009 |title=The Ethics of Conspiracy Theorizing |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10790-009-9189-1 |journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=43 |pages=457–468 |doi= 10.1007/s10790-009-9189-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy theories involving GMOs and their promoters have been invoked in a variety of contexts. For example, in commenting on the [[Séralini affair]], an incident that involved the retraction of a much-criticized paper which claimed harmful effects of GMOs in lab rats, American biologist [[PZ Myers]] said that anti-GMO activists were claiming the retraction was a part of "a conspiracy to Hide the Truth™".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Belated retraction of Seralini’s bad anti-GMO paper|url = http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/11/29/belated-retraction-of-seralinis-bad-anti-gmo-paper/|website = Pharyngula|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work seeking to explore risk perception over GMOs in [[Turkey]] identified a belief among the conservative political and religious figures who were opposed to GMOs that GMOs were "a conspiracy by Jewish Multinational Companies and Israel for world domination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Worldviews and discursive construction of GMO-related risk perceptions in Turkey|url = http://pus.sagepub.com/content/22/2/137|journal = Public Understanding of Science|date = 2013-02-01|issn = 0963-6625|pmid = 23833021|pages = 137–154|volume = 22|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0963662511423334|language = en|first = Giuseppe A.|last = Veltri|first2 = Ahmet K.|last2 = Suerdem}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a [[Latvia]]n study showed that a segment of the population of that country believed that GMOs were part of a greater conspiracy theory to poison the population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2014/07/shsconf_shw2012_00048/shsconf_shw2012_00048.html|title=SHS Web of Conferences|website=www.shs-conferences.org|access-date=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of media rhetorical devices used in [[Hunan]], China found that the news articles that were opposed to trials of [[golden rice]] promoted conspiracy theories "including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jinjie|last2=Xu|first2=Kaibin|last3=Rodriguez|first3=Lulu|date=2014-05-19|title=The rejection of science frames in the news coverage of the golden rice experiment in Hunan, China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698575.2014.923092|journal=Health, Risk &amp; Society|volume=16|issue=4|pages=339–354|doi=10.1080/13698575.2014.923092|issn=1369-8575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a study of the rhetoric used in public policy debates about genetically modified food in [[Ghana]] showed that conspiracy theories were a feature of a [[civil society]] opposition to GMOs:&lt;blockquote&gt;Government and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory and posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of ''insincerity'', claiming that scientists had some kind of “hidden agenda” behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from their patents on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs includes the underlying assumptions, the uncertainties and the probabilities associated with both best and worst case scenarios. This is a necessary condition to minimise misinformation on GMOs but may be insufficient to completely erase conspiracy theories from the minds of the public especially when scientists and government are perceived to be biased towards multinational corporations that are ostensibly preoccupied with making profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kangmennaang|first=Joseph|last2=Osei|first2=Lydia|last3=Armah|first3=Frederick A.|last4=Luginaah|first4=Isaac|date=2016-10-01|title=Genetically modified organisms and the age of (Un) reason?

&lt;blockquote&gt;The corporate push for genetically modified food arouses great suspicion. Critics charge that GM food ("[[Frankenfood]]") is profitable to industry not only because it can be patented but because crop uniformity will eventually drive up pesticide demand. The charge that big food interests take advantage of poverty to open new markets for GM food is restated by conspiracy theorists, who describe a deliberate macroeconomic creation of food shortages in impoverished nations in order to open the door to GM food. The food industry's opposition to GM food labeling and precautionary measures fuels such suspicions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margit Stange|editor=Peter Knight|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-812-9|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view was echoed by bioethicist [[Michael Reiss]] and moral philosopher Roger Straughan who explain in their book ''Improving Nature?: The Science and Ethics of Genetic Engineering'' that fears about the consolidation of power by a few agrochemical companies over farmers is a main argument against new genetic engineering technology in agriculture: "At its extreme, this fear belongs to the conspiracy-theory genre and, to caricature somewhat, envisages powerless farmers forced to pay ever increasing amounts to anonymous international companies who profit from the cost of the crop seed and from the cost of the herbicides used to spray them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqEObv4UBqkC|title=Improving Nature?: The Science and Ethics of Genetic Engineering|last=Reiss|first=Michael J.|last2=Straughan|first2=Roger|date=2001-05-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521008471|page=143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professors [[Joseph Uscinski]] and Joseph M. Parent in their book ''American Conspiracy Theories'' summarized the people that have adopted GMO conspiracy theories thusly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another prototypical conspiratorial movement involves those opposed to genetically modified organisms (GMO), in essence a protest against the genetic engineering of food. Not everyone who opposes GMOs is a conspiracy theorist: reasonable people can disagree about research and fail to see small groups of people covertly working against the common good. But most visible and vocal members of this movement, however, are conspiracy theorists. They believe that genetically modified foods are a corporate plot, led by the giant multinational Monsanto, to profit off unhealthy food.&lt;ref name="Uscinski2014"&gt;{{Cite book

==Monsanto==

A major aspect of many conspiracy theories is the fear that large [[agribusiness]]es, especially [[Monsanto]] are working to undermine the health and safety of the general public by introducing and promoting GMOs in the food supply. One claim is that Monsanto is deliberately hiding scientific evidence that GMOs are harmful.&lt;ref name=Raikka /&gt; Some anti-GMO activists claimed that Monsanto infiltrated both the American [[Food and Drug Administration]]  and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] which is why the two organizations have supported the scientific evidence for the safety of the genetically engineered food available for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Misleading War on GMOs: The Food Is Safe. The Rhetoric Is Dangerous.|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/are_gmos_safe_yes_the_case_against_them_is_full_of_fraud_lies_and_errors.html|website = Slate Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey M. Smith]] is identified in the book ''American Conspiracy Theories'' as arguing that Monsanto has [[regulatory capture|capture]]d the FDA and many other countries.&lt;ref name="Uscinski2014" /&gt; In the compendium ''Agricultural and Food Controversies'', the authors who are social scientists and food scientists trace the conspiracy theory relating in particular to Monsanto back to events in the early 1990s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are some well-qualified dissenting scientists and a motivated group of food activists behind them, pushing back against GM food. They believe a GM crop is not substantially equivalent to traditional crops. Moreover, they believe that the FDA follows the substantial equivalence rule not because of the science, but because the FDA was corrupted by corporate influence. This is not a belief that the authors' share, but there are smart people of high character who do believe this conspiracy theory, and their side of the story deserves to be heard.&lt;p&gt;

In ''The World According to Monsanto'', author Marie-Monique Robin describes how the substantial equivalence began with a 1992 policy statement by the FDA under the leadership of a former Monsanto lawyer, who, after working in the FDA, returned to Monsanto as vice president. Her story suggests that GM regulations were the product of a revolving-door system where regulators are former and/or future employees of the company being regulated (note that some argue Monsanto wanted excess regulations to keep out competitors, but that is not Robin's story). It is not hard to imagine a company rewarding lenient regulators with a nice job, and food activists have websites listing powerful government officials and their relation to Monsanto and other corporations. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory (a term not meant as a euphemism), it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Bailey Norwood|author2=Michelle S. Calvo-Lorenzo|author3=Sarah Lancaster|author4=Pascal A. Oltenacu|title=Agricultural and Food Controversies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCStBAAAQBAJ|date=17 November 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-936842-6|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Belief that Monsanto is particularly problematic has inspired such actions as the [[March Against Monsanto]] and the singling out of Monsanto over other agribusinesses such as [[DuPont]], [[Syngenta]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[BASF]] and [[Bayer]], and has been identified as a salient feature of anti-GMO activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061913/why-monsanto-evil-dupont-isnt.asp | title=Why Is Monsanto Evil, But DuPont Isn't?|publisher=[[Investopedia]] |author=Stephen D. Simpson, CFA|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of Monsanto-based conspiracy theorizing were the claims by some anti-GMO activists that Monsanto banned GMOs from their cafeterias while promoting them for sale and consumption by the public.&lt;ref name="Blackmore"&gt;{{cite web |author = Willy Blackmore|url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/08/30/why-we-shouldnt-waste-time-gmo-conspiracies|title = Why We Shouldn’t Waste Time on GMO Conspiracies|publisher = [[TakePart]]|accessdate = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-GMO/[[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrail]] blogger Barbara H. Peterson, a retired correctional officer and rancher, complained that Monsanto "has painted those of us attempting to shed light on the dangers of genetically modified/engineered organisms (GMOs) as 'conspiracy theorists'...." She went on to attack Monsanto's suggestion that sabotage could be a possible explanation for the discovery of a few plants of experimental [[genetically modified wheat]] found inexplicably growing on a farm in Oregon as being a conspiracy theory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://farmwars.info/?p=10908|title=Monsanto’s GMO Wheat Conspiracy Theory|website=Farm Wars|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zika virus==

In January 2016, concerns over a [[Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus outbreak]] were accompanied by claims first published on [[Reddit]] that the virus was being spread by a genetically modified mosquito.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/zika-virus-conspiracy-theory-2016-1|author = Lydia Ramsey|publisher = [[Business Insider]]|accessdate = 31 January 2016|title = A wacky conspiracy is circulating about Zika and GMOs — and it needs to stop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fears were based in part because of a new mosquito abatement initiative led by [[Oxitec]]—male mosquitoes (which do not bite) are genetically modified to be sterile, and released to mate with females, resulting in no offspring, thereby reducing the ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquito population that spreads tropical diseases such as Zika.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"/&gt; The claims were identified as "unproven" by the debunking website [[snopes.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MOSTLY FALSE: Zika Virus Caused by GMO Mosquitos|url = http://www.snopes.com/zika-virus-gmo-mosquitoes/|website = snopes|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|first = Kim|last = LaCapria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chipotle food safety==

In the context of ongoing concerns over [[Chipotle Mexican Grill#Food safety|food safety at Chipotle Mexican Grill]] certain commentators have implied that the outbreaks of food-borne illnesses were intentional sabotage by the biotech industry in retaliation over Chipotle's removal of GMOs from their menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/01/publishers-platform-chipotle-must-denounce-mike-adams-conspiracy-theory/#.VtmQWJMrJE4|title=Publisher's Platform: Chipotle Must Denounce Mike Adam's Conspiracy Theory|website=Food Safety News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-e-coli-conspiracy-theory-2015-12|title=Chipotle fans have a wacky conspiracy theory about the chain's E. coli outbreaks|website=Business Insider|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were identified as "unproven" by the debunking website [[snopes.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/chipotle-gmo-bioterror/|title=Chipotle Sabotaged by GMO Activists?|last=LaCapria|first=Kim|website=snopes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical criticism==

In ''Scholars &amp; Rogues'', an online progressive political journal, David Lambert, a development program officer for the [[United Nations]], compared the conspiracy theories  supported by some  in the anti-GMO movement to those supported in the [[anti-vaccination movement]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like preventable childhood diseases, malnutrition is another great moral failing of our time. GMOs such as [[golden rice]]—rice modified to contain high levels of beta carotene in order to compensate for the vitamin A deficiency which kills hundreds of thousands of children around the world and blinds many more every year—and drought resistant crops, which will become increasingly vital in the global south due to [[climate change]], have vast potential to help those who don't shop at [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]]. But real progress has been stymied by the paranoid and misinformed, who clamor that GMOs, which are biologically no different than "natural" foods, are somehow poisonous. Behind it all is of course an evil corporation: Monsanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conspiracies against progress: why the rise of the modern conspiracy theory should concern us all|url = http://scholarsandrogues.com/2014/08/26/conspiracies-against-progress-why-the-rise-of-the-modern-conspiracy-theory-should-concern-us-all/|website = Progressive Culture {{!}} Scholars &amp; Rogues|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Germi Station.jpg|thumb|Weather Station at [[Germi]], Ardabil]]

==History==
Serious efforts have been made to establish a [[meteorological station]] in the city of [[Germi]] since 2000 and in the spring of 2001, succeeded.
The State Meteorological Organization has sent experts to locate and purchase place of Meteorological Station in the city of Germi.  
After going through the legal process, the construction of the station began and it began experimentation in February 2003.

The '''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen}}'''&lt;ref name="translation" group=lower-alpha/&gt; or '''GEH''' is a German national association for the conservation of historic and endangered [[domestic animal]] [[breed]]s.

==History==

The GEH was founded in [[Witzenhausen]], in [[Hesse]], central Germany, in 1981. It has about 2100 members. Since it was founded, no domestic livestock breed has become extinct in Germany.&lt;ref name=geh/&gt;

==Activities==

The GEH co-operates with other national and international organisations for the conservation of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=geh/&gt; It publishes an annual [[Rote Liste]] or red list of [[endangered breed]]s of livestock, which attributes one of four categories of conservation risk to domestic breeds of cattle, dogs, goats, horses, pigs, rabbits and sheep, of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys, and of bees; listing of domestic pigeon breeds is in preparation.&lt;ref name=rote/&gt; Some breeds from outside Germany are listed separately. The four levels of risk are:

* I: ''{{lang|de|extrem gefährdet}}'', "extremely endangered"
* II: ''{{lang|de|stark gefährdet}}'', "seriously endangered"
* III: ''{{lang|de|gefährdet}}'', "endangered"
* ''{{lang|de|Vorwarnstufe}}'', "alert"

The risk level is calculated using a formula that takes into account five criteria: the number of breeding animals or breeding females; the percentage of pure-bred matings; the five-year trend in breed numbers; the number of breeders or herds; and the interval between generations of the animal.&lt;ref name=geh3/&gt;

The GEH also publishes, in conjunction with the {{illm|Bund Deutscher Rassegeflügelzüchter|de}}, the German national association of poultry breeders, a separate list of the historic poultry breeds  and colour varieties that were raised in Germany before 1930. The same levels of conservation risk are assigned as in the main red list.&lt;ref name=rote2/&gt;

==Endangered breed of the year==

Since 1984 the GEH has each year named one or more animal breeds as "endangered breed of the year". To date, these have been:&lt;ref name=geh2/&gt;

[[Paper]], a thin unwoven material made from milled plant fibers, is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first [[papermaking]] process was documented in China during the [[Eastern Han]] period (25–220 CE), traditionally attributed to the court official [[Cai Lun]]. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the [[Islamic world]], where [[pulp mill]]s and [[paper mill]]s were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing [[waterwheel]]s in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of [[Wood pulp|wood-based]] papers.

Although precursors such as [[papyrus]] and [[amate]] existed in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true [[parchment]] considered paper{{efn|Confusingly, parchment ''paper'' is a treated paper used in baking, and unrelated to true parchment.}}; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. 

==Precursors: papyrus==
[[File:Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart.]]

The word "paper" is etymologically derived from ''papyrus'', [[Ancient Greek]] for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant. [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]] for [[History of writing|writing]] long before paper was used in China.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the ''Cyperus papyrus'', and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are the pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}|T.H. Barrett}}

{{Further|Cai Lun#Invention of paper|Science and technology of the Han Dynasty}}

Archaeological evidence of [[papermaking]] predates the traditional attribution given to [[Cai Lun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an imperial eunuch official of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at [[Fangmatan]] in [[Gansu]] province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179–141 BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"&gt;
{{Citation|author=David Buisseret|title=Envisaging the City|year=1998|publisher=U Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBvl1wHRTX0C|page=12|isbn=978-0-226-07993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BCE and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BCE.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}

"Cai Lun's" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishing nets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}&lt;ref&gt;Papermaking. (2007). In: ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}

===Techniques===
During the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1050–256 BCE) dynasties of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], documents were ordinarily written on bone or [[bamboo]] (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of [[silk]] was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The [[Han dynasty]] Chinese court official [[Cai Lun]] (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}} However, the discovery of specimens bearing written [[Chinese character]]s in 2006 at [[Fangmatan]] in north-east China's [[Gansu]] Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"/&gt; It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm|title=eNewsletter|publisher=World Archeological Congress|date=August 2006|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' says&lt;ref name=needham&gt;
{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=40}} uses Wade-Giles transcription&lt;/ref&gt;
:In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai.

The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of [[paper mulberry]] was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of ''tan'' (檀; [[sandalwood]]). In the [[Eastern Jin]] period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After [[printing]] was popularized during the [[Song dynasty]] the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.&lt;ref name=needham /&gt;

===Uses===

{{quotation|Open, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. it can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}|Fu Xian}}

Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous "medicine" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"/&gt; Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. [[Toilet paper]] was used in China from around the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 589, the Chinese scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from [[Five Classics]] or the names of [[Wise old man|sage]]s, I dare not use for toilet purposes".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; An [[Arab]] traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...&amp;nbsp;[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of [[tea]]. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi (currency)|Huizi]]''). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper [[envelope]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the first well-documented [[Europeans in Medieval China]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchant [[Marco Polo]] remarked how the Chinese burned paper [[effigy|effigies]] shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while [[Cremation|cremating]] the dead during [[Funerary art|funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of paper===
According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a "strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=36}} Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=37}} By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=37-38}} A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=38}}

The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=39}} 

According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that "it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}} During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of [[woodblock printing]] from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|From the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 ''juan'') in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

However despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian [[Domenico Grimani]]'s collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Paper became central to the three arts of China – poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=40}}

==Paper in Asia==

{{see|Dunhuang manuscripts}}

After its origin in central [[China]], the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at [[Dunhuang]] by 150 CE, in [[Loulan]] in the modern-day province of [[Xinjiang]] by 200, and in [[Turpan]] by 399.  Paper was concurrently introduced in [[Japan]] sometime between the years 280 and 610.&lt;ref&gt;DeVinne, Theo. L. ''The Invention of Printing''.

After the defeat of the Chinese in the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 (present day [[Kyrgyzstan]]), the invention spread to the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="meggs58"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend goes,&lt;ref&gt;Quraishi, Silim "A survey of the development of papermaking in Islamic Countries", ''Bookbinder'', 1989 (3): 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt; the secret of [[papermaking]] was obtained from two [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prisoners from the Battle of Talas, which led to the first [[paper mill]] in the Islamic world being founded in [[Samarkand]] in [[Sogdia]] (modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]). There was a tradition that Muslims would release their prisoners if they could teach ten Muslims any valuable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi, Imam Muhammad. The Prophet Muhammad – A Mercy to the World.

In Muslim countries they made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather-covered paste boards; they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed.

Since the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, paper manufacturing in Damascus had been interrupted by wars, but its production continued in two other centres. [[Egypt]] continued with the thicker paper, while [[Iran]] became the center of the thinner papers. Papermaking was diffused across the Islamic world, from where it was diffused further west into [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Farid|last=Mahdavi|title=Review: ''Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World'' by Jonathan M.

The oldest known paper document in the West is the [[Mozarab]] [[Missal of Silos]] from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in [[Xàtiva]] in 1056.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hills: ''Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988: A Short History.''

Papermaking reached [[Europe]] as early as 1085 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and was firmly established in [[Xàtiva]], [[Spain]] by 1150.  It is clear that [[France]] had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in [[Fabriano]], [[Italy]] and in [[Treviso]] and other northern Italian towns by 1340.  Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in [[Troyes]], [[France]] by 1348, in [[Holland]] sometime around 1340–1350, in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] in 1320, and in [[Nuremberg]] by 1390 in a mill set up by [[Ulman Stromer]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Neathery Batsell|title=A Brief history of paper|year=2002|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just about the time when the [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]] technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the [[old master print]] and [[popular prints]]. There was a paper mill in [[Switzerland]] by 1432 and the first mill in [[England]] was set up by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]] in 1490 near [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufactura.cz/historie.htm Historie ručního papíru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the first commercially successful paper mill in [[Great Britain|Britain]] did not occur before 1588 when [[John Spilman]] set up a mill near [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/paper.shtml|title=Dartford, cradle of Britain's papermaking industry|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, paper making spread to [[Poland]] by 1491, to [[Austria]] by 1498, to [[Russia]] by 1576, to the [[Netherlands]] by 1586, to [[Denmark]] by 1596, and to [[Sweden]] by 1612.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab prisoners who settled in a town called [[Borgo Saraceno]] in the Italian [[Province of Ferrara]] introduced [[Fabriano]] artisans in the [[Province of Ancona]]{{huh|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- is this the wrong Borgo Saraceno? they seem very far apart--&gt; the technique of making paper by hand.  At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth.  Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time.  They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, [[sizing]] paper by means of [[animal glue]], and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local [[tannery|tanneries]]. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.&lt;ref name="gasparinetti"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/11263265|title=Early Italian papermaking : a crucial technical revolution|last1=Hills|first1=Richard|date=1936|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They adapted the waterwheels from the fuller's mills to drive a series of three wooden hammers per trough.  The hammers were raised by their heads by cams fixed to a waterwheel's axle made from a large tree trunk.&lt;ref name="dabrowski"&gt;{{cite journal |first2=Józef |last2=Dąbrowski |first1=Rękodzieło |last1=Papiernicze |title=The Papermaking Craft |date=1991 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dabro"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.paperhistory.org/dabro.pdf |format=PDF |page=6 |title=Paper Manufacture in Central and Eastern Europe Before the Introduction of Paper-making Machines |last1=Dabrowski |first1=Jozef |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==

[[File:Huex_codex_1a_loc.jpg|thumb|[[Amate]] is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture.]]

In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~tobin/maya/ The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic-Period Maya Civilization] Maya Codex and Paper Making&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''[[amatl]]'' or ''[[amate]]'', it was in widespread use among [[Mesoamerican]] cultures until the [[Spanish conquest]]. The earliest sample of [[amate]] was found at [[Huitzilapa]] near the [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco]], Mexico, belonging to the [[shaft tomb culture]]. It is dated to 75 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). "Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico". Ancient Mesoamerica.== 17 (2). pp. 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods [[boiled]], so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink.

European papermaking spread to the Americas first in [[Mexico]] by 1575 and then in [[Philadelphia]] by 1690.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Paper mills ==
{{Main|Paper mill}}
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|thumb|left|The [[Nuremberg]] paper mill, the building complex at the lower right corner, in 1493. Due to their noise and smell, paper mills were required by medieval law to be erected outside the city perimeter.]]

The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim [[papermaking|papermakers]]. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|It has also become universal to talk of paper "mills" (even of 400 such mills at [[Fes|Fez]]!), relating these to the hydraulic wonders of Islamic society in east and west. All our evidence points to non-hydraulic hand production, however, at springs away from rivers which it could pollute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 1978, 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}: {{quote|European papermaking differed from its precursors in the mechanization of the process and in the application of water power. [[Jean Gimpel]], in ''The Medieval Machine'' (the English translation of ''La Revolution Industrielle du Moyen Age''), points out that the Chinese and Muslims used only human and animal force. Gimpel goes on to say : "This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' – not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Routledge Hill|Donald Hill]] has identified a possible reference to a water-powered [[paper mill]] in [[Samarkand]], in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], but concludes that the passage is "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Christian Impurity versus Economic Necessity: A Fifteenth-Century Fatwa on European Paper|author=Leor Halevi|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|year=2008|volume=83|pages=917–945 [917–8]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0038713400017073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414−417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by the Christian king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] addresses the establishment of a royal "[[Watermill|molendinum]]", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of [[Xàtiva]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt; The crown innovation was operated by the Muslim [[Mudéjar]] community in the [[Moorish]] quarter of Xàtiva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|author=[[Thomas F.

The first paper mill north of the Alps was established in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Ulman Stromer]] in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1993|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==19th-century advances in papermaking==
Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with [[fibres]] from [[wood pulp]]. Although older machines predated it, the [[Fourdrinier machine|Fourdrinier]] papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. [[Robert brothers|Nicholas Louis Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], [[France]], was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for [[Leger Didot]] with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet  Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers of [[London]], who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British [[patent]] 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at [[Two Waters]]. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, [[Matthias Koops]] (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled ''Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.''&lt;ref&gt;Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] and [[Charles Fenerty]] began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the [[western world]] were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the invention of the practical [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.

The original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of [[alum]] and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as [[slow fires]]. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use [[acid-free paper]] for [[hardback]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books.

==Determining provenance==
Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways.  The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar.  Using known sheets can produce an exact identification.  Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results.  Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process.  Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|first1=Michael F.|last1= Suarez, S.J.| last2=Woudhuysen|first2=H.R.|isbn=9780199679416|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sbacAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

{{Network Science}} 
'''Ingredient-flavor networks''' are networks describing the sharing of [[flavor]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]] of culinary ingredients. In the bipartite form, an ingredient-flavor network consist of two different types of nodes: the ingredients used in the [[recipes]] and the flavor compounds that contributes to the flavor of each ingredients. The links connecting different types of nodes are undirected, represent certain compound occur in each ingredients. The ingredient-flavor network can also be [[Bipartite network projection|projected]] in the ingredient or compound space where nodes are ingredients or compounds, links represents the sharing of the same compounds to different ingredients or the coexistence in the same ingredient of different compounds.

ingredient-flavor network was constructed based on the [[molecule|molecular level]] understanding of culinary networks and received wide attention&lt;ref name="MITreview"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/426217/flavour-networks-shatter-food-pairing-hypothesis/ MIT Technology Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesocietypages.org/graphicsociology/2012/01/11/flavor-network/ The Society Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/packages/fall-produce-guide/five-ingredient-fall-recipes.html Food Network]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flowingdata.com/2011/12/27/backbone-of-the-flavor-network/ Flowingdata.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2012/01/are-there-fundamental-laws-of-cooking/ Wired.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

According to Ahn,&lt;ref name="flavor"/&gt; in the total number of 56,498 recipes studied, 381 ingredients and 1021 [[flavor]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]] were identified. Averagely each ingredients connect to 51 flavor compounds.&lt;ref name=Burdock&gt;
{{cite book |author= Burdock, G. A. |title= Fenaroli’s handbook of flavor ingredients |edition=5th |year= 2004 |publisher= CRC Press  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that in comparison with random pairing of ingredients and [[flavor]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]], North American cuisines tend to share more compounds while East Asian cuisines tend to share fewer compounds.&lt;ref name="flavor"/&gt; It was also shown that this tendency was mostly generated by the frequently used ingredients in each cuisines.

==Food pairing==

An important feature that the ingredient-flavor network showed is the principle of [[Foodpairing|food pairing]]. A well known hypothesis states that ingredients sharing flavor compounds are more likely to taste well together than ingredients that do not.&lt;ref name="flavor"/&gt; However, the [[Sensory analysis|sensory test]] by Miriam Kort, etc.&lt;ref name = "Netherland"&gt;[https://jcunieuws.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/food-pairing.pdf "FOOD PAIRING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE 'VOLATILE COMPOUNDS IN FOOD' DATABASE" by Miriam Kort, Ben Nijssen, Katja van Ingen-Visscher, Jan Donders in Expression of Multidisciplinary Flavour Science: Proceedings of the 12th Weurman Symposium, Interlaken, Switzerland. Edited by Blank I, Wüst M, Chahan C. Wädwnswil: Institut of Chemistry and Biological Chemistry; 2010:589–592.]&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the shared compound hypothesis can be debatable. 
According to Ahn,&lt;ref name="flavor"/&gt; the [[Foodpairing|food pairing]] pattern changes in different cuisines. North American recipes tends to obey the shared compound hypothesis while East Asian cuisines tend to avoid it. Besides the spatial variance, Kush R. Varshney, Lav R. Varshney, Jun Wang, and Daniel Myers &lt;ref name = "Medieval"&gt;[http://ssg.mit.edu/~krv/pubs/VarshneyVWM_ijcaiw2013.pdf "Flavor Pairing in Medieval European Cuisine: A Study in Cooking with Dirty Data" by Kush R. Varshney, Lav R. Varshney, Jun Wang, and Daniel Myers  in Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell. Workshops, Aug. 2013, pp. 3–12]&lt;/ref&gt; also showed the time variance in food pairing by comparing the modern European recipes with the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European recipes. They concluded that the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] cuisine tend to share more compounds than the cuisine today.

The '''International Geography Olympiad''' ('''iGeo''') is an annual competition for 16- to 19-year-old [[geography]] students from all over the world. Students chosen to represent their countries are some of the best, chosen from thousands of students who participate enthusiastically in their own National Geography Olympiads. iGeo tests the abilities of every participants in spatial patterns and processes. The iGeo consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and a substantial fieldwork exercise requiring observation, leading to cartographic representation and geographical analysis. The programme also includes poster presentations by teams, cultural exchanges, and time for students to get to know their fellow students and explore the host city.

The International Geography Olympiad is organised by the [[International Geographical Union]] (IGU) Olympiad Task Force, who produce tests with reference to the local organisers and the international board.

After the first iGeo in 1996, it was recommended that the competition was held biennially. Due to the competition growing in popularity, since 2012 the competition has been held annually, rather than biennially, as is the case with the other large [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

== History of competition and national success ==

During the 1994 Congress of the International Geographical Union (IGU) in [[Prague]], people from [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]] launched the idea of an International Geography Competition (iGeo) or Olympiad for students between 15 and 19 years of age. The first one was held in 1996 in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, with five participating countries. The participant count grew to 24 countries with the 2008 competition in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Before 2012, the International Science Olympiads were held every two years, and some regional geography Olympiads were held during intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoolympiad.org/fass/geoolympiad/what-is-igeo/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Asia Pacific Regional Geography Olympiads (APRGO), which were held in 2007 (Hsinchu, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;http://promotinggeog.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/iGeo2010taipei/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spock.nehs.hc.edu.tw/newsletter/1205/B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), 2009 (Tsukuba, Japan&lt;ref&gt;http://japan-igeo.com/english/pdf/result.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and 2011 (Merida, Mexico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtansw.org.au/files/geog_bulletin/2012/2_GTA%20Bulletin%201%202012-2_Asia%20Pacific%20Olympiad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Central European Regional Geography Olympiads (CERIGEO). Since 2013, the International Geography Olympiad, in concordance with the other Olympiads, has been held on a yearly basis.

At the most recent iGeo, held in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]] between July and August 2018, there were 43 participating countries.

The next Olympiad is the 2019 iGeo, which will be held in [[Hong Kong]], China in August 2019.

'''Júlio Augusto Henriques''' (January 15, 1838 - January 15, 1928) was a Portuguese [[botanist]] and professor at the [[University of Coimbra]]. He developed the Herbarium of the University and Coimbra Botanical Garden. He also founded the 'Society Broterian', which brought together various scientists botanists, geologists and naturalists. He was a large admirer of the work of [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;Thomas F. Glick and Elinor Shaffer {{Google books| C297AwAAQBAJ | The Literary and Cultural Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe}}. p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote many articles about the flora of Portugal.

==Biography==
Henriques was born on 15 January 1838, in the parish of [[Arco de Baúlhe e Vila Nune|Arco de Baúlhe]].&lt;ref name=biblio&gt;{{cite web| first=J. | last=Guimarães | title= Henriques, Júlio Augusto, 1838-1928 | date=January 2010 | url=http://bibdigital.bot.uc.pt/index.php?menu=4&amp;language=eng&amp;tabela=geral | publisher=bibdigital.bot.uc.pt (Biblioteca Digital de Botânica) | accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, he married 'Zulmira Angelina de Magalhães Lima'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Júlio Augusto Henriques | date= | url=http://old.geneall.net/B/per_page.php?id=257833 | publisher=old.geneall.net | accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to school in the city of [[Braga]]. In 1854, he trained to become a lawyer at College of Sao Bento in [[Coimbra]], (following his fathers wishes). He completed his law course in 1859, but then enrolled on a second college course in [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Coimbra]]. After gaining a bachelor's degree in Philosophy, he went on to obtain a Ph.D. doctorate.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

Henriques was a supporter of [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt; His final thesis in 1865, was entitled 'As especies sao mudaveis? (translated as 'Are species modifiable?) was a defence of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt;

In 1866, he became a tutor in Philosophy at the University of Coimbra. He soon became secretary of the Philosophy Faculty, which he held until 1873. In 1869, he became a substitute lecturer in botany, agriculture, zoology, chemistry and mineralogy.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

He most favoured botany and the plant sciences, and then in 1873, this new found passion lead to him becoming head of the Botany and Agriculture. This also meant being in charge of the university botanical garden. Using other botanical gardens in Europe as his guide, he achieved new funding for the department. He acquired new laboratory resources, increased fieldwork opportunities for his botany students. He re-organised the books, to create a library, then he re-organised the botanical specimens to create a [[herbarium]]. This new plant collection attracted others, including a vast number of specimens from the German collector [[Heinrich Moritz Willkomm]] (who collected in Spain and Portugal). He also added to the Botanical Garden, by collaborating (via exchanges of plants and seeds) with other botanical gardens and plant organisations.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;&lt;ref name=botCoimbra&gt;{{cite web| title=Botanical Garden of Coimbra | url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Botanical_Garden_of_Coimbra.html | publisher=myetymology.com | accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This invigoration within the botany department, turned Coimbra into a national centre for studying Portuguese flora.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

In 1876, he wrote 'O Jardim Botanico', published by University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|  RJ8CAAAAYAAJ| O Jardim Botanico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, he was still in contact with Heinrich Moritz Willkomm, with several letters being sent between the two botanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=[Letter], Sep 1880. 8, [Lisbon], Julio A.

In 1880, he founded the ''Sociedade Broteriana'',  which was named in honour after [[Félix Avelar Brotero]] (a botanist and founder of the Botanical Garden. The botanical society brought together plant enthusiasts from all over Portugal, to write various articles in the society's bulletins.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Augusto Henriques, Aurélio Pereira da Silva Quintanilha and Luiz Wittnich Carrisso (Editors){{Google books |VmFRAAAAYAAJ| Boletim_da_Sociedade_Broteriana}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disseminate information about plants throughout the country.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

Henriques became to travel all over the country to collect more specimens for the University and the herbarium.  He also started classifying and identifying the herbarium collection (including Willkomm's and his) specimens.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

He produced many articles and publications on the fungi, lichens, algae and vascular plants (such as [[Amaryllidaceae]], [[Poaceae]] and [[Plantaginaceae]]) of Portugal and produced a regional flora of the [[Baixo Mondego|Mondego Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Julio Augusto Henriques (1880) {{Google books|5vEVtwAACAAJ| Contributiones ad floram mycologicam lusitanicam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Henriques published an article 'Carlos Darwin', which is devoted to Charles Darwin's life and works.&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt;

In 1883, he published 'Expedicao scientifica a Serra da Estrella', in 'Seccao de botanica', based on a botanical exploration taken of [[Serra da Estrella]](Star Mountain range) in 1881. It listed 716 plants (including 600 vascular species).&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;Sidney Fay Blake {{Google books| _n4WAAAAYAAJ | Geographical Guide to Floras of the World: Annotated List | page=469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julio Augusto Henriques (1880) {{Google books|wkhEAAAAYAAJ| Expedição scientifica á Serra da Estrella em 1881: Secção de botanica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, he published 'Uma excursao botanico na Serra do Caramullo' in 'Bol. Soc Broteriana', various geological, topographical and flora observations from explorations taken in June 1884.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt;

In 1886, he published 'Contribuição para o estudo da flora d'Africa: Flora de S. Thome' about flora of the Portuguese commonwealth in Africa, he collected in [[São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]] as well, and is responsible for publishing the first flora of these islands in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|7w0_QwAACAAJ|Contribuição para o estudo da flora d'Africa: Flora de S.

In 1901, he published 'De Macieira ate Castro Daire' in 'Bol. Soc Broteriana' various geological, topographical and flora details of various regions in articles.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt;

Henriques did not hold a large number of administrative positions, preferring instead to concentrate on his teaching and running the gardens.

In 1907, the [[University of Uppsala]] (in Sweden) awarded him an honorary doctorate but, as a particularly humble man, he often refused other recognition's.&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

In 1915, he wrote a letter on 5 January from Jardim Botanico, Coimbra to [[William Abbott Herdman|Sir William Abbott Herdman]], the letter is now stored by the [[Natural History Museum]] Archives in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Julio Augusto Henriques, 1 letter from, Jardim Botanico, Coimbra, Portugal, 5 Jan 1915 |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18670">'''Line moiré''' is one type of [[moiré pattern]]; a pattern that appears when superposing two transparent layers containing correlated opaque patterns. Line moiré is the case when the superposed patterns comprise straight or curved lines. When moving the layer patterns, the moiré patterns transform or move at a faster speed. This effect is called optical moiré speedup.

==Superposition of layers with periodically repeating parallel lines==
[[File:070309-moire-a5-a4-parallel-lines.png|thumb|200px|Figure 1. Two layers with parallel lines]]

Simple moiré patterns can be observed when superposing two transparent layers comprising periodically repeating opaque parallel lines as shown in Figure 1. The lines of one layer are parallel to the lines of the second layer.

The superposition image does not change if transparent layers with their opaque patterns are inverted. When considering printed samples, one of the layers is denoted as the [[base layer]] and the other one as the revealing layer. It is assumed that the revealing layer is printed on a transparency and is superimposed on top of the base layer, which can be printed either on a transparency or on an opaque paper. The periods of the two layer patterns are close. We denote the period of the base layer as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and the period of the revealing layer as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.

The superposition image of Figure 1 outlines periodically repeating dark parallel bands, called moiré lines. Spacing between the moiré lines is much larger than the periods of lines in the two layers.

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a8-overlap-and-interleave.png|thumb|200px|Figure 2. Overlapping and interleaving zones]]

Light bands of the superposition image correspond to the zones where the lines of both layers overlap. The dark bands of the superposition image forming the moiré lines correspond to the zones where the lines of the two layers interleave, hiding the white background. The labels of Figure 2 show the passages from light zones with overlapping layer lines to dark zones with interleaving layer lines. The light and dark zones are periodically interchanging.

Figure 3 shows a detailed diagram of the superposition image between two adjacent zones with overlapping lines of the revealing and base layers (i.e., between two light bands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of moiré lines is the distance from one point where the lines of both layers overlap (at the bottom of the figure) to the next such point (at the top). Let us count the layer lines, starting from the bottom point. At the count 0 the lines of both layers overlap. Since in our case ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, for the same number of counted lines, the base layer lines with a long period advance faster than the revealing layer lines with a short period. At the halfway of the distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the base layer lines are ahead the revealing layer lines by a half a period (''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/2) of the revealing layer lines, due to which the lines are interleaving, forming a dark moiré band. At the full distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the base layer lines are ahead of the revealing layer lines by a full period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, so the lines of the layers again overlap. The base layer lines gain the distance ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with as many lines (''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) as the number of the revealing layer lines (''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) for the same distance minus one: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + 1. From here we obtain the well known formula for the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the superposition image:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;p_m=\frac{p_b \cdot p_r}{p_b - p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the case when the revealing layer period is longer than the base layer period, the distance between moiré bands is the absolute value computed by the formula. The superposition of two layers comprising parallel lines forms an optical image comprising parallel moiré lines with a magnified period. According to the formula for computing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the closer the periods of the two layers, the stronger the magnification factor is.

The thicknesses of layer lines affect the overall darkness of the superposition image and the thickness of the moiré bands, but the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; does not depend on the layer lines’ thickness.

==Speedup of movements with moiré==
The moiré bands of Figure 1 will move if we displace the revealing layer. When the revealing layer moves perpendicularly to layer lines, the moiré bands move along the same axis, but several times faster than the movement of the revealing layer.

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a5-upward-movement.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 4. Slow movement of the revealing layer upward]]

The [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF animation]] shown in Figure 4 corresponds to a slow movement of the revealing layer. The GIF file repeatedly animates an upward movement of the revealing layer (perpendicular to layer lines) across a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. The animation demonstrates that the moiré lines of the superposition image move up at a speed, much faster than the movement speed of the revealing layer.

When the revealing layer is shifted up perpendicularly to the layer lines by one full period (''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of its pattern, the superposition optical image must be the same as the initial one. It means that the moiré lines traverse a distance equal to the period of the superposition image ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; while the revealing layer traverses the distance equal to its period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming that the base layer is immobile (''v''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=0), the following equation represents the ratio of the optical speed to the revealing layer’s speed:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_m}{v_r}=\frac{p_m}{p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
By replacing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with its formula, we have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv
| title = The basics of line moiré patterns and optical speedup
| author = Emin Gabrielyan
| date = 2007-03-08
| arxiv = physics/0703098
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_m}{v_r}=\frac{p_b}{p_b-p_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
In case the period of the revealing layer is longer than the period of the base layer, the optical image moves in the opposite direction. The negative value of the ratio computed according to this formula signifies a movement in the reverse direction.

==Superposition of layers with inclined lines==

Here we present patterns with inclined lines. When we are interested in optical speedup we can represent the case of inclined patterns such that the formulas for computing moiré periods and optical speedups remain valid in their current simplest form. For this purpose, the values of periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the distances between the lines along the axis of movements (the vertical axis in the animated example of Figure 4). When the layer lines are perpendicular to the movement axis, the periods (''p'') are equal to the distances (denoted as ''T'') between the lines (as in Figure 4). If the lines are inclined, the periods (''p'') along the axis of the movement are not equal to the distances (''T'') between the lines.

===Computing moiré lines’ inclination as function of the inclination of layers’ lines===

[[File:070309-moire-a5-a6-10-layer-lines-same-degree.png|thumb|200px|Figure 5. Identical inclination of layer lines]]

The superposition of two layers with identically inclined lines forms moiré lines inclined at the same angle. Figure 5 is obtained from Figure 1 with a vertical shearing. In Figure 5 the layer lines and the moiré lines are inclined by 10 degrees. Since the inclination is not a rotation, during the inclination the distance (''p'') between the layer lines along the vertical axis is conserved, but the true distance (''T'') between the lines (along an axis perpendicular to these lines) is changed. The difference between the vertical periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and the distances ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in the diagram of Figure 8.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a16-1-layers-with-same-cruves.png|thumb|200px|Figure 6. identical curves in all pattern]] --&gt;

The inclination degree of layer lines may change along the horizontal axis forming curves. The superposition of two layers with identical inclination pattern forms moiré curves with the same inclination pattern. In Figure 6 the inclination degree of layer lines gradually changes according to the following sequence of degrees (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30). Layer periods ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; represent the distances between the curves along the vertical axis. The presented formulas for computing the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (the vertical distance between the moiré curves) and the optical speedup (along the vertical axis) are valid for Figure 6.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a6-layer-lines.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 7. Changing inclination of revealing layer lines]] --&gt;

More interesting is the case when the inclination degrees of layer lines are not the same for the base and revealing layers. Figure 7 shows an animation of a superposition images where the inclination degree of base layer lines is constant (10 degrees), but the inclination of the revealing layer lines oscillates between 5 and 15 degrees. The periods of layers along the vertical axis ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are the same all the time. Correspondingly, the period ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (along the vertical axis) computed with the basic formula also remains the same.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:070309-moire-a5-a19-inclination-diagram.png|thumb|500px|Figure 8. Computing the inclination angle of moiré lines]] --&gt;

Figure 8 helps to compute the inclination degree of moiré optical lines as a function of the inclination of the revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The bold lines of the diagram inclined by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; degrees are the base layer lines. The bold lines inclined by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; degrees are the revealing layer lines. The base layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and the revealing layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. The distances ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; represent the true space between the base layer and revealing layer lines, correspondingly. The intersections of the lines of the base and the revealing layers (marked in the figure by two arrows) lie on a central axis of a light moiré band. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis of the light moiré band. The inclination degree of moiré lines is therefore the inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the dashed line.

From Figure 8 we deduce the following two equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
    \tan \alpha_m=\frac{p_b+l \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{l} \\
    \tan \alpha_r=\frac{p_b-p_r+l \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{l}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
From these equations we deduce the equation for computing the inclination of moiré lines as a function of the inclinations of the base layer and the revealing layer lines:
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\alpha_m=\frac{p_b \cdot \tan\alpha_r - p_r \cdot \tan\alpha_b}{p_b-p_r} &lt;/math&gt;

===Deducing other known formulas===

The true pattern periods ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (along the axes perpendicular to pattern lines) are computed as follows (see Figure 8):
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=p_b \cdot \cos\alpha_b,\ T_r=p_r \cdot\cos\alpha_r,\ T_m=p_m \cdot\cos\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt;
From here, using the formula for computing tan(''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) with periods ''p'', we deduce a well known formula for computing the moiré angle ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with periods ''T'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_m=\arctan\left(\frac{T_b\cdot\sin\alpha_r-T_r\cdot\sin\alpha_b}{T_b \cdot\cos\alpha_r-T_r\cdot\cos\alpha_b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
From formula for computing ''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; we deduce another well known formula for computing the period ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of [[moiré pattern]] (along the axis perpendicular to moiré bands):
:&lt;math&gt;T_m=\frac{T_b \cdot T_r}{\sqrt{T_b^2+T_r^2-2 \cdot T_b \cdot T_r \cdot \cos(\alpha_r-\alpha_b)}}&lt;/math&gt;
In the particular case when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=''T'', the formula for the period ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced into well known formula:
:&lt;math&gt;T_m=\frac{T}{2 \cdot \sin \left ( \frac{\alpha_r-\alpha_b}{2} \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
And the formula for computing α&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_m=90^\circ +\frac{\alpha_r+\alpha_b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===The revealing lines inclination as a function of the superposition image’s lines inclination===

Here is the equation for computing the revealing layer line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; for a given base layer line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and a desired moiré line inclination ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\alpha_r=\frac{p_r}{p_b} \cdot \tan\alpha_b+\left(1-\frac{p_r}{p_b}\right)\cdot \tan\alpha_m.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-2-curved-with-straight-base.png|thumb|200px|Figure 9. Moiré curves with straight base layer lines]]

For any given base layer line inclination, this equation permits us to obtain a desired moiré line inclination by properly choosing the revealing layer inclination. In Figure 6 we showed an example where the curves of layers follow an identical inclination pattern forming a superposition image with the same inclination pattern. The inclination degrees of the layers’ and moiré lines change along the horizontal axis according to the following sequence of alternating degree values (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30). In Figure 9 we obtain the same superposition pattern as in Figure 6, but with a base layer comprising straight lines inclined by –10 degrees. The revealing pattern of Figure 9 is computed by interpolating the curves into connected straight lines, where for each position along the horizontal axis, the revealing line’s inclination angle ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is computed as a function of ''α''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; according to the equation above.

Figure 9 demonstrates that the difference between the inclination angles of revealing and base layer lines has to be several times smaller than the difference between inclination angles of moiré and base layer lines.

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-3-mirrored-curves.png|thumb|200px|Figure 10. Inversed base layer and moiré lines]]

Another example forming the same superposition patterns as in Figure 6 and Figure 9 is shown in Figure 10. In Figure 10 the desired inclination pattern (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30) is obtained using a base layer with an inverted inclination pattern (–30, +30, –30, +30, –30).

[[File:070312-moire-a5-a16-same-curves-changing-layers.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 11. The same moiré curves with modifying layer patterns]]
[[File:Moiré.gif|438px|right|thumb|Effect on circular lines.]]

Figure 11 shows an animation where we obtain a superposition image with a constant inclination pattern of moiré lines (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30) for continuously modifying pairs of base and revealing layers. The base layer inclination pattern gradually changes and the revealing layer inclination pattern correspondingly adapts such that the superposition image’s inclination pattern remains the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19244">The '''methodology of econometrics''' is the study of the range of differing approaches to undertaking [[Econometrics|econometric analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Castle and Neil Shephard (Eds) (2009) ''The Methodology and Practice of Econometrics  -  A Festschrift in Honour of David F. Hendry'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-923719-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly distinguished differing approaches that have been identified and studied include:
* the [[Cowles Commission]] approach&lt;ref&gt;Christ, Carl F. 1994. “The Cowles Commission Contributions to Econometrics at Chicago: 1939–1955” ''Journal of Economic Literature''.  Vol. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[vector autoregression]] approach&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher A. Sims|Sims, Christopher]] (1980) Macroeconomics and Reality, ''Econometrica'', January, pp. 1-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[LSE approach to econometrics]] - originated with [[Denis Sargan]] now associated with [[David Forbes Hendry|David Hendry]] (and his general-to-specific modeling). Also associated this approach is the work on integrated and cointegrated systems originating on the work of [[Robert F. Engle|Engle]] and [[Clive Granger|Granger]] and [[Søren Johansen|Johansen]] and [[Katarina Juselius|Juselius]](Juselius 1999)
* the use of calibration - [[Finn E. Kydland|Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward C. Prescott|Edward Prescott]]&lt;ref&gt;Kydland, Finn E &amp; Prescott, Edward C, 1991. " The Econometrics of the General Equilibrium Approach to Business Cycles," ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'', Blackwell Publishing, 93 (2),161–178.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''[[Experimentalist approach to econometrics|experimentalist]]'' or [[difference in differences]] approach - [[Joshua Angrist]] and [[Jörn-Steffen Pischke]].&lt;ref&gt;Angrist, J. D., &amp; Pischke, J.-S. (2009). ''Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these more clearly defined approaches, [[Kevin Hoover|Hoover]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Kevin D. (2006). Chapter 2, "The Methodology of Econometrics." in T. C. Mills and K. Patterson, ed., ''Palgrave Handbook of Econometrics'', v. 1, ''Econometric Theory'', pp. 61-87.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a range of ''heterogeneous'' or ''textbook approaches'' that those less, or even un-, concerned with methodology, tend to follow.

==Methods==
Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].&lt;ref name=Introductory_econometrics&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although [[exploratory data analysis]] may by useful for generating new hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Wold|Herman O. Wold]] (1969). "Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building," ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.&lt;/ref&gt; Economics often analyzes systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].&lt;/ref&gt; Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Leamer (2008). "specification problems in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental economics===
In recent decades, econometricians have increasingly turned to use of [[experimental economics|experiments]] to evaluate the often-contradictory conclusions of observational studies. Here, controlled and randomized experiments provide statistical inferences that may yield better empirical performance than do purely observational studies.&lt;ref&gt;• H. Wold 1954. "Causality and Econometrics," ''[[Econometrica]]'', 22(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1907540 p. 162]-177.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Kevin D. Hoover (2008). "causality in economics and econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000569&amp;q=experimental%20methods%20in%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=11 Abstract] and [http://econ.duke.edu/~kdh9/Source%20Materials/Research/Palgrave_Causality_Final.pdf galley proof.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data===
[[Data set]]s to which econometric analyses are applied can be classified as [[time-series data]], [[cross-sectional data]], [[panel data]], and [[multidimensional panel data]].  Time-series data sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation over the course of several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a given year.  Panel data sets contain both time-series and cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third dimension. For example, the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] contains forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast horizons (a third dimension).&lt;ref&gt;Davies, A., 2006. A framework for decomposing shocks and measuring volatilities derived from multi-dimensional panel data of survey forecasts. International Journal of Forecasting, 22(2): 373-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumental variables===
In many econometric contexts, the commonly used [[ordinary least squares]] method may not recover the theoretical relation desired or may produce estimates with poor statistical properties, because the assumptions for valid use of the method are violated. One widely used remedy is the method of [[instrumental variable]]s (IV). For an economic model described by more than one equation, [[Simultaneous equations model|simultaneous-equation methods]] may be used to remedy similar problems, including two IV variants, Two-Stage Least Squares ([[2SLS]]), and Three-Stage Least Squares ([[3SLS]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kennedy (economist)]] (2003).

===Computational methods===
[[Computational economics|Computational concerns]] are important for evaluating econometric methods and for use in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;• Keisuke Hirano (2008). "decision theory in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_D000244&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Computational%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=19 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[James O. Berger]] (2008). "statistical decision theory," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000251&amp;edition=&amp;field=keyword&amp;q=statistical%20decision%20theory&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Such concerns include [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[well-posed problem|well-posedness]]: the [[existence]], [[uniqueness]], and [[stability theory|stability]] of any solutions to econometric equations. Another concern is the numerical efficiency and accuracy of software.&lt;ref&gt;B. D. McCullough and H. D. Vinod (1999). "The Numerical Reliability of Econometric Software," ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 37(2), pp. [http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/jel.pdf 633-665].&lt;/ref&gt; A third concern is also the usability of [[econometric software]].&lt;ref&gt;• Vassilis A. Hajivassiliou (2008). "computational methods in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000559&amp;edition=current&amp;q=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Richard E. Quandt]] (1983). "Computational Problems and Methods,"  ch. 12, in ''Handbook of Econometrics'', v. 1, pp. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573441283010168 699]-764.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Ray C. Fair]] (1996). "Computational Methods for Macroeconometric Models," ''Handbook of Computational Economics'', v. 1, pp. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574002196010052143]-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural econometrics===
Structural econometrics extends the ability of researchers to analyze data by using economic models as the lens through which to view the data. The benefit of this approach is that any policy recommendations are not subject to the [[Lucas critique]] since counter-factual analyses take an agent's re-optimization into account. Structural econometric analyses begin with an economic model that captures the salient features of the agents under investigation. The researcher then searches for parameters of the model that match the outputs of the model to the data. There are two ways of doing this. The first requires the researcher to completely solve the model and then use [[maximum likelihood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rust |first=John |title=Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=1987 |pages=999–1033 |jstor=1911259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many advances that can bypass the full solution of the model and that estimate models in two stages. Importantly, these methods allow the researcher to consider more complicated models with strategic interactions and multiple equilibria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hotz |first=V. Joseph |last2=Miller |first2=Robert A. |title=Conditional Choice Probabilities and the Estimation of Dynamic Models |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=497–529 |jstor=2298122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of structural econometrics is in the estimation of [[First-price sealed-bid auction|first price sealed bid auctions]] with independent private values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerre|first=E.|last2=Perrigne|first2=I.|last3=Vuong|first3=Q.|title=Optimal Nonparametric Estimation of First Price Auctions|journal=[[Econometrica]]|volume=68|issue=3|year=2000|pages=525–574|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key difficulty with bidding data from these auctions is that bids only partially reveal information on the underlying valuations, bids shade the underlying valuations. One would like to estimate these valuations in order to understand the magnitude of profits each bidder makes. More importantly, it is necessary to have the valuation distribution in hand to engage in [[mechanism design]]. In a first price sealed bid auction the expected payoff of a bidder is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; (v-b)\Pr(b\ \textrm{wins}) &lt;/math&gt;
where v is the bidder valuation, b is the bid. The optimal bid &lt;math&gt;b^*&lt;/math&gt; solves a first order condition:
:&lt;math&gt; (v-b^*)\frac{\partial \Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})}{\partial b}-\Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})=0 &lt;/math&gt;
which can be re-arranged to yield the following equation for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v=b^*+\frac{\Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})}{\partial \Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})/\partial b} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the probability that a bid wins an auction can be estimated from a data set of completed auctions, where all bids are observed. This can be done using simple [[Kernel regression|non-parametric estimators]]. If all bids are observed, it is then possible to use the above relation and the estimated probability function and its derivative to point wise estimate the underlying valuation. This will then allow the investigator to estimate the valuation distribution.

==The realism-antirealism debate==
Similarly to the methodology of economics (cf.&lt;ref&gt;Mäki, U. (2009). Realistic realism about unrealistic models. ''The Oxford handbook of philosophy of economics''.&lt;/ref&gt;), the empirical branch of the discipline also was the topic of the debate that dates back to [[Milton Friedman]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;id=Fv8846OSbvwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=milton+friedman+essay&amp;ots=fNiabOSDBB&amp;sig=MyhA0ERHF09KhTbMu_fkLWZgItU|title=Essays in Positive Economics|last=Friedman|first=Milton|date=1953|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226264035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famous essay advising an instrumentalist interpretation of the discipline. According to the [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] philosophy of science, models are interpreted as a tool and its truth or falsity is not considered. With the aim to save the viewpoint that econometric models depict (resemble, isolate, idealize, etc.) the realm of economy, various realist interpretations were put forth. [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ideas.repec.org/b/oxp/obooks/9780198235071.html|title=Nature's Capacities and Their Measurement|last=Cartwright|first=Nancy|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted the coefficients of econometric models as probabilistic, causal laws. Kevin Hoover&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, K. D. (2002). Econometrics and reality. ''Maki, U.''(ed.), ''Economics and Reality.'' 152-177.&lt;/ref&gt; supported the standard scientific-realist interpretation of (econometric) models as isolations of reality. From the position of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], [[Tony Lawson]]&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, T. (1997). Economics and reality. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the lack of robustness of econometric models indicates their falsity, and therefore rejected the [[Scientific realism|scientific-realist]] interpretation (cf. the [[criticisms of econometrics]]). In response to such criticms, Hoover&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Kevin. 2012. Pragmatism, perspectival realism, and econometrics. Lahtinen, Aki, Kuorikoski, Jakko, and Ylikoski, Petri (eds.). ''Economics for real: Uskali Mäki and the place of truth in economics'', 223-240.&lt;/ref&gt; employed [[perspectival realism]] to defend the truth of econometric models. Considering that perspectivism is a pragmatically-flavored stance and does not presuppose the ontic commitment, Maziarz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2018-09-08|title=‘Emerging Contrary Result’ Phenomenon and Scientific Realism|url=http://panoeconomicus.org/index.php/jorunal/article/view/626|journal=Panoeconomicus|language=en|pages=1–20|doi=10.2298/PAN171218024M|issn=2217-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt; employed Uskali Mäki's&lt;ref&gt;Mäki, U. (2017). Modelling failure. In ''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings of the 15th international congress (Helsinki). London: College Publications''.&lt;/ref&gt; model of modeling to show that econometric results differ because of their context-specificity, but pairs of contrary models can grasp different aspects of the same economic reality. In other words, purpose, audience, and context, in addition to target, influence the results of econometric modeling.

'''''My Brief History''''' is a memoir published in 2013 by the English [[physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]]. The book recounts Hawking's journey from his post-war London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Eryn |title=Stephen Hawking memoir "My Brief History" out Tuesday (PHOTOS) |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 September 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/08/science/la-sci-sn-stephen-hawking-new-book-20130908 |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''My Brief History'' has received modest praise from critics.  Ian Sample of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "Hawking's memoir, ''My Brief History'', is a skip across the surface of the Cambridge cosmologist's life, from his quirky upbringing in London and St Albans to his latest work on the beginning of time and the evolution of the universe. The details are sketched, but the brevity makes for a bold picture. Hawking's intellectual activity soars as his illness takes hold and eventually puts an intolerable burden on his marriages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sample |first=Ian |title=My Brief History: a memoir by Stephen Hawking – review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 September 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/13/brief-history-stephen-hawking-review |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chuck Leddy of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' similarly observed, "It's clear, though, that Hawking is more comfortable looking up at the universe than into himself, more concerned with detailing the evolution of a career than the twists and turns of a life, though he does reveal some interesting details about his beginnings as a scientist. In clean, direct prose, Hawking leads us from his birth in Oxford in 1942 to the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leddy |first=Chuck |title='My Brief History' by Stephen Hawking |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=10 September 2013 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/09/09/book-review-brief-history-stephen-hawking/MtYAUq6y9sX4J75rxuCKuL/story.html |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Countries by Natural Gas Proven Reserves (2014).svg|thumb|400px|Countries by natural gas proven reserves (2014), based on data from The World Factbook]]

This article includes a '''chart representing proven reserves, production, consumption, exports and imports of [[natural gas]] by country'''. Below the numbers there is specified which position a country holds by the corresponding parameter. Dependent territories, not fully recognized countries and supranational entities are not ranked. By default countries are ranked by their total proven natural gas reserves.

All data is taken from [[CIA World Factbook]]. Note that data related to one parameter may be more up to date than data related to some other.

== Top producers ==
The [[International Energy Agency]] top 10 natural gas producers in 2011 were (66.7 % of total) (bcm): 1) [[Energy in Russia | Russia]] 677 (20.0 %), 2) [[Energy in the United States | United States]] 651 (19.2 %), 3) [[Energy in Canada | Canada]] 160 (4.7 %), 4) [[Energy in Qatar | Qatar]] 151 (4.5 %), 5) [[Energy in Iran | Iran]] 149 (4.4 %), 6) [[Energy in Norway | Norway]] 106 (3.1 %), 7) [[Energy in China | China]] 103 (3.0 %), 8) [[Energy in Saudi Arabia | Saudi Arabia]] 92 (2.7 %), 9) [[Energy in Indonesia | Indonesia]] 92 (2.7 %), 10) [[Energy in the Netherlands | Netherlands]] 81 (2.4 %) and [[World]] 3 388 (100 %).&lt;ref name=IEA2012&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf Key world statistics 2012] IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">In [[mathematics education]] at [[primary school]] level, a '''number bond''' (sometimes alternatively called an '''addition fact''') is a simple [[addition]] sum which has become so familiar that a child can recognise it and complete it almost instantly, with recall as automatic as that of an entry from a [[multiplication table]] in [[multiplication]].

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;5 + 2 = 7&lt;/math&gt;

A child who "knows" this number bond should be able to immediately fill in any one of these three numbers if it were missing, given the other two, without having to "work it out".

Number bonds are often learned in sets for which the sum is a common [[round number]] such as 10 or 20. Having acquired some familiar number bonds, children should also soon learn how to use them to develop strategies to complete more complicated sums, for example by navigating from a new sum to an adjacent number bond they know, i.e. 5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 and 4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 are both number bonds that make 7; or by strategies like "making ten", for example recognising that 7&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(7&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13.

The term "number bond" is also used to refer to a pictorial representation of part-part-whole relationships, often found in the Singapore mathematics curriculum.  Number bonds consist of a minimum of 3 circles that are connected by lines. The “whole” is written in the first circle and its “parts” are written in the adjoining circles.
Number bonds are used to build deeper understanding of math facts.

== History ==

The term "number bond" is sometimes derided as a piece of unnecessary new mathematical jargon, adding an element of pointless abstraction or incomprehensibility for those not familiar with it (such as children's parents) to a subject even as simple as primary school addition.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;e.g. {{cite web|last=Ebner|first=Sarah|title=Can you help an eight-year-old with her maths homework?|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/schoolgate/2010/03/can-you-help-an-eightyearold-with-her-maths-homework.html|work=[[The Times|The Times Online]]|accessdate={{date|18 April 2013}}|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806011916/http://timesonline.typepad.com/schoolgate/2010/03/can-you-help-an-eightyearold-with-her-maths-homework.html|archivedate={{date|August 6, 2010}}|date={{date|March 12, 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used at least since the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Myers, G.C.(1924) ''Persistence of Errors in Arithmetic'', Journal of Educational Research, Vol 10, June 1924,19-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Pemberton and A. Haigh (1963), ''Number bond workbooks'', books 1&amp;ndash;4, Glasgow: Blackie, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and formally entered the primary curriculum in [[Singapore]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Peng Yee Lee (2008), Sixty years of Mathematics syllabi and textbooks in Singapore, in Zalman Usiskin, Edwin Willmore (eds), ''Mathematics curriculum in Pacific rim countries&amp;mdash;China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore: proceedings of a conference'', Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qT7mQp-271kC&amp;pg=PA89 p.89] {{isbn|1-59311-953-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. the phrase came into widespread classroom use from the late 1990s when the [[National Numeracy Strategy]] brought in an emphasis on in-classroom discussion of strategies for developing mental arithmetic in its "numeracy hour".

In the field of [[cell biology]], the method of '''partial cloning''' ('''PCL''') converts a fully differentiated ''old'' [[somatic cell]] into a '''partially reprogrammed'''  ''young'' cell that retains all the specialised functions of the differentiated ''old'' cell but is simply younger.&lt;ref name="pmid20689186"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PB, Zacouto F | title = Nuclear reprogramming and epigenetic rejuvenation | journal = J. Biosci. | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–9 |date=June 2010 | pmid = 20689186 | doi = 10.1007/s12038-010-0034-2 | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/jun2010/315.pdf | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method of PCL reverses characteristics associated with old cells.  For example, old, senescent, cells ''rejuvenated'' by PCL are free of highly condensed senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and re-acquire the proliferation potential of young cells.&lt;ref name="pmid17544228"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adams PD | title = Remodeling of chromatin structure in senescent cells and its potential impact on tumor suppression and aging | journal = Gene | volume = 397 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 84–93 |date=August 2007 | pmid = 17544228 | pmc = 2755200 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2007.04.020 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method of PCL thus rejuvenates old cells without de-differentiation and passage through an embryonic, pluripotent, stage.

== Method ==

PCL consists in introducing a [[somatic cell|somatic]] adult or senescent [[cell nucleus]] or entire cell with enlarged membrane pores in an (activated) [[oocyte]] and to withdraw this treated cell before its de-differentiation and first [[cell division]] occurs. Thus, the progressive rejuvenation capability of the oocyte is used only temporarily in order to obtain a partial natural rejuvenation. PCL permits to envisage a chosen degree of partial rejuvenation in changing the duration of the introduction of the treated cell in the oocyte. Using PCL cell de-differentiation and its age reprogramming might be, at least partially, separable. Thus the existence of an isolated ageing clock would be confirmed at least during a certain part of the [[cellular evolution]] and [[wikt:involution|involution]].

== Application ==

First experimental result shows a possible high efficiency in partial rejuvenation of senescent [[mouse]] cells. Notably PCL rejuvenates exclusively one single tissue or organ, in contrast to classical [[cloning]] PCL is therefore unable to reconstitute an entire organism. Furthermore, PCL is feasible in a few hours in opposition to classical cloning or [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS) which all need weeks or months.

Classical cloning can rejuvenate old cells but the process demands that the old cells must artificially pass through an embryonic cell stage. Partial cloning affords the advantage that the old cells to be rejuvenated do not have to pass through the embryonic cell stage and are simply made younger.

The extension of human lifespan, in terms of useful, quality, years added to life, has been a goal for many since time immemorial. And while a goal whose attainment was thought improbable, or at least achievable only in the far distant future, the discovery that animals can be cloned has brought the goal of rejuvenation much closer. The remarkable discovery that animals can be cloned showed that the nucleus of an old cell can be used as a donor in so-called “nuclear transfer” experiments where an old nucleus is transferred into a recipient egg whose own nuclear material has been removed. The “reconstructed” egg is then prompted to engage development and develops through an embryonic stage that results, once the embryo is implanted into a surrogate mother, into a new born.  Thus an old cell can give rise to a newborn, which has a typical lifespan: the age of the donor cell is “wiped clean” and returned to a youthful state. Notably, in classical animal cloning the rejuvenation process involves a return to an embryonic form. Thus the specialized functions of the adult cell are also “wiped clean” and returned to an embryonic cell type. And in classical cloning passage through this embryonic state is a must for the age of the cell to be “wiped clean”.

The key notion that exemplifies “partial” cloning from “classical” cloning is the separation of the mechanism(s) that “wipe clean” the specialization of a cell from those that “wipe-clean” the age of the cell. In short, partial cloning aims to retain the specialized functions of a cell and simply make it younger, e.g., a skin cell is rejuvenated without having to pass through the embryonic stage that is a must for rejuvenation via the classical cloning technique (see diagram).

In a new laboratory at the Forschungszentrum Borstel our work on partial cloning focuses, inter alia, on the restricted, temporary, incubation of an “old” cell within the egg. In this way only the age of the cell is “wiped clean” and its specialized, differentiated, state is retained. It is simply made younger – rejuvenated - without going through the embryonic state. The measure of Diagram showing the difference between “Classical” and “Partial” cloning: Classical cloning (the route given by the black arrows) can rejuvenate an old cell but requires passage through an embryonic stage. “Partial cloning” (given by the red arrow) rejuvenates old cells without passage through an embryonic stage.“Partial cloning” (given by the red arrow)rejuvenates old cells without passage through an embryonic stage.

In this way only the age of the cell is “wiped clean” and its specialized, differentiated, state is retained. It is simply made younger – rejuvenated - without going through the embryonic state. The measure of rejuvenation in our system is, first, the re-acquisition of the ability of an old cell to divide, something that is lost in old cells and, second, the loss of characteristics that are associated with old cells.

Should such rejuvenation be achievable the consequences for medicine would be profound. It would avoid the need to artificially pass through an embryonic stage – either by nuclear transfer or by the so-called iPS cells method - to rejuvenate cells. One would simply be able to take aged cells from a patient and then return to the patient their own, histocompatible, rejuvenated heart cells, liver cells etc. In sharp contrast to the cycle of artificial de-differentiation of somatic cells to stem cells and then the artificial re-differentiation of stem cells to the desired differentiated cell type, which is highly inefficient, time-consuming and results in unstable cell types. The process of partial cloning would be efficient and rapid and thus cheap both in terms of materials and manpower. In short, partial cloning has enormous potential to relieve human suffering and disease: it is the most rapid and cheap route to successful regenerative medicine. Partial cloning also avoids the ethical problems associated with “classical” cloning in that it does not result in live born – it mere uses the oocyte briefly as a means to condition and thereby rejuvenate the old cell exclusively.

'''Perceptual computing''' is an application of [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s theory of [[Computing with words and perceptions|computing with words]] on the field of assisting people to make subjective judgments.

==Perceptual computer==

The ''perceptual computer'' – ''Per-C'' – an instantiation of perceptual computing – has the architecture that is depicted in Fig. 1 [2]–[6]. It consists of three components: encoder, CWW engine and decoder. Perceptions – words – activate the Per-C and are the Per-C output (along with data); so, it is possible for a human to interact with the Per-C using just a vocabulary.

[[File:PerC.jpg|below|Figure 1. Architecture for the perceptual computer.]]

A vocabulary is application (context) dependent, and must be large enough so that it lets the end-user interact with the Per-C in a user-friendly manner. The encoder transforms words into [[fuzzy set]]s (FSs) and leads to a ''codebook'' – words with their associated FS models. The outputs of the encoder activate a Computing With Words&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi Zadeh [7], the father of fuzzy logic, coined the phrase computing with words, and stated: ''“CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. CWW may have an important bearing on how humans … make perception-based rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth.”'' He did not mean that computers would actually compute using words—single words or phrases—rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets (FSs), and that these FSs would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other FS, after which the latter would be converted back into a word. Zadeh’s definition of CWW is very general and does not refer to a specific field in which CWW would be used. ''Perceptual computing'' focuses on CWW for making subjective judgments.&lt;/ref&gt; (CWW) engine, whose output is one or more other FSs, which are then mapped by the decoder into a recommendation (subjective judgment) with supporting data. The recommendation may be in the form of a word, group of similar words, rank or class.

Although there are lots of details needed in order to implement the Per-C’s three components – encoder, decoder and CWW engine – and they are covered in [5], it is when the Per-C is applied to specific applications, that the focus on the methodology becomes clear. Stepping back from those details, the ''methodology of perceptual computing'' is:

# Focus on an application (''A'').
# Establish a vocabulary (or vocabularies) for ''A''.
# Collect interval end-point data from a group of subjects (representative of the subjects who will use the Per-C) for all of the words in the vocabulary.
# Map the collected word data into word-FOUs by using the ''Interval Approach'' [1], [5, Ch. 3]. The result of doing this is the ''codebook'' (or codebooks) for ''A'', and completes the design of the encoder of the Per-C.
# Choose an appropriate CWW engine for ''A''. It will map IT2 FSs into one or more IT2 FSs. Examples of CWW engines are: IF-THEN rules [5, Ch. 6] and Linguistic Weighted Averages [6], [5, Ch. 5].
# If an existing CWW engine is available for ''A'', then use its available mathematics to compute its output(s). Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of CWW engine. The new CWW engine should be constrained&lt;ref&gt;This (new) constraint is the major difference between perceptual computing and function approximation applications of FSs and systems.&lt;/ref&gt; so that its output(s) resemble the FOUs in the codebook(s) for ''A''.
# Map the IT2 FS outputs from the CWW engine into a recommendation at the output of the decoder. If the recommendation is a word, rank or class, then use existing mathematics to accomplish this mapping [5, Ch. 4]. Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of decoder.

==Applications of Per-C==

To-date a Per-C has been implemented for the following four applications: (1) investment decision-making, (2) social judgment making, (3) distributed decision making, and (4) hierarchical and distributed decision-making. A specific example of the fourth application is the so-called ''Journal Publication Judgment Advisor'' [5, Ch. 10] in which for the first time only words are used at every level of the following hierarchical and distributed decision making process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''n'' reviewers have to provide a subjective recommendation about a journal article that has been sent to them by the Associate Editor, who then has to aggregate the independent recommendations into a final recommendation that is sent to the Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Because it is very problematic to ask reviewers to provide numerical scores for paper-evaluation sub-categories (the two major categories are ''Technical Merit'' and ''Presentation''), such as importance, content, depth, style, organization, clarity, references, etc., each reviewer will only be asked to provide a linguistic score for each of these categories. They will not be asked for an overall recommendation about the paper because in the past it is quite common for reviewers who provide the same numerical scores for such categories to give very different publishing recommendations. By leaving a specific recommendation to the associate editor such inconsistencies can hope to be eliminated. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How words can be aggregated to reflect each reviewer’s recommendation as well as the expertise of each reviewer about the paper’s subject matter is done using a linguistic weighted average. Although the journal publication judgment advisor uses reviewers and an associate editor, the word “reviewer” could be replaced by judge, expert, low-level manager, commander, referee, etc., and the term “associate editor” could be replaced by control center, command center, higher-level manager, etc. So, this application has potential wide applicability to many other applications.

Recently, a new Per-C based [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) methodology was developed, with its application to [[edible bird's nest]] farming, in [[Borneo]], has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chai K.C.|author2=Tay K. M.|author3=Lim C.P. | title=A perceptual computing-based method to prioritize failure modes in failure mode and effect analysis and its application to edible bird nest farming |journal=Applied Soft Computing |volume=49|year=2016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616304379 |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.043
 |pages= 734–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Per-c fmea.png|center|thumb|A Perceptual Computing Based Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Methodology]]

In summary, the Per-C (whose development has taken more than a decade) is the first complete implementation of Zadeh’s CWW paradigm, as applied to assisting people to make subjective judgments.

'''Richard Vogt''' (19 December 1894 - January 1979) was a military [[Germany|German]] [[aircraft]] designer who was known for his original airframes, including the [[Asymmetry|asymmetrical]] [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141|BV 141]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he moved the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], where he worked on American military aircraft design.

== Early life ==
Richard Vogt was born in [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]], a town in the Kingdom of [[Württemberg]], which at that time was a constituent state of the [[German Empire]]. He was the seventh child of twelve [[sibling]]s.

He was admitted to a school of universal [[literacy education]] in [[:de:Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt|Stuttgart-Cannstatt]]. When he was a student at the school, he had an opportunity get to know [[Ernst Heinkel]]. In 1912, when he was 18 years old, Vogt built his first aeroplane. With the help of a friend and under the eye of Heinkel, he attempted unsuccessfully to fly it just outside [[Mutlangen]], a neighboring town to Schwäbisch Gmünd.

==World War 1==
After school Vogt worked for a year at an engine factory in [[Ludwigshafen]]. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he was conscripted into the military ranks of the [[German Empire]], with which he was wounded in action, and medically evacuated back to Germany. Vogt then trained as a [[Aviator|pilot]] in [[Halberstadt]]. 

==Career==
On being discharged from military service in August 1916 and found work at the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin works]] in [[Friedrichshafen]]. While there, Vogt was impressed by [[Claudius Dornier]] and determined to become an aircraft designer. After the war, he completed a two-year study course at the [[Technische Hochschule|Technical University]] in [[Stuttgart]], and subsequently served as an assistant to Professor Baumann at the university's Institute of Aeronautical and Automobile Systems until 1922. During that period he was awarded his first [[patent]] and received a [[doctorate degree]].

===Kawasaki===
On behalf of Dornier, Vogt was briefly sent to [[Italy]] and then, in 1923, to the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] in [[Kobe, Japan|Kobe]], [[Japan]], which was a licensed manufacturer of [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] aircraft. In Japan he was appointed to the rank of chief designer, and he trained the young Japanese engineer [[Takeo Doi (aircraft designer)|Takeo Doi]] to be his successor. Doi would go on to design the [[Kawasaki Ki-61|Ki-61]] ''Hien'' . During that period Vogt designed several types including the [[Kawasaki Type 92|KDA-5 Army Type 92]] [[biplane]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] plane, [[Kawasaki Type 88|KDA-2 Army Type 88]] biplane reconnaissance, [[Kawasaki KDA-3|KDA-3]] single-seat fighter, and (in cooperation with Doi) a modified version of the KDA-5 Army Type 92-I biplane fighter. He stayed with Kawasaki until 1933.

===Blohm &amp; Voss===

[[File:Blohm und Voss Bv138.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138|BV 138]] ''Seedrache'' ({{lang-en|Sea Dragon}}) three-engined patrol flying boat was produced in greater numbers than any other B&amp;V type.]]
[[File:Blohm und Voss Bv141.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141|BV 141]] tactical reconnaissance prototype with an unusual asymmetrical shape.]]
In 1933 he was offered the position of Chief Designer at [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau]], an aircraft manufacturer recently set up by [[Blohm+Voss|Blohm &amp; Voss]] shipbuilders. During his flight back from Japan he worked on the idea of a tubular steel main wing [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] which could also double as an armoured [[fuel tank]]. Almost all of his subsequent designs would feature such a combined hollow steel spar and fuel tank.

Vogt's next major innovation was an asymmetric aircraft layout in which the thrust line was offset to one side, allowing the pilot a clear view on the other side. It appeared in the [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141|Ha 141]] reconnaissance aircraft, of which about twenty were built.

Shortly before [[World War II]] broke out, Hamburger Flugzeugbau was reformed as the aircraft division of Blohm &amp; Voss and changed its name accordingly. The designation of Vogt's aircraft changed from Ha to BV, with many of the types then under development changing their designations, for example the Ha 141 became the BV 141.

Other important, more conventional designs included a series of ever-larger [[flying boat]]s. The [[Blohm &amp; Voss BV 238|BV 238]] was the largest and heaviest aircraft manufactured until the end of the war by any Axis power. Vogt also developed a series of gliding munitions, but the advanced control systems caused problems and although quite large quantities were manufactured, none ever saw operational service.

His design style was noted by the British journal ''Aeroplane'' in the caption to a cartoon:&lt;ref&gt;Pohlmann (1982), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most any other designer can.&lt;br&gt;

Vogt's final innovation was a tailless "pfeilflieger" (swept wing) design, well suited to the new [[jet engine]]s then under development. A series of designs culminated in the [[Blohm &amp; Voss P 215|P 215]] all-weather fighter, which received an order for three prototypes just weeks before the war ended.&lt;ref name="amtmann1998"&gt;Hans Antmann; ''The Vanishing Paperclips'', Monogram, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohlmann"&gt;Pohlmann (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

===American "Paperclip"===
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}
After [[World War II]], Vogt was recruited by the [[US Air Force]] under "[[Operation Paperclip]]", and he moved to the [[United States]]. He worked as a civilian employee for the Research Laboratory of the US Air Force in [[Dayton, Ohio]] from the beginning of 1947 to 1954. Subsequently he became the chief designer of the [[Curtiss-Wright|Aerophysics Development Corporation]] and worked there until the parent company decided to close the business in 1960.

From August 1960 to August 1966, he served as a staff member on the team of [[George S. Schairer]], who was the chief [[aerodynamicist]] in the research and testing division of [[Boeing]]. At Boeing, Vogt was especially involved in the design of [[VTOL|vertical takeoff]] systems and [[hydrofoils]]. He also investigated the effect of the length and shape of wings on the flying range, and he proved that small extensions attached to both tips of the wings improved the [[aerodynamics]] and increased the operation range of the aircraft. This finding has been widely used in the design of modern aircraft, where the extension parts are well known as the [[wing tip]]s or [[Wingtip device|winglet]]s. His last assignment was the after-launch evaluation of the design of the [[Boeing 747]].

== Retirement==
After retiring from Boeing, he enjoyed developing a safe [[sailboat]] that would not turn over, and he wrote his memoirs. In 1977 a fire totally destroyed his house, resulting in the loss of many personal and technical documents.

==Death==
In January 1979 he died of [[myocardial infarction]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], at age 84. 

==Personal life==
Vogt was married and had two sons.

== Aircraft designed ==
These types were all built and flown.

'''Satya N. Atluri ICCES Medal''' is a Medal awarded annually by [http://www.icces.org ICCES (International Conference on Computational &amp; Experimental Engineering and Sciences)]  and [http://www.techscience.com the Tech Science Press] to an individual who has had a significant impact on the world of engineering, the sciences, and commerce, and the well-being of the society at large as a result. This Medal is presented at the Awards Banquet of [http://www.icces.org the annual ICCES Conference].&lt;ref name="icces"&gt;ICCES [http://www.icces.org/awards.html Award List]&lt;/ref&gt; The recipient of the Medal is invited to deliver a Plenary Lecture, on a topic of her/his choosing, at the ICCES conference. This Medal honors Professor [[Satya N. Atluri]] of [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]], who founded ICCES in 1986, and founded the journals, "[http://www.techscience.com/cmes CMES: Computer Modeling in Engineering &amp; Sciences]" (2000), "[http://www.techscience.com/cmc CMC: Computers, Materials, &amp; Continua]" (2004), "[http://www.techscience.com/mcb MCB: Molecular &amp; Cellular Biomechanics]" (2004), "[http://www.techscience.com/sl SL: Structural Longevity]" (2008), and "[http://www.techscience.com/acm ACM: Advances in Computational Mechanics]" (2008), all of which are published by [http://www.techscience.com Tech Science Press].&lt;ref name="tsp"&gt;Tech Science Press [http://www.techscience.com/academic.html Journals]&lt;/ref&gt; All these journals are in the frontier disciplines of engineering and the sciences, and especially at the interfaces of engineering and the sciences. Previously, Professor Atluri founded, and was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal, "[https://www.springer.com/engineering/journal/466 Computational Mechanics]", during 1986-2000.

[http://www.icces.org The ICCES conferences] are held annually: [[Tokyo]] (1986); [[Atlanta]] (1988); [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] (1991); [[Hong Kong]] (1992); [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island, Hawaii]] (1995); [[San Jose, Costa Rica]] (1997); [[Atlanta]] (1998); [[Los Angeles]] (2000); [[Puerto Vallarta, Mexico]] (2001); [[Reno, Nevada]] (2002); [[Corfu, Greece]] (2003); [[Madeira]], Portugal (2004); [[Chennai, India]] (2005); [[Miami]] (2007); [[Honolulu]] (2008); [[Phuket, Thailand]] (2009), [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] (2010), and [[Nanjing, China]] (2011).

=== Formation ===
When wind, whitecaps, and breaking waves mix air into the sea surface, the air regroups to form bubbles, floats to the surface, and bursts at the air-sea interface &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Gerrit|last2=Andreas|first2=Edgar L|last3=Anguelova|first3=Magdalena D.|last4=Fairall|first4=C.

When they burst, they release up to a thousand particles of sea spray &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron|first=Fabrice|date=2015-01-03|title=Ocean Spray|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014651|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=507–538|doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014651|issn=0066-4189}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which range in size from nanometers to micrometers and can be expelled up to 20 cm from the sea surface &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. '''Film droplets''' make up the majority of the smaller particles created by the initial burst, while '''jet droplets''' are generated by a collapse of the bubble cavity and are ejected from the sea surface in the form of a vertical jet &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntyre|first=Ferren|date=1972-09-20|title=Flow patterns in breaking bubbles|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/jc077i027p05211|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=77|issue=27|pages=5211–5228|doi=10.1029/jc077i027p05211|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In windy conditions, water droplets are mechanically torn off from crests of breaking waves. Sea spray droplets generated via such a mechanism are called '''spume droplets''' ''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' and are typically larger in size and have less residence time in air. Impingement of plunging waves on sea surface also generates sea spray in the form of '''splash droplets''' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreas|first=Edgar L.|date=2002-09-30|title=The Impact of Sea Spray on Air-Sea Fluxes in Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Models|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21236/ada627095|location=Fort Belvoir, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. The composition of the sea spray depends primarily on the composition of the water from which it is produced, but broadly speaking is a mixture of salts and [[organic matter]].  Several factors determine the production flux of sea spray, especially wind speed, [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] height, swell period, humidity, and temperature differential between the atmosphere and the surface water &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Gerrit|last2=Neele|first2=Filip P.|last3=Hill|first3=Martin|last4=Smith|first4=Michael H.|last5=Vignati|first5=Elisabetta|date=2000-12-01|title=Production of sea spray aerosol in the surf zone|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000JD900549|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=105|issue=D24|pages=29397–29409|doi=10.1029/2000jd900549|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Production and size distribution rate of SSAs are thus sensitive to the mixing state &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prather|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Bertram|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Grassian|first3=Vicki H.|last4=Deane|first4=Grant B.|last5=Stokes|first5=M. Dale|last6=DeMott|first6=Paul J.|last7=Aluwihare|first7=Lihini I.|last8=Palenik|first8=Brian P.|last9=Azam|first9=Farooq|date=2013-05-07|title=Bringing the ocean into the laboratory to probe the chemical complexity of sea spray aerosol|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/19/7550|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=19|pages=7550–7555|doi=10.1073/pnas.1300262110|issn=0027-8424|pmid=23620519}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A lesser studied area of sea spray generation is the formation of sea spray as a result of rain drop impact on the sea surface ''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Spatial variation ===
In addition to the local conditions that influence sea spray formation, there are also consistent spatial patterns in sea spray production and composition. Because sea spray is generated when air is mixed into the ocean, formation gradients are established by [[turbulence]] of the surface water &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Wave action along coastal shorelines is generally where turbulence is greatest, so this is where sea spray production is the highest. Particles generated in turbulent coastal areas can travel horizontally up to 25 km within the [[planetary boundary layer]] &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. As distance from shore decreases, sea spray production declines to a level sustained almost exclusively by white caps &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The proportion of the ocean surface area that is turbulent enough to produce significant sea spray is called the white cap fraction  &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Gerrit|last2=Andreas|first2=Edgar L|last3=Anguelova|first3=Magdalena D.|last4=Fairall|first4=C. W.|last5=Lewis|first5=Ernie R.|last6=O'Dowd|first6=Colin|last7=Schulz|first7=Michael|last8=Schwartz|first8=Stephen E.|date=2011-05-07|title=Production flux of sea spray aerosol|url=https://doi.org/10.1029/2010RG000349|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|doi=10.1029/2010rg000349|issn=8755-1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The only other production mechanism of sea spray in the open ocean is through direct wind action, where strong winds actually break the surface tension of the water and lift particles into the air &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. However, particles of seawater generated in this way are often too heavy to remain suspended in the atmosphere and usually are deposited back to the sea within a few dozen meters of transport &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

===Temporal variation ===
During winter months, the ocean typically experiences stormy, windy conditions that generate more air inundation into the sea and therefore more sea spray &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Dowd|first=Colin D.|last2=Langmann|first2=Baerbel|last3=Varghese|first3=Saji|last4=Scannell|first4=Claire|last5=Ceburnis|first5=Darius|last6=Facchini|first6=Maria Cristina|date=2008-01-01|title=A combined organic-inorganic sea-spray source function|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007GL030331|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|doi=10.1029/2007gl030331|issn=0094-8276}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Calmer summer months result in lower overall production of sea spray &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. During peak [[Primary production|primary productivity]] in the summer, increased organic matter in the surface ocean drives subsequent increases in sea spray. Given that sea spray retains the properties of the water from which it was produced, the composition of sea spray experiences extreme seasonal variation. During the summer, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can constitute 60-90% of sea spray mass &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Even though much more sea spray is produced during the stormy winter season, the composition is nearly all salt because of the low primary production &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

=== Organic matter ===
The organic matter in sea spray consists of [[Dissolved organic matter|dissolved organic carbon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=L.M.|last2=Hawkins|first2=L.N.|last3=Frossard|first3=A.A.|last4=Quinn|first4=P.K.|last5=Bates|first5=T.S.|date=2010|title=Carbohydrate-like composition of submicron atmospheric particles and their production from ocean bubble bursting|journal=Proc.

Biomass often enters sea spray through the death and [[lysis]] of algal cells, often caused by [[Viral Infections|viral infections]] &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Cells are broken apart into DOC that is propelled into the atmosphere when surface bubbles pop. When primary productivity peaks during the summer, [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]] can generate an enormous amount of organic matter that is eventually incorporated into sea spray &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. In the right conditions, aggregation of the DOC can also form [[surfactant]] or [[sea foam]].

[[Chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll-a]], which is used as a proxy for [[primary production]] in the [[photic zone]] of the ocean, is viewed by some researchers as a way to approximate the amount of organic matter present in sea spray. However, one study suggests that measurements of Chlorophyll-a and organic matter content in sea spray are only weakly correlated and that Chlorophyll-a is not an adequate proxy &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

== Climate interactions ==
At high winds the droplet evaporation layer (DEL) influences the surface energy heat exchange of the ocean &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreas|first=Edgar L|last2=Edson|first2=James B.|last3=Monahan|first3=Edward C.|last4=Rouault|first4=Mathieu P.|last5=Smith|first5=Stuart D.|title=The spray contribution to net evaporation from the sea: A review of recent progress|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00712389#citeas|journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|language=en|volume=72|issue=1-2|doi=10.1007/bf00712389#citeas|issn=0006-8314}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[latent heat flux]] of sea spray generated at the DEL has been cited as an important addition to climate modeling efforts, particularly in simulations assessing air/sea heat balance as related to hurricanes and cyclones formed during high wind events &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreas|first=Edgar L|date=1992|title=Sea Spray and the Turbulent Air-Sea Heat Fluxes|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/92JC00876|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|language=en|volume=97|issue=C7|pages=11429–11441|doi=10.1029/92jc00876|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the formation of whitecaps, sea spray droplets exhibit the same properties as the ocean surface, but rapidly adapt to surrounding air. Some sea spray droplets immediately reabsorb into the sea while others evaporate entirely and contribute salt particles like [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) to the atmosphere where they can be transported via turbulence to cloud layers and serve as CCN  &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prather|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Bertram|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Grassian|first3=Vicki H.|last4=Deane|first4=Grant B.|last5=Stokes|first5=M.

The formation of these CCN like DMS have climate implications as well, due to their influence on cloud formation and interaction with solar radiation &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Additionally, the contribution of sea spray DMS to the atmosphere is linked to the global [[sulfur cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eriksson|first=Erik|date=1963-07-01|title=The yearly circulation of sulfur in nature|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/JZ068i013p04001|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|language=en|volume=68|issue=13|pages=4001–4008|doi=10.1029/jz068i013p04001|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Understanding total forcing from natural sources like sea spray can illuminate critical constraints posed by [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]] influence and can be coupled with ocean chemistry, biology and physics to predict future ocean and atmospheric variability &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;.

The proportion of organic matter in sea spray can impact [[reflectance]], determine the overall cooling effect of SSAs &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, and slightly alter the capacity for SSAs to form CCN (17). Even small changes in SSA levels can affect the global radiation budget leading to implications for global climate &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. SSA has a low [[albedo]], but its presence overlaid on the darker ocean surface affects absorption and reflectance of incoming solar radiation &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

=== Enthalpy flux ===
The influence of sea spray on the surface heat and moisture exchange peaks during times of greatest difference between air and sea temperatures &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. When air temperature is low, sea spray [[sensible heat flux]] can be nearly as great as the spray latent heat flux at high latitudes &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. In addition, sea spray enhances the air/sea enthalpy flux during high winds as a result of temperature and humidity redistribution in the [[Surface layer|marine boundary layer]] &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058%3C3741:EOSSOT%3E2.0.CO;2|url=https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058%3C3741:EOSSOT%3E2.0.CO;2|language=en|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058%3C3741:eossot%3E2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sea spray droplets injected into the air thermally equilibrate ~1% of their mass. This leads to the addition of sensible heat prior to ocean reentry, enhancing their potential for significant enthalpy input &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;.

===Dynamic effects===
The effects of sea spray transport in the [[atmospheric boundary layer]] is not yet completely understood'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''. Sea spray droplets alter the air-sea momentum fluxes by being accelerated and decelerated by the winds'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''. In hurricane-force winds, it is observed that there is some reduction in the air/sea momentum flux'' &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''. This reduction in momentum flux manifests as saturation of air/sea [[drag coefficient]]. Some studies have identified spray effects as one of the potential reasons for the air/sea drag coefficient saturation &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Michael M.|last2=Montgomery|first2=Michael T.|last3=Emanuel|first3=Kerry A.|date=2012-11|title=Air–Sea Enthalpy and Momentum Exchange at Major Hurricane Wind Speeds Observed during CBLAST|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/jas-d-11-0276.1|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|volume=69|issue=11|pages=3197–3222|doi=10.1175/jas-d-11-0276.1|issn=0022-4928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donelan|first=M.

== Ecology ==
=== Coastal ecosystems ===
Salt deposition from sea spray is the primary factor influencing distribution of plant communities in coastal ecosystems &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MALLOCH|first=A. J. C.|date=1971-11|title=VEGETATION OF THE MARITIME CLIFF-TOPS OF THE LIZARD AND LAND'S END PENINSULAS, WEST CORNWALL|url=https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1971.tb04597.x|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1155–1197|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1971.tb04597.x|issn=0028-646X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ion concentrations of sea spray deposited on land generally mirror their concentrations in the ocean, except that potassium is often higher in sea spray &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malloch|first=A. J. C.|date=1972|title=Salt-Spray Deposition on the Maritime Cliffs of the Lizard Peninsula|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2258044|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=60|issue=1|pages=103–112|doi=10.2307/2258044}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Deposition of salts on land generally decreases with distance from the ocean but increases with increasing wind speed  &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Salt deposition from sea spray is correlated with a decrease in plant height and significant scarring, shoot reduction, stem height decrease, and tissue death on the windward side of shrubs and trees &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=F. B.|date=1973|title=The Vegetation of Exposed Sea Cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental Studies|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2258652|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=61|issue=3|pages=819–829|doi=10.2307/2258652}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/23928269|title=Some aspects of the vegetation of sea cliffs|last=B.|first=Goldsmith, F.|date=1967|oclc=23928269}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Variation in salt deposition also influences competition between plants and establishes gradients of salt tolerance &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;.

While the salts within sea spray can severely inhibit plant growth in coastal ecosystems, selecting for salt-tolerant species, sea spray can also bring vital nutrients to these habitats. For example, one study showed that sea spray in Wales, UK delivers roughly 32 kg of potassium per hectare to coastal sand dunes each year &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Because dune soils leach nutrients very quickly, sea spray fertilization could be very influential to dune ecosystems, especially for plants that are less competitive in nutrient-limited environments.

[[File:Ocean mist and spray 2.jpg|thumb|left| Sea spray containing [[marine microorganism]]s can be swept high into the atmosphere. These airborne microorganisms may travel the globe before falling back to earth.]]

=== Microbial communities ===
Viruses, bacteria, and plankton are ubiquitous in sea water, and this biodiversity is reflected in the composition of sea spray &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  Generally speaking, sea spray has slightly lower concentrations of microbes than the water it is produced from. However, the microbial community in sea spray is often distinct from nearby water and sandy beaches, suggesting that some species are more biased towards SSA transportation than others. Sea spray from one beach can contain thousands of [[Operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic units]] (OTUs)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Nearly 10,000 different OTUs have been discovered in sea spray just between San Francisco, CA and Monterey, CA, with only 11% of them found ubiquitously &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. This suggests that sea spray in every coastal region likely has its own unique assemblage of microbial diversity, with thousands of new OTUs yet to be discovered. Many of the more common OTUs have been identified to the following taxa: Cryptophyta (order), Stramenopiles (order) and OM60 (family)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Many have even been identified to genus: Persicirhabdus, Fluviicola, Synecococcus, Vibrio, and Enterococcus &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

Scientists have conjectured a stream of airborne microorganisms circles the planet above weather systems but below commercial air lanes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/living-bacteria-are-riding-earths-air-currents-180957734/ Living Bacteria Are Riding Earth’s Air Currents] ''Smithsonian Magazine'', 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these peripatetic microorganisms are swept up from terrestrial dust storms, but most originate from the marine microorganisms in sea spray. In 2018 a team of scientists reported that hundreds of millions of viruses and tens of millions of bacteria are deposited daily on every square meter around the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robbins |first=Jim |title=Trillions Upon Trillions of Viruses Fall From the Sky Each Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/science/virosphere-evolution.html |date=13 April 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISME-2018"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reche |first1=Isabel |last2=D’Orta |first2=Gaetano |last3=Mladenov |first3=Natalie |last4=Winget |first4= Danielle M |last5=Suttle |first5= Curtis A |title=Deposition rates of viruses and bacteria above the atmospheric boundary layer |journal=ISME Journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-017-0042-4.epdf |date=29 January 2018 |doi=10.1038/s41396-017-0042-4 |accessdate=14 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical resistance ==
Sea spray is largely responsible for [[corrosion]] of metallic objects near the coastline, as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric [[oxygen]] and moisture&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schindelholz|first=E.|last2=Risteen|first2=B.

Salts do not dissolve in air directly, but are suspended as fine [[particulates]], or dissolved in microscopic airborne water droplets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Duncan C.|last2=Woodcock|first2=Alfred H.|date=1980-05|title=THE PRODUCTION, CONCENTRATION, AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEA-SALT AEROSOL|url=https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1980.tb17130.x|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=338|issue=1 Aerosols|pages=330–347|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1980.tb17130.x|issn=0077-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[salt spray test]] is a measure of material endurance or resistance to corrosion, particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a [[Bearing (mechanical)|mechanical load bearing]] or otherwise critical role. These results are often of great interest to [[Marine industry|marine industries]], whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to salt water exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-10-01|title=Corrosion resistance of sintered duplex stainless steels in the salt fog spray test|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013607003718|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|language=en|volume=192-193|pages=443–448|doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.04.077|issn=0924-0136}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Through '''sexing''', [[biologist]]s and [[agricultural]] workers determine the [[mian]] of [[livestock]] and other animals they work with. The specialized trade of [[chicken sexing]] has a particular importance in the [[poultry]] industry.

Assisted physical sexing is a relevant issue in vertebrates with cloacae (e.g. [[birds]], [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]]) when there is no external [[sexual dimorphism]]. In veterinary practice, [[Fiberscope|fibroscopy]] is used under [[general anaesthesia]] in birds such as [[parrots]].

'''Molecular sexing''' is a set of techniques that use [[DNA]] for determining sex in wild or domestic species (population studies, farming, genetics) or humans (archaeology, forensic medicine). Markers commonly used include [[amelogenin]], [[SRY]] and [[ZFX]]/[[ZFY]]. Various techniques have been developed using simple [[polymerase chain reaction]] product size [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]], presence/absence, [[Restriction enzyme|restriction]] dimorphism, or even sequencing.

[[Image:Beta Lyrae Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The [[Beta Lyrae]] binary in the sky of an airless planet, after the painting by Chesley Bonestell.]]'''''The Conquest of Space''''' is a [[1949 in literature|1949]] speculative [[science]] book written by [[Willy Ley]] and illustrated by [[Chesley Bonestell]]. The book contains a portfolio of [[painting]]s by Bonestell depicting the possible future exploration of the [[solar system]], with explanatory text by Ley.

Of the 58 illustrations by Bonestell in ''Conquest'', most had been published previously, in color, in magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collectspace.com/resources/spaceart_bonestellcolordex.html "Bonestell Color Illustrations Index."] ''collectspace.com''. Retrieved: January 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on fiction==
*Some of Bonestell's designs inspired the look of [[George Pal]]'s [[1955 in film|1955]] [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Conquest of Space]]'', which also takes its title from the book, but uses it as a framework on which to hang a [[melodrama]]tic plot. 
*Bonestell's illustrations of the [[Moon]] in ''The Conquest of Space'' were used by [[Hergé]] as a basis for his illustrations of the lunar surface in his 1952-53 ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1539/1 A comic book, the Cold War, and the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]] was also an admirer of ''The Conquest of Space''; in his novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Clarke refers to Saturn's moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] as "Japetus" due to that being the spelling used by Ley in ''The Conquest of Space''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke]], ''[[The Lost Worlds of 2001]]'', pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Larry Niven]]'s 1967 short story "[[The Soft Weapon]]" is set on a planet around [[Beta Lyrae]]; Niven's description of Beta Lyrae is actually a meticulous retelling of the details of Bonestell's painting rather than any kind of portrayal of the Beta Lyrae system itself, which is now understood to look [[Binary star#Configuration of the system|quite different]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Larry Niven#Known Space|Neutron Star]] |last=Niven |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Niven |date=1968 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Red Wall: A Woman in the RCMP''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book, written by [[Canadian writer]] Jane Hall, first published in July 2007 by General Store Publishing. In the book, the author chronicles her personal experiences as the first woman accepted in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP). Hall recalls that ever since becoming a Mountie in 1977, people have asked her "What it was like"? Hall says she always avoided answering the question because she knew the story couldn't be told with a few sentences. The book's 351 pages are apparently sufficient as the book has been well received for its historical significance. Hall says of her book, "It was time to break the silence; time to acknowledge our successes and our failures. Time to move forward."&lt;ref&gt;General Store Publishing, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://gsph.indelta.ca/index.php?ID=477&amp;Lang=En ''The Red Wall'']&lt;/span&gt;, Retrieved 11/23/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hall spent eight years writing her manuscript, and another two years copy-editing her work before presenting it for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Open Book Toronto, December 5, 2007, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.openbooktoronto.com/news/10_questions_with_jane_hall 10 Questions With Jane Hall]&lt;/span&gt;, Home - News, Retrieved 11/23/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Theory of Interstellar Trade'''''&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul (1978), [http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf "The Theory of Interstellar Trade"], July 1978&lt;/ref&gt; is a paper written in 1978 by the [[economist]] [[Paul Krugman]]. The paper was first published in March 2010 in the journal ''[[Economic Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman]]. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00225.x/full "The Theory of Interstellar Trade"], ''[[Economic Inquiry]]'', March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the paper as something he wrote to cheer himself up when he was an "oppressed assistant professor" caught up in the academic [[rat race]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/economics-the-final-frontier/ "Economics: the final frontier"], ''The New York Times'', March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman analyzed the question of
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
How should interest rates on goods in transit be computed when the goods travel at close to the speed of light? This is a problem because the time taken in transit will appear less to an observer traveling with the goods than to a stationary observer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krugman emphasized that in spite of its farcical subject matter, the economic analysis in the paper is correctly done. In his own words,
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
while the subject of this paper is silly, the analysis actually does make sense. This paper, then, is a serious analysis of a ridiculous subject, which is of course the opposite of what is usual in economics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==
Responding to the paper, the economist [[Tyler Cowen]] speculated on how [[time travel]] affects [[time preference]] discounting.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Cowen, [http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/03/the-theory-of-i.html "The theory of interstellar trade"], Marginal Revolution, March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
My own puzzling focuses on the determinants of real interest rates, given how time dilation changes the meaning of time preference.  As you approach the speed of light you move into the future relative to more stationary observers.  So can you not leave a penny in a savings account, take a very rapid spaceflight, and come back to earth "many years later" as a billionaire?  Hardly any time has passed for you.  In essence we are abolishing time preference, or at least allowing people to lower their time preference by spending money on fuel.  I believe that in such worlds the real interest rate cannot exceed the costs at which more fuel can "propel you into the future through time dilation."
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Assume you have a spaceship that can approach lightspeed and thus you can make, say 1,000 years, seem like 10 years. If you can gain the [[time value of money]] 100 times faster, that effectively makes the interest rate 100x higher for you. Thus time preference is meaningless. This is a problem for economic theory. Krugman's solution is to force the interest rate to correspond to the cost of making the trip.

Here is the standard compound interest formula:
: FV = PV(1+i)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;

Fuel costs for the above trip are $X. Let us say you have $1,000 to invest and wonder whether it is worth taking a near-lightspeed voyage to increase your return 10 subjective years from now.

Stay on earth:
: A = $1000(1 + i)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
Take trip:
: B = ($1000(1 + i)&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt;) – $X

Krugman says that it is necessarily true that A=B, for time preference theory to stay consistent; thus it will be driven by X. In the future, given a free market, spaceship fuel costs will be the primary determinant of interest rates. The less the fuel cost, the less the interest rate, and vice versa.

==Related theories and publications==
In 2004, Espen Gaarder Haug published a theory he titled "SpaceTime-Finance" in ''[[Wilmott Magazine|Wilmott]]'' magazine to show how a series of finance calculations had to be adjusted to avoid [[arbitrage]] when hypothetically traveling at very high velocities relative to other observers (traders). He illustrated how such necessary adjustments already could be measurable at the speed of the space shuttle, but also that such calculations and adjustments were of little or no practical relevance today since we all are moving at the nearly same speed relative to the enormous speed of light.

In 2008, [[John Hickman (professor)|John Hickman]] at [[Berry College]] in Georgia (USA) published in the ''[[Journal of Astro Politics]]'' an article related to the political and cultural obstacles that could be related to hypothetical interstellar trade.  A 2009 article explored tax implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=Chodorow|title=Tax in the Final Frontier: A Theory of Interstellar Tax|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=8 December 2009|ssrn=1520413|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution''''' is a treatise by [[Austrian School|Austrian school]] economist and philosopher [[Ludwig von Mises]]. It can be thought of as a continuation in the development of the Misesian system of social science. In particular, it provides further [[epistemology|epistemological]] support for his earlier works, esp. [[Human Action]]. Most notably, Mises elaborates on [[methodological dualism]], develops the concept of [[thymology]] – a historical branch of the sciences of human action – and presents his critique of Marxist [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]].

Furthermore, Mises puts forward a theory of knowledge and value. He later explores and critically analyzes paradigms of thought like [[determinism]], [[materialism]], [[dialectic materialism]], [[historicism]], [[scientism]], [[positivism]], [[behaviorism]] and [[psychology]]. He argues that these schools of thought – some politically motivated,&lt;ref&gt;Mises. (1957). ''Theory and history'', pp. 26, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; others blinded by dogmatism&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 30, 77, 111, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; – have committed epistemological and methodological blunders and are not conducive to a scientific understanding of human behavior.

Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] considered ''Theory and History'' to be Mises's most overlooked work.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. xi-xix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Mises presents the book in four parts.

'''Introduction and Part One – Value:'''

The first part sets the overall theme of the book with Mises introducing the concept of [[methodological dualism]]. He then expounds a theory of value that is central throughout. Regarding his view on science – as systematic body of knowledge, of both natural and social phenomena – as a means to successful action in the world, Mises argues that in order to properly understand human behavior we must attribute – as a methodological resort – [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[Teleology|purpose]] to human behaviour. Mises considers this the epistemological and methodological basis of the sciences of human action. The branch that deals with the logical implications of action as such is called [[praxeology]].

'''Part Two – Determinism and Materialism:'''

In the second part, Mises weighs in on the [[free will]] vs. [[determinism]] controversy and comments that the long historical debates did little to settle the problems at hand. He argues that while the natural sciences, in discovering scientific laws, must presuppose a strict regularity in the occurrence of causes and effects, i.e. determinism, such a presupposition cannot be held in the case of human action. He argues further that the social sciences must take [[thought]]s, [[idea]]s, and [[value judgment|judgments of value]] as ultimately given in the analysis of human action. Our ignorance of the origins and causes of these phenomena, Mises argues, forces us – at least for the time being – to adopt a dualistic approach. He contends that attempts to find the origins and causes of these phenomena are vain, as is the task of all varieties of materialism.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Mises then turns his attention to the doctrine of materialism, more specifically, that of Marxist dialectical materialism.

'''Part Three – Epistemological Problems of History:'''

The third part deals with the logical and epistemological problems of historical analysis. Mises explains the individualistic character of historical human events. He argues that the historian must ultimately face – when tracing back the causal factors behind past human action – a point at which no further reduction is possible, i.e. the ideas and actions of individuals. This, he claims, is the "ultimate given of history".&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 183–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the individuality of historical events, Mises still insists there are general laws of human behaviour but that they are praxeological laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], not historical laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]. However, [[historicism]], according to Mises, claimed there were no general laws – especially economic laws – of human behavior. Mises then enters into a critique of historicism.

Mises also addresses the challenges of scientism in the context of social science, namely the application of positivism and behaviorism in the realm of human action. However, more noteworthy is Mises's presentation of [[thymology]], a historical branch of the sciences of human action. Mises argues that thymology is what everybody resorts to when trying to [[Verstehen|''understand'']] and anticipate the historical and future actions of their fellow men, and is particularly useful to the historian. He then expounds the scope of thymology and its relation to praxeology.

'''Part Four – The Course of History:'''

In the final part of his treatise, Mises dissects and critiques various speculations and interpretations of history, including a common interpretation of modern [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He also comments on his observation regarding society's move away from [[classical liberalism]], freedom, and capitalism towards socialism and totalitarianism. Moreover, Mises notes the rising ideology of wealth and income equality and speculates on its origins. He argues that rising anti-capitalistic ideology is fostering a present trend toward the impoverishment of society. He criticizes the notion of society's inevitable "trend toward progress",&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 367-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that the evolution of society and civilization is predicated – not on an automatic and inevitable path – but on the underlying ideology which can, at any time, change. To this point, Mises closes with some remarks on the uncertainty of the future and the neglect of ideological factors that can give rise to civilization but also stamp it out.

'''WISE J014656.66+423410.0''' (designation abbreviated to '''WISE 0146+4234''') is a binary [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]]es T9 and Y0&lt;ref name="Dupuy2015"/&gt; located in the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. It is approximately 60 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Leggett2017"/&gt;.

==Discovery==
'''WISE 0146+4234''' was discovered in 2012 by [[J. Davy Kirkpatrick]] et al. from data, collected by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)]] [[Earth-orbit]]ing [[satellite]] — [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[infrared|infrared-wavelength]] 40 [[centimeter|cm]] (16 [[inch|in]]) [[space observatory|space telescope]], which mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. In 2012 Kirkpatrick et al. published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal]], where they presented discovery of seven new found by WISE [[brown dwarf]]s of [[spectral type]] Y, among which also was WISE 0146+4234.{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Distance==
The distance of WISE 0146+4234 was initially estimated to be 20 [[light-year]]s from earth.{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} Later measurements of its [[stellar parallax]] showed that it was actually 60 light-years away.&lt;ref name="Leggett2017"/&gt;

'''WOSTEP''', the '''Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program''', is an internationally recognized professional qualification in the maintenance and care of fine-quality [[watch]]es. It was devised by the Centre Suisse de Formation et de Perfectionnement Horloger and is sponsored by manufacturers and retailers within the [[horology|horological]] industry in [[Switzerland]].

==Origin==

During the 1960s, and at the request of the U.S. Government, the Swiss government created what would eventually evolve into WOSTEP- [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH]]. It was originally designed to train American watchmakers in techniques of watchmaking that developed in [[Geneva]] and the [[Jura mountains]] as from the 16th Century.

It is important to understand that at the time of the founding of Wostep, America was losing its title as "world's largest watch producer" to the Soviet Union (mostly making poor-quality everyday watches). As American watch companies continued to slide into oblivion after the end of World War II, some were able to update by purchasing movements from Swiss companies, even establishing their own subsidiaries in Switzerland (e.g. [[Waltham Watch Company]], [[Hamilton Watch Company]], [[Benrus]], [[Bulova]]), to keep them going another 10–20 years before folding completely in the U.S. It was this reason that the U.S. requested some sort of formalized training for its best watchmakers.

There had always been relatively small imports of ultra-fine Swiss watches, but post World War II the number of watches imported either as partial or complete watches grew exponentially. These "modern" watch movements were decidedly different from the American companies' products, which grew out of 100 years of manufacturing (starting mass production of quality watches). American manufacturers were not able to develop new products and new methods to compete and were destroyed in record time.

==Worldwide training programs==

The Federation developed an 11-month training program in which a watchmaker was flown to [[Neuchâtel]], Switzerland, and trained by any one of many talented instructors that worked at WOSTEP over the years.

Recent changes in structure have assured the survival of WOSTEP as a foundation with a beautiful lakefront chateau converted to the school building. With the retirement of long-time director [[Antoine Simonin]] and his wife, the next generation has taken the reins and continues to develop courses for full training used throughout the world at their '''WOSTEP-Partnership Schools'''. The school also provides a variety of industry-specific training to companies and practicing watchmakers.

'''Yorick''' is an [[Interpreted language|interpreted]] [[programming language]] designed for [[numerics]], [[graph of a function|graph]] plotting, and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to [[Array data structure|array]] syntax, and extensible via [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]] routines. It was created in 1996 by [[David H. Munro]] of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

== Features ==
=== Indexing ===
Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax.

Several elements can be accessed all at once:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
&gt; x
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
&gt; x(3:6)
[3,4,5,6]
&gt; x(3:6:2)
[3,5]
&gt; x(6:3:-2)
[6,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

;Arbitrary elements

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x([2,1],[1,2])
[[2,1],[5,4]]
&gt; list=where(1&lt;x)
&gt; list
[2,3,4,5,6]
&gt; y=x(list)
&gt; y
[2,3,4,5,6]
&lt;/source&gt;

;Pseudo-index

Like "theading" in [[Perl Data Language|PDL]] (Perl Data Language) and "broadcasting" in [[Numpy]] (Numeric extension for Python), Yorick has a mechanism to do this:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x=[1,2,3]
&gt; x
[1,2,3]
&gt; y=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; y
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; y(-,)
[[[1],[2],[3]],[[4],[5],[6]]]
&gt; x(-,)
[[1],[2],[3]]
&gt; x(,-)
[[1,2,3]]
&gt; x(,-)/y
[[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
&gt; y=[[1.,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x(,-)/y
[[1,1,1],[0.25,0.4,0.5]]
&lt;/source&gt;

;Rubber index

".." is  a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array.

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x(..,1)
[1,2,3]
&gt; x(1,..)
[1,4]
&gt; x(2,..,2)
5
&lt;/source&gt;

"*" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector.

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x(*)
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
&lt;/source&gt;

;Tensor multiplication

[[Tensor]] multiplication is done as follows in Yorick:

 P(,+, )*Q(, +)

means &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{j=N}{P_{ijkl}Q_{mnj}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
&gt; x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; x
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt; y=[[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]]
&gt; x(,+)*y(+,)
[[39,54,69],[49,68,87],[59,82,105]]
&gt; x(+,)*y(,+)
[[58,139],[64,154]]
&lt;/source&gt;
