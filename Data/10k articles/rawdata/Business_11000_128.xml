'''Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;/small&gt; (18 October 1863 – 19 February 1930) was a Scottish consulting [[electrical engineer]], who provided the theoretical basis for the electronic [[television]], two decades before the technology existed to implement it.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"&gt;Oakes, Elizabeth (2009), ''A to Z of STS Scientists''. Infobase publishing, pp. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He began experimenting around 1903 with the use of cathode ray tubes for the electronic transmission and reception of images.&lt;ref name="Burns-Swinton"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell described the theoretical basis for an all electronic method of producing television in a 1908 letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. Campbell-Swinton's concept was central to the cathode ray television because of his proposed modification of the cathode ray tube that allowed its use as both a transmitter and receiver of light.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"/&gt; The cathode-ray tube was the system of electronic television that was subsequently developed in later years, as technology caught up with Campbell-Swinton's initial ideas. Other inventors would use Campbell-Swinton's ideas, as a starting-point to realise the cathode ray tube television as the standard, workable form of all electronic television that it became for decades after his death. It is generally considered that the original credit for the successful theoretical conception of using a cathode ray tube device for imaging should belong to Campbell-Swinton.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidsarnoff.org/rcatechtv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the son of advocate [[Archibald Campbell Swinton]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alan_Archibald_Campbell_Swinton&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell-Swinton was educated at [[Cargilfield Trinity School]] and [[Fettes College]] (1878–1881).&lt;ref name="bibiography"&gt;

He was one of the first to explore the medical applications of [[radiography]], opening the first radiographic laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1896. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1915. He is better known by his work on the electronic television. He discovered the phenomenon known as ''[[Video camera tube#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|magnetic focusing]]'' in 1896, he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam.&lt;ref name="Swinton_ESMF"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell-Swinton wrote a letter in response to an article in the 4 June 1908 issue of [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] by [[Shelford Bidwell]] entitled "Telegraphic Photography and Electric Vision". Even as early as 1908, it was recognised that "The final, insurmountable problems with any form of mechanical scanning were the limited number of scans per second, which produced a flickering image, and the relatively large size of each hole in the disk, which resulted in poor resolution".

&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the 18 June 1908 issue of ''Nature''. The name of the article is "Distant Electric Vision". He wrote: "This part of the problem of obtaining distant electric vision can probably be solved by the employment of two beams of cathode rays (one at the transmitting and one at the receiving station) synchronously deflected by the varying fields of two electromagnets placed at right angles to one another and energised by two alternating electric currents of widely different frequencies, so that the moving extremities of the two beams are caused to sweep simultaneously over the whole of the required surface within the one-tenth of a second necessary to take advantage of visual persistence. Indeed, so far as the receiving apparatus is concerned, the moving cathode beam has only to be arranged to impinge on a suitably sensitive fluorescent screen, and given suitable variations in its intensity, to obtain the desired result."&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave a speech in London in 1911 where he described in great detail how distant electric vision could be achieved. This was to be done by using [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes.&lt;ref name="Swinton-Rontgen1"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first iteration of the electronic television which is still in use today. When Swinton gave his speech others had already been experimenting with the use of cathode ray tubes as a receiver, but the use of the technology as a transmitter was unheard of. His concept for a fully electronic television system was later popularised by Hugo Gernsback as the ''"Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System"'' in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine ''Electrical Experimenter''.&lt;ref name="Swinton-Watson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 he once again described his system in his presidential address to the Roentgen Ray Society and in 1921 a book was published describing it in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw9IAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=the+electrical+transmission+of+photographs&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sYzqt9XXen&amp;sig=5ijTnMlLo2Ndo9p202p6suHGY8s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C_dpSv-AD5Gutgf77rW_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''The Electrical Transmission of Photographs'' by Marcus J Martin; Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, New York, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; He himself described his system seven years later in the June 1928 issue of ''[[Modern Wireless]]'', "Television by Cathode Rays". 
:''"Surely it would be better policy if those who can afford the time and money would abandon mechanical devices and expend their labours in what appears likely to prove the ultimately more promising method in which the only moving parts are imponderable electrons."''

In a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some "not very successful experiments" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a [[Cathode ray|cathode ray beam]].&lt;ref name="Burns-Swinton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swinton_ET1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide,&lt;ref name="Miller-Strange"/&gt; or with aluminium or zirconium oxide treated with caesium.&lt;ref name="Iams-Rose-1937"/&gt; These experiments are the base of the future [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|vidicon]].

Alongside his research into the electrical transmission of images, Campbell-Swinton also worked in voice telephony, founding the short-lived [[Equitable Telephone Association]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;

'''Alcon''' is swiss global [[medical]] company specializing in eye care products and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].  Alcon's American headquarters are located in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Alcon is a subsidiary of [[Novartis]] although the company announced intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business in order to create an independent company in 2019.&lt;ref name="novartis.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/content/new-alcon|title=Novartis announces intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business|work=Alcon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alcon was founded in 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/about-us/who-we-are/history|title= Improving Vision through Innovation Since 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], USA.  The company started as a small [[pharmacy]] in Fort Worth and was named for its founders, [[pharmacist]]s Robert Alexander and William Conner.  Conner and Alexander focused on [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] products.

[[Nestlé]] of [[Switzerland]] purchased Alcon in 1977.  Alcon expanded its manufacturing capability with new plants in South America and Europe and drastically increased its investment in research.  In 1979, Alcon acquired Texas Pharmacal Company which became Dermatological Products of Texas (and is now [[DPT Laboratories]]). In 1984, Alcon founded the Technical Excellence Award to promote achievements in R&amp;D excellence and has awarded it to more than 100 recipients. The Alcon product line has expanded from [[pharmaceuticals]] to the surgical arena. Today, Alcon has operations in 75 countries and their products are sold in over 180 countries.

[[Nestlé]] conducted an initial public offering of 25% of its stake in Alcon in 2002. The stock is traded under the [[ticker symbol]] ACL. In July 2008, Novartis purchased approximately 25% of Nestlé's stake in Alcon, with an option to buy Nestlé's remaining shares beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.reuters.com/r/SCXS8/P81DY/JIQCHE/H9SK4/IOW2A/YT/h Reuters - Novartis announces offer to buy Nestlé's shares in Alcon] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis bought 52% stake from Nestlé for $28.1 Billion. This deal brought the total ownership of Novartis to 77%. Beginning January 2010 Novartis formally announced it will be completing the exercise options for finishing purchasing the rest of Alcon and then promptly continue to exercise merger and takeover of Alcon.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/content/new-alcon|title=Novartis announces intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business|work=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 2010, Alcon acquired Durezol and Zyclorin from Sirion Therapeutics.

On June 28, 2010, Alcon's Independent Director Committee announced that a recommendation by the Committee was an indispensable first step before the board of the company can decide on the merger proposal of [[Novartis AG]], refuted Novartis’ public implications that it would be able to unilaterally impose the merger irrespective of the Independent Director Committee’s position once Novartis became Alcon’s majority shareholder. On July 8, 2010, Alcon's independent director committee (IDC) had set up a $50 million litigation trust to ensure company's minority shareholders get the best deal from bidder Novartis AG.&lt;ref name="ceoworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |title=Alcon (ACL) Sets up trust for litigation between with Novartis to protect minorities |work=The Chief Executive Forum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710193111/http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |archivedate=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alona Barkat''' ({{lang-he-n|אלונה ברקת}}; born 24 June 1969) is an Israeli [[Businessperson|businesswoman]], and owner of the [[Association football|football]] team [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Beer Sheva]].

==Biography==
Barkat was born and raised in [[Ashkelon]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/A-victory-for-social-change-457475 A victory for social change - ''The Jerusalem Post''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14 she moved to [[Jerusalem]] to {{what|study [[atelier]]|date=January 2018}}. Four years later she returned to national service in her hometown. She then studied at [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/hapoel-beersheva-becomes-israel-s-leicester-city-1.57639 "Hapoel Beersheva becomes Israel's Leicester City"]&lt;/ref&gt; performing undergraduate and graduate studies in the history of the [[Middle East]]. During her studies she met Eli Barkat,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; then a student in Mathematics and Computer Science, and the two married.

In 1996 she moved to [[Silicon Valley]] in the United States with her husband, who became a businessman with his brother [[Nir Barkat]]. He was an early investor in [[Check Point]] and set up the [[venture capital]] fund BRM and IVN. In the eight years in which the family lived in the United States, Barkat started in the field of philanthropy. Among other things, the fund management company IVN also funded social projects, and has been active in organizations such as [[AIPAC]] and the [[Jewish Federation]] of [[San Francisco]].

In 2004, she moved back to Israel with her family. Relations with the businessman Lonnie Herzikovic, then-owner of the football team [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], led her to consider entering a partnership with Maccabi Tel Aviv. She was involved in establishing a research institute at the [[University of Tel Aviv]], together with the Rashi Foundation, where she met [[Eli Alaluf]], CEO of the Fund at the time. Alaluf convinced her to buy the football team [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Beer Sheva]], which played in the second division at the time.

In the summer of 2007, just weeks before the opening of the season, the acquisition of the group from the previous owner, Eli Zino, was completed. Barkat became the first woman in Israel to own a football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{cite web|title=Obstacles have been removed, Alona Barkat Hapoel Be'er Sheva acquired|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3421188,00.html|website=Ynet|accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barkat's management team put special emphasis on a youth department, educational activities, and community connection. In March 2010, the group announced their departure at the end of the season, after a number of fans of the group tried to attack the coach, [[Guy Azouri]]. Two months later, after seeing a dramatic improvement in fan behavior, she announced that she had changed her mind and that she intended to stay with the group.

In May 2016 the team won the [[2015–16 Israeli Premier League|Football League Championship]] in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{cite web|title=After 40 years: Hapoel Beer Sheva has won the state championship with a 1-3 for Bnei Sakhnin|url=http://sports.walla.co.il/item/2963216|website=WallaSport|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkat lives with her husband and three children in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.

'''Benjamin Harrison V''' (April 5, 1726{{spaced ndash}}April 24, 1791), from [[Charles City County, Virginia]], was an American planter and merchant, a [[American Revolution|revolutionary]] leader and a [[Founding Father of the United States]]. He received his higher education at the [[College of William and Mary]]. Harrison was a representative to the [[House of Burgesses|Virginia House of Burgesses]] for [[Surry County, Virginia]] (1756–1758, 1785–1786), and Charles City County (1766–1776, 1787–1790). He was a [[Virginia]] delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1774 to 1777 and, during the [[Second Continental Congress]], was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Harrison served as Virginia's fifth governor from 1781 to 1784.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 59, 74, 79, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; His direct descendants include two [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]—his son [[William Henry Harrison|William Henry Harrison Sr.]] and great-grandson President [[Benjamin Harrison]].

==Family==
{{See also|Harrison family of Virginia}}

Harrison was the eldest child of [[Benjamin Harrison IV]] and Anne Carter, and a grandson of [[Robert Carter I]]. The first Benjamin Harrison is said to have arrived in the colonies around 1630. British historian F. A. Inderwick contends that Benjamin IV is also descended from [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], [[List of regicides of Charles I|a participant in the regicide]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], but this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin IV and Anne built the manor house at [[Berkeley Plantation]] in Virginia and he served as a Justice of the Peace and represented Charles City County in the Virginia House of Burgesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin V, one of ten children, was described in his youth as "tall and powerfully built", with "features that were clearly defined, and a well-shaped mouth above a strong pointed chin".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His next younger brother, Carter Henry, became a leader in [[Cumberland County, Virginia|Cumberland County]]; two other brothers, Henry and Robert, died young. Brother Nathaniel settled in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]], became sheriff, and was later elected to the House of Burgesses. Another brother, Henry, fought in the [[French and Indian War]] and later settled at [[Hunting Quarter]] in [[Sussex County, Virginia|Sussex County]]. The youngest brother Charles joined the [[Continental Army]] and rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berkeley plantation harrison home.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Berkeley Plantation – Harrison family homestead]]
On July 12, 1745, at the age of fifty-one, father Benjamin IV, in the midst of an afternoon thunderstorm, with daughters Hannah and Lucy a second in hand, attempted to shut an upstairs window, was struck by lightning, and he and Hannah were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], pp.157–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his father's death, Benjamin inherited the bulk, but not all, of his father's estate including the family home Berkeley and a number of surrounding plantations; he also assumed ownership and responsibility for the manor house's equipment, stock and numerous slaves. Benjamin's younger siblings inherited another six plantations, possessions and slaves, as the father chose to depart from the tradition of primogeniture (i.e. leaving the entire estate to the eldest son.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Harrison's slaves were sustained by the success of the plantations, their treatment presented a picture consistent with the period. It is known that in the division of slaves among his children, Benjamin's father specifically prohibited any splitting of slave families. The Harrisons also assumed a sense of duty to indoctrinate their slaves in Christianity. There were a number of mulattoes among the slaves Benjamin V inherited; while there is no specific information to show who fathered them, it was particularly common for younger plantation family members and guests, as well as overseers, to invade slave dwellings for carnal reasons. In this light, Benjamin IV's decision to ignore primogeniture subjected his younger children and their slaves to potentially precarious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], pp. 164—165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local politics and First Continental Congress==

Benjamin V followed his father in representing the counties of Charles City and Surry in the House of Burgesses and also served as a county justice. In 1770 Benjamin was among the first signers of an agreement among Virginia lawmakers and merchants boycotting British imports until the British Parliament repealed its taxes on tea. Harrison also joined in sponsoring a bill that declared certain laws passed by Parliament affecting Virginia to be illegal without the consent of His Majesty's subjects in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1773 the famous Boston Tea Party occurred and the British Parliament enacted punitive measures which were called by the colonies [[Intolerable Acts]]. On May 24, 1774 Harrison, along with eighty-eight other members of the Virginia Burgesses, signed a new association condemning the action of the Parliament, and agreed to invite other colonies to convene a Continental Congress. On August 5, 1774 Harrison was selected by convention as one of seven delegates to represent Virginia at the Congress. He set out that month, leaving his home state for the first time, and headed to Philadelphia, arriving there on September 2, 1774 for the First Continental Congress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Harrison gravitated to the older and more conservative of his fellow delegates in Philadelphia, and was more distant with the New Englanders and the more radical, particularly the Adams family. Though describing Harrison variously as "another Sir John Falstaff", "obscene", "profane" and "impious", [[John Adams]] in his diary also recalled Harrison as having said that he was so eager to participate in the Continental Congress "he would have come on foot." Their dislike for one another was primarily due to differences in lifestyle and personality. Adams, the lawyer, author and diplomat of Puritan heritage, generally shunned unnecessary things which brought pleasure—like lively food and drink, and a humorous tale—things which Harrison, the rural, corpulent, and exuberant planter, relished. Party factionalism also accounted for the divide; Harrison aligned with John Hancock, and Adams with Richard Henry Lee, whom Harrison had adamantly opposed in the House of Burgesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 26–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Congress, and with it first impressions, concluded the following month in October, with finalization of a [[Petition to the King]], which was signed by all delegates including Harrison, and requested the King's attention to the colonies' grievances and restoration of harmony with the crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Continental Congress and Declaration of Independence==
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' – Benjamin Harrison V is seated at the table far left]]
The Second Continental Congress, including Harrison, convened in May 1775. During the Congress he resided in a house in north Philadelphia with Peyton Randolph and George Washington. He remained there alone after Washington assumed command of the Continental Army and Randolph died. Harrison, in attendance to the session's end in July 1776, served frequently as Chairman of the [[Committee of the Whole]] in the Congress, presided over the final debates on the [[Lee Resolution|independence resolution]] offered by Virginia delegate [[Richard Henry Lee]], and presided as well over the debates and amendments to the final Declaration itself.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 24–25, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1776, Jefferson's draft including initial alterations of the Declaration of Independence was reported to Congress by the [[Committee of Five]] charged with the initial drafting.The Congress resolved on July 1 that the Declaration be considered by Harrison's Committee of the Whole.  Having further amended the Declaration on July 2 and 3, the Committee adopted the Declaration in final form on Thursday, July 4; Harrison duly reported this to the Congress, and delivered to Congress a final reading of the Declaration. The Declaration was then unanimously agreed upon and Congress resolved to have the Declaration engrossed and signed by those present, which signing took place on August 2, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was indisputably known for his sense of humor. Even detractor John Adams conceded in his diary that "Harrison's contributions and many pleasantries steadied rough sessions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while preparing to sign the Declaration, the rather rotund Harrison famously quipped to Elbridge Gerry, who had taken his place at the table to sign: "I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die in a few minutes and be with the angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary War==

Harrison would indeed soon witness the Declaration's consequences, both politically and personally. He returned to the re-convening Congress in Philadelphia in November and assumed duties required in the conduct of the war. He, along with a number of other delegates, went to Cambridge with [[George Washington]] to plan the continuing, supporting and regulating of the Continental army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison also worked closely with fellow delegates specifically for the defense of South Carolina, New York and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; His service was requested as a member of the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] for the Congress, and also as Chairman of the [[Board of War]] during the Revolution. From December 1776 until March 1777 the Congress was forced by threat from British forces to remove itself to Baltimore, a location which Harrison did not prefer. A similar relocation was again required the following fall, to Pennsylvania on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 43, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison found himself at odds with Washington over [[Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette's]] commission, which Harrison insisted was honorary only and without pay. He also created controversy in his endorsement of the rights of Quakers not to bear arms in accordance with their religion. He unsuccessfully argued, throughout the formation of the Articles of Confederation, that Virginia be given greater numerical representation than other states based on population and land mass. Harrison's Congressional membership ended in October 1777 and he returned to Virginia where he quickly renewed his efforts in the House of Burgesses, retaining the Speakership until 1780.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 45–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1781, a British force of 1,600 led by American turncoat [[Benedict Arnold]] was positioned at the mouth of the James River and Harrison was called upon to return immediately to Philadelphia and make request for military support in his state. Knowing that Berkeley was one of Arnold's primary targets, Harrison relocated his family before setting out. In Philadelphia his pleas for Virginia were heard, and he succeeded in obtaining increased gunpowder, supplies and troops, but only on a delayed basis. Meanwhile, Arnold advanced up the James, wreaking havoc on both sides of the river. Though the Harrison family avoided capture in Arnold's January raid on Berkeley, Arnold ensured that no likeness of the family then in the home would survive, intently removing and burning all family portraits. Most of Harrison's possessions, and a large portion of the house were destroyed. Other signers were similarly targeted, with more horrific consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dowdey|Dowdey]], pp. 262–64&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison took up the rehabilitation of his home, then returned to his correspondence with Washington and continued efforts to obtain armaments, troops and clothing supplies for other southern states.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Assembly, led in 1781 by Gov. Thomas Jefferson, Speaker Harrison, Thomas Nelson and others encountered difficulties and danger in government affairs similar to those previously experienced at the Congress; advancing British forces led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] harassed the Assembly. Gov. Jefferson called a special session of the Assembly in Richmond, but the British threat forced session adjournments westward, first to Charlottesville and then again further to Staunton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]]. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Virginia==

The Yorktown victory in October 1781 provided only brief respite for Harrison, then age 55, who began on November 30 to serve as the fifth [[List of Governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]] until 1784. The primary problem he confronted was money—as in other colonies, the coffers of the Virginia treasury were drained by the war and the government was plagued by creditors, both domestic and foreign. It was clear that there was no capacity for military action outside of the immediate area, so Harrison steadfastly opposed offensive action sought against Indians in the Kentucky and Illinois country. He alternatively pursued a policy of treating with the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Creek Indian tribes, which allowed peace to last, at least for the remainder of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to legislature and death==
In 1788, Harrison participated as a member of the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] for the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]]. However, being skeptical of a foreseeably large central government, Harrison, along with [[Patrick Henry]] and other men of prominence, opposed the constitution because of the absence of a [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his work in the House until he died in April 1791 when his son [[William Henry Harrison]] was 18 years old at his home Berkeley after a dinner party celebrating his final electoral success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison is the namesake of a residence hall at the [[College of William and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wm.edu/offices/residencelife/oncampus/residencehalls/upperlevel/randolph/harrison-page/index.php|title=William &amp; Mary-&amp;nbsp;Harrison &amp; Page Halls|publisher=|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Knowledge Forum is the largest forum of its kind in Asia. He also served a brief stint as South Korea's acting [[Prime Minister of South Korea|prime minister]] in August 2002 under [[President of South Korea|president]] [[Kim Dae-jung]], but the [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]] voted not to confirm him.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/29/world/fg-briefs29.4|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2002-08-29|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=Second Recent Choice for Premier Rejected}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Chang obtained a bachelor's degree in politics at the [[University of Rochester]] in 1973. He also received a diploma for the Study of EC (European Community) in Belgium in June 1974, and went on to do an M.A. in international affairs at [[George Washington University]]'s [[Elliott School of International Affairs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Afterwards, Chang received his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics and management from [[New York University]], where he wrote his 1987 doctoral dissertation on South Korean construction firms in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="ChosunFocus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Performance of the Korea-based construction firms in the Middle East|last=Chang|first=Tae-hwan|year=1987|publisher=New York University|series=Ph.D. dissertation|oclc=26335012}}; see also [[Koreans in the Arab world]]&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as the president of the South Korean branch of the NYU alumni association.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?ctg=12&amp;Total_ID=3925854|periodical=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|date=2009-12-16|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=강만수 특보 자랑스런 NYU동문상 수상 {{bracket|Gang Man-su receives NYU alumni prize}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang started his newspaper career as a manager of planning department at Maeil Business Newspaper on 1 January 1986.

Chang is a Commissioner for the Global Commission on Internet Governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourinternet.org/#commission&lt;/ref&gt;

==As prime minister==
Chang was named as South Korea's acting PM on 9 August 2002, after the National Assembly declined to confirm his predecessor [[Chang Sang]]. The nomination was a surprise to fellow top-level civil servants in their 60s, as Chang was just 50 years old at the time, and had no experience in government.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020809"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/09/2002080961002.html|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|date=2002-08-09|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=Chang Dae-hwan Named as Acting PM|last=Kim|first=Min-bai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If appointed, he would have been the wealthiest member of the cabinet, with [[South Korean won|₩]]5.6 billion in family assets, according to his self-report.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/14/2002081461006.html|title=PM-Designate's Private Assets Amount to W5.6 Billion|date=2002-08-14|accessdate=2010-07-09|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his confirmation hearings, [[Grand National Party]] (GNP) members including [[Hong Joon-pyo]] and [[Ahn Kyung-ryul]] expressed their opposition.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020823"&gt;{{citation|title=PMs Confirmation Hearing Hits Problems|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=2002-08-23|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/23/2002082361016.html|last=Cho|first=Hee-chun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/27/2002082761023.html|date=2002-08-27|accessdate=2010-07-09|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|title=Confirmation Vote Set for Wednesday|last=Kim|first=Chang-kyun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang himself also acknowledged in a press conference that he had falsely registered himself as living in [[Seoul]]'s [[Gangnam-gu]] to enroll his son in a better school.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020823"/&gt; In the end he was rejected by a vote of 151-112.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

[[File:Clara Ledesma 01.jpg|right|thumb|Untitled, 1960, oil on panel, [[Museo Bellapart]] (Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic)]]
'''Clara Ledesma Terrazas''' (5 March 1924 &amp;ndash; 25 May 1999)&lt;ref name="ssdi"&gt;''Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014''. [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt; was an artist from the [[Dominican Republic]].

==Early years and education==
Born in [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], she initially studied art under [[Yoryi Morel]] in his academy in that city. Ledesma later enrolled in the [[National School of Fine Arts]] in [[Santo Domingo]], graduating in 1948. "Ledesma was one of the first women to join the National School of Fine Arts."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dominicancult.blogspot.com/2013/07/clara-ledesma-dominican-artist.html|title=Clara Ledesma|website=Clara Ledesma|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her professors included [[Celeste Woss y Gil]] and [[George Hausdorf]], while her primary mentor was painting professor [[Josep Gausachs]]. Fellow students included [[Gilberto Hernández Ortega]] and [[Eligio Pichardo]].

After graduating, she taught drawing at the National School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galeriadeartedominicana.com/cat.php?id=16968|title=GALERIA DE ARTE DOMINICANA: Clara Ledesma|website=www.galeriadeartedominicana.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career, continuing education and personal life==
In 1949, Ledesma had her first solo exhibition and in 1951 she opened a studio/gallery, where she displayed her works as well as those of other artists. With the proceeds from a very successful solo exhibition in 1952, Ledesma traveled to Europe to further her education. She studied painting in [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]], and exhibited her works in galleries in Spain. Ledesma also traveled to [[Lisbon]] and [[Paris]] to visit important museums. She was particularly influenced by the works of [[Marc Chagall]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Paul Klee]]. During her stay in Europe, Ledesma met [[Bolivian people|Bolivian]] artist [[Walter Terrazas]], who returned to Santo Domingo with her in 1954.

"She studied painting at prestigious academies abroad and then returned to the country where she presented works that she had conducted in Europe under the influence of Miro, Chagall and Paul Klee, among others."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In Santo Domingo, she worked closely with other important Dominican artists, including [[Gilberto Hernández Ortega]], [[Josep Gausachs]] and [[Jaime Colson]]. In 1955, she was named vice director of the National School of Fine Arts.

In 1961, Ledesma and her husband moved to [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where she opened another gallery. She lived and worked in New York City the rest of her life.

===Exhibitions and artwork===
Ledesma had numerous international solo exhibitions, including events in Madrid, [[Mexico City]] and New York City, and participated in group exhibitions in Brazil, Spain, Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, Argentina and Puerto Rico.
 
Ledesma's style ranged from [[Expressionism]] and [[Surrealism]] to [[abstract art|Abstraction]]. She is known for her use of brilliant colors, imaginative figures and the feeling of magic and mysticism created in her paintings and drawings. In 1955, journalist Horia Tanasescu described her work, "At times ironic, often playful, but taking great care in the production of her paintings, this artist introduces an enthusiasm for life to the national art scene that is in striking contrast to the solemnity of the majority of her fellow artists."

"“Ledesma also touched on social realism in her work, with her most noted series underlining the racial inequities of the time.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://remezcla.com/lists/culture/dominican-art-history-trailblazing-female-artists/|title=Dominican Art History: 10 Trailblazing Female Artists You Should Know|work=Remezcla|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"She tried to represent native paintings, with concern, but away from the drama. One of her best stage was marked by the issue of blackness."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Her artwork can be found in various private collections worldwide. It can also be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of New York]], the Metropolitan Museum of Miami, the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico, the Contemporary Art of Madrid and the Gallery of Modern Art. Ledesma's work has also been featured in the Sarduy Gallery of New York, Art Gallery Nader, Signs of New York, and the Gallery of Modern Art in Santo Domingo.

== Awards and achievements ==
* Premio Nicaragua y Medalla de Oro. Awards
* Won first prize for la Bienal de Santo Domingo with her painting "El Sacrificio del Chivo" (The Sacrifice of the Goat). 
* In 1960 she obtained second prize with her painting titled "Crepusculo en una Aldea" (Twilight in a Village), and won first prize in Pintura de Bellas Artes en escultura (Beautiful Paintings in Sculptures) in 1948.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
* Ledesma was selected for the collective for the Medical Association for Puerto Rico titled "Maestros del Continente" (Teachers of the Continent). 
* In 1960 she was contracted by the gallery The Contemporaries of New York in order to showcase her art, which received praise from numerous newspapers.

The '''Compressed Gas Association''' ('''CGA''') is an American [[trade association]] for the [[Industrial gas|industrial]] and [[medical gas supply]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cockerill|first1=Rob|title=The Safety Experts: A Profile of the Compressed Gas Association|url=https://www.gasworld.com/the-safety-experts-a-profile-of-the-compressed-gas-association/2010186.article|accessdate=28 September 2017|publisher=CryoGas Magazine|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGA publishes standards and practices that codify industry practices.  In cases where government regulation is inspecific, CGA documents are considered authoritative.   CGA falls into a group of [[trade association]]s whose publications are relied on by government.  These groups include the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) and [[ASTM International]]. For example, the state of Montana, the U.S. Army, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] point to CGA documents for regulatory guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compressed Gas Safety General Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PDF/compressedgassafety.PDF|publisher=Montana Department of Labor and Industry|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Module 14 Hazardous Materials|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy06/46f6-ht30/14_haz_materials.ppt|publisher=OSHA|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cylinder valve openings==
The CGA provides detail specifications for the outlet connections of gas containers. They are based on the characteristics of the gas and the storage pressure. flammability, toxicity, state (permanent gas or liquified) and corrosiveness of the gas. These connections are identified by a 3-digit number, such as CGA555. The range of available connection standards covers the majority of the range of industrial, ultra-pure and medical gases in use, including the medical [[pin index safety system]], [[scuba cylinder]] valves and liquefied natural gas for home use.&lt;ref name="CPC Int" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diversifiedcpc.com/Stewardship/Documents/cylconnections.pdf |title=Cylinder Valve Connections - Don’t Tamper with That Connection! }last=Staff |publisher=Diversified CPC International, Incorporated, Channahon, IL |accessdate=9 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards include:

[[File:Corporate tax rates history.png|500px|right|United States Corporate tax rate]]

'''Corporate tax''' is imposed in the United States at the federal, most state, and some local levels on the income of entities treated for tax purposes as corporations. Since January 1, 2018, the nominal federal corporate tax rate in the United States of America is a flat 21% due to the passage of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. State and local taxes and rules vary by jurisdiction, though many are based on federal concepts and definitions. Taxable income may differ from book income both as to timing of income and [[tax deductions]] and as to what is taxable. The corporate [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] was also eliminated by the 2017 reform, but some states have alternative taxes. Like individuals, corporations must file [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] every year. They must make quarterly estimated tax payments. Groups of corporations controlled by the same owners  may file a consolidated return.

Some corporate transactions are not taxable. These include most formations and some types of mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. Shareholders of a corporation are taxed on [[dividends]] distributed by the corporation. Corporations may be subject to foreign income taxes, and may be granted a [[foreign tax credit]] for such taxes.

Shareholders of most corporations are not taxed directly on corporate income, but must pay tax on [[dividend]]s paid by the corporation. However, shareholders of [[S corporation]]s and [[mutual funds]] are taxed currently on corporate income, and do not pay tax on dividends.

==Overview==
[[File:Corporate Income Tax as a Share of GDP, 1946 - 2009.png|thumb|Corporate income tax as a share of GDP, 1946–2009.]]
Corporate income tax is imposed at the federal level&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A.html Subtitle A of Title 26 of the United States Code], in particular {{USC|26|11}}, {{USCSec|26|881}}, and {{USCSec|26|882}}. For a thorough overview of federal income taxation of corporations, see [[Internal Revenue Service]] [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p542.pdf Publication 542], Corporations.  See also Willis|Hoffman chapters 17-20, Pratt &amp; Kulsrud chapters 19–21, Fox chapter 30 (each fully cited under '''Further reading'''). For purely corporate tax matters, the Bittker &amp; Eustice treatise cited fully under '''Treatises''' is authoritative and has been cited by the Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt; on all entities treated as corporations (see [[Corporate tax in the United States#Entity classification|Entity classification]] below), and by 47 states and the District of Columbia.  Certain localities also impose corporate income tax. Corporate income tax is imposed on all [[domestic corporation]]s and on [[foreign corporation]]s having income or activities within the jurisdiction. For federal purposes, an entity treated as a corporation and organized under the laws of any state is a domestic corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|7701(a)(4)}}.  Note that a sham entity may be ignored. See Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2005 p. 19-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  For state purposes, entities organized in that state are treated as domestic, and entities organized outside that state are treated as foreign.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', New York State [http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/publications/multi/pub20.pdf Publication 20], Tax Guide for Business, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of corporations ([[S corporation]]s, mutual funds, etc.) are not taxed at the corporate level, and their shareholders are taxed on the corporation's income as it is recognized.&lt;ref&gt;For 2006, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] reported that approximately 6 million corporate returns were filed, of which more than 4 million were S corporations.  See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06coccr.pdf 2006 Statistics on Income, Corporation Income Tax Returns].&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations which are not S Corporations are known as [[C corporation]]s.

Before 2018, domestic corporations were taxed on their worldwide income at the federal and state levels.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2005 pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] changed this system so that subsidiaries are now taxed at the rate of the jurisdiction in which they are established. Corporate income tax is based on net [[taxable income]] as defined under federal or state law. Generally, taxable income for a corporation is gross income (business and possibly non-business receipts less cost of goods sold) less allowable [[tax deductions]]. Certain income, and some corporations, are subject to a [[tax exemption]]. Also, tax deductions for interest and certain other expenses paid to related parties are subject to limitations.

Corporations may choose their [[tax year]]. Generally, a tax year must be 12 months or 52/53 weeks long. The tax year need not conform to the financial reporting year, and need not coincide with the calendar year, provided books are kept for the selected tax year.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|441}}.  Also see IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p538.pdf Publication 538] Accounting Methods and Periods.&lt;/ref&gt;  Corporations may change their tax year, which may require [[Internal Revenue Service]] consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most state income taxes are determined on the same tax year as the federal tax year.

[[Corporate group|Groups of companies]] are permitted to file single returns for the members of a ''controlled group'' or ''unitary group'', known as [[tax consolidation|consolidated returns]], at the federal level, and are allowed or required to do so by certain states. The consolidated return reports the members' combined taxable incomes and computes a combined tax. Where related parties do not file a consolidated return in a jurisdiction, they are subject to [[transfer pricing]] rules.  Under these rules, tax authorities may adjust prices charged between related parties.

Shareholders of corporations are taxed separately upon the distribution of corporate earnings and profits as a [[dividend]].  Tax rates on dividends are at present lower than on ordinary income for both corporate and individual shareholders.  To ensure that shareholders pay tax on dividends, two withholding tax provisions may apply: [[withholding tax]] on foreign shareholders, and “[[backup withholding]]” on certain domestic shareholders.

Corporations must file tax returns in all U.S. jurisdictions imposing an income tax. Such returns are a self-assessment of tax. Corporate income tax is payable in advance installments, or estimated payments, at the federal level and for many states.

Corporations may be subject to withholding tax obligations upon making certain varieties of payments to others, including wages and distributions treated as dividends. These obligations are generally not the tax of the corporation, but the system may impose penalties on the corporation or its officers or employees for failing to withhold and pay over such taxes.

==State and local income taxes==
[[File:State corporate tax rate.jpg|frameless|right|500px|State corporate tax rates in the United States]]
{{see also|State income tax}}
Nearly all of the states and some localities impose a tax on corporation income. The rules for determining this tax vary widely from state to state. Many of the states compute taxable income with reference to federal taxable income, with specific modifications. The states do not allow a tax deduction for income taxes, whether federal or state. Further, most states deny tax exemption for interest income that is tax exempt at the federal level.

Most states tax domestic and foreign corporations on taxable income derived from business activities apportioned to the state on a [[Formulary apportionment|formulary basis]]. Many states apply a "throw back" concept to tax domestic corporations on income not taxed by other states.  [[Tax treaties]] do not apply to state taxes.

Under the [[U.S. Constitution]], states are prohibited from taxing income of a resident of another state unless the connection with the taxing state reach a certain level (called “nexus”).&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court enunciated four tests for a state tax in [[Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady]].  Under that case, the out of state taxpayer must have a substantial connection (nexus) with the state, the tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce, the tax must be fairly apportioned, and there must be a fair relationship of the tax to services provided.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most states do not tax non-business income of out of state corporations. Since the tax must be fairly apportioned, the states and localities compute income of out of state corporations (including those in foreign countries) taxable in the state by applying [[formulary apportionment]] to the total business taxable income of the corporation.  Many states use a formula based on ratios of property, payroll, and sales within the state to those items outside the state.

==History==
[[File:US Effective Corporate Tax Rate 1947-2011 v2.jpg|thumb|The U.S. federal [[effective tax rate|effective]] corporate tax rate has become much lower than the nominal rate because of [[tax shelter]]s such as [[tax haven]]s.]]
[[File:Taxes revenue by source chart history.png|thumb|Tax revenue by source history]]
The first federal income tax was enacted in 1861, and expired in 1872, amid constitutional challenges. A corporate income tax was enacted in [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act|1894]], but a key aspect of it was shortly held unconstitutional. In 1909, Congress enacted an [[Excise tax in the United States|excise tax]] on corporations based on income. After ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, this became the corporate provisions of the federal income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Bittker &amp; Eustice section 1.01, Pratt &amp; Hulsrud 2005 p.1-4, Willis|Hoffman p. 1-2 and 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amendments to various provisions affecting corporations have been in most or all [[Revenue Act (disambiguation)|revenue acts]] since. Corporate tax provisions are incorporated in Title 26 of the [[United States Code]], known as the [[Internal Revenue Code]].  The present rate of tax on corporate income was adopted in the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;For a more complete history, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=tzOWzbST-V4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=seidman%27s+legislative+history+of+the+federal+income+tax&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TjcqUGjJZA&amp;sig=d6eDG665FoFGtUhAqwlEvFsciog&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=awdKTMPXG8H_nQfklfHiDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Seidman's Legislative History of Income Tax Laws], 1938, reprinted 2003 as {{ISBN|1-58477-336-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, corporate tax revenue constituted about 9% of all federal revenues or 1.3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kocieniewski (2 May 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/business/economy/03rates.html "U.S. Business Has High Tax Rates but Pays Less"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entity classification==
{{main|Entity classification election}}
Business entities may elect to be treated as corporations taxed at the entity and member levels or as [[Flow-through entity|"flow through" entities]] taxed only at the member level.  However, entities organized as corporations under U.S. state laws and certain foreign entities are treated, ''per se'', as corporations, with no optional election.  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] issued the so-called “check-the-box” regulations in 1997 under which entities may make such choice by filing [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf Form 8832].  Absent such election, default classifications for domestic and foreign business entities, combined with voluntary entity elections to opt out of the default classifications (except in the case of “''per se'' corporations” (as defined below)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.2&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 301.7701-2]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612145504/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26%3A18.0.1.1.2.20.69.2&amp;idno=26 |date=June 12, 2011 }}, [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.4&amp;idno=26 301.7701-3]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612162314/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26%3A18.0.1.1.2.20.69.4&amp;idno=26 |date=June 12, 2011 }}, Bittker &amp; Eustice chapter 2, and Fox chapter 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If an entity not treated as a corporation has more than one equity owner and at least one equity owner does not have limited liability (e.g., a [[general partner]]), it will be classified as a partnership (i.e., a pass-through), and if the entity has a single equity owner and the single owner does not have limited liability protection, it will be treated as a disregarded entity (i.e., a pass-through).

Some entities treated as corporations may make other elections that enable corporate income to be taxed only at the shareholder level, and not at the corporate level.  Such entities are treated similarly to partnerships.  The income of the entity is not taxed at the corporate level, and the members must pay tax on their share of the entity's income.  These include:
* [[S corporation|S Corporations]], all of whose shareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident individuals; other restrictions apply.  The election requires the consent of all shareholders.  If a corporation is not an S corporation from its formation, special rules apply to the [[Taxation in the United States|taxation]] of income earned (or gains accrued) before the election.
* Regulated investment companies (RICs), commonly referred to as [[mutual funds]].

[[File:U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Receipts and Pre-Tax Profits.png|thumb|right|Federal corporate income tax receipts have declined relative to corporate profits.]]
Determinations of what is taxable and at what rate are made at the federal level based on U.S. tax law. Many but not all states incorporate federal law principles in their tax laws to some extent. Federal taxable income equals [[gross income]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61].&lt;/ref&gt; (gross receipts and other income less [[cost of goods sold]]) less [[tax deductions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63- 26 USC 63].&lt;/ref&gt; Gross income of a corporation and business deductions are determined in much the same manner as for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Willis|Hoffman 2009, p. 17-8 and -9.&lt;/ref&gt; All income of a corporation is subject to the same federal tax rate. However, corporations may reduce other federal taxable income by a net capital loss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1211-|title=26 U.S. Code § 1211 - Limitation on capital losses|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain deductions are more limited.&lt;ref&gt;For example, charitable contributions of a corporation are limited to 10% of taxable income under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170(b)(2)].  For a comparison of how individuals and corporations are taxed, see Willis|Hoffman 2009 p. 17–36, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain deductions are available only to corporations. These include deductions for dividends received&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/243- 26 USC 243] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/246- 26 USC 246], Bittker &amp; Eustice section 5.05.&lt;/ref&gt; and amortization of organization expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/248- 26 USC 248], Bittker &amp; Eustice section 5.06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states tax business income of a corporation differently than nonbusiness income.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', New York, ''supra'', which bases taxable income on federal taxable income, with minor modification, but separately taxes 'income from subsidiary capital.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Principles for recognizing income and deductions may differ from financial accounting principles. Key areas of difference include differences in the timing of income or deduction, [[tax exemption]] for certain income, and disallowance or limitation of certain [[tax deductions]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis|Hoffman 2009 p. 4–5 ''et seq'', Pratt &amp; Kulsrud p. 5–13 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;  IRS rules require that these differences be disclosed in considerable detail for non-small corporations on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf Schedule M-3] to [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf Form 1120].

Notes: The rates above are for regular corporate taxes based on income (including those called franchise taxes) and exclude the effect of alternative taxes and minimum taxes.  Most states have a minimum income or franchise tax.  The above rates generally apply to entities treated as corporations other than S Corporations and financial institutions, which may be subject to different rates of tax.  Tax rates are before credits and reductions for corporations operating in certain parts of the state.

(a) Excludes the effect of graduated tax rates based on level of income.

(b) The Michigan Business Tax applies to incorporated and unincorporated businesses, and is based on alternative measure of income that may not relate to net income.

(c) Businesses with an entire net income greater than $100K pay 9% in all taxable income, companies with entire net income greater than $50K and less than or equal to $100K pay 7.5% on all taxable income, and companies with entire net income less than or equal to $50K pay 6.5% on all taxable income.

(d) A tax on gross receipts, the commercial activity tax (CAT), was phased in from 2005 to 2008 while the corporate franchise tax (CFT, Ohio's corporate net income tax) was phased out. Beginning April 1, 2009, the CAT rate was fully phased in at 0.26%.

(e) The top income tax rate (7.9% on income over $250K) applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2011.

(f) Excludes local corporate income tax.

(g) Excludes the effect of alternative tax bases, such as sales or assets.

(h) Other tax rates may apply to certain corporations.

(i) Missouri allows a deduction for federal income tax payments, reducing the effective state tax rate.

(j) A higher rate applies if the corporation elects "water's edge" apportionment.

(k) Also applies to unincorporated entities.

(l) While not called an income tax, Texas imposes a franchise tax at the higher of a tax based on capital or a graduated tax based on income.

|}
The adjacent table lists the tax rates on corporate income applied by each state, but not by local governments within states.  Because state and local taxes are deductible expenses for federal income tax purposes, the [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rate]] in each state is not a simple addition of federal and state tax rates.

Although a state may not levy a corporate income tax, they may impose other taxes that are similar. For example, Washington state does not have an income tax but levies a B&amp;O (business and occupation tax) which is arguably a larger burden because the B&amp;O tax is calculated as a percentage of revenue rather than a percentage of net income, like the corporate income tax. This means even loss-making enterprises are required to pay the tax.

==Tax credits==
Corporations, like other businesses, may be eligible for various [[tax credits]] which reduce federal, state or local income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2005 p. 15-26 ''et seq'', Willis|Hoffman 2009 chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest of these by dollar volume is the federal [[foreign tax credit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/901- 26 USC 901], ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For statistics related to federal taxes, see IRS [https://www.irs.gov/taxstats/index.html Statistics on Income], available in .pdf and Excel formats for many years.  Note that some statistics are based on counts of returns, and some are based on samples.  For [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06coccr.pdf  2006 for all corporations], the total foreign tax credit for corporations was $78 billion, the general business credit $16 billion, and prior year AMT credit $7 billion, on total pre-credit taxes of $463 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;  This credit is allowed to all taxpayers for income taxes paid to foreign countries.  The credit is limited to that part of federal income tax before other credits generated by foreign source taxable income.  The credit is intended to mitigate taxation of the same income to the same taxpayer by two or more countries, and has been a feature of the U.S. system since 1918.  Other credits include credits for certain wage payments, credits for investments in certain types of assets including certain motor vehicles, credits for use of alternative fuels and off-highway vehicle use, natural resource related credits, and others. See, ''e.g.'', the [[Research &amp; Experimentation Tax Credit]].

==Tax deferral==
[[File:Deferred Corporate Foreign Earnings 2001-2010.jpg|thumb|Deferred U.S. corporate foreign earnings 2001–2010.]]
{{main|Tax deferral|Companies of the United States with untaxed profits}}
Deferral is one of the main features of the worldwide tax system that allows U.S. multinational companies to delay paying taxes on foreign profits. Under U.S. tax law, companies are not required to pay U.S. tax on their foreign subsidiaries’ profits for many years, even indefinitely until the earnings are returned to U.S. Therefore, it is one of the main reasons that U.S. corporations pay low taxes, even though the corporate tax rate in the U.S. is one of the highest rates (35%) in the world. The corporate tax rate will change to a flat (21%) on January 1, 2018, permanently.

Deferral is beneficial for U.S. companies to raise the cost of capital relatively to their foreign-based competitors. Their foreign subsidiaries can reinvest their earnings without incurring additional tax that allows them to grow faster. It is also valuable to U.S. corporations with global operations, especially for corporations with income in low-tax countries. Some of the largest and most profitable U.S. corporations pay exceedingly low tax rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Lost to Tax Loopholes | author= Jesse Drucker| publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.]]| date = October 21, 2010| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html | accessdate = March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through their use of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130820114017/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R40623_20100903.pdf subsidiaries in so-called tax haven countries].

However, tax deferral encourages U.S. companies to make job-creating investments offshore even if similar investments in the United States can be more profitable, absent tax considerations. Furthermore, companies try to use accounting techniques to record profits offshore by any way, even if they keep actual investment and jobs in the United States. This explains why U.S. corporations report their largest profits in low-tax countries like the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Bermuda, though clearly that is not where most real economic activity occurs.&lt;ref name="americanprogress" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2016}}

==Interest deduction limitations==
A [[tax deduction]] is allowed at the federal, state and local levels for interest expense incurred by a corporation in carrying out its business activities. Where such interest is paid to related parties, such deduction may be limited.&lt;ref&gt;Some limitations apply to all corporations, while some apply only to corporate payments to foreign related parties.  See, ''e.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163(j)], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/267- 267], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_C_40_VI.html 385].  Without such limitation, owners could structure financing of the corporation in a manner that would provide for a tax deduction for much of the profits, potentially without changing the tax on shareholders.  For example, assume a corporation earns profits of 100 before interest and would normally distribute 50 to shareholder individuals.  If the corporation is structured so that deductible interest of 50 is payable to the shareholders, it will cut its tax to half the amount due if it merely paid a dividend.  Absent the recently enacted rate differential on dividends, the shareholders' tax would be the same in either case.&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification of instruments as debt on which interest is deductible or as equity with respect to which distributions are not deductible is highly complex and based on court-developed law.  The courts have considered 26 factors in deciding whether an instrument is debt or equity, and no single factor predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} for [Tax Notes] article circa 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal tax rules also limit the deduction of interest expense paid by corporations to foreign shareholders based on a complex calculation designed to limit the deduction to 50% of cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163(j) and long-proposed regulations thereunder.]  See Bittker &amp; Eustice section 4.04[8] for a brief outline.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states have other limitations on related party payments of interest and royalties.

==Other corporate events==
U.S. rules provide that certain corporate events are not taxable to corporations or shareholders.  Significant restrictions and special rules often apply. The rules related to such transactions are quite complex, and exist primarily at the federal level. Many of the states follow federal tax treatment for such events.

===Formation===
The formation of a corporation by controlling corporate or non-corporate shareholder(s) is generally a nontaxable event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/351- 26 USC 351].  Bittker &amp; Eustice chapter 3, Willis|Hoffman 2009 chapter 17, Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2005 pp.19–30 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, in tax free formations the tax attributes of assets and liabilities are transferred to the new corporation along with such assets and liabilities.

Example:  John and Mary are United States residents who operate a business.  They decide to incorporate for business reasons. They transfer assets of the business to Newco, a newly formed Delaware corporation of which they are the sole shareholders, subject to accrued liabilities of the business, solely in exchange for common shares of Newco.  This transfer should not generally cause gain or loss recognition for John, Mary, or Newco.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/351-  26 USC 351].&lt;/ref&gt;  Newco assumes John and Mary's [[tax basis]] in the assets it acquires.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/362- 26 USC 362].&lt;/ref&gt;  If on the other hand Newco also assumes a bank loan in excess of the basis of the assets transferred less the accrued liabilities, John and Mary will recognize taxable gain for such excess.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/357- 26 USC 357] and [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:4.0.1.1.1.0.12.110&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.367-1(b) Example] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612162355/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26%3A4.0.1.1.1.0.12.110&amp;idno=26 |date=2011-06-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Corporations may merge or acquire other corporations in a manner treated as nontaxable to either of the corporations and/or to their shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_C_40_III_50_B.html 26 USC 354-358] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_C_40_III_50_C.html 361-362].&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, significant restrictions apply if tax free treatment is to be obtained.  For example, Bigco acquires all of the shares of Smallco from Smallco shareholders in exchange solely for Bigco shares.  This acquisition is not taxable to Smallco or its shareholders under U.S. tax law if certain requirements are met,&lt;ref&gt;See 26 USC 368(a)(1)(B) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368- 26 USC 368]&lt;/ref&gt; even if Smallco is then liquidated into or merged with Bigco.&lt;ref&gt;See generally USC 368(a)(1)(D) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368- 26 USC 368]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganizations===
In addition, corporations may change key aspects of their legal identity, capitalization, or structure in a tax free manner.  Examples of reorganizations that may be tax free include mergers, liquidations of subsidiaries, share for share exchanges, exchanges of shares for assets, changes in form or place of organization, and recapitalizations.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368- 26 USC 368] defining events qualifying for reorganization treatment, including certain acquisitions.  Bittker &amp; Eustice chapter 12.  Willis|Hoffman p. 20-14 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advance tax planning might mitigate tax risks resulting from a business reorganization or potentially enhance tax savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davis|first1=Bruce| last2=Bast|first2=Donald| last3=Sellers|first3=Tracey|title= Sales Taxes and Business Reorganizations: A Primer|url= https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/sales-taxes-and-business-reorganizations-primer|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of earnings==
[[File:US Corporate Profits 1947-2011.jpg|thumb|U.S. corporate profits after taxes 1947–2011.&lt;ref name=CPFED&gt;{{cite web|title=US Corporate Profits after Taxes|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=CP#|publisher=Federal Reserve Board, St. Louis|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Shareholders of corporations are subject to corporate or individual income tax when corporate earnings are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61(a)(7)].  See Bittker &amp; Eustice chapter 8, Willis|Hoffman 2009 chapter 19, and Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2005 chapter 20 for a thorough discussion of non-liquidating distributions, including earnings and profits, and Bittker &amp; eustice chapters 9 and 10 and Pratt &amp; Kulsrud pp. 20–14 ''et seq'' for a discussion of redemptions and liquidating distributions.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such distribution of earnings is generally referred to as a [[dividend]].

Dividends received by other corporations may be taxed at reduced rates, or exempt from taxation, if the [[dividends received deduction]] applies.  Dividends received by individuals (if the dividend is a "[[qualified dividend]]") are taxed at reduced rates.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1- 26 USC 1(h)(11)] for the reduced rate of tax for individuals, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/243- 26 USC 243](a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions to shareholder taxation apply to certain nonroutine distributions, including distributions in liquidation of an 80%  subsidiary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/332-|title=26 U.S. Code § 332 - Complete liquidations of subsidiaries|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in complete termination of a shareholder's interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/302- 26 USC 302].&lt;/ref&gt;

If a corporation makes a distribution in a non-cash form, it must pay tax on any gain in value of the property distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/311- 26 US 311].&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States does not generally require [[withholding tax]] on the payment of dividends to shareholders.  However, withholding tax is required if the shareholder is not a U.S. citizen or resident or U.S. corporation, or in some other circumstances (see [[Tax withholding in the United States]]).

==Earnings and profits==
U.S. corporations are permitted to distribute amounts in excess of earnings under the laws of most states under which they may be organized.  A distribution by a corporation to shareholders is treated as a dividend to the extent of earnings and profits (E&amp;P), a tax concept similar to [[retained earnings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/301- 26 USC 301].  Dividend is defined at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/316- 26 USC 316].  Bittker &amp; Eustice section 8.03.&lt;/ref&gt;   E&amp;P is current taxable income, with significant adjustments, plus prior E&amp;P reduced by distributions of E&amp;P.  Adjustments include depreciation differences under [[MACRS]], add-back of most tax exempt income, and deduction of many non-deductible expenses (e.g., 50% of meals and entertainment).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/312- 26 USC 312].&lt;/ref&gt;  Corporate distributions in excess of E&amp;P are generally treated as a return of capital to the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/301- 26 USC 301(c)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquidation==
The [[liquidation]] of a corporation is generally treated as an exchange of a capital asset under the Internal Revenue Code.  If a shareholder bought stock for $300 and receives $500 worth of property from a corporation in a liquidation, that shareholder would recognize a capital gain of $200.  An exception is when a parent corporation liquidates a subsidiary, which is tax-free so long as the parent owns more than 80% of the subsidiary.  There are certain anti-abuse rules to avoid the engineering of losses in corporate liquidations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/uscorporatetax/corporate-liquidation Taxation of corporate liquidations].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign corporation branches==
The United States taxes foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporations differently than domestic corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast tax on domestic corporations under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11- 26 USC 11] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63- 26 USC 63] with tax on foreign corporations under  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_II_50_B.html 26 USC 881-885].  See Bittker &amp; Eustice sections 15.01 to 15.04, Willis|Hoffman pp. 25–35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign corporations generally are taxed only on business income when the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (i.e., in a [[Permanent establishment|branch]]).  This tax is imposed at the same rate as the tax on business income of a resident corporation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/882- 26 USC 882].&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. also imposes a branch profits tax on foreign corporations with a U.S. branch, to mimic the dividend withholding tax which would be payable if the business was conducted in a U.S. subsidiary corporation and profits were remitted to the foreign parent as [[dividends]].  The branch profits tax is imposed at the time profits are remitted or deemed remitted outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/884- 26 USC 884].  Bittker &amp; Eustice section 15.04[2].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, foreign corporations are subject to [[Tax withholding in the United States|withholding tax]] at 30% on dividends, interest, royalties, and certain other income.  [[Tax treaties]] may reduce or eliminate this tax. This tax applies to a "dividend equivalent amount," which is the corporation's effectively connected earnings and profits for the year, less investments the corporation makes in its U.S. assets (money and adjusted bases of property connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business). The tax is imposed even if there is no distribution.

==Consolidated returns==
{{main|Tax consolidation}}
Corporations 80% or more owned by a common parent corporation may file a consolidated return for federal and some state income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_6_30_A.html 26 USC 1501-1505] and extensive [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfrv12_02.tpl extensive regulations under 1.1502-1 ''et seq'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.  See Crestol, ''et al'' cited below.&lt;/ref&gt;  These returns include all income, deductions, and credits of all members of the controlled group, generally expressed without intercompany eliminations.   Some states allow or require a combined or consolidated return for U.S. members of a "unitary" group under common control and in related businesses.  Certain transactions between group members may not be recognized until the occurrence of events for other members.  For example, if Company A sells goods to sister Company B, the profit on the sale is deferred until Company B uses or sells the goods. All members of a consolidated group must use the same tax year.

==Transfer pricing==
{{main|Transfer pricing}}
Transactions between a corporation and related parties are subject to potential adjustment by tax authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/482- 26 USC 482] and extensive [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfrv6_02.tpl regulations]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} thereunder.&lt;/ref&gt;  These adjustments may be applied to both U.S. and foreign related parties, and to individuals, corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts.

==Alternative taxes==
{{see also|Alternative Minimum Tax}}
The United States federal Alternative Minimum Tax was eliminated in 2018.

Corporations may also be subject to additional taxes in certain circumstances.  These include taxes on excess accumulated undistributed earnings and personal holding companies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_G.html 26 USC 531-565].  See Bittker &amp; Eustice, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and restrictions on graduated rates for personal service corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/11- 26 USC 11(b)].&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=August 2018}}

Some states, such as New Jersey, impose alternative taxes based on measures other than taxable income.  Among such measures are gross income, pipeline revenues, gross receipts, and various asset or capital measures.  In addition, some states impose a tax on capital of corporations or on shares issued and outstanding.  The U. S. state of Michigan previously taxed businesses on an alternative base that did not allow compensation of employees as a tax deduction and allowed full deduction of the cost of production assets upon acquisition.

==Tax returns==
[[File:US Corporation Income Tax Return 2011 form 1120.jpg|thumb|U.S. corporate income tax return form 1120.&lt;ref name=IRS1120&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|upright]]
Corporations subject to U.S. tax must file federal and state income [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6012- 26 USC 6012(a)(2)].  See individual states for requirements.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different tax returns are required at the federal and some state levels for different types of corporations or corporations engaged in specialized businesses. The United States has 13 variations on the basic [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf Form 1120] for [[S corporation]]s, insurance companies, [[Domestic international sales corporation|Domestic International Sales Corporations]], foreign corporations, and other entities.  The structure of the forms and the imbedded schedules vary by type of form.

United States federal corporate tax returns require both computation of taxable income from components thereof and reconciliation of taxable income to financial statement income.  Corporations with assets exceeding $10 million must complete a detailed 3 page reconciliation on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120sm3.pdf Schedule M-3] indicating which differences are permanent (i.e., do not reverse, such as disallowed expenses or tax exempt interest) and which are temporary (e.g., differences in when income or expense is recognized for book and tax purposes).

Some state corporate tax returns have significant imbedded or attached schedules related to features of the state's tax system that differ from the federal system.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', New Jersey's 17+ page [http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/other_forms/cbt/09cbt100.pdf Form CBT100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122104710/http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/other_forms/cbt/09cbt100.pdf |date=2009-11-22 }} that incorporates limitations on related party interest and royalties, an alternative tax, 3 factor apportionment, depreciation adjustments, special taxes for professional corporations, and other features.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation of non-simple corporate tax returns can be time consuming.  For example, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] states that the average time needed to complete Form 1120-S, for privately held companies electing flow through status, is over 56 hours, not including recordkeeping time.&lt;ref&gt;See page 38f [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1120s.pdf Instructions for Form 1120-S].&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal corporate tax returns for most types of corporations are due by the 15th day of the third month following the tax year (March 15 for calendar year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6072-|title=26 U.S. Code § 6072 - Time for filing income tax returns|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State corporate tax return due dates vary, but most are due either on the same date or one month after the federal due date. Extensions of time to file are routinely granted.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i7004.pdf instructions] to IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f7004.pdf Form 7004].&lt;/ref&gt;

Penalties may be imposed at the federal and state levels for late filing or non-filing of corporate income tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F_20_68_30_A.html 26 USC 6651-6665].&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, other substantial penalties may apply with respect to failures related to returns and tax return computations.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662- 26 USC 6662] for penalties up to 40% of tax related to transfer pricing or valuation adjustments.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intentional failure to file or intentional filing of incorrect returns may result in criminal penalties to those involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_F_20_75.html 26 USC 7201 et seq].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund McIlhenny''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|k|əl|h|ɛ|n|i}}; 1815 – 25 November 1890) was an American businessman and manufacturer who invented [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco brand pepper sauce]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], in 1815, Edmund McIlhenny moved to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], around 1840, finding work in the Louisiana banking industry. He was of Irish and  Scottish descent, his great grandparents immigrated to America from County Donegal [citation needed].  By the eve of the [[American Civil War]], he had acquired a small fortune and became an independent bank owner.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (Lafayette, La.: Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana/Louisiana Historical Association, 1998), s.v., McIlhenny, Edmund.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1859, he married Mary Eliza Avery. They had eight children.

During the Civil War, McIlhenny fled with his in-laws, the Avery family, to Texas, where he served as a civilian employee of the [[Confederate army]], first as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in a [[commissary]] office, then as a financial agent for the [[paymaster]].

The [[Southern United States|South]]'s economic collapse after its defeat ruined McIlhenny, who now lived with his in-laws in their [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] on [[Avery Island]], Louisiana.  It was there that McIlhenny tended the family garden, where, according to tradition, he grew a variety of [[fruits]] and vegetables, including [[tabasco pepper]]s.

==Tabasco sauce==
Between 1866 and 1868, McIlhenny, probably inspired by an earlier sauce introduced by New Orleans-area entrepreneur [[Maunsel White]], experimented with making a [[sauce]] from the peppers in the Avery family garden. In 1868 he grew his first commercial pepper crop, and the next year sold the first bottles of his new product, which he called ''Tabasco brand pepper sauce''.

In 1870 McIlhenny obtained [[letters patent]] for his invention, which he packaged in cork-top two-ounce bottles with diamond logo labels very similar in appearance to those in present-day use.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

At first McIlhenny sold the product mainly along the [[Gulf Coast]] in places including New Orleans, [[New Iberia]], Louisiana, and [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], Texas. By the early 1870s, however, he had broken into larger markets, such as New York City, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Boston]], helped by major nineteenth century food manufacturer and distributor [[E. C. Hazard and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, "Tabasco: Edmund McIlhenny and the Birth of a Louisiana Pepper Sauce," ''Louisiana Cultural Vistas'' (Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities publication), Fall 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

McIlhenny died in 1890, and apparently did not consider his creation of Tabasco sauce to have been a particularly notable accomplishment.  Indeed, he made no mention of Tabasco sauce in an [[autobiography|autobiographical sketch]] composed toward the end of his life, nor was it mentioned in his [[obituaries]].&lt;ref name=HotHistory&gt;"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=861201 TABASCO's Hot History]," ''Morning Edition'', [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), 29 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, his successors, sons [[John Avery McIlhenny]] and [[Edward Avery McIlhenny]], realized that their father had created a foundation on which they could build a larger family business, and they shortly expanded and modernized the manufacturing process. Today each [[carton]] of Tabasco sauce bears a facsimile of McIlhenny's signature.

As of October 2015, [[Forbes]] ranked Broad the 65th wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $7.4 billion.&lt;ref name="ForbesList"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Broad was born in 1933 in the [[Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] immigrant parents who met in New York.&lt;ref name=Unreasonable&gt;{{cite book |last1=Broad |first1=Eli |date=2012-05-08 |title=The Art of Being Unreasonable |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJZqGV1SsasC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20art%20of%20being%20unreasonable&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20art%20of%20being%20unreasonable&amp;f=false |publisher=wiley |isbn=978-1118173213}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name=LAMAG&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u10EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=broad#v=onepage&amp;q=broad&amp;f=false Los Angeles Magazine: "A Little Thing Called Power - He has more pull than the mayor, more art than the Getty, and more money than God.

Broad attended [[Michigan State University]], majoring in accounting with a minor in economics and graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1954. Among the jobs Broad held in college were selling women's shoes, selling [[garbage disposal]]s door-to-door, and working as a [[drill press]] operator at [[Packard|Packard Motor]], where he was a member of [[United Auto Workers]].&lt;ref name="Unreasonable"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The same year, 21-year-old Broad married 18-year-old Edythe "Edye" Lawson.&lt;ref name=Unreasonable /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

Broad became the youngest Michigan resident to attain the credentials of [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA), a record he held until 2010. Broad worked as an accountant for two years and taught night classes at the [[Detroit Institute of Technology]] as an assistant professor of accounting in 1956.&lt;ref name="Unreasonable" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Wanting to work on his own, he founded his own accounting firm and was offered office space by the husband of his wife's cousin, [[Donald Bruce Kaufman]], in return for doing the books for Kaufman's small homebuilding and subcontracting business.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt;

==Career==
===Kaufman &amp; Broad===
Doing the accounting for Kaufman's small business led Broad to decide to enter homebuilding himself. In 1956, Broad and Kaufman decided to partner and build homes together.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt; Borrowing $12,500 from his wife's parents, Broad put up half the capital in their first venture together, building two model homes in the Northeast Detroit suburbs&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt; where a new generation of first-time home buyers were flocking. By streamlining the construction process and eliminating basements, offering a carport instead, they could price the houses so the monthly mortgage would be less than the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Kaufman and Broad christened this model the "Award Winner" and priced it at $13,700.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt;&lt;ref name=BruckNYer2010 /&gt; After one weekend, seventeen were sold and within two years, Kaufman and Broad had built 600 homes in the Detroit suburbs.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt; In 1960, fearing that the Detroit economy was too dependent on the automotive business, they moved to Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt; In 1961, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation (now [[KB Home]]) [[initial public offering|went public]] on the [[American Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=ReutersKBH&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=KBH | work=Reuters | title=KB Home (KBH)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Broad moved the company to [[Los Angeles]]. Soon after, Kaufman retired and he and his wife [[Glorya Kaufman]] went on to become noted philanthropists.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt; By 1969, KB Home was the first homebuilder listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=ReutersKBH /&gt; In 1974, Broad stepped down as CEO.&lt;ref name=LAMAG /&gt;

===SunAmerica===
{{Main|SunAmerica}}
In 1971, Broad acquired Sun Life Insurance Company of America, a family-owned insurance company founded in [[Baltimore]] in 1890, for $52 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://broadfoundation.org/about-us/|title=About Us {{!}} The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation|work=The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broad transformed Sun Life into the retirement savings powerhouse [[SunAmerica]]. In 1999, he sold SunAmerica to the [[American International Group]] (AIG) for $18 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sunamerica.com/TridionData.do?Page_ID=67997&lt;/ref&gt; Broad continued as CEO of SunAmerica until 1999, when he left to focus on [[philanthropy]] full-time.

===Writing===
In 2012, Broad's first book, ''The Art of Being Unreasonable: Lessons in Unconventional Thinking'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-eli-broad-book-20120504,0,4402401.story|title=Eli Broad offers life lessons in|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first1=Mike|last1=Boehm|date=2014-05-04|accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley and Sons]] and debuted as a ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and ''[[Washington Post]]'' bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eli and Edythe Broad|url=http://www.thebroad.org/about/eli-and-edythe-broad|publisher=The Broad|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eli L.

===Arts===
Broad has been an influential figure in the art world since 1973 and has had a particular focus on the cultural life of [[Los Angeles]].

[[Image:Broad Art Center, by Meier.jpg|thumb|Broad Art Center, by Meier at the [[UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture]]]]
Broad was the founding chairman of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] in 1979 and chaired the board until 1984. He recruited the founding director of the museum&lt;ref&gt;Peter Aspden, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4e3eb722-ca62-11de-a3a3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1CiXYf0XM Putting LA at the heart of world culture] Financial Times, November 6, 2009. Accessed February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and negotiated the acquisition of the [[Giuseppe Panza|Panza Collection]] for the museum.

In 2008, The Broad Foundation gave a $30 million challenge grant to rebuild the museum’s endowment and to provide exhibition support. The Foundation's donation was contingent on the museum remaining independent and not merging with [[LACMA|Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/arts/design/23moca.html | work=The New York Times | first=Edward | last=Wyatt | title=Billionaire Offers Arts Bailout in Los Angeles | date=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad is a life trustee of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA).

Opera, currently occupied by [[Plácido Domingo]].

The Broads contributed $10 million in 2008 for a programming [[Financial endowment|endowment]] for a state-of-the-art music and [[performing arts center]] at [[Santa Monica College]], The Eli and Edythe Broad Stage, and an adjacent [[Black box theater|black box performance space]], The Edye.

Broad’s interest in art began in 1973 with his family’s first acquisition of a [[Van Gogh]] drawing, entitled "Cabanes a Saintes-Maries" (1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flashartonline.com/interno.php?pagina=articolo_det&amp;id_art=469&amp;det=ok&amp;title=ELI-BROAD |title=Eli Broad |publisher=Flash Art |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711011211/http://www.flashartonline.com/interno.php?pagina=articolo_det&amp;id_art=469&amp;det=ok&amp;title=ELI-BROAD |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art collector and [[MCA Records|MCA]] executive Taft Schreiber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/16/entertainment/la-ca-broad-simon-20110116 | title=Eli Broad, today's Norton Simon | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Christopher | last1=Knight | date=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; became his mentor.

Eli and Edythe Broad established The Broad Art Foundation in 1984 with the goal of making their extensive contemporary art collection more accessible to the public; to date The Foundation has made more than 8,000 loans to more than 500 [[Art museum|museums and university galleries]] worldwide.

The Broads have two collections—a personal collection with nearly 600 works and The Broad Art Foundation's collection, which has approximately 1,500 works [[modern art|Modern]] and [[contemporary art]]. In January 2008, the Broads decided that works in their personal collection would ultimately go to their foundation to make the artwork accessible to the public through the foundation’s loan program.

Some of the best-known works are by contemporary artists including:&lt;ref name="latimes01102008"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Knight |first=Christopher |author-link= |title=Will LACMA's reputation suffer from Broad's change of heart? |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 10, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-critic11jan10,1,6451548.story?ctrack=4&amp;cset=true |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AKnight+intitle%3AWill+LACMA%27s+reputation+suffer+from+Broad%27s+change+of+heart%3F&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117104327/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-critic11jan10,1,6451548.story?ctrack=4&amp;cset=true |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad owns more than 20 Koons pieces, and donated €640,000 ($900,000) to help sponsor a 2008 Koons retrospective at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] (with fellow Koons collector [[François Pinault]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ArtNews|date=November 2008|title=Where Michael Jackson Meets Louis XIV: How the Jeff Koons exhibition at Versailles led to a national controversy in France|first=Richard|last=Covington}} ARTNews, Nov. 2008, p. 104: "One of the main sponsors helping to defray that cost was Pinault, who, officials say, contributed about €960,000 toward the exhibition's €1.9 million ($2.6 million) total cost. (Other private sponsors, including Los Angeles property developers Eli and Edythe Broad, who count more than 20 Koons pieces in their collection, contributed €640,000 [$900,000], and the state chipped in €300,000 [$400,000], according to Versailles officials.)"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roy Lichtenstein]] – three comic strip paintings (1962–65) and his 1969 abstraction of a mirror. In November 1994, Broad purchased "I...I'm Sorry" for $2.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]] at a [[Sotheby's]] auction, paid with his [[American Express]] [[credit card]], and thereby earned 2.5 million [[Frequent flyer program|frequent flyer miles]].

==Controversy==
{{POV section|date=February 2017}}
In 2013, Eli Broad was named by the California attorney general as a contributor to Americans for Job Security, a Virginia trade association. The money sent to Americans for Job Security was intended for "issue advocacy," meaning advertising that doesn't expressly urge Californians to vote one way or another. However, Americans for Job Security sent some of their donations to a Phoenix group, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which provided it to a small business action committee that opposed [[California Proposition 30 (2012)|Proposition 30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/25/local/la-me-secret-money-20131025 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Chris | last=Megerian | title=California fines groups $16 million for funneling money to campaigns | date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Eli Broad was aware that his 2013 donation would be used in this way, since he had stated in 2012 that he supported higher taxes on the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/01/philanthropist-broad-endorses-browns-call-for-raising-taxes.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A.

According to one unnamed critic at portside.org, such an outcome would "do away with democratically controlled, publicly accountable education in LA." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://portside.org/2015-09-26/billionaire%E2%80%99s-secret-plan-%E2%80%98hostile-takeover%E2%80%99-la-public-schools#sthash.RRCidnDj.dpuf | work=Portside | title=Billionaire’s Secret Plan: A ‘Hostile Takeover’ of LA Public Schools | date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12531">The '''Evaporating Cloud''' is one of the six [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] in the [[Theory of Constraints]]. The Evaporating Cloud (EC) - also referred to in the literature as "the cloud", or as a "conflict resolution diagram"&lt;ref&gt;Dettmer, H,W. 1999. The conflict resolution diagram: Creating win-win solutions, Quality Progress,32(3):41&lt;/ref&gt; - is a logical diagram representing a problem that has no obvious satisfactory solution.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;Fedurko, Jelena. Behind the cloud: Enhancing logical thinking. TOC Strategic Solutions Ltd (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- need peer-reviewed examples/refs. This is internally published. --&gt;

== Overview ==
The most commonly used of the TOC tools,{{refn|group=note|name=note0|The EC is reported to be used in 77% of TOC case-studies, according to one report.&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;Kim, Seonmin, Victoria Jane Mabin, and John Davies. "The theory of constraints thinking processes: retrospect and prospect." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 28.2 (2008): 155-184.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the EC was designed to address conﬂict or [[dilemma]] situations (trade-off situations where there is no acceptable compromise) by diagramming the logic behind the conflict and methodically examining the assumptions behind the logic.
&lt;ref name=kim2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC has a set format with five boxes, labelled A, B, C, D, D’, that are usually laid out as follows:&lt;ref name=mabin2001&gt;Victoria J. Mabin, Steve Forgeson and Lawrence Green. Harnessing resistance: using the theory of constraints to assist change management. Journal of European Industrial Training. 25/2/3/4 [2001] 168±191&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Evaporating Cloud - Overview.svg|thumb|280px|The generic structure of an Evaporating Cloud diagram.]]

    [B] ← [D ]                      [A]
   /       ↑                       /   \
 [A]       conflict      OR      [B]   [C]
   \       ↓                      ↑     ↑
    [C] ← [D’]                   [D] ↔ [D’]

The boxes represent two opposing ''wants'' that represent the conflict (D, D’){{refn|group=note|The conflict can take the form of either "do this vs don't do this", or "do action 1 vs do action 2" where both actions can't be done at once.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=10}} }}, the ''needs'' that each want is trying to satisfy (B, C), and a common ''objective'' or goal (A) that both needs are trying to fulfil.{{refn|group=note|For example, a cloud based on an airlines case study&lt;ref name=polito2006&gt;Polito, Tony, Kevin Watson, and Robert J. Vokurka. "Using the theory of constraints to improve competitiveness: an airline case study." Competitiveness Review: An International Business Journal incorporating Journal of Global Competitiveness 16.1 (2006): 44-50.&lt;/ref&gt; has the conflict (D vs D’) stated as "minimize service costs" vs "do not minimize service costs." The needs (B, C) are stated respectively as "have the least cost" and "have superior service", with the common objective (A) being to "provide quality".}}

The lines or arrows connecting the nodes represent the rationale or causal assumptions that are used to link the nodes. When communicating the cloud, the arrows should be read as “in order to” or “because” or “so that”. For example: ''“In order to achieve '''A''' we require '''B''' because there is no way we can have '''A''' without '''B'''.”'' Or: ''“There is no way we can have '''D''' and have '''D’''' ''(read as "D-prime")'' at the same time.”''

== Origin of Name ==
According to Scheinkopf (2002) the Evaporating Cloud is so named in honor of [[Richard Bach]]. In Bach's 1977 book ''[[Illusions_(Bach_novel)|Illusions]]'', the main characters remove storm clouds from the sky by thinking them away.
:''If you really want to remove a cloud from your life, you do not make a big production out of it, you just relax and remove it from your thinking. That’s all there is to it.''&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Richard, Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah. Dell Publishing, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Evaporating Cloud tool is intended to similarly "vapourize" difficult problems by resolving an underlying conflict.
:''[Goldratt teaches] that every problem is a conﬂict, and that conﬂicts arise because we create them by believing at least one erroneous assumption. Thus, simply by thinking about the assumptions that enforce the existence of a conﬂict, we should be able to resolve any conﬂict by evaporating it with the power of our thinking.''&lt;ref&gt;Scheinkopf, Lisa J. Thinking for a change: Putting the TOC thinking processes to use. CRC Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps in problem solving ==
The general process for applying an EC to problem solving is described by Cohen (2010) as follows:&lt;ref name="handbook24"&gt;James F. Cox III, Ph.D, CFPIM, CIRM; John G. Schleier, Jr.: Theory of Constraints Handbook. Daily Management with TOC, Chapter (McGraw-Hill Professional, 2010), AccessEngineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=676}}
# Identify the type of problem (there are variations in the way the diagrams are constructed for different types of problems.)
# Write a storyline of this problem in a factual, objective way, even if the problem causes an emotional upset.
# Build the Cloud (see example guides below).
# Check the logical statements of the Cloud and make necessary corrections and upgrades.
# Surface the assumptions behind the logical connections to find the one that is supporting the conflict.{{refn|group=note|Usually the best connections to examine are the ones between C-D′ or B-D. While addressing the D-D′ connection is ideal, it is not usually feasible.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=681-684}} }}
# Construct your solution and check it for win-win.
# Communicate the solution to the people involved in dealing with the problem.

Clouds are "built" by filling in the appropriate boxes with statements about the situation. Both the wording of the statements and the sequence of filling the boxes can be important. Below is a guide to the recommended sequence and questions for building ''Day-to-day Conflict'' or ''Inner Dilemma'' clouds.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|pages=679, 689}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| D || What action does the other side want to do/do I feel under pressure to do?
|-

| C || What need is satisfied by my action in D′?
|-
| B || What need is satisfied by their/my action in D?
|-
| A || What common objective will be achieved by meeting both need B and need C?
|}

Different types of problems have slightly different requirements when it comes to documenting and communicating the underlying conflict. Below is a summary of different types of problems, and the suggested sequence for building and communicating the cloud.&lt;ref name="handbook24"/&gt;{{rp|page=711}}

== Example ==
Goldratt has illustrated the use of the evaporating cloud technique in a discussion of the [[Economic production quantity]] model.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990&gt;E.M. Goldratt. What is this thing called the Theory of Constraints and how is it implemented? North River Press: Crofton-on-Hudson NY, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=43}} The prerequisite wants are to ''run large batches'' (D) and yet to ''run small batches'' (D’). These are clearly in conflict. The required need that D is trying to meet is to ''reduce setup cost'' (B), whereas the D’ prerequisite needs to ''reduce carrying cost per unit'' (C). Both requirements are aimed at the objective (A): to ''reduce cost per unit''.

[[Image:Evaporating Cloud Example.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|EC example illustrating the problem of the Economic Batch Quantity.]]
Fedurko (2011) recommends checking the logic of the EC by reading the logical statements aloud, in the following sequence:&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|pages=13, 22}}
#In order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run ''large'' batches.
#in order to reduce cost per unit, we must reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#In order to reduce carrying cost per unit we must run ''small'' batches.
#Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict.
#Running ''large'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''carrying'' cost per unit.
#Running ''small'' batches puts in danger the need to reduce ''setup'' cost per unit.

According to Fedurko,
:''Reading aloud ... is needed because it explicitly employs the auditory channel as an additional mechanism to process and check the logic.''&lt;ref name=fedurko2011 /&gt;{{rp|page=13}}

Goldratt claims that each of the logical connections in the EC represent an (often hidden) assumption.
:''One of the most basic fundamentals of logic is, that behind any logical connection there is an assumption.''&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|page=47}}

The assumptions behind the above connections can be surfaced by again reading the statements with a "because" clause added.&lt;ref name=fedurko2011/&gt;{{rp|page=31}} For example, Goldratt surfaces the following assumptions behind the 2nd statement in the example EC:
*In order to reduce setup cost per unit we must run large batches, ''because''
*#setup cost is fixed and can't be reduced.
*#the machine being set up is a bottleneck with no spare capacity.&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=48-50}}
And again, with the 5th statement:
*Running ''large'' batches and running ''small'' batches are in direct conflict, ''because'':
*#large is the opposite of small.
*#there is only one meaning to the word "batch".&lt;ref name=goldratt1990/&gt;{{rp|pages=50-51}}

The second assumption is challenged by distinguishing between ''production batch'' size (between setups) and ''transfer batch'' size (between workstations), and so allowing different sized batches for different purposes.

== Core Conflict Cloud ==
The '''Core Conflict Cloud''' is an Evaporating Cloud that emerges from analysis of a [[current reality tree (Theory of constraints)|current reality tree]] (CRT), which is one of the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]]. The CRT provides a way for analyzing many system or organizational problems at once, treating them as symptoms of a single core problem.
If an easy solution to such a core problem has not already been implemented, it is likely there is some conflict in the organization that is blocking implementation.&lt;ref name=tocma&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Core Conflict Cloud is to address this inherent conflict that is preventing the sorting out of the core problem.&lt;ref name=handbook24/&gt;{{rp|page=710}}

[[File:GIST Logo.jpg|thumbnail]]
The '''Global Innovation through Science and Technology initiative''' ('''GIST''') is a U.S. government program on innovation and entrepreneurship. The program assists businesspeople to establish startups. GIST participants in 135 emerging economies can develop skills, build networks, find mentors, and access financing through a combination of in-country training, a pitch competition, interactive online programming, and direct connections to U.S. experts. GIST helps create conditions for successful local entrepreneurship ecosystems and enables global youth to develop local solutions to local problems.  GIST is also one of the key programs under President Obama's SPARK Initiative, an initiative under which programs are selected to represent the best work being done by the U.S. Government to advance entrepreneurship around the world.

Since 2011, GIST has engaged more than 2.8 million innovators and entrepreneurs worldwide and mentored over 5,000 startups that have generated more than $110 million in revenue. GIST is a partnership led by the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]], with implementation of programs by [[Venturewell]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

==Launch ==
The GIST programs were announced at the 2011 conference on Economic Development through Science and Technology Innovation in Rabat, Morocco attended by U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]] Dr. Kerri-Ann Jones. This conference was the third and final consultative meeting to develop high impact engagement opportunities. Previous meetings were held in Alexandria, Egypt and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GIST Initiative Launches Innovation and Entrepreneurship Programs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/06/166490.htm|agency=U.S. Department of State|publisher=Office of the Spokesperson|date=18 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GIST initiative exemplifies a science and technology innovation partnership that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] called for in a 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by the President at Cairo University|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-Cairo-University-6-04-09|website=White House|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GIST assists entrepeneurs in 135 emerging economies through its Global Online Innovation Community, including online programming and mentorship; in-country training programs, the GIST Startup Boot Camps, GIST Ideation Boot Camps and GIST Villages; and the annual GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition.

==Global Online Innovation Community==

GISTNetwork is a government program led by the Department of State that provides a user-driven online resource to help young science and technology entrepreneurs in emerging economies build viable startups. GISTNetwork connects entrepreneurs to peers, mentors, experts, and financing both globally and within their communities.

GISTNetwork’s online community provides:  Mentors from top U.S. universities, Silicon Valley startups and local communities around the world; live and on-demand programming, including pages focused on specific local communities; and access to international angel investors and venture capitalists and a meeting place to find entrepreneurial team members.

==GIST Online Programming==

GIST online programming provides in-country entrepreneurs with direct online access to U.S. businesspeople and academics. The two key online programs are the GIST TechConnect and GIST Guru Series.

==GIST In-Country Training Programs== 
GIST in-country programs nurture the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs through direct, on-the-ground training.  Top U.S. and in-country leaders teach and mentor aspiring entrepreneurs, who also develop financial know-how and access to capital that allow them  to advance their science and technology ventures with skill and confidence. There are three main in-country programs: GIST Ideation Boot Camps; GIST Startup Boot Camps; and GIST Villages.

==GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition==

The GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition is an annual competition for science and technology entrepreneurs from emerging economies worldwide. Participants produce videos to pitch their ideas and startups, which are reviewed first by a panel of experts and then by the online voting public. Finalists receive a trip to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), three months of one-to-one mentoring, and the chance to win seed capital.  Through two days of intensive training and pitching their ventures at the GES, GIST Tech-I finalists make connections and gain international exposure.

Since 2011, innovators from over 100 emerging economies have showcased their science and technology ventures through GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competitions, with over one million votes from the online voting public.

The first Tech-I competition occurred in 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. Notable Tech-I finalists have included Nermin Sa'd, founder of Hanadisayat.net from Jordan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghazal|first1=Mohammad|title=Mechanical engineers, mothers work from home to keep career passion alive|url=http://jordantimes.com/mechanical-engineers-mothers-work-from-home-to-keep-career-passion-alive|accessdate=4 August 2014|publisher=Jordan Times|date=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Natali Ardianto, founder and COO of Tiket.com from Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Global Emerging Startups Showcase at D.C.

The '''history of capitalism''' has diverse and much debated roots, but fully-fledged [[capitalism]] is generally thought to have emerged in north-west Europe, especially in the [[Low Countries]] (mainly present-day [[Flanders]] and [[Netherlands]]) and [[Great Britain|Britain]], in the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries. Over the following centuries, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] has been accumulated by a variety of different methods, in a variety of scales, and associated with a great deal of variation in the concentration of economic power and wealth, and capitalism has gradually become the dominant economic system throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Scott 2005"&gt;Scott (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the history of the past five hundred years is, therefore, concerned with the development of capitalism in its various forms.

==Varieties of capitalism==
It is an ongoing debate within the fields of economics and sociology as to what the past, current and future stages of capitalism consist of. While ongoing disagreement about exact stages exists, many economists have posited the following general states. These states are not mutually exclusive and do not represent a fixed order of historical change, but do represent a broadly chronological trend.
* ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism, a social system in which the government is exclusively devoted to the protection of individual rights, including property rights – one in which there exists absolutely no government intervention in the economy.
* Agrarian capitalism, sometimes known as market feudalism. This was a transitional form between feudalism and capitalism, whereby market relations replaced some but not all of feudal relations in a society.
* [[Mercantilism]], where national governments sought to maintain positive balances of trade and acquire gold bullion.
* [[Industrial capitalism]], characterized by its use of heavy machinery and a much more pronounced division of labor.
* [[Monopoly capitalism]], marked by the rise of monopolies and trusts dominating industry as well as other aspects of society. Often used to describe the economy of the late 19th and early 20th century.
* [[Colonialism]], where governments sought to colonize other areas to improve access to markets and raw materials and improve the standing of nationally based capitalist firms. Predominant in the 1890s, notably as a response to the economic crises of the 1890s.
* [[Welfare capitalism]], where mixed economies predominated and governments sought to provide a safety net to alleviate the worst abuses of capitalism. The heyday of welfare capitalism (in advanced economies) is widely seen to be from 1945 to 1973 as major social safety nets were put in place in most advanced capitalist economies.&lt;ref name="A People pg. 251-397"&gt;"A People's History of the World" Chris Harman pp. 251–397&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mass production]], post-World War II, saw the rising hegemony of major corporations and a focus on mass production, mass consumption and (ideally) mass employment. This stage sees the rise of advertising as a way to promote mass consumption and often sees significant economic planning taking place within firms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"The New Industrial State" J.K. Galbraith pp. 16–35&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State capitalism]], where the state intervened to prevent economic instability, including partially or fully nationalizing certain industries. Some economists also include the economies of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] in this category.&lt;ref name="Michael Barratt 1974 pp. 309–30: Chapter 12"&gt;"The Economics of Imperialism" [[Michael Barratt Brown]] pp. 309–30 (Chapter12)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corporatism]], where government, business and labor collude to make major national decisions. Notable for being an economic model of fascism, it can overlap with, but is still significantly different from state capitalism.
* [[Financialization]], or [[financial capitalism]], where financial parts of the economy (like the finance, insurance, or real estate sectors) predominate in an economy. Profit becomes more derived from ownership of an asset, credit, rents and earning interest, rather than actual productive processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Zombie Capitalism" Chris Harman pp. 142–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marois, Thomas (2012) "Finance, Finance Capital, and Financialisation." In: Fine, Ben and Saad Filho, Alfredo, (eds.), ''The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics''. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
The processes by which capitalism came about, evolved, and spread, are the subject of extensive research and debate among historians. Debates sometimes circle around how ''capitalism'' is defined, but a significant body of work has been able to bring substantive historical data to bear on key questions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Biernacki, review of Ellen Meiksins Wood (1999), ''[[The Origin of Capitalism]]'' (Monthly Review Press, 1999), in ''Contemporary Sociology,'' Vol. 29, No. 4 (Jul., 2000), pp. 638–39 {{JSTOR|2654574}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key parameters of debate include: how far capitalism is a natural human behaviour and how far it arises from specific historical circumstances; whether its origins lie in towns and trade or in rural property relations; the role of class conflict; the role of the state; how far it is a distinctively European innovation; its relationship with European imperialism; whether technological change is a driver or merely an epiphenomenon of capitalism; and whether or not it is the most beneficial way to organise human societies.&lt;ref name="Ellen Meiksins Wood 2002"&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''[[The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View]]'' (London: Verso, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiography of capitalism can be divided into two broad schools. One is associated with [[economic liberalism]], with the eighteenth-century economist [[Adam Smith]] as a foundational figure, and one with [[Marxism]], drawing particular inspiration from the nineteenth-century economist [[Karl Marx]]. Liberals tend to view capitalism as an expression of natural human behaviours which have been in evidence for millennia, and the most beneficial way of promoting human wellbeing. They tend to see capitalism as originating in trade and commerce, and freeing people to exercise their entrepreneurial natures. Marxists tend to view capitalism as a historically unusual system of relationships between classes, which could be replaced by other economic systems which would serve human wellbeing better. They tend to see capitalism as originating in more powerful people taking control of the means of production, and compelling others to sell their labour as a commodity.&lt;ref name="Ellen Meiksins Wood 2002"/&gt; For these reasons, much of the work on the history of capitalism has been [[Marxist historiography|broadly Marxist]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Origins of capitalism ===
The origins of capitalism have been much debated (and depend partly on how the defining features of capitalism are defined). The traditional account, originating in classical eighteenth-century liberal economic thought and still often articulated, is the 'commercialization model'. This sees capitalism originating in trade. Since evidence for trade is found even in palaeolithic culture, it can be seen as natural to human societies. In this reading, capitalism emerged from earlier trade once merchants had acquired sufficient wealth (referred to as '[[primitive capital]]') to begin investing in increasingly productive technology. This account tends to see capitalism as a natural continuation of trade, arising when people's natural entrepreneurialism was freed from the constraints of [[feudalism]], partly by urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002.), pp. 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it traces capitalism to early forms of [[merchant capitalism]] practiced in Western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Banaji"&gt;Jairus Banaji (2007), "Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism", ''Journal Historical Materialism'' 15#1 pp. 47–74, Brill Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Thomas Hall (2000) notes, "The [[Song dynasty|Sung Empire]] in particular nearly underwent a transformation to capitalism in the tenth century C.E. But the only states to be controlled by capitalists before the European transformation in the seventeenth century were semiperipheral capitalist city-states such as the [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenician cities]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and [[Malacca#History|Malacca]]. These operated in the interstices between the tributary states and empires, and though they were agents of commodification, they existed within larger systems in which the logic of state-based coercion remained dominant. The first capitalist [[nation-state]] was the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century. This coming to state power by capitalists in an emerging core region signaled the triumph of regional capitalism in the European subsystem."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Thomas D. (2000). ''A World-Systems Reader: New Perspectives on Gender, Urbanism, Cultures, Indigenous Peoples, and Ecology'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Werner Sombart]]'s words, "In all probability the [[United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] were the land in which the capitalist spirit for the first time attained its fullest maturity; where this maturity related to all its aspects, which were equally developed; and where this development had never been done comprehensive before. Moreover, in the Netherlands an entire people became imbued with the capitalist spirit; so much so, that in the 17th century Holland was universally regarded as the land of capitalism par exellence; it was envied by all other nations, who put forth their keenest endeavours in their desire to emulate it; it was the high school of every art of the tradesman, and the well-watered garden wherein the [[middle-class]] virtues throve."&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Sombart|Sombart, Werner]]: ''The Quintessence of Capitalism: A Study of the History and Psychology of the Modern Business Man''.

====Other views====

However, the 'commercialization model' has been questioned, with a leading competitor being the 'agrarian model'. This notes that traditional mercantilism focused on moving goods from markets where they were cheap to markets where they were expensive rather than investing in production, and that many cultures (including the early modern [[Dutch Republic]]) saw urbanisation, and merchants amassing great wealth, without capitalist production emerging.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Harman, '[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj102/harman.htm The Rise of Capitalism]', ''International Socialism Journal'', 102 (Spring 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The 'agrarian model' instead argues that capitalism arose from unique circumstances in English agrarianism.

The agrarian argument developed particularly through [[Karl Polanyi]]'s ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), [[Maurice Dobb]]'s ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism'' (1946), and [[Robert Brenner]]'s research in the 1970s, the discussion of which is known as the [[Brenner Debate]]. In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible to be able to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]]. In this reading, 'it was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), quoting p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'crisis of the fourteenth century'===
[[File:Plan mediaeval manor.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of a [[Manorialism|medieval manor]]. Notice the large commons area and the division of land into small strips. The mustard-colored areas are part of the '''[[demesne]]''', the [[hatching|hatched]] areas part of the '''[[glebe]]'''.&lt;br /&gt;William R. Shepherd, ''Historical Atlas'', 01923]]
According to some{{which|date=June 2015}} historians, the modern capitalist system has its origin in the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|"crisis of the fourteenth century"]], a conflict between the land-owning aristocracy and the agricultural producers, or [[Serfdom|serfs]].  [[Manorial]] arrangements inhibited the development of capitalism in a number of ways.  Serfs had obligations to produce for lords and therefore had no interest in technological innovation; they also had no interest in cooperating with one another since they produced to sustain their own families. The lords who owned the land{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} relied on force to guarantee that they were provided with sufficient food.  Because lords were not producing to sell on the market, there was no competitive pressure for them to innovate.  Finally, because lords expanded their power and wealth through military means, they spent their wealth on military equipment or on [[conspicuous consumption]] that helped foster alliances with other lords; they had no incentive to invest in developing new productive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Robert, 1977, "The Origins of Capitalist Development: a Critique of Neo-Smithian Marxism," in ''New Left Review'' 104: 36–37, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Medieval demography|demographic]] crisis of the fourteenth century upset this arrangement.  This crisis had several causes: agricultural productivity reached its technological limitations and stopped growing, bad weather led to the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] of 1315–1317, and the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1350 led to a population crash.  These factors led to a decline in agricultural production.  In response, [[feudal lord]]s sought to expand agricultural production by expanding their domains through warfare; they therefore demanded more tribute from their serfs to pay for military expenses.  In England, many serfs rebelled.  Some moved to towns, some purchased land, and some entered into favorable contracts to rent lands from lords who needed to repopulate their estates.&lt;ref&gt;Dobb, Maurice 1947  ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism.''  New York: International Publishers Co., Inc. 42–46, 48 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the ''[[Manorialism|manorial]]'' system in England enlarged the class of [[tenant farmer]]s with more freedom to market their goods and thus more incentive to invest in new technologies.  Lords who did not want to rely on renters could buy out or evict tenant farmers, but then had to hire free labor to work their estates, giving them an incentive to invest in two very different kinds of commodity owners: those who had money, the means of production, and subsistence, who were eager to [[valorisation|valorize]] the sum of value they had appropriated by buying the labor power of others{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}; and the free workers, who sold their own labor power and, therefore, labor. The free workers were "free workers" in the double sense that they neither formed part of the means of production nor did they own the means of production that transformed land and even money into what we now call "capital".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl [1867] 1976 ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy Volume One'' trans. Ben Fowkes.  Harmondsworth and London: Penguin Books and New Left Review. 874&lt;/ref&gt;
Marx labeled this period the "pre-history of capitalism".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marx, Karl [1867] 1976 ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy Volume One'' trans. Ben Fowkes.  Harmondsworth and London: Penguin Books and New Left Review. 875&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, [[feudalism]] began to lay some of the foundations necessary for the development of [[mercantilism]], a precursor of capitalism. Feudalism was mostly confined to Europe{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and lasted from the medieval period through the sixteenth century.  Feudal manors were almost entirely self-sufficient, and therefore limited the role of the market.  This stifled any incipient tendency towards capitalism.  However, the relatively sudden emergence of new technologies and discoveries, particularly in agriculture&lt;ref&gt;James Fulcher, Capitalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004) 19&lt;/ref&gt; and exploration, facilitated the growth of capitalism.  The most important development at the end of feudalism{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} was the emergence of what Robert Degan calls "the dichotomy between wage earners and capitalist merchants".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The competitive nature meant there are always winners and losers, and this became clear as feudalism evolved into mercantilism, an economic system characterized by the private or corporate ownership of capital goods, investments determined by private decisions, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods determined mainly by competition in a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Enclosure===
{{Main article|Enclosure}}
[[File:Decaying hedge - geograph.org.uk - 1715089.jpg|thumb|300px|Decaying hedges mark the lines of the straight field boundaries created by a Parliamentary Act of Enclosure.]]
England in the 16th century was already a centralized state, in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country, creating a large internal market for goods, in contrast to the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. The economic foundations of the agricultural system were also beginning to diverge substantially; the manorial system had broken down by this time, and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. The system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try out better methods, and the tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods, in order to succeed in an increasingly competitive [[labour market]]. Land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation, and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces.

An important aspect of this process of change was the [[enclosure of common land|enclosure]]&lt;ref&gt;"Enclosure" is the modern spelling, while "inclosure" is an older spelling still used in the United Kingdom in [[legal document]]s and [[place name]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[common land]] previously held in the [[open field system]] where peasants had traditional rights, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] and [[grazing]] [[livestock]]. Once enclosed, these uses of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be land for commons. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist and neo-Marxist historians]] argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless [[working class]] that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the [[north of England]]. For example: "In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|authorlink=E.

==Merchant capitalism and mercantilism==
{{Main article|Merchant capitalism|Mercantilism}}

===Precedents===
[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638, at the height of mercantilism.]]
The earliest recorded activity of long-distance profit-seeking merchants can be traced back to the Old Assyrian merchants active in the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Warburton, David, ''Macroeconomics from the beginning: The General Theory, Ancient Markets, and the Rate of Interest''. Paris: Recherches et Publications, 2003. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire developed more advanced forms of commerce, and similarly widespread networks existed in Islamic nations, but capitalism took shape in Europe in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. However, while trade has existed since early in human history, it was not capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 73–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early emergence of commerce occurred on monastic estates in Italy and France and in the independent [[Italian city-states|city republics]] of Italy during the late [[Middle Ages]]. Innovations in banking, insurance, accountancy, and various production and commercial practices linked closely to a 'spirit' of frugality, reinvestment, and city life, promoted attitudes which sociologists have tended to associate only with [[northern Europe]], [[Protestantism]] and a much later age. The city republics maintained their political independence from [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] and [[Catholic Church|Church]], traded with [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]], and introduced Eastern practices. They were also considerably different from the absolutist monarchies of Spain and France, and were strongly attached to civic liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. ''Victory of Reason'', (Random House New York, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall. The Ascent of Money, (Penguin,2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Quentin, The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, vol I: The Renaissance; vol II: The Age of Reformation. Cambridge University Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
Modern capitalism, however, only fully emerged in the [[early modern period]] between the 16th and 18th centuries, with the establishment of [[mercantilism]] or merchant capitalism.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2003"&gt;Burnham, Peter ''Capitalism, the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', 2003 Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2006"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early evidence for mercantilistic practices appears in early modern [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], and [[Pisa]] over the [[Mediterranean]] trade in [[bullion]]. The region of mercantilism's real birth, however, was the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;John J. McCusker, ''Mercantilism and the Economic History of the Early Modern Atlantic World'' (Cambridge UP, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Josiah Child, Bt by John Riley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Josiah Child|Sir Josiah Child]], an influential proponent of [[mercantilism]]. Painting attributed to [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]].]]
England began a large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the [[Elizabethan Era]]. An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: "We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them."&lt;ref&gt;Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in {{Harvtxt|Braudel|1979}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home. Queen Elizabeth promoted the Trade and Navigation Acts in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping.

These efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of England against the far larger and more powerful [[Spanish Empire]], and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include [[Gerard de Malynes]] and [[Thomas Mun]], who first articulated the [[Elizabethan System]]. The latter's  ''England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure'' gave a systematic and coherent explanation of the concept of [[balance of trade]]. It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Onnekink|author2=Gijs Rommelse|title=Ideology and Foreign Policy in Early Modern Europe (1650–1750)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1QdbzdTimsC&amp;pg=PA257|year= 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=257|isbn=9781409419143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantile doctrines were further developed by [[Josiah Child]]. Numerous French authors helped to cement French policy around mercantilism in the 17th century. [[French mercantilism]] was best articulated by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (in office, 1665–1683), although his policies were greatly liberalised under [[Napoleon]].

===Doctrines===
Under mercantilism, European merchants, backed by state controls, [[subsidy|subsidies]], and monopolies, made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], the purpose of mercantilism was "the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices..."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in the medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], the state superseded the local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy.
[[File:De slag bij Terheide - The Battle of Schevening - August 10 1653 (Willem van de Velde I, 1657).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were fought between the English and the Dutch for control over the seas and trade routes.]]
Among the major tenets of mercantilist theory was [[bullionism]], a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating [[precious metals]]. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported; and promoted government subsidies, such as the granting of monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s, were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.

Proponents of mercantilism emphasized state power and overseas conquest as the principal aim of economic policy. If a state could not supply its own raw materials, according to the mercantilists, it should acquire colonies from which they could be extracted. Colonies constituted not only sources of supply for raw materials but also markets for finished products. Because it was not in the interests of the state to allow competition, to help the mercantilists, colonies should be prevented from engaging in manufacturing and trading with foreign powers.

Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.&lt;ref name="Scott 2005"/&gt; Noting the various pre-capitalist features of mercantilism, [[Karl Polanyi]] argued that "mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production – labor and land – from becoming the elements of commerce"; thus with mercantilism regulation was more akin to feudalism than capitalism. According to Polanyi, "not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date."&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl. ''The Great Transformation''. Beacon Press, Boston. 1944. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chartered trading companies===
[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg|225px|thumb|right|150px|British East India Company 1801]]
The [[Muscovy Company]] was the first major [[chartered company|chartered]] [[Joint stock company|joint stock]] English [[trading company]] established in 1555 with a [[monopoly]] on [[trade]] between England and [[Muscovy]]. It was an offshoot of the earlier ''[[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]'', founded in 1551 by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] and Sir [[Hugh Willoughby (sea captain)|Hugh Willoughby]] to locate the [[Northeast Passage]] to China to allow trade. This was the precursor to a type of business that would soon flourish in England, the [[Dutch Republic]] and elsewhere.

The British [[East India Company]] (1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602) launched an era of large state chartered trading companies.&lt;ref name="Banaji" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic system :: Market systems|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178493/economic-system/61117/Market-systems#toc242146|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies were characterized by their monopoly on trade, granted by [[letters patent]] provided by the state. Recognized as chartered [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] by the state, these companies enjoyed power, ranging from lawmaking, military, and treaty-making privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=chartered company |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ch/chartere.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109044147/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ch/chartere.html |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by its colonial and [[expansionism|expansionary]] powers by states, powerful nation-states sought to accumulate [[precious metal]]s, and military conflicts arose.&lt;ref name="Banaji" /&gt; During this era, merchants, who had previously traded on their own, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a [[return on investment]].

==Industrial capitalism==
[[File:Dore London.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]'s 19th-century engraving depicted the dirty, overcrowded slums where the industrial workers of London lived.]]

[[Mercantilism]] declined in [[Great Britain]] in the mid-18th century, when a new group of economic theorists, led by [[Adam Smith]], challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines as the belief that the amount of the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state. However, in more undeveloped economies, such as [[Prussia]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], with their much younger manufacturing bases, mercantilism continued to find favor after other states had turned to newer doctrines.

The mid-18th century gave rise to industrial capitalism, made possible by (1) the accumulation of vast amounts of capital under the merchant phase of capitalism and its investment in machinery, and (2) the fact that the Enclosures meant that Britain had a large population of people with no access to subsistence agriculture, who needed to buy basic commodities via the market, thus ensuing a mass consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood (2002), ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'' (London: Verso, 2002), pp. 142–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial capitalism, which Marx dated from the last third of the 18th century, marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work process and the routinization of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2003"/&gt;

During the resulting [[Industrial Revolution]], the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and effected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, [[guild]]s, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, capitalism marked the transformation of relations between the British landowning gentry and peasants, giving rise to the production of [[cash crop]]s for the market rather than for subsistence on a [[feudal]] [[Manorialism|manor]]. The surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture.

===Industrial Revolution===
{{main article|Industrial Revolution}}
The productivity gains of capitalist production began a sustained and unprecedented increase at the turn of the 19th century, in a process commonly referred to as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Starting in about 1760 in England, there was a steady transition to new manufacturing processes in a variety of industries, including going from hand production methods to machine production, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of [[water wheel|water power]], the increasing use of steam power and the development of [[machine tool]]s. It also included the change from wood and other bio-fuels to coal.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spinning mule]], built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].]]
In [[textile]] manufacturing, mechanized cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of about 1000, due to the application of [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]], [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]], [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[Spinning Mule]] and other inventions.  The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ayres |first1=Robert |author1-link= Robert Ayres (scientist) |title=Technological Transformations and Long Waves|year=1989 |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton gin increased productivity or removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.

===Finance===
[[File:Frankfurt Taunusbahnhof 1850.jpg|thumb|The [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild family]] revolutionised international finance. The [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt terminus]] of the [[Taunus Railway]] was financed by the Rothschilds and opened in 1840 as one of Germany's first railways.]]
The growth of Britain's industry stimulated a concomitant growth in her system of [[finance]] and [[credit (finance)|credit]]. In the 18th century, services offered by banks increased. Clearing facilities, security investments, [[cheque]]s and [[overdraft]] protections were introduced.
[[Cheque]]s were invented in the 17th century in England and banks settled payments by direct courier to the issuing bank.  Around 1770, they began meeting in a central location, and by the 19th century a dedicated space was established, known as a [[bankers' clearing house]].  The London clearing house used a method where each bank paid cash to and then was paid cash by an inspector at the end of each day. The first overdraft facility was set up in 1728 by [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]].

The end of the [[Napoleonic War]] and the subsequent rebound in trade, led to an expansion in the [[bullion]] reserves held by the [[Bank of England]], from a low of under 4 million pounds in 1821 to 14&amp;nbsp;million pounds by late 1824.

Older innovations became routine parts of financial life during the 19th century. The [[Bank of England]] first issued bank notes during the 17th century, but the notes were hand written and few in number. After 1725 they were partially printed, but cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to a named person. In 1844, parliament passed the [[Bank Charter Act]] tying these notes to [[gold reserves]], effectively creating the institution of [[central bank]]ing and [[monetary policy]]. The notes became fully printed and widely available from 1855.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Growing international trade increased the number of banks, especially in London. These new "merchant banks" facilitated trade growth, profiting from England's emerging dominance in seaborne shipping. Two immigrant families, [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Barings Bank|Baring]], established merchant banking firms in London in the late 18th century and came to dominate world banking in the next century. The tremendous wealth amassed by these banking firms soon attracted much attention. The poet [[George Gordon Byron]] wrote in 1823: "Who makes politics run glibber all?/ The shade of Bonaparte's noble daring?/ Jew [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and his fellow-Christian, Baring."

The operation of banks also shifted. At the beginning of the century, banking was still an elite preoccupation of a handful of very wealthy families. Within a few decades, however, a new sort of banking had emerged, owned by anonymous [[stockholder]]s, run by professional [[Management|managers]], and the recipient of the deposits of a growing body of small middle-class savers. Although this new breed of banks was new in prominence, it was not newly invented – the [[Quaker]] family [[Barclays Bank|Barclays]], had been banking in this manner since 1690.

===Free trade and globalization===
At the height of the [[First French Empire]], [[Napoleon]] sought to introduce a "[[continental system]]" that would render Europe economically autonomous, thereby emasculating British trade and commerce. It involved such stratagems as the use of [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]] in preference to the cane sugar that had to be imported from the tropics. Although this caused businessmen in England to agitate for peace, the government was able to persevere, in part because the United Kingdom was well into the [[industrial revolution]]. The war had the opposite effect – it stimulated the growth of certain industries like [[pig iron|pig-iron]] output, which was just 68,000 tons in 1788 and soared to 244,000 tons by 1806.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] become the first global economic [[superpower]], because of superior manufacturing technology and improved global communications such as [[steamship]]s and [[railroad]]s.]]
In 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:
: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''

By the mid 19th century, Britain was firmly wedded to the notion of [[free trade]] and the first era of globalization began.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2003" /&gt; In the 1840s, the [[Corn Laws]] and the [[Navigation Acts]] were repealed, ushering in a new age of free trade. In line with the teachings of the classical political economists, led by [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], Britain embraced [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], encouraging competition and the development of a [[market economy]].

[[Industrialization]] allowed cheap production of household items using [[economies of scale]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]]. After the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s and the completion of British conquest of India, vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of European exports. It was in this period that areas of [[Sub Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, by Europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as [[rubber]], [[diamonds]] and [[coal]] and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/tr_show01.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date=1929-10-24 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|200x200px|The [[gold standard]] formed the financial basis of the international economy from 1870 to 1914.]]

Militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper. What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in August 1914.}}

The global financial system was mainly tied to the [[gold standard]] in this period. The United Kingdom first formally adopted this standard in 1821. Soon to follow was [[United Province of Canada|Canada]] in 1853, [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1865, and the United States and Germany (''[[de jure]]'') in 1873. New technologies, such as the [[telegraph]], the [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]], the [[Radiotelephone]], the [[steamship]], and [[railway]] allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bordo, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas A. Irwin. "Is Globalization Today Really Different than Globalization a Hundred Years Ago?". NBER Working Paper No.7195. June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption of [[American civil war|civil war]] in the United States in 1861 and the blockade of its ports to international commerce meant that the main supply of [[cotton]] for the [[Lancashire]] looms was cut off. The textile industries shifted to reliance upon cotton from Africa and Asia during the course of the U.S. civil war, and this fact created pressure for an Anglo-French controlled canal through the [[Suez]] peninsula. The [[Suez canal]] opened in 1869; in the same year the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] that spanned the North American continent was completed. Capitalism and the engine of profit was making the globe a smaller place.

==Twentieth century==
Several major challenges to capitalism appeared in the early part of the 20th century.  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] in 1917 established the first socialist state in the world; a decade later, the [[Great Depression]] triggered increasing criticism of the existing capitalist system.  One response to this crisis was a turn to [[fascism]], an ideology which advocated state-influenced capitalism{{Citation needed|reason=State-influenced capitalism is capitalism as a state is required to manage private property.|date=November 2016}}; whilst others rejected capitalism altogether in favor of communist or socialist ideologies.

===Keynesianism and free markets===
{{Main article|Keynesianism|Neoliberalism}}
[[File:NY stock exchange traders floor LC-U9-10548-6.jpg|thumb|right|The New York [[stock exchange]] [[trading room|traders' floor]] (1963)]]
The economic recovery of the world's leading capitalist economies in the period following the end of the Great Depression and the [[Second World War]]—a period of unusually rapid growth by historical standards—eased discussion of capitalism's eventual decline or demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stanley Engerman |author2=Seymour Drescher |author3=Robert Paquette |title=Slavery (Oxford Readers)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state began to play an increasingly prominent role to moderate and regulate the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.

[[Keynesian]] economics became a widely accepted method of government regulation and countries such as the United Kingdom experimented with [[mixed economies]] in which the state owned and operated certain major industries.

The state also expanded in the US; in 1929, total government expenditures amounted to less than one-tenth of [[GNP]]; from the 1970s they amounted to around one-third.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2006"/&gt; Similar increases were seen in all industrialized capitalist economies, some of which, such as France, have reached even higher ratios of government expenditures to GNP than the United States.

A broad array of new analytical tools in the [[social sciences]] were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period, including the concepts of [[post-industrial society]] and the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Burnham 2003"/&gt;

The long postwar boom ended in the 1970s, amid the economic crises experienced following the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barnes, Trevor J.|title=Reading economic geography|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23554-X|page=127|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s led many economic commentators and politicians to embrace [[neoliberalism|market-oriented]] policy prescriptions inspired by the laissez-faire capitalism and [[classical liberalism]] of the 19th century, particularly under the influence of [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. The theoretical alternative to [[Keynesianism]] was more compatible with laissez-faire and emphasized rapid expansion of the economy. Market-oriented solutions gained increasing support in the capitalist world, especially under leadership of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the U.S. and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK in the 1980s. Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called [[collectivist]] concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called "remarketized capitalism."&lt;ref name="Fulcher, James 2004"&gt;Fulcher, James. Capitalism. 1st ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eyes of many economic and political commentators, the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] brought further evidence of the superiority of market capitalism over planned economy.

===Globalization===
[[File:NYSESecurity.JPG|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]].]]
Although overseas trade has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with [[globalization]] have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development. Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[world system]] (Burnham).  However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doug Henwood]] is an economists who has argued that the heyday of globalization was during the mid-19th century.  For example, he writes in ''What Is Globalization Anyway?'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only is the novelty of "globalization" exaggerated, so is its extent. Capital flows were freer, and foreign holdings by British investors far larger, 100 years ago than anything we see today. Images of multinational corporations shuttling raw materials and parts around the world, as if the whole globe were an assembly line, are grossly overblown, accounting for only about a tenth of U.S. trade.[https://web.archive.org/web/20011130131557/http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/1999-11/26henwood.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the abandonment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, and the strict state control of foreign exchange rates, the total value of transactions in foreign exchange was estimated to be at least twenty times greater than that of all foreign movements of goods and services (EB). The internationalization of finance, which some see as beyond the reach of state control, combined with the growing ease with which large corporations have been able to relocate their operations to low-wage states, has posed the question of the 'eclipse' of state sovereignty, arising from the growing 'globalization' of capital.&lt;ref&gt;For an assessment of this question, see Peter Evans, "The Eclipse of the State?

==Today==
By the beginning of the 21st century, capitalism had become the pervasive economic system worldwide. The collapse of the [[Soviet bloc]] in 1991 significantly reduced the influence of Socialism as an alternative economic system. Socialist movements continue to be influential in some parts of the world, most notably Latin-American [[Bolivarianism]], with some having ties to more traditional anti-capitalist movements, such as Bolivarian [[Communist Party of Venezuela|Venezuela]]'s ties to communist [[Communist Party of Cuba|Cuba]].

In many emerging markets, the influence of banking and financial capital have come to increasingly shape national developmental strategies, leading some to argue we are in a new phase of financial capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Marois, Thomas (2012) States, Banks and Crisis: Emerging Finance Capitalism in Mexico and Turkey. Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

State intervention in global capital markets following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] was perceived by some as signaling a crisis for free-market capitalism. Serious turmoil in the banking system and financial markets due in part to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] reached a critical stage during September 2008, characterized by severely contracted [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] in the global credit markets posed an existential threat to investment banks and other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/09/images/20080925-9_v092508db-0111-515h.html "President Bush Meets with Bicameral and Bipartisan Members of Congress to Discuss Economy"], [[Whitehouse.gov]], September 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7641733.stm|title=House votes down bail-out package|author=|date=29 September 2008|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
According to some,{{who|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name="Michio 1999"&gt;[[Michio Kaku|Kaku, Michio]] (1999). ''Visions: How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century and Beyond''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-288018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transition to the [[information society]] involves abandoning some parts of capitalism, as the "capital" required to produce and process information becomes available to the masses and difficult to control, and is closely related to the controversial issues of [[intellectual property]]. Some&lt;ref name="Michio 1999"/&gt; even speculate that the development of mature [[molecular manufacturing|nanotechnology]], particularly of [[universal assembler]]s, may make capitalism obsolete, with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] ceasing to be an important factor in the economic life of humanity. Thinkers have also explored what kind of economic system [[Post-capitalism|might replace]] capitalism, such as [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]].

==Role of women==
Women's historians have debated the impact of capitalism on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. {{JSTOR|178999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th-century England, it made a negative impact on the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class and women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; Tilly and Scott have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Ashurbeyli was born on 9 September 1963, in Baku, Azerbaijan, a descendant of the Azerbaijani noble family of [[Ashurbeyov]]. He graduated from the [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]] in 1985. He then founded the Socium, which later became Socium Holding, in 1988. In 1990 Ashurbeyli moved to [[Moscow]]. He held the positions of Deputy General Manager, First Deputy General Manager, and Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at SPA Almaz (later rebranded as [[GSKB Almaz-Antey]]) starting from 1994. From 2000 to 2011, Ashurbeyli was the CEO of SPA Almaz (because SPA Almaz was rebranded as the OJSC State Special Design Bureau Almaz-Antey, the Russian abbreviation of this company, GSKB Almaz –Antey is frequently confused with JSC Concern Almaz-Antey). From 2004, he was the Chairman of the Board of the Nonprofit Non-Government Expert Society on Space Threat Defense (ESSTD). In 2014, ESSTD was granted special consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC). He was awarded Russia’s [[State Prize of the Russian Federation|State Science and Technology Prize]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raspletin.com/files/110207/1.pdf|title=Официальное сообщение в соответствии с п. 4 Ст. 69 Федерального закона «Об акционерных обществах»|website=Raspletin.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashurbeyli resigned from SPA Almaz in 2011. From 2011, he was the Chairman of the Board and Scientific Supervisor of KB-1 (Design Bureau -1), a privately held company, and Chairman of the Board and Owner of Socium Holding. He founded the Aerospace International Research Center (AIRC) in Vienna, Austria, in 2013. In 2014, AIRC began publication of an international space journal, ROOM, of which Ashurbeyli is the editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/defense_safety/20111011/455649515.html|title=Третий и четвёртый полки С-400 поставят в армию в 2012 году|website=Ria.ru|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 2016, Ashurbeyli was awarded the UNESCO Medal for contributions to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnologies during a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth UNESCO Medals for contributions to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnologies ceremony|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/fifth-unesco-medals-contributions-development-nanoscience-and-nanotechnologies-ceremony|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=7 June 2017|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2016, Ashurbeyli announced in a press conference in [[Paris]] "The birth of the new space nation [[Asgardia (nation)|Asgardia]]" in an opening speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37650274|title=Scientists plan to create 'Asgardia' nation state in space|date=2016-10-13|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From
20 January 2017, supported by more than 150,000 members, Igor Ashurbeyli took up the position of Head of Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asgardia.space/|title=Asgardia - The Space Nation|website=asgardia.space|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
'''Indemnity''' is a contractual obligation of one party (indemnifier) to compensate the loss occurred to the other party (indemnity holder) due to the act of the indemnitor or any other party. The duty to indemnify is usually, but not always, coextensive with the contractual duty to "'''hold harmless'''" or "save harmless".  In contrast, a '''guarantee''' is an obligation of one party assuring the other party that guarantor will perform the promise of the third party if it defaults.

Indemnities form the basis of many [[insurance]] contracts; for example, a car owner may purchase different kinds of insurance as an indemnity for various kinds of loss arising from operation of the car, such as damage to the car itself, or medical expenses following an accident. In an [[Agency (law)|agency]] context, a principal may be obligated to indemnify their agent for liabilities incurred while carrying out responsibilities under the relationship. While the events giving rise to an indemnity may be specified by contract, the actions that must be taken to compensate the injured party are largely unpredictable, and the maximum compensation is often expressly limited.

==English common law==
&lt;!-- (To be discussed: Indemnity in English common law, American law, European law, etc.) --&gt;


&lt;!--If anybody writes of a different commonwealth jurisdiction, please change this title to 'United Kingdom', thanks--&gt;

===Indemnity clauses===
{{See also|Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977}}
Under section 4 of the [[Statute of Frauds]] (1677), a "guarantee" (an undertaking of secondary liability; to answer for another's default) must be evidenced in writing. No such formal requirement exists in respect of indemnities (involving the assumption of primary liability; to pay irrespective of another's default) which are enforceable even if made orally. (Ref: Peel E: "Treitel, The Law of Contract")

Under current English law, indemnities must be clearly and precisely worded in the contract in order to be enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweigart|first1=Raymond|title=English Indemnity Law–Parsing the Promise: Words Are Important, But So Are Actions|url=http://www.pillsburylaw.com/publications/english-indemnity-lawparsing-the-promise-words-are-important-but-so-are-actions|publisher=Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1977,  the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977|Unfair Contract Terms Act]] s4 stated that a consumer cannot be made to unreasonably indemnify another for their [[breach of contract]] or [[negligence]], however this section was repealed by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015|Consumer Rights Act 2015 sch 4 para 6.]]

===Contract award===
In [[England and Wales]] an "indemnity" monetary award may form part of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] during an action of [[restitutio in integrum]]. The [[property]] and funds are exchanged, but indemnity may be granted for costs necessarily incurred to the innocent party pursuant to the [[contract]]. The leading case is ''[[Whittington v Seale-Hayne]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1900) 82 LT 49&lt;/ref&gt; in which a contaminated [[farm]] was sold. The [[contract]] made the buyers renovate the [[property|real estate]] and, the contamination incurred medical expenses for their manager, who had fallen ill. Once the [[contract]] was rescinded, the buyer could be indemnified for the cost of renovation as this was necessary to the [[contract]], but not the medical expenses as the [[contract]] did not require them to hire a manager. Were the sellers at [[fault (legal)|fault]], [[damages]] would clearly be available.

The distinction between indemnity and [[damages]] is subtle may be differentiated by considering the roots of the [[law of obligations]]: how can money be paid where the [[defendant]] is not at fault? The [[contract]] before [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] is voidable but not void, so, for a period of time, there is a legal [[contract]]. During that time, both parties have legal obligation. If the [[contract]] is to be voided ''ab initio'' the obligations performed must also be [[payment|compensated]]. Therefore, the costs of indemnity arise from the (transient and performed) obligations of the claimant rather than a [[breach of contract|breach of obligation]] by the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, M, ''Law of Contract'', ed11 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from guarantees===
An indemnity is distinct from a [[guarantee]], which is the promise of a third party to honor the obligation of a party to a contract should that party be unable or unwilling to do so (usually a guarantee is limited to an obligation to pay a debt). This distinction between indemnity and guarantee was discussed as early as the eighteenth century in ''Birkmya v Darnell''.&lt;ref&gt;(1704) 1 Salk 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, concerned with a guarantee of payment for goods rather than payment of rent, the presiding judge explained that a guarantee effectively says "Let him have the goods; if he does not pay you, I will."&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''Mountstephan v Lakeman'' (1871) LR 7 QB 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from warranties===

An indemnity is distinct from a [[warranty]] in that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Byrne|title=Warranties and indemnities: what's the difference?|url=http://www.inhouselawyer.co.uk/index.php/ireland/7833-warranties-and-indemnities-whats-the-difference|website=The In-House Lawyer|accessdate=26 February 2015|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
* Warranties require the beneficiary to mitigate their losses, while indemnities do not.
* Warranties do not cover problems known to the beneficiary at the time the warranty is given, while indemnities do.

{{Anchor|US Contracts}}

==US contracts==

Many private contracts and [[terms of service]] in the United States require one party (indemnitor, typically a customer) to pay (indemnify) the other side's costs for legal claims arising from the relationship. They are particularly common in online services.&lt;ref name="qmul1"&gt;{{Citation |last=Kamarinou |first=Dimitra |title=Privacy in the Clouds: An Empirical Study of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies of 20 Cloud Service Providers |date=2015-08-18 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2646447 |last2=Millard |last3=Hon |first2=Christopher |first3=W. Kuan |publisher=Queen Mary University of London - Cloud Legal Project |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US government publishes [https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/ special Terms of Service], which it has negotiated with many companies, to exclude indemnification for official US government work. US law "is violated by any indemnification agreement that, without statutory authorization, imposes on the United States an open-ended, potentially unrestricted liability."&lt;ref name=ag&gt;The Anti-Deficiency Act Implications of Consent by Government Employees to Online Terms of Service Agreements Containing Open-Ended Indemnification Clauses (Opinion of the US Attorney General. 2012) [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4342057/the-anti-deficiency-act-implications-of-consent-by-government-employees-to/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Hercules, Inc. v. United States, 516 U.S. 417 (1996)[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118004/hercules-inc-v-united-states/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Attorney General says federal agencies "should renegotiate the terms of service to revise or eliminate the indemnification clause or cancel the [government]'s enrollments in social media applications when their operators insist on such a clause."&lt;ref name=ag /&gt;

===State variations===
Under US law, interpretation of indemnification clauses varies by state.&lt;ref name=bern&gt;Bernstein, Jedidiah M. Esq. (May 2017). http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/tips-for-a-startup-manufacturer-in-31651/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California indemnification clauses do not cover certain risks unless the risks are listed in the contract, while in ''New York'' a brief clause, "X shall defend and indemnify Y for all claims arising from the Product" does make X responsible for all claims against Y.&lt;ref name=bern /&gt; Indemnity can be extremely costly, since X's liability insurance typically does not cover claims against Y, but X still has to cover them.&lt;ref name="boatus" /&gt;

In 2017, the Utah Supreme Court said that "By statute, a contractual provision requiring a purchaser of a product to indemnify a manufacturer is 'void and unenforceable' in certain circumstances. UTAH CODE § 78B-6-707."&lt;ref&gt;Bylsma v. R.C.WilleyHumanTouch, 2017 UT 85 [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4448338/bylsma-v-rcwilleyhumantouch/ opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012-2014, a New Jersey woman had to pay a lawyer to get out of an indemnity payment for injury at a storage unit. When someone slipped on ice in 2012, while going to a unit, Public Storage sued in court to make the woman who rented the unit pay for the injury. She tried to ignore the case, so state court ruled she must pay. She then retained a lawyer and went to court. In 2014, the US District Court said this specific indemnity clause was unenforceable in New Jersey, because it covered Public Storage's own negligence without explicitly saying so, contrary to New Jersey law (other states differ).&lt;ref&gt;MARTINEZ-SANTIAGO v. PUBLIC STORAGE (1:14-cv-00302-JBS-AMD),
[https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.298992.24.0.pdf opinion] and
[https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4311531/martinez-santiago-v-public-storage/ docket]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 decision in New Jersey upheld a broad indemnity clause, since it was followed by another sentence, "indemnity agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State of New Jersey". The judge said, "It is true that a consumer, unfamiliar with the laws of New Jersey, would not be able to state with certainty how far the waiver extends".&lt;ref&gt;SAURO v. L.A. FITNESS INTERNATIONAL, LLC (1:12-cv-03682), [https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.275723.30.0.pdf opinion] and [https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4310733/sauro-v-la-fitness-international-llc/ docket]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Colorado Supreme Court required a flower shop to indemnify its shopping center for a customer who slipped on the icy parking lot, through no fault of the flower shop, because the tenant was there to visit that shop, and the shop's lease had a broad indemnity clause.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com/article/three-strategies-limiting-your-indemnity-obligation | title=Three Strategies for Limiting Your Indemnity Obligation | author=Cohen, Alan M. Esq. | journal=Commercial Tenants Lease Insider |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a Federal District Court in Wyoming did not require a customer to indemnify a white-water rafting company for injury to his wife, since the wording may have only applied to him and his children, and clauses cannot be enforced in Wyoming to indemnify a company for its own negligence.&lt;ref name="wyo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/1999135231fsupp2d132111193 |title=MADSEN v. WYOMING RIVER TRIPS 31 F.Supp.2d 1321 (1999) |website=Leagle |language=en |access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a subcontractor must indemnify the builder for damages it caused, according to an indemnification clause in their purchase order.&lt;ref&gt;Turner v. Alpha Phi Sorority House, 276 N.W.2d 63 (Minn. 1979) [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1737796/turner-v-alpha-phi-sorority-house opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the California Supreme Court ruled that Hertz could not enforce its clause requiring renters to indemnify Hertz' insurer.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Nat. Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 65 Cal. 2d 100 (Cal. 1966) [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1232527/atlantic-nat-ins-co-v-armstrong opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With negotiations===
When a contract is '''negotiable''', the indemnitor negotiates to control these legal costs. It will not let the indemnified party (indemnitee) overspend, ''"An arrangement where the indemnitee makes decisions about how to defend and settle the claim while the indemnitor writes the checks presents a [[moral hazard]]. Knowing that its defense and settlement costs are being borne by the indemnitor, the indemnitee may be encouraged to engage a more expensive legal team or pursue a riskier defense strategy than it would otherwise. For this reason, most indemnitors are unwilling to indemnify against claims when they do not control the defense of the claim."''&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202747710279/Indemnity-Procedures-and-Liability-in-IT-Contracts?mcode=0&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL | title=Indemnity Procedures and Liability in IT Contracts |author1=Steinberg, Jim  |author2=Lance McCord | journal=Daily Report | date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Bar Association has published advice on negotiations of construction contracts: that (1) owners try to get contractors to indemnify as much as possible, while (2) contractors (a) only indemnify for their own negligence and (b) "establish a right but not a duty for the contractor to defend under an indemnification claim."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tklaw.com/files/Publication/632aa92a-f020-4001-bbc8-d5a1d3e83c60/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/5c85c61b-0b85-4777-93ff-d95505b1d707/ABA_PP_v028n05__critical_construction_contract_clauses.pdf Critical Construction Contract Clauses], published by ABA in ''Probate and Property'', 2014, Volume 28, Number 5&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of letting the indemnitor control costs is (in this case a contractor for a homeowners association-HOA), "''Contractor shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Association) and hold harmless the Association"''&lt;ref name="stirling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.davis-stirling.com/MainIndex/HoldHarmlessIndemnify/tabid/539/Default.aspx | title=HOLD HARMLESS &amp; INDEMNIFY | publisher=Adams-Stirling Professional Law Corp | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and HOAs also use indemnity to protect directors, since few would serve as directors if their risks were not indemnified.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.communityassociationmanagement.com/c49-legal-compliance/c57-ask-the-experts/association-answers-are-hoa-board-members-protected-from-lawsuits/ | title=Association Answers | publisher=Community Association Management, reprinted from Charlotte Observer | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiation is important for both parties, '' "Just about all homeowner association management contracts have a provision which states that the HOA shall indemnify the manager under certain circumstances... There are several ways the indemnification clause can be drafted and both management and HOA must take into account what protects each the best"''&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://realtytimes.com/consumeradvice/hoaadvice1/item/7280-20070321_indemnifymanag | title=Indemnify the HOA Manager | author=Thompson, Richard | journal=Realty Times | date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If indemnitors can negotiate a limit on liability in their contract, this limits the cost of a potential indemnity if they "''make clear in the agreement that any limitations of liability (whether in the form of caps or exclusions of certain types of damages—e.g., consequential) apply to the ... indemnification''."&lt;ref name="corpcounsel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202759907099/Some-IP-Indemnification-Considerations-for-Tech-Vendors | title=Some IP Indemnification Considerations for Tech Vendors | author=Michael Bloom, Lindsey Chandler and Alexa Peterson | journal=Corporate Counsel | date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Without negotiations===
When a contract is '''not''' negotiable ([[adhesion contract]]), the wording often lets the indemnitee decide what to spend on legal costs and bill the indemnitor. Most clauses are quite broad.&lt;ref name="qmul2"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Bradshaw |first=Simon |last2=Millard |first2=Christopher |last3=Walden |first3=Ian |date=2010-09-02 |title=Contracts for Clouds: Comparison and Analysis of the Terms and Conditions of Cloud Computing Services |publisher=Queen Mary University of London - Cloud Legal Project  |url=http://www.cloudlegal.ccls.qmul.ac.uk/Research/researchpapers/37188.html |location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of indemnity requirements from a range of businesses. The last one, Angie's List, limits issues to the user's fault, but decisions and costs are still controlled by the indemnitee (Angie's List).

''The lawyer for a boat owners' group interprets this as,"By signing a marina contract with such provisions, you may find yourself responsible for costs not covered by your insurance policy...

==Insurance==

{{See also|Prize indemnity insurance}}&lt;!--a lot of people made vague references to insurance, Please place these here if they are directly relevant to indemnity--&gt;
Indemnity insurance compensates the beneficiaries of the policies for their actual economic losses, up to the limiting amount of the insurance policy. It generally requires the insured to prove the amount of its loss before it can recover. Recovery is limited to the amount of the provable loss even if the face amount of the policy is higher. This is in contrast to, for example, life insurance, where the amount of the beneficiary's economic loss is irrelevant.  The death of the person whose life is insured for reasons not excluded from the policy obligate the insurer to pay the entire policy amount to the beneficiary.

Most business interruption insurance policies contain an Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement, which extends coverage beyond the time that it takes to physically restore the property. This provision covers additional expenses that allow the business to return to prosperity and help the business restore revenues to pre-loss levels.&lt;ref&gt;Adjusting Today [http://adjustersinternational.com/adjustingtoday/?start=3&amp;page_no=3&amp;pdfID=37 The Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Freeing of slaves and indentured servants===
[[Slave owners]] suffered a loss whenever their [[slave]]s  were granted their freedom. Slave owners might have been paid to cover their losses.

When the slaves of [[Zanzibar]] were freed in 1897, it was by compensation since the prevailing opinion was that the slave owners suffered the loss of an asset whenever a slave was freed.

In the 1860s in the [[United States]], U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] had requested many millions of dollars from Congress with which to compensate slave owners for the loss of their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=Abraham Lincoln's Second Annual Message of 1862 |first=Abraham |last=Lincoln |authorlink=Abraham Lincoln |event=Presidential speech |date=December 1, 1862 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29503#axzz1pzerHqlo |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66OKu6j1R?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29503 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1868, [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Validity of public debt|Section IV]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment]] dismissed all of the claims that slave owners had been injured by the freeing of the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html Fourteenth Amendment and related resources at the Library of Congress]; [https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#14 National Archives (USA): 14th Amendment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807–08, in [[Prussia]], statesman [[Baron Heinrich vom Stein]] introduced a [[Prussian reforms|series of reforms]], the [[Prussian reforms#Edict of October 1807|principal of which]] was the [[abolition of serfdom]] with indemnification to territorial lords.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Haiti]] was [[Haiti indemnity controversy|required to pay an indemnity of 150,000,000 francs to France]] in order to atone for the loss suffered by the [[France|French]] slave owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Hallward |url=http://newleftreview.org/II/27/peter-hallward-option-zero-in-haiti |title=Peter Hallward: Option Zero in Haiti. New Left Review 27, May-June 2004 |publisher=Newleftreview.org |date= |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peru]], [[Antonio Salinas y Castañeda]] (1810–1874), a wealthy Peruvian landowner and conservative politician, led the meeting of the main landowners of the country for an indemnity after slavery abolition and ruled the commission who promoted the immigration of Asians to replace former slaves as a workforce during Ramón Castilla government.

===Costs of war===
The nation that wins a war may insist on being paid compensations for the costs of the war, even after having been the instigator of the war. 
* Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95]], the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] required that [[China]] pay [[Japan]] the sum of 200,000,000 [[tael]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Shimonoseki|title=Treaty of Shimonoseki {{!}} 1895, China-Japan|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the massacres of foreigners during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the defeated [[Qing Empire]] were to pay 450&amp;nbsp;million [[tael]]s of fine silver as indemnity over a course of 39 years to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance|eight nations]] involved.&lt;ref name="spence"&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. [1991] (1991), ''The Search for Modern China'', WW Norton &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0-393-30780-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[exchange rate]]s at the time, this was equal to 335 million US [[gold dollar]]s or [[Pound sterling|£]]67&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="spence"/&gt;

'''Joseph Medill McCormick''' (May 16, 1877 – February 25, 1925), called '''Medill''', was part of the [[McCormick family]] of businessmen and politicians in [[Chicago]]. After working for some time and becoming part owner of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]],'' which his maternal grandfather had owned, he entered politics.

After serving in the State House, he was elected both as a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] in the [[United States]] Congress and later as a [[United States Senate|US Senator]] from [[Illinois]]. He committed [[suicide]] at age 47, a few months after losing his bid for renomination for a second term in the senate.

== Early life ==
Joseph Medill McCormick was born in [[Chicago]] on May 16, 1877.  His father was the future diplomat [[Robert Sanderson McCormick]] (1849–1919), who was a nephew of [[Cyrus McCormick]].

McCormick attended the [[Groton School]], a preparatory school at [[Groton, Massachusetts]].  He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1900, where he was elected to the secret society [[Scroll and Key]].

He worked as a newspaper [[reporter]] and [[publisher]], and became an owner of the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]''. He later purchased interests in ''[[The Plain Dealer|The Cleveland Leader]]'' and ''[[Cleveland News]].'' In 1901 he served as a [[war correspondent]] in the [[Philippine Islands]].

===Marriage and family===
In 1903 he married [[Ruth Hanna McCormick|Ruth Hanna]], daughter of the Ohio Senator [[Mark Hanna]]. They had three children: 
*[[Bazy Tankersley|Ruth "Bazy" McCormick]], (1921–2013) who married Peter Miller and then Garvin Tankersley.  As Bazy Miller, she founded [[Al-Marah Arabians]], a breeding and training farm for [[Arabian horse]]s formerly in [[Tucson, Arizona]], which is still operating, now in Florida, under the ownership of her son, Mark Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=...&amp;nbsp;and Ride Away Singing |last=Parkinson |first=Mary Jane |year=1998 |publisher=Arabian Horse Owners Foundation |isbn=978-1-930140-00-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Katrina McCormick (1913–2011), who married Courtlandt Dixon Barnes Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Katrina|title=Katrina McCormick Weds Courtland Dixon Barnes, Jr.|url=http://www.tarzan.org/pdf/19350615.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2013|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=June 15, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Medill McCormick, called "Johnny", died in a mountain-climbing accident in 1938.

== The ''Chicago Tribune'' ==
McCormick was a grandson of the ''Tribune'' owner [[Joseph Medill]].  His mother Katherine Medill McCormick hoped that leadership of the paper would pass from her brother-in-law, [[Robert Wilson Patterson]], to her first son. Joseph McCormick took over much of the management of the paper between 1903 and 1907, but became increasingly depressed and developed [[alcoholism]]. In 1907–1908, he spent some time under the care of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] in Zurich, and subsequently followed Jung's advice to detach himself from the family newspaper.&lt;ref name="Miller1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Kristie |title=Ruth Hanna McCormick: A Life in Politics |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-8263-1333-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His younger brother, the famed [[Robert R. McCormick|"Colonel" Robert McCormick]] (1880–1955) became involved in the newspaper, worked closely on it for four decades, and was a leading isolationist figure in the Republican Party.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Richard Norton Smith]] |title= The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert R. McCormick, 1880–1955 |publisher= [[Northwestern University Press]] |year= 2003 |origyear= 1997 |isbn= 978-0-8101-2039-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0tIW6XTGsOAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
McCormick was vice chairman of the national campaign committee of the [[Progressive Republican]] movement from 1912 to 1914. He was elected to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] in 1912 and 1914.

Afterward he advanced to national office, being elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he served one term from March 4, 1917, to March 3, 1919. He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1918, and served from March 4, 1919, until his death at age 48 in 1925. In the Senate, McCormick was chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Labor|Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Labor]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments|Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments]].

McCormick lost the nomination in 1924 to [[Charles S. Deneen]], who had previously served as the [[List of Governors of Illinois|23rd Governor of Illinois]].  He died on February 25, 1925, in a hotel room in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= National Affairs: Medill McCormick |date= March 9, 1925 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751256,00.html |accessdate= January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it was not publicized at the time, his death was considered suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{CongBio |M000369 |inline=please}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McCormick was interred in [[Middle Creek Cemetery]], near [[Byron, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Find A Grave"&gt;{{Find a Grave |7862015 |Joseph Medill McCormick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julia Lynch Olin''' (October 21, 1882 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1961) was an American author and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] who co-founded the New History Society in [[New York City]], and was later expelled from the religion by [[Shoghi Effendi]] around 1939. Through marriage, she was a member of the [[Astor family|Astor]] and Dudley–Winthrop families.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;

==Early life==
Julia was born on October 21, 1882 in [[Glen Cove, New York]].  She was the daughter of Stephen Henry Olin (1847–1925), the acting President of [[Wesleyan University]] from 1922 to 1923,&lt;ref name="1922ActingHead"&gt;{{cite news|title=COL.

==Bahá'í Faith==
Julia was first introduced to the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] about 1925, as she states in her auto-biography.  Becoming intimately associated with [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] they together with her second husband, started the ''New History Society''.&lt;ref name="NSA1941"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Basis of the Bahá'í Community: A Statement Concerning the New History Society|date=1941|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States|url=http://bahai-library.com/nsa_new_history|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This Society, based in the home that Julia and Lewis owned in New York, (later called ''Caravan House''), published several books, into the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;  It apparently became defunct after Sohrab and/or Julia had died.

In 1929, he and Julia formed an educational organization called ''[[Caravan of East and West]]'' with a quarterly magazine called ''The Caravan''. This magazine is where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared, also in 1929.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;

Also that year, an article appeared in which the engagement of her daughter Elsie Benkard to Charles H. Clarke was announced.&lt;ref name="1929Engagement"/&gt;  The marriage announcement appeared on February 27, 1930, stating that ".....they were married with a Bahai ceremony. It was the first time that such a ceremony..... has been used at a society wedding in New York. Mirza Ahmad Sohrab officiated."&lt;ref name="1930Wedding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1934MarriageCeremony"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chanler|first1=Julie|title=BAHA'I MARRIAGE CEREMONY|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1934/02/25/archives/bahai-marriage-ceremony.html|accessdate=25 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 February 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New History Society was addressed by several luminaries, including [[Albert Einstein]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="EINSTEIN1930"&gt;{{cite news|title=EINSTEIN ADVOCATES RESISTANCE TO WAR; If Only 2% of Eligibles Refused to Join Army, Jails Would Not Hold Them, He Says.

===Expulsion===
She was expelled from the Bahá'í community in 1939 along with Lewis and Sohrab after they refused to allow the Local [[Spiritual Assembly]] of New York oversight over the operations of the New History Society. They went on to support the efforts of [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], and at one point petitioned the President of [[Israel]] for Muhammad `Alí's property rights when he tried to assert his control over the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="Aghdasi1994"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aghdasi|first1=Farzin|title=The Vision of Shoghi Effendi|url=http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm|website=bci.org|publisher=Association for Baha'i Studies University of British Columbia|accessdate=25 August 2017|date=Spring 1994|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515041702/http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm|archivedate=15 May 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its mission, the New History Society, for many years sponsored an essay-contest. At least one of the winners of this, [[Jaja Wachuku]], became famous in his own right, for his essay "How Can the People of the World Achieve Universal Disarmament?" written while at the New Africa University College.&lt;ref name="Chanler1956"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chanler|first1=Julie|title=From Gaslight to Dawn|date=1956|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/C/Chanler/FGTD.htm|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''letter of credit''' ('''LC'''), also known as a '''documentary credit''' or '''bankers commercial credit''', is a [[payment|payment mechanism]] used in [[international trade]] to provide an economic [[guarantee]] from a creditworthy [[bank]] to an exporter of goods. A letter of credit is extremely common within international trade and goods delivery, where the reliability of contracting parties cannot be readily and easily determined. Its economic effect is to introduce a bank as underwriting the credit risk of the buyer paying the seller for goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfig.unece.org/contents/letters-of-credit.htm|title=Letters of credit|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Trade Facilitation Implementation Guide|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The letter of credit has been used in Europe since ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mead|first=Carl A.|date=April 1922|title=Documentary Letters of Credit|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1111302.pdf|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=22|pages=297-331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of credit were traditionally governed by internationally recognized rules and procedures rather than by national law. The [[International Chamber of Commerce]] oversaw the preparation of the first [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]] (UCP) in 1933, creating a voluntary framework for commercial banks to apply to transactions worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chadsey|first=Horace M.|date=1954|title=Practical Effect of the Uniform Commercial Code on Documentary Letter of Credit Transactions|url=https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=7792&amp;context=penn_law_review|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=102|pages=618-628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, travelers commonly carried a "circular" letter of credit issued by a relationship bank, which allowed the beneficiary to withdraw cash from other banks along their journey. This type of letter of credit was eventually replaced by [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's checks]], [[Credit card|credit cards]] and [[Automated teller machine|automated teller machines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.law.columbia.edu/CircularLetterOfCredit/|title=The Circular Letter of Credit|last=McKeever|first=Kent|last2=Ditcheva|first2=Boriana|date=October 2006|website=library.law.columbia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although letters of credit first existed only as paper documents, they were regularly issued by [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] in the late 19th century, and by [[telex]] in the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=James G.|last2=Byrne|first2=James E.|date=Spring 2001|title=E-Commerce and Letter of Credit Law and Practice|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2031&amp;context=til|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=35|pages=23-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1973 with the creation of [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]], banks began to migrate to [[electronic data interchange]] as a means of controlling costs, and in 1983 the UCP was amended to allow "teletransmission" of letters of credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozolchyk|first=Boris|date=Summer 1992|title=The Paperless Letter of Credit|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4155&amp;context=lcp|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|volume=55|pages=39-101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 21st century, the vast majority of L/Cs were issued in electronic form and entirely "paperless" L/Cs were becoming more common.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Terminology==
UCP 600 (2007 Revision) regulates common market practice within the letter of credit market. It defines a number of terms related to letters of credit which categorise the various actors within any given transaction. These are crucial to understanding the role financial institutions play within. These include:

* The ''Advising Bank'' is the bank that will inform the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank of the credit, send the original credit to the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank, and provide the Beneficiary or their Nominated Bank with any amendments to the letter of credit.
* The ''Applicant'' is the person or company who has requested the letter of credit to be issued; this will normally be the buyer.
* The ''Beneficiary'' is the person or company who will be paid under the letter of credit; this will normally be the seller (UCP600 Art.2 defines the beneficiary as "the party in whose favour a credit is issued").
* A ''Complying Presentation'' is a set of documents that meet with the requirements of the letter of credit and all of the rules relating to letters of credit.
*''Confirming Bank'' is a bank other than the issuing bank that adds its confirmation to credit upon the issuing bank's authorization or request thus providing more security to beneficiary.
*''Confirmation'' is an undertaking from a bank other than the issuing bank to pay the Beneficiary for a Complying Presentation, allowing the Beneficiary to further reduce payment risk, although Confirmation is usually at an extra cost.
*The ''Issuing Bank'' is the bank that issues the credit, usually following a request from an Applicant.
*The ''Nominated Bank'' is a bank mentioned within the letter of credit at which the credit is available (in this respect, UCP600 Art.2 reads: "Nominated bank means the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit available with any bank") .

==Function==
A letter of credit is an important [[payment method]] in international trade. It is particularly useful where the buyer and seller may not know each other personally and are separated by distance, differing laws in each country, and different trading customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How do Letters of Credit Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/finance/letter_of_credit.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary method in international trade to mitigate the risk a seller of goods takes when providing those goods to a buyer. It does this by ensuring that the seller is paid for presenting the documents which are specified in the contract for sale between the buyer and the seller. That is to say, a letter of credit is a payment method used to discharge the legal obligations for payment from the buyer to the seller, by having a bank pay the seller directly. Thus, the seller relies on the credit risk of the bank, rather than the buyer, to receive payment. As will be seen, and is observed in Image 2, the bank will pay the seller the value of the goods when the seller provides [[negotiable instruments]], documents which themselves represent the goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters of credit for importers and exporters|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/letters-of-credit-for-importers-and-exporters|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; Upon presentation of the documents, the goods will traditionally be in the control of the issuing bank, which provides them security against the risk that the buyer (who had instructed the bank to pay the seller) will repay the bank for making such a payment.

In the event that the buyer is unable to make payment on the purchase, the seller may make a demand for payment on the bank. The bank will examine the beneficiary's demand and if it complies with the terms of the letter of credit, will honor the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding and Using Letters of Credit, Part I|url=http://www.crfonline.org/orc/cro/cro-9-1.html|website=Credit Research Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most letters of credit are governed by rules promulgated by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] known as [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hashim|first1=Rosmawani Che|title=The UCP 600 rules in Letter of Credit|url=http://eprints.um.edu.my/14424/1/0001.pdf|website=University of Malaya|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version, UCP 600, became effective July 1, 2007. Banks will typically require collateral from the purchaser for issuing a letter of credit and will charge a fee which is often a percentage of the amount covered by the letter of credit.

===Types===
Several categories of LC's exist which seek to operate in different markets and solve different issues. An example of these include:
* '''Import/export:''' &amp;mdash; The same credit can be termed an import or export letter of credit depending on whose perspective is considered. For the importer it is termed an Import LC and for the exporter of goods, an Export LC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCurdy|first1=William E.|title=Commercial Letters of Credit|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1922|volume=35|issue=5|pages=539–592|jstor=1328326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Revocable/ Irrevocable:''' &amp;mdash; Whether a LC is revocable or irrevocable determines whether the buyer and the issuing bank are able to manipulate the LC or make corrections without informing or getting permissions from the seller. According to UCP 600, all LCs are irrevocable, hence in practice this type of LC increasingly obsolete. Any changes (amendment) or cancellation of the LC (except it is expired) is done by the applicant through the issuing bank. It must be authenticated and approved by the beneficiary.
* '''Confirmed/Unconfirmed:''' &amp;mdash; An LC is said to be confirmed when a second bank adds its confirmation (or guarantee) to honor a complying presentation at the request or authorization of the issuing bank.
* '''Restricted/ Unrestricted:''' &amp;mdash; Either the one advising bank can purchase a bill of exchange from the seller in the case of a restricted LC or; the confirmation bank is not specified, which means that the exporter can show the bill of exchange to any bank and receive a payment on an unrestricted LC.
* '''Deferred / Usance:''' &amp;mdash; A credit that is not paid/assigned immediately after presentation, but after an indicated period that is accepted by both buyer and seller. Typically, seller allows buyer to pay the required money after taking the related goods and selling them.

Additionally, a letter of credit may also have specific terms relating to the payment conditions which relate to the underlying reference documents. Some of these include 
* '''At Sight:''' &amp;mdash; A credit that the announcer bank immediately pays after inspecting the carriage documents from the seller.
* '''Red Clause:''' &amp;mdash; Before sending the products, seller can take the pre-paid part of the money from the bank. The first part of the credit is to attract the attention of the accepting bank. The first time the credit is established by the assigner bank, is to gain the attention of the offered bank. The terms and conditions were typically written in red ink, thus the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlapipertradefinance.com/en/glossary/r/red-clause-letter-of-credit.html|title=Defining Trade Finance -  Red Clause Letter of Credit|last=|first=|date=|website=DLA Piper|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Back to Back''': &amp;mdash; A pair of LCs in which one is to the benefit of a seller who is not able to provide the corresponding goods for unspecified reasons. In that event, a second credit is opened for another seller to provide the desired goods. Back-to-back is issued to facilitate intermediary trade. Intermediate companies such as trading houses are sometimes required to open LCs for a supplier and receive Export LCs from buyer.
* '''Standby Letter of Credit:''' &amp;mdash; Operates like a Commercial Letter of Credit, except that typically it is retained as a "standby" instead of being the intended payment mechanism. In other words, this is a LC which is intended to provide a source of payment in the event of non-performance of contract. This is a security against an obligation which is not performed. If you present the bank with demands of non-payment it is not a guarantee - trigger isn't non-payment - it is presented by documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative Power Solutions v Central Electricity Board [2015]&lt;/ref&gt; UCP600 article 1 provides that the UCP applies to Standbys; [[Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice|ISP98]] applies specifically to Standby letters of Credit; and the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/a50r048.htm|website=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=31 October 2017|date=11 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies to a small number of countries that have ratified the Convention.

====Transferability====  
The exporter has the right to make the credit available to one or more subsequent beneficiaries. 
Credits are made transferable when the original beneficiary is a "middleman", who does not supply the documents himself, but procures either goods or documents from other suppliers and arranges them to be sent to the issuing bank. A letter of credit can be transferred to the second beneficiary at the request of the first beneficiary only if it expressly states that the letter of credit is "transferable". A bank is not obligated to transfer a credit. It can further be transferred to more than one alternate beneficiary as long as it allows partial shipments.
The terms and conditions of the original credit must be replicated exactly in the transferred credit. However, to keep the workability of the transferable letter of credit, some figures can be reduced or curtailed, including:
* Amount
* Unit price of the merchandise (if stated)
* Expiry date
* Presentation period
* Latest shipment date or given period for shipment.
The first beneficiary may demand from the transferring bank to substitute for the applicant. However, if a document other than the invoice must be issued in a way to show the applicant's name, in such a case that requirement must indicate that in the transferred credit it will be free. Transferred credit cannot be transferred again to a third beneficiary at the request of the second beneficiary.

In some cases, the middleman does not want the buyer and supplier know each other. The middleman is entitled to substitute his own invoice for the supplier's and acquire the difference as profit.

==Operational function==
Typically, after a [[sales contract]] has been negotiated, and the buyer and seller have agreed that a letter of credit will be used as the method of payment, the Applicant will contact a bank to ask for a letter of credit to be issued. Once the issuing bank has assessed the buyer's credit risk – i.e. that the Applicant will be able to pay for the goods – it will issue the letter of credit, meaning that it will provide a promise to pay the seller upon presentation of certain documents. Once the Beneficiary (the seller) receives the letter of credit, it will check the terms to ensure that it matches with the contract and will either arrange for shipment of the goods or ask for an amendment to the letter of credit so that it meets with the terms of the contract. The letter of credit is limited in terms of time, the validity of credit, the last date of shipment, and in terms of how much late after shipment the documents may be presented to the Nominated Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Fortis Bank SA/NV v Indian Overseas Bank (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the goods have been shipped, the Beneficiary will present the requested documents to the Nominated Bank.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;  This bank will check the documents, and if they comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, the issuing Bank is bound to honor the terms of the letter of credit by paying the Beneficiary.

If the documents do not comply with the terms of the letter of credit they are considered '''Discrepant'''. At this point, the Nominated Bank will inform the Beneficiary of the discrepancy and offer a number of options depending on the circumstances after consent of applicant. However, such a discrepancy must be more than trivial. Refusal cannot depend on anything other than reasonable examination of the documents themselves. The bank then must rely on the fact that there was, in fact, a material mistake.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; A fact that if true would entitle the buyer to reject the items. A wrong date such as an early delivery date was held by English courts to not be a material mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; If the discrepancies are minor, it may be possible to present corrected documents to the bank to make the presentation compliant.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; Failure of the bank to pay is grounds for a chose in action. Documents presented after the time limits mentioned in the credit, however, are considered discrepant.

If the corrected documents cannot be supplied in time, the documents may be forwarded directly to the issuing bank "in trust"; effectively in the hope that the Applicant will accept the documents. Documents forwarded in trust remove the payment security of a letter of credit so this route must only be used as a last resort.

Some banks will offer to "Telex for Approval" or similar. This is where the Nominated Bank holds the documents, but sends a message to the Issuing Bank asking if discrepancies are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; This is more secure than sending documents in trust.

===Documents That May Be Requested For Presentation===
To receive payment, an exporter or shipper must present the documents required by the LC. Typically the letter of credit will request an original [[Bill of lading]] as the use of a title document such as this is critical to the functioning of the Letter of Credit.&lt;ref&gt;Equitable Trust Co of NY v Dawson Partners&lt;/ref&gt; However, the list and form of documents is open to negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third-party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin or place. Typical types of documents in such contracts might include:&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Financial documents''' &amp;mdash; [[Negotiable instrument|bill of exchange]], co-accepted draft
*'''Commercial documents''' &amp;mdash; [[invoice]], [[shipping list|packing list]]
*'''Shipping documents''' &amp;mdash; [[bill of lading]] (ocean or multi-modal or charter party), airway bill, lorry/truck receipt, railway receipt, CMC other than mate receipt, forwarder cargo receipt 
*'''Official documents''' &amp;mdash; license, embassy legalization, origin certificate, inspection certificate, [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures|phytosanitary certificate]]
*'''Insurance documents''' &amp;mdash; insurance policy or certificate, but not a cover note.
The range of documents that may be requested by the applicant is vast, and varies considerably by country and commodity.
Several methods of verifying the documents exist, each provides different variations of risk to the fact that the documents are legitimate. A '''Documentary Credit''' provides security for both buyer and seller. Outlined in the ''UCP 600'', the bank will give an undertaking (or promise), on behalf of buyer (who is often the applicant) to pay the beneficiary the value of the goods shipped if acceptable documents are submitted and if the stipulated terms and conditions are strictly complied with. The buyer can be confident that the goods he is expecting only will be received since it will be evidenced in the form of certain documents, meeting the specified terms and conditions. The supplier finds his confidence in the fact that if such stipulations are met, he will receive payment from the issuing bank, who is independent of the parties to the contract. 
In some cases, a letter of credit will require the documents to be collected. Subject to ICC's  URC 525, sight and [[usance]], for delivery of shipping documents against payment or acceptances of draft, where shipment happens first, then the title documents are sent to the buyer's bank by seller's bank, for delivering documents against collection of payment/acceptance. Other forms of effected payment is the '''direct payment''' where the supplier ships the goods and waits for the buyer to remit the bill, on open account terms.

===Risk Exposure===
Letters of Credit are often used in international transactions to ensure that payment will be received where the buyer and seller may not know each other and are operating in different countries. In this case, the seller is exposed to a number of risks such as [[credit risk]], and [[legal risk]] caused by the distance, differing laws and difficulty in knowing each party personally.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Chartered Bank v Dorchester LNG (2) Ltd [2015].&lt;/ref&gt; some of the other risks inherent in international trade include:

;Fraud Risks
The payment will be obtained for nonexistent or worthless merchandise against presentation by the beneficiary of forged or falsified documents.

;Legal Risks
There is the possibility that performance of a documentary credit may be disturbed by legal action relating directly to the parties and their rights and obligations under the documentary credit or performance may be prevented by government action outside the control of the parties. Alternatively, performance of a contract – including an obligation under a documentary credit relationship – could also be prevented by external factors such as natural disasters or armed conflicts. These risks, however, are often seen as secondary to the risk of non-payment.

;Applicant
Several risks could relate to the parties of the applicant themselves. These may include situations where there is a non-delivery of Goods, [[Short shipment]] the goods are of inferior quality, are damaged, or are late. The applicant is also exposed to the failure of the bank to make payment.

;Issuing Bank
The issuing bank is also exposed to risks which he may seek to mitigate through various techniques. He will be exposed to the insolvency risk of the applicant, that is, the risk the applicant runs insolvent before he is able to repay the letter of credit. Secondly, the bank will be exposed to a risk of fraud by the seller, who may provide incorrect or falsified documents to receive payment. If the bank ought to have known that the documents were a fraud, then the bank will be exposed to a fraud.

;Beneficiary
The beneficiary will be exposed to the risk of its own failure to comply with credit conditions or failure of, or delays in payment from, the issuing bank. These risks are considered remote. Crucially, the beneficiary is not exposed to the risks of [[set-off (law)|set-off]] by the applicant where the goods are damaged or are of inferior quality. While he may be sued by the applicant at a later point, the issuing bank cannot reduce the payment owed to correspond with the damage occurred. This is crucial in mitigating the risk to insolvency. Crucial to a letter of credit is the beneficiary's (the seller) attempt to isolate itself from the credit risk of the buyer. That is to say, it is concerned primarily with the ability of the buyer to pay for the goods.

===Pricing===
Issuance charges, covering negotiation, reimbursements and other charges are paid by the applicant or as per the terms and conditions of the LC. If the LC does not specify charges, they are paid by the Applicant. Charge-related terms are indicated in field 71B.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Legal principles==
The fundamental principle of all letters of credit is that letters of credit deal with documents and not with goods. The payment obligation is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction. The bank’s obligation is defined by the terms of the LC alone, and the contract of sale is not considered. So, for example, where party 'A' enters into an agreement to purchase goods from party 'B', Party 'A' will engage with their bank to create a letter of credit.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; If said bank is provided certain documents, by 'B', then he is obliged to pay, regardless of whether the contract between 'A' and 'B' is subject to set-off, or contractual issues. The specified documents are often bill of lading or other "documentary intangibles" which 'A' and 'B' have previously specified in their original contract.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Chartered Bank v Dorchester LNG (2) Ltd [2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability.&lt;ref&gt;Ficom S.A. v. Socialized Cadex [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 4(a) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly. This is confirmed within the market-practice documents stated by Article 5 of UCP600. As is a core tenant of [[Financial law]], market practice comprises a substantial portion of how parties behave. Accordingly, if the documents tendered by the beneficiary or their agent are in order, then, in general, the bank is obliged to pay without further qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is the issuing bank who bears the [[financial risk|risk]] that is linked with non-payment of the buyer. This is advantageous because the issuing bank often has a personal banking relationship with the buyer. The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that. It further does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment. However, the only exception to this may be fraud. For example, a dishonest seller may present documents which comply with the letter of credit and receive payment, only to later discover that documents are fraudulent and the goods are not in accordance with the contract, this would place the risk on the buyer, but it also means that the issuing bank must be stringent in assessing whether the presenting documents are legitimate. .&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other [[Financial law]] instruments, a Letter of Credit utilises several legal concepts to achieve the economic effect of shifting the legal exposure from the seller to the buyer. The policies behind adopting this principle of abstraction are purely commercial. Whilst the bank is under an obligation to identify that the correct documents exist, they are not expected to examine whether the documents themselves are valid. That is to say, the bank is not responsible for investigating the underlying facts of each transaction, whether the goods are of the sufficient – and specified – quality or quantity. Because the transaction operates on a negotiable instrument, it is the document itself which holds the value - not the goods to which the reference. This means that the bank need only be concerned with whether the document fulfils the requirements stipulated in the letter of credit. Documents required under the LC, could in certain circumstances, be different from those required under the sale transaction. This would place banks in a dilemma in deciding which terms to follow if required to look behind the credit agreement. Since the basic function of the credit is to provide a seller with the certainty of payment for documentary duties, it would seem necessary that banks should honor their obligation in spite of any buyer allegations of misfeasance.&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1.A.C.168 at 183&lt;/ref&gt; If this were not the case, financial institutions would be much less inclined to issue documentary credits because of the risk, inconvenience, and expense involved in determining the underlying goods. Financial institutions do not act as 'middlemen' but rather, as paying agents on behalf of the buyer. Courts have emphasized that buyers always have a remedy for an action upon the contract of sale and that it would be a calamity for the business world if a bank had to investigate every breach of contract.

With the UCP 600 rules the ICC sought to make the rules more flexible, suggesting that data in a document "need not be identical to, but must not conflict with data in that document, any other stipulated document, or the credit", as a way to account for any minor documentary errors. However, in practice, many banks still hold to the principle of strict compliance, since it offers concrete guarantees to all parties. If this were not the case, the bank would be entitled to withhold payment even if the deviation is purely technical or even typographical.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Rayner &amp; Co., Ltd., and the Oil seeds Trading Company, Ltd. v.Ham bros Bank Limited [1942] 73 Ll. L. Rep. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada (The American Accord) [1983] 1 AC 168&lt;/ref&gt; The general legal maxim ''[[de minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]'' (literally "The law does not concern itself with trifles") has no place in the field. However, whilst the details of the letter of credit can be understood with some flexibility the banks must adhere to the “principle of strict compliance” when determining whether the documents presented are those specified in the letter of credit. This is done to make the banks' duty of effecting payment against documents easy, efficient and quick.

===Legal basis===
Legal writers have failed to satisfactorily reconcile the bank’s obligation to pay on behalf of the applicant with any contractually-founded, academic analysis. That is to say, they have not examined legal effect of the banks obligation through a conclusive theoretical lens. This has produced several conflicting theories as to the contractual effect of a letter of credit. Some theorists suggest that the obligation to pay arises through the implied promise, [[Assignment (law)|assignment]], [[novation]], reliance, [[Agency (law)|agency]], [[estoppel]] and even [[Trust law|trust]] and the guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Herman Norman|title=Legal Aspects of Commercial Letters of Credit|date=1930|publisher=Columbia University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsgMMwEACAAJ|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although documentary credits are enforceable once communicated to the beneficiary, it is difficult to show any [[consideration]] given by the beneficiary to the banker prior to the tender of documents. In such transactions the undertaking by the beneficiary to deliver the goods to the applicant is not sufficient consideration for the bank’s promise because the contract of sale is made before the issuance of the credit, thus consideration in these circumstances is past. However, the performance of an existing duty under a contract may be a valid consideration for a new promise made by the bank, provided that there is some practical benefit to the bank&lt;ref&gt;William v Roffey Brothers &amp; Nicholls (contractors) Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; A promise to perform owed to a third party may also constitute a valid consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Scotson v Pegg&lt;/ref&gt;

It might also be feasible to typify letters of credit as a [[collateral contract]] for a [[third-party beneficiary]], because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. [[Jean Domat]] suggests that because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity, the cause of a LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, a LC theoretically fits as a [[collateral contract]] accepted by conduct or in other words, an [[implied-in-fact contract]] where the buyer participates as the third party beneficiary with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term "[[beneficiary]]" is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a beneficiary (also, in trust law, ''[[cestui que use]]'') in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “[[consideration]] or [[Privity in English law|privity]] requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action [[assumpsit]] because of its promissory connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menendez|first=Andres|title=Letter of Credit, its Relation with Stipulation for the Benefit of a Third Party|ssrn=2019474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few countries have created statutes in relation to letters of credit. For example, most jurisdictions in the [[United States]] (U.S.) have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 5 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC). These statutes are designed to work with the rules of market practice including UCP and [[Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice|ISP98]]. These rules of practice are incorporated into the transaction by agreement of the parties. The latest version of the UCP is the UCP600 effective July 1, 2007.  Since the UCP are not laws, parties have to include them into their arrangements as normal contractual provisions. However, they still form a substantial part of market practice and underpin [[Financial law]] crucially.

== National laws ==

=== Germany ===
''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', the German civil code, does not directly address letters of credit. German case law indicates that the relationship between the issuing bank and customer is a contract for execution of a transaction, while the relationship between the issuing bank and the beneficiary is a promise of a debt.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grassi|first=Paolo S.|date=1995|title=Letter of Credit Transactions: The Banks' Position in Determining Documentary Compliance-A Comparative Evaluation under US, Swiss and German Law|url=https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1297&amp;context=pilr|journal=Pace International Law Review|volume=7|pages=81-127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[Swiss Civil Code]] of 1911 did not directly address letters of credit, which were still rare in the country at the time. Courts eventually dealt with the device by treating it as a hybrid of a mandate (''Auftrag'') and authorization-to-pay contract (''Anweisung'').&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== United States ===
Letters of credit came into general domestic use in the United States during [[World War I]], although they had been used in American foreign trade for some time prior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has historically had the most substantial and consistent body of case law in the United States with regard to letters of credit, due to the prominence of New York banks in international trade.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harfield|first=Henry|date=Fall 1962|title=Code Treatment of Letters of Credit|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2391&amp;context=clr|journal=Cornell Law Quarterly|volume=48|pages=92-107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Bankers Commercial Credit Conference of 1920 provided the first set of voluntary L/C regulations for major banks in the United States, but these banks transitioned to the international UCP standard by 1938.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Article 5 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], drafted in 1952, provided a basis for codifying many UCP principles into state law&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and created one of the only extensive specific legal regulations of letters of credit worldwide, although the UCC rules do not cover all aspects of letters of credit.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; New York effectively subjugated the UCC rules to the existing UCP rules, and as a result the UCP rules continued to govern letters of credit under New York law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Article 5 was revised in 1995 to reflect the latest international practices as codified in the UCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=James G.|date=1995|title=Internationalization of Revised UCC Article 5 (Letters of Credit)|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1428&amp;context=njilb|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|volume=16|pages=215-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in fraud ==
Letters of credit are sometimes used to defraud banks through presentment of false documentation indicating that goods were shipped when they actually were not. Letters of credit are also sometimes used as part of fraudulent investment schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/letter-of-credit-fraud|title=Letter of Credit Fraud|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Long Island Business News''''' ('''LIBN''') is a weekly business journal based in [[Ronkonkoma, New York]]. Launched in 1953 as the '''Long Island Commercial Review''', LIBN covers business, government, legal, nonprofit and health care issues in [[Long Island]]'s two counties, [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].

In addition to the weekly paper, LIBN maintains a Web site featuring news and several business blogs. The company also publishes lists of Long Island companies as well as several issue-centered books such as its annual Green Guide and 40 Under 40 Awards guide.

== History ==
In 1953 newspaper reporter Arthur Hug and the husband-and-wife team of Peg and John Whitmore launched ''Long Island Commercial Review''. Hug had been a reporter at the ''Nassau Daily Review-Star'', the leading newspaper on Long Island in the 1930s. Several years later, he accepted an offer to write for ''[[Newsday]]''. Hug also served as a copy editor for ''[[New York World-Telegram|World Telegram &amp; Sun]]'' shortly before it folded.

The Hug and Whitmore team published the first paper on September 14, 1953. An issue sold for 15 cents, and a yearly subscription cost $5. The ''Commercial Review'' was known as the official publication of the [[Long Island Association]], but it always remained independent.

In international economic relations and international politics, "'''most favoured nation'''" ('''MFN''') is a status or level of treatment accorded by one [[Sovereign state|state]] to another in [[international trade]]. The term means the country which is the recipient of this treatment must nominally receive equal trade advantages as the "most favoured&amp;nbsp;nation" by the country granting such treatment. (Trade advantages include low [[tariffs]] or high [[import quota]]s.) In effect, a country that has been accorded MFN status may not be treated less advantageously than any other country with MFN status by the promising country. There is a debate in legal circles whether MFN clauses in [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] include only substantive rules or also procedural protections.&lt;ref&gt;McCloure, Mike (2011-07-25). [http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2011/07/25/most-favoured-nation-clauses-%E2%80%93-no-favoured-view-on-how-they-should-be-interpreted/ "Most Favoured Nation Clauses – No favoured view on how they should be interpreted"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007030343/http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2011/07/25/most-favoured-nation-clauses-%E2%80%93-no-favoured-view-on-how-they-should-be-interpreted/ |date=2011-10-07 }}. ''Kluwer Arbitration Blog''. Retrieved 2011-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) agree to accord MFN status to each other. Exceptions allow for preferential treatment of [[Developing country|developing countries]], regional [[free trade area]]s and [[customs union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/regatt_e.htm|title=WTO – Regional Trade Agreements – goods (GATT) provisions|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the principle of [[national treatment]], MFN is one of the cornerstones of WTO [[trade law]].

"Most favoured nation" relationships extend ''reciprocal'' bilateral relationships following both [[GATT]] and WTO norms of reciprocity and non-discrimination. In bilateral reciprocal relationships a particular privilege granted by one party only extends to other parties who reciprocate that privilege, while in a multilateral reciprocal relationship the same privilege would be extended to the group that negotiated a particular privilege. The ''non-discriminatory'' component of the GATT/WTO applies a ''reciprocally'' negotiated privilege to all members of the GATT/WTO without respect to their status in negotiating the privilege.

== History ==
The earliest form of the most favoured nation status can be found as early as in the 11th century. Today's concept of the most favoured nation status starts to appear in the 18th century, which is when the division of conditional and unconditional most favoured nation status also began.&lt;ref name="Seong Deong 2004"&gt;Yi, Seong Deong (2004). Commemorative Edition in Honour of Professor Paik, Choong-Hyun on his Retirement : Articles ; Most-Favoured Nation Treatment: Its Historical Developments and Concept. Vol. 11 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of [[international trade]], "most favoured nation" status was usually used on a dual-party, state-to-state basis. A nation could enter into a "most favoured nation" treaty with another nation. In the [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|treaty of Madrid]] in 1667 Spain granted England "most favoured nation" trading status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economist: Weekly Commercial Times, Banker's Gazette and Railway Monitor, Volume 1|date=1845|publisher=Economist Newspaper Limited|page=551|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zkZUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794, the US also granted the same to Britain.

After [[World War II]], [[tariff]] and [[trade]] agreements were negotiated simultaneously by all interested parties through the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which ultimately resulted in the World Trade Organization in 1995. The World Trade Organization requires members to grant one another "most favoured nation" status. A "most favoured nation" clause is also included in the majority of the numerous [[Bilateral investment treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] concluded between capital exporting and capital importing countries after World War II.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Benefits==
Trade experts consider MFN clauses to have the following benefits:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
* Increases trade creation and decreases trade diversion. A country that grants MFN on imports will have its imports provided by the most efficient supplier if the most efficient supplier is within the group of MFN. Otherwise, that is, if the most efficient producer is outside the group of MFN and additionally, is charged higher rates of tariffs, then it is possible that trade would merely be diverted from this most efficient producer to a less efficient producer within the group of MFN (or with a tariff rate of 0). This leads to economic costs for the importing country, which can outweigh the gains from free trade.
* MFN allows smaller countries, in particular, to participate in the advantages that larger countries often grant to each other, whereas on their own, smaller countries would often not be powerful enough to negotiate such advantages by themselves. 
* Granting MFN has domestic benefits: having one set of [[tariffs]] for all countries simplifies the rules and makes them more transparent. Theoretically, if all countries in the world confer MFN status to each other, there will be no need to establish complex and administratively costly [[rules of origin]] to determine which country a product (that may contain parts from all over the world) must be attributed to for customs purposes. However, if at least one nation lies outside the MFN alliance, then customs cannot be done away with.
* MFN restrains domestic special interests from obtaining [[protectionism|protectionist]] measures. For example, butter producers in country A may not be able to lobby for high tariffs on butter to prevent cheap imports from developing country B, because, as the higher tariffs would apply to every country, the interests of A's principal ally C might get impaired.

As MFN clauses promote non-discrimination among countries, they also tend to promote the objective of [[free trade]] in general.

==Exceptions==
{{further|Preferential trading area}}
GATT members recognized in principle that the "most favoured nation" rule should be relaxed to accommodate the needs of [[developing countries]], and the [[UN Conference on Trade and Development]] (established in 1964) has sought to extend preferential treatment to the exports of the developing countries.&lt;ref name=underst&gt;''[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/understanding_e.pdf Understanding the WTO]'' Handbook at WTO official website. (Note that the document's printed folio numbers do not match the pdf page numbers.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|fol.93}}

Another challenge to the "most favoured nation" principle has been posed by regional [[trade bloc]]s such as the [[European Union]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which have lowered or eliminated tariffs among the members while maintaining tariff walls between member nations and the rest of the world. Trade agreements usually allow for exceptions to allow for regional [[economic integration]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Specific countries' policies==

===United States===
{{Contradicts other|date=August 2009|1=Permanent normal trade relations}}
{{Main|Permanent normal trade relations}}
In the 1990s, continued "most favoured nation" status for the [[People's Republic of China]] by the United States created controversy because of its sales of sensitive [[military technology]] and [[Human rights in China|China's serious and continuous persecution of human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?18389-1/uschina-trade-mfn-status U.S.-China Trade and MFN Status], [[C-SPAN]], JUNE 12, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; China's MFN status was made permanent on December 27, 2001. All of the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet states]], including [[Russia]], were granted MFN status in 1996. On a bilateral level, however, the [[United States]] could not grant MFN status to some members of the former [[Soviet Union]], including the [[Russian Federation]], because of the [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]]. This presented an obstacle to those countries' accession to the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090115105823/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2007-123-10.cfm Russia, Jackson-Vanik Amendment Could Be Lifted By End Of 2008] – JRL 5-31-07&lt;/ref&gt; At the urging of [[Joe Biden|Vice President Joe Biden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/03/14/47359712.html|title=Biden urges repeal of Jackson-Vanik amendment|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906022508/http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/03/14/47359712.html|archivedate=6 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jackson-Vanik amendment was repealed with [[Magnitsky Act]] (which attempts to punish human rights violations without hampering trade) on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/12/14/statement-press-secretary-hr-6156|title=Statement by the Press Secretary on H.R. 6156|work=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, in the [[United States]], "most favoured nation status" has been renamed "permanent normal trade relations" (NTR) as all but a handful of countries had this status already. The country gives preferential treatment to some of its trading partners without this status. This is based on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] interpretation of MFN principle as a mere prohibition to enact discriminatory legislation concerning duties on goods of like character imported from an MFN partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regional Cooperation and Free Trade Agreements in Asia|last=Hu|first=Jiang|last2=Vanhullebusch|first2=Matthias|publisher=Brill Nijhoff|year=2014|isbn=9789004279858|location=Leiden|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that MFN does not constrain the U.S. from giving out special privileges to other countries.

The ideas behind MFN policies can first be seen in US foreign policy during the opening of [[Japan]] in the mid to late 1850s, when they were included as a clause in the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Commercial Treaty of 1858]], which signalled the opening of the Japanese market.

Since 1998, the term normal trade relations (NTR) has replaced most favoured nation in all U.S. statutes. This change was included in section 5003 of the [[Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998]] (P.L. 105-206). However, Title IV of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] (P.L. 93-618) established conditions on U.S. MFN/NTR tariff treatment to certain non-market economies, one of which is certain freedom-of-emigration requirements (better known as the [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]]). The act authorizes the president to waive a country’s full compliance with Jackson-Vanik under specified conditions, and this must be renewed by June 3 of each year. Once the president does so, the waiver is automatic unless Congress passes (and avoids or overturns a presidential veto of) a disapproval resolution.

MFN/NTR status for China, a non-market economy, which had been originally suspended in 1951, was restored in 1980 and was continued in effect through subsequent annual Presidential extensions. Following the [[Tienanmen Square Massacre|massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square]] in 1989, however, the annual renewal of China’s MFN status became a source of considerable debate in the Congress; and legislation was introduced to terminate China’s MFN/NTR status or to impose additional conditions relating to improvements in China’s actions on various trade and non-trade issues. Agricultural interests generally opposed attempts to block MFN/NTR renewal for China, contending that several billion dollars annually in current and future U.S. agricultural exports could be jeopardized if that country retaliated. In China’s case, Congress agreed to permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status in P.L. 106-286, President Clinton signed into law on October 10, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbaugh, Kerry [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs2024/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20691_2001Apr27.html RS20691: Voting on NTR for China Again In 2001, and Past Congressional Decisions] at University of North Texas, April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; PNTR paved the way for China’s accession to the WTO in December 2001; it provides U.S. exporters of agricultural products the opportunity to benefit from China’s WTO agreements to reduce trade barriers and open its agricultural markets.

===India===
MFN status to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam, but review on withdrawal MFN status of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Withdrawal-of-Most-Favoured-Nation-status-may-hurt-Pakistan-industry-Experts/articleshow/54552083.cms India has decided to review the MFN status given to Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
There are increasing calls in Pakistan to grant the MFN status to [[China]]. During the negotiations for the $6.64 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan had given an undertaking that it would take positive steps to grant MFN status to India.

==In contract law==
A '''most favoured nation clause''' (also called a '''most favoured customer clause''' or '''most favoured licensee clause'''&lt;nowiki&gt;) is a contract provision in which a seller (or licensor) agrees to give the buyer (or licensee) the best terms it makes available to any other buyer (or licensee). In some contexts, the use of such clauses may become commonplace, such as when online ebook retailers contract with publishers for the supply of e-books.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The "Most Favored Nation" landmine |url=http://feldmanfile.blogspot.com/2012/04/most-favored-nation-landmine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of such clauses, in some contexts, may provoke concerns about anticompetitive influences and antitrust violations, while in other contexts, the influence may be viewed as procompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developing an Administrable MFN Enforcement Policy |url=http://www.crai.com/uploadedFiles/Publications/Developing_An_Administrable_MFN_Enforcement_Policy_Salop_ScottMorton_Antitrust_Spring_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example where most favoured nation clauses may appear is in institutional investment advisory contracts, where if a certain number of conditions are met, one client may be entitled to the lowest fee offered to other clients with a substantially identical investment strategy and the same or lower level of assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'', §2:5.50 (Thomson West, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most favoured nation clause can also be included in an agreement between a state and a company or an investor. This involves the provision of special privileges and advantages although the state cannot use contractual mechanisms to avoid its MFN treatment obligations with other countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment|last=Newcombe|first=Paul|last2=Paradell|first2=Lluis|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|year=2009|isbn=9789041123510|location=Austin|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the relationship among states where a nation accorded an MFN status cannot be treated less advantageously than another, the host nation does not breach MFN treatment if it provides different privileges to different investors. The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] clarified this when it stated that "a host country cannot be obliged to enter into an individual investment contract" and that "freedom of contract prevails over the MFN standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Most-favoured-nation Treatment, Volume 3|last=UNCTAD|first=|publisher=United Nations Publications|year=1999|isbn=9211124506|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This general principle, however, is not absolute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===European Union===
The current EU competition law position is that MFN clauses will infringe Article 101(i) if in the individual circumstances of the case result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the European Union. This is likely to happen when the parties to the agreement have substantial market power.

It is recognised by EU courts and regulators that such clauses are widely used in a number of industries including most topically with online travel agents. However the regulatory tide in the EU appears to be turning against the use of these clauses. In a number of recent EU cases in the UK and Germany, MFNs have been condemned when used by companies with significant market power.

In January 2014, the UK competition regulator, the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) accepted binding commitments from leading on-line booking platforms, Expedia and Booking.com to alter the way they operated their MFN clauses with a major hotel chain International Hotel Group. The decision is being appealed by the price comparison website Skyscanner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-competitionlaw.com/i-didnt-sign-up-for-this-skyscanner-appeals-expedia-commitments/|title=Bryan Cave EU &amp; Competition Law|work=Eu &amp; Competition Law|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by online travel agent, Skoosh.

The '''''National Business Review''''' (or '''''NBR''''') is a weekly, national [[New Zealand newspapers|New Zealand newspaper]] and online publication aimed at the business sector.

Businessman Barry Colman was the ''NBR's'' publisher for 24 years, after buying it from John Fairfax &amp; Sons in the 1980s. He sold it to [[Todd Scott]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/end-era-nbr-publisher-ck-127142|title=End of era for NBR publisher|date=2012-08-31|work=The National Business Review|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication's website has a paywall model, where businesses and individual subscribers pay to access certain content. As of June 2016, the ''NBR'' had more than 4000 paying subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/4000|title=NBR ONLINE paid member subscribers top 4000|date=2016-06-30|work=The National Business Review|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''NBR'' launched an online radio platform in March 2015, NBR Radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/nbr-radio|title=NBR continues its digital expansion with personalised radio, opens up trial mobile subscription to the masses|date=2015-03-12|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2017 it launched a video platform, NBR View, which is headed by broadcasters [[Susan Wood (television presenter)|Susan Wood]] and [[Simon Dallow]].

It has journalists based in Auckland and Wellington.

The publication produces an annual ''Rich List'' with the estimated wealth of the richest New Zealanders.

During the term of the 5th Labour government, ''NBR'' produced a feature called ''Crony Watch'', which it intended to report on cronyism in government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The feature was discontinued in late 2008, as the new National government took office, but resumed in 2018 after National's term ended, and the 6th Labour government took office.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A '''nominee trust''' is an arrangement whereby one or more persons appoint a "trustee" to be listed on legal title, or other documents, on their behalf. The arrangement is simple and passive, the trustee is to do nothing except what they are directed to do by the beneficiaries. Technically it is not a [[trust law|trust]] but an [[Agency (law)|agency]] arrangement, although it has been characterized as a hybrid between a traditional trust and an agency relationship. One use of the nominee trust is to avoid reporting the ownership of real estate on the public record. The deed, or other filed document lists the trustee, but not the undisclosed principals. Another use is to facilitate transfer of real property without involving the county recorder.

Unlike a trust, the trustee does not have legal title, which remains in the "beneficiaries". Therefore, the trustee does not file a tax return with regard to income on trust property, as they would in an actual trust.  The nominee trust is also an exception to the general rule that the capacity of a trustee is separate from the capacity of an agent. The common law may apply principles of the law of bailment to the nominee trust in some instances. The trustee is an agent of the beneficiaries who merely follows their specific directions. For bankruptcy purposes, the directed agency feature of a nominee trust prevents the trust itself from being a debtor-person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1990218113BR105_1193.xml/IN%20RE%20VILLAGE%20GREEN%20REALTY%20TRUST 113 B.R. 110 (1990). In Re Village Green Realty Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a nominee trust cannot declare bankruptcy. Debts contracted by the trustee in his trustee capacity are debts of the beneficiaries.

'''Optiarc''' is a brand of optical desk drives owned by a US company [[Vinpower]], Inc.

Initially Optiarc was established on April 3, 2006 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Sony corporation|Sony Corporation]] (55% shares) and [[NEC Corporation]] (45% shares). The company, named '''Sony NEC Optiarc''', focused on manufacturing optical disk drives primarily for the [[OEM]] desktop and [[notebook PC]] markets.

On September 11, 2008, it was announced that Sony would take over NEC's 45% share, making Optiarc a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218151311/http://www.sonynec-optiarc.com/company/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be called '''Sony Optiarc'''.

In March 2013, Sony closed its Optiarc optical disk division,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Sony to exit PC-use optical drives, say reports|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57501393-92/sony-to-exit-pc-use-optical-drives-say-reports/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=[[CNET]]|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=White|title=Sony Optiarc closed, the subsidiary that manufactures optical drives|url=http://technewspedia.com/sony-optiarc-closed-the-subsidiary-that-manufactures-optical-drives/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=Technewspedia|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; laying off about 400 employees globally.

In 2017, a US company [[Vinpower]], whose main business was manufacturing optical disc duplicators for the commercial market, acquired rights to the Optiarc brand and product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myce.com/news/u-s-company-vinpower-digital-claims-resurrecting-optiarc-cddvd-burner-brand-82160/|title=U.S. company VinPower Digital claims to be resurrecting Optiarc CD/DVD burner brand|last=Jan Willem|first=Aldershoff|date=June 19, 2017|work=Myce.com|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams''''' is a 1987 book on the social side of software development, specifically managing project teams.  It was written by software consultants [[Tom DeMarco]] and [[Tim Lister]], from their experience in the world of software development.  This book was revised in 2013.

==Overview==
''Peopleware'' is a popular book about software organization management. The first chapter of the book claims, "The major problems of our work are not so much ''technological'' as ''sociological'' in nature". The book approaches sociological or 'political' problems such as group chemistry and team jelling,  "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] time" and quiet in the work environment, and the high cost of turnover.   Other topics include the conflicts between individual work perspective and corporate ideology, corporate entropy, "teamicide" and workspace theory.

The authors presented most subjects as principles backed up by some concrete story or other information. As an example, the chapter "Spaghetti Dinner" presents a fictional example of a manager inviting a new team over for dinner, then having them buy and prepare the meal as a group, in order to produce a first team success. Other chapters use real-life stories or cite various studies to illustrate the principles being presented.

==Editions==
*1st Edition: 1987
*2nd Edition: 1999
The second edition kept the original content with only a few changes or corrections. The bulk of the new content was in a new section at the end. The new section's chapters revisited some of the concepts of the original chapters with changes and added new ones.
The eBook PDF version published by DorsetHouse was not searchable as each page appeared to be an image.  The Kindle version is searchable.
*3rd Edition: 2013
The new content of the third edition is spread out through the book. There are new chapters, but the original content has also been updated.

==Application status==

=== 2009 ===
Initial applications for regulatory approval to construct the PATH transmission line were filed in 2009. On September 9, 2009, the [[Maryland Public Service Commission]] rejected the application as improperly filed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvpubcast.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=11221 West Virginia Public Broadcasting, "PATH rejected by Maryland PSC on technicalities"].&lt;/ref&gt; PATH was given 30 days to declare whether they would refile in Maryland, but only announced they were reconsidering their options.  On October 19, 2009, the [[Virginia State Corporation Commission]] filed a motion to dismiss the PATH application in Virginia, citing inability to adequately analyze the project due to an uncertain Maryland termination point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leesburgtoday.com/articles/2009/10/23/news/fp11path102009.txt ''Leesburg Today'', "SCC Staff Recommends PATH Application Dismissal"].&lt;/ref&gt; On October 28, 2009 an attorney for the [[West Virginia Public Service Commission]] moved to dismiss the PATH application in West Virginia.  Virginia and West Virginia are requesting rejection of the application [[without prejudice]], meaning PATH will be able to refile in those states once they have refiled a proper application in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/527158.html?startIndex=26 [[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]], "PSC seeks to halt PATH"].&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2011 PJM Interconnect requested that [[FirstEnergy]] (which took control of Allegheny Power on February 25, 2011) and American Electric Power suspend efforts on PATH. "Recent dramatic swings in economic forecasts and evolving public policies, particularly with respect to renewable energy, are adding greater uncertainty to our planning studies," PJM President and CEO Terry Boston said in a prepared statement.&lt;ref name=cancelled /&gt; American Electric Power's and FirstEnergy Corp withdrew applications for the project in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BRIAN FARKAS Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=13021919 |title=ABC News, "$2B Power Line Project From WVa to Md.

Dick Ishler, President of the Citizens Against the Kemptown Electrical Substation (CAKES) says this is a huge victory for the little guy; "This is but the latest example of David beating Goliath, concerned citizens banding together, in this case, to stop a toxic coal-fired transmission line."&lt;ref name="fredericknewspost1"/&gt; Will Burns, the Sierra Club attorney who has spent hundreds of hours researching the PATH project is optimistic PJM's order will close the PATH project down; "We didn't believe this was needed for reliability reasons.

== Kemptown Property ==
{{References|date=April 2018}}
In December 2008 PATH Allegheny Transmission Company, LLC purchased two contiguous properties in Kemptown, Maryland comprising 152.2 acres for $6.83 million.  The properties, actively farmed at the time, were sold by the Browning family which held title to one property as a limited partnership and the other property as a limited liability company.   The Kemptown properties are bisected by a high tension electrical transmission line owned by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and are adjacent to a second high tension electrical transmission line.  PATH planned to  The Kemptown property was slated by PATH as the location of a large electrical substation.  In September 2010, PATH Allegheny Transmission Company, LLC conveyed the property to PATH Allegheny Maryland Transmission Company, LLC for no consideration.

On August 22, 2017 the two Kemptown properties, along with several other smaller properties in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia were sold at public auction.   F.C. Frederick, Inc. a non-profit soccer club based in Frederick Maryland submitted the winning bids on the Kemptown properties.  Settlement on the transaction occurred in October 2017 at a price of $1.008 million.

'''Robert Lucas Chance''' (8 October 1782 – 7 March 1865),&lt;ref name=thepeeragewc&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21406.htm#i214059 thePeerage.com - William Chance, father of the founders]&lt;/ref&gt; was the fifth child and eldest son of William Chance (a partner in [[Nailsea Glassworks]]) and Sarah Lucas (daughter of John Robert Lucas). He was always known as '''Lucas Chance'''.

==Working life==
He started work at his father's business in [[Birmingham]], at the age of 12, then started his own glass merchant business in London in 1815. This involved many trips to France where he formed alliances with French owners. In 1824 he purchased the British Crown Glass Company, following the death of the owner, Thomas Shutt, for £24,000, which is worth around £1 million in 2009.

He founded Chance Glass works, then formed a partnership with John Hartley in 1828. After experiencing financial difficulties in 1832, Lucas was then saved by his brother, William, who also became a partner. The partnership with Hartley's sons (who inherited the partnership on their father's death in 1833) was dissolved in 1836 and the business was then named [[Chance Brothers]] &amp; Company.

In 1830, he became great friends with [[Georges Bontemps]], a leading director of a glassworks in France, who would later assist at Chance Brothers following his exile from France. Chance was instrumental in introducing the method of Sheet glass production for making flat glass for (primarily) windows. This would eventually dispose the previous working method of Crown glass. He was also one of the great exponents in removing the crippling excise duty and the [[Window Tax]]. Following these actions, the glass trade in England started to flourish.

In 1851, Chance Brothers supplied the glass to glaze the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which was probably partly due to Chance's previous links with [[Joseph Paxton]], the architect, when supplying glass for the greenhouses at [[Chatsworth House]].

The two brothers were noted as being very philanthropic, founding a school (1845), a library and a church, all primarily for the workforce. Lucas Chance died in 1865.

'''Sally Cary Fairfax''' ({{circa}}1730 – 1811 in Bath, England) was the wife of [[George William Fairfax]] (1729–1787), a prominent member of the [[landed gentry]] of late [[colonial Virginia]]. As such, she was [[Mistress (form of address)|mistress]] of the [[Plantation economy|Virginia plantation]] and [[Estate (house)|estate]] of [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]]. She is well-remembered for being the woman [[George Washington]] was apparently in love with just before his marriage to [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Custis]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/3/2009_3_42.shtml Thomas Fleming] "George Washington in Love," ''American Heritage'', Fall 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family, early life and marriage===
Sally Cary, as she was born, came from one of [[Virginia]]'s oldest and wealthiest families. Her forefather, [[Miles Cary]] of [[Bristol]], [[England]], first came to America in the mid-17th century and established himself as a Virginian nobleman. [[Colonel Wilson Cary]], Sally's father and a member of the [[House of Burgesses]], inherited one of Virginia's largest fortunes and the family estate, [[Ceelys on the James]]. Little is known about his wife and Sally's mother, Sarah, on account of an 1826 fire that destroyed many of the family's records. Out of Colonel Cary's four daughters, the eldest Sally was the most sought-after and a grande belle in Virginian society. Although she had many suitors, [[George William Fairfax]] eventually won Sally's favor, and in records found by [[Wilson Miles Cary]], a writer and family historian, their marriage was announced in ''[[The Virginia Gazette]]'' in December 1748. After their marriage, Sally and George William moved into the [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]] estate that had been established in the early 1740s, by his father Col. [[William Fairfax]].

The [[Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Fairfax family]], as the Carys, was a living remnant of European feudalism and English aristocracy. Fairfax family members generally held the reins of social and political power in Virginia.

===Relationship with George Washington===
George William's sister, Anne Fairfax, married [[Lawrence Washington (1718-1752)|Lawrence Washington]] soon after George William's marriage to Sally. Lawrence's adolescent [[half-brother]], [[George Washington]], began visiting Belvoir frequently. Wishing to advance his brother's fortunes, Lawrence introduced George to George William. A friendship grew between the two men, who were close in age. Yet a relationship also blossomed between Sally Fairfax and George Washington. Sally had been well-educated under the Colonel's supervision, and as a young man with limited education and inexperienced in climbing the social ladder, Washington was impressed with this attractive, popular, and intelligent woman—arguably viewing her as the ideal of womanhood. She was a key inspiration for the future [[President of the United States|President]] to elevate himself to a higher social, cultural, and intellectual sphere, which is clear in the increasing level of refinement in his letters to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginialiving.com/virginiana/history/the-lady-of-belvoir/ |title=The Lady of Belvoir |last1=Darden |first1=Tyler |last2= |first2= |date=August 20, 2010 |website=''[[Virginia Living]]'' |publisher=Cape Fear Publishing|access-date=June 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving in the [[Forbes Expedition|Forbes campaign]] in September 1758, Washington wrote a particularly famous letter to Sally, telling her that "Tis true, I profess myself a Votary to Love…I feel the force of her amiable beauties in the recollection of a thousand tender passages that I wish to obliterate, till I am bid to revive them – but experience alas! Sadly reminds me how Impossible this is."   In another letter, he makes an allusion to the literary characters [[Juba II|Juba]], prince of Numidia, who loves Cato's daughter [[Marcia (given name)|Marcia]], in the play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', by [[Joseph Addison]]. This ambiguity makes the question of the relationship's consummation frustrating to historians, and the answer is still unknown.

Despite any feelings he may have felt for Sally Fairfax, Washington married the wealthy [[Martha Dandridge Custis]], perhaps to heighten his social status, but their marriage appears to have been strong. Sally and George William were, in fact, the most frequent visitors to [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]], implying that any inkling the spouses had of previous indiscretions (or flirtation) was politely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Thomas Flexner| title=George Washington in Love| work=American Heritage| date=Fall 2009| page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
The happy foursome separated in 1773 when the Fairfaxes repaired to England to attend to family matters. Thereafter, George William's fortunes were crushed. As a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], he had every intention of returning to America after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|1776 insurrection]] was over, but the success of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] prevented either of them from ever returning.  He died in 1787 and Sally then lived alone in Bath until her death in 1811.

There were signs of regret on Sally's part in the end.  She wrote to her sister-in-law in 1788: "I know now that the worthy man is to be preferred to the high-born who has not merit to recommend him…when we enquire into the family of these mighty men we find them the very lowest of people." Washington, too, confesses to Sally in a letter that she was the passion of his youth and that not all the glories of the Revolution, not even the splendors of the Presidency, had "been able to eradicate from my mind those happy moments, the happiest in my life, which I have enjoyed in your company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Thomas Flexner|title=Washington:  The Indispensable Man (paperback)|publisher=Back Bay Books (Little Brown and Company)|place=New York|year=1974|page= 364|ISBN=0-316-28605-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trivia-library.com/a/president-george-washington-personal-life.htm|title=President George Washington: Personal Life|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Screen Digest''' Ltd is a company providing [[business intelligence]], research and analysis on the global media markets based in [[London]], United Kingdom, that has grown out of a monthly journal of that name that was founded in 1971. It was acquired by the technology researcher iSuppli in 2010, which was in turn acquired by information services company [[IHS Inc.]]

== Company history ==
''Screen Digest'' was founded in 1971 by journalist and documentary film-maker [[John Chittock]], then film and video correspondent of the [[Financial Times]], together with his business partner and wife Joy Chittock.  Initially it was a news digest containing abstracts of a range of media, including film and cinema, television and in particular the nascent video sector and with editorial emphasis on the relevance and brevity of stories.

From the first issue,&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Digest'', October 1971. London: Screen Digest, 1971, 12pp&lt;/ref&gt; it has been characterised by the use of [[Computer icon|icons]] to identify the broad media subject area of each news story and the inclusion of contact information for companies and organisations mentioned in news items.  Other features from the start were the inclusion in the subscription of a free binder and detailed annual index, based on the concept of acting as a [[journal of record]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In February 1972 a four-page centre section on yellow paper was introduced, initially to carry a page of reference material and articles from members of the industry. Among early contributors were Robert W Sarnoff, then chairman of [[RCA]], film director and teacher [[Thorold Dickinson]] and the [[BBC]] director-general [[Charles Curran (broadcaster)|Charles Curran]].  This developed into a data-related eight-page section based on the company's recent research.  Also in that month [[David Fisher (editor)|David Fisher]] joined as news editor and led in the shaping of the standards of the commercial publication.  He became editor in July 1974 and held that position until January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Update by FIsher&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1970s, Chittock and Fisher produced a daily half-hour closed-circuit radio programme for delegates at the 1976 British Industrial Film Festival in [[Brighton]] and repeated the exercise the following year's 18th International Industrial Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/2867 BFI | Film &amp; TV Database | International Industrial Film Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[National Film Theatre]] in London.

In 1976 Screen Digest formed an alliance with Nord Media, a London-based research business owned by Ebav, an audio-visual company jointly owned by the Scandinavian enterprises [[Esselte]] and [[Bonnier Group|Bonnier]]. The partnership ended in May 1980.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Chittock sold the company in July 1996 to a management team comprising David Fisher, Allan Hardy, Ben Keen and Mark Smith. At that time the company had one full-time employee. Since then Screen Digest has expanded its consultancy and report publishing activities, as well as developing a set of continuously updated online information and data services on Advertising, Broadband Media, Cinema, Games, Mobile Media, Television, Television technology and Video. Screen Digest now counts over 50 full-time employees, with bases in New York and California in the US and Melbourne, Australia, as well as London.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2007, Screen Digest acquired the US video market research company Adams Media Research (AMR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=9709978 Adams Media Research, Inc.: Private Company Information – BusinessWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmediaresearch.com/site/contact/pressreleases.asp Adams Media Research :: Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and established Screen Digest Inc. The Global Media Intelligence (GMI) division was formed in 2007 to supply reports on media companies for corporate investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_7696_8149_74412_82725_84553 Merrill Lynch Agrees to Exclusive Distribution Agreement With Global Media Intelligence, a Producer of Independent Research in the Media Sector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media conferences==
In its association with Nord Media, Screen Digest staged two  video conferences: Video Disc 77&lt;ref&gt;David Fisher (compiler): ''Video Disc 77''. London: Nord Media, November 1977, 40pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and Video Disc and Videogram 79.&lt;ref&gt;David Fisher (compiler): Video Disc and Videogram 79. London: Nord Media, February 1979, 40pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1981 Screen Digest was involved in conference organisation for the International Video Week,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/289 BFI | Film &amp; TV Database |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; co-ordinated by [[The Economist]] and held on the [[South Bank]], London. The event was staged again the following year. Several industry lunches were also held in London around this time at which guest speakers included [[Buckminster Fuller]] and Rosita Sarnoff, granddaughter of [[David Sarnoff]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1996 Screen Digest became responsible for arranging the conference programme for the annual European Video Perspective (PEVE) home entertainment conferences and in 2007 acquired the sole ownership of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendigest.com/events/peve/index_html/view.html Screen Digest PEVE Digital Entertainment conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Shareholder Protection Act}}

The proposed '''Shareholder Protection Act'''&lt;ref name="hr4790"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4790}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2010. It would amend the [[Securities Exchange Act]] of 1934 to require that any solicitation of a proxy, consent, or authorization with respect to any security of an issuer: (1) describe the specific nature and total amount of expenditures proposed for political activities for the forthcoming fiscal year; and (2) provide for a separate shareholder vote to authorize such proposed expenditures. The bill was introduced by [[Michael Capuano|Representative Michael Capuano]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Massachusetts]], partially as a response to the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Citizens United v.

The '''Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway''' ('''SP&amp;S''') {{reporting mark|SPS}} was a [[United States]]-based [[railroad]] incorporated in 1905. It was a joint venture by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to build a railroad along the north bank of the [[Columbia River]]. Remnants of the line are currently operated by [[BNSF Railway]] and the [[Portland and Western Railroad]].

==History==
The railroad was chartered in 1905 by [[James J. Hill]] to connect the two transcontinental railroads owned by him, the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]] (NP) and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] (GN), to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] from [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;''The history of bnsf: A legacy for the 21st century''. Railway: The employee magazine of burlington northern sante fe corporation, 27. Retrieved from http://www.bnsf.com/about-bnsf/our-railroad/company-history/pdf/hist_overview.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; to gain a portion of the lumber trade in Oregon, a business then dominated by [[E.H. Harriman]]'s [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] railroads. Construction began in 1906&lt;ref name="greatest year"&gt;"Greatest Year for Railroad Construction: Building in Territory Tributary to Portland During 1906 Breaks All Records—City Now Strategic Point in Struggle of Giants". (January 1, 1907). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]" (Portland), section 2, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Portland &amp; Seattle Railway,&lt;ref name="greatest year"/&gt;&lt;ref name="american rails"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-rails.com/spokane-portland-and-seattle.html|title=The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, ''The Northwest’s Own Railway''|publisher=American-Rails.com|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeding eastward from [[Vancouver, Washington]].&lt;ref name="schafer2003"&gt;{{Schafer-Classic-Railroads-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1906 also saw the start of construction of the line between Vancouver and Portland, including work on three major new bridges, [[Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6|crossing the Columbia River]], the [[Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge|Oregon Slough]] and the [[Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1|Willamette River]].&lt;ref name="greatest year"/&gt; The northernmost of these was the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower [[Columbia River]].&lt;ref name="last bolt"&gt;"Finish Bridge Over Columbia; Steel Structure of the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railroad [sic] Completed—Last Bolt In Yesterday". (June 26, 1908). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite legal challenges from Harriman, within a year the line had been built as far as [[Pasco, Washington]] along the Columbia River, where it connected with NP. The first section to open was from Pasco west to Cliffs (near [[Maryhill, Washington|Maryhill]]), a length of {{convert|112|mi|km}}, on December 15, 1907.&lt;ref name=history-6nov1908&gt;"History of North Bank Road". (November 6, 1908). ''The Morning Oregonian'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation was extended west to [[Lyle, Washington|Lyle]], {{convert|33|mi|km}} further west, on January 15, 1908, as construction continued on the {{convert|221|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Pasco to Vancouver.&lt;ref name=history-6nov1908/&gt; 
[[File:Ocean Shore Limited Spokane Portland and Seattle Railroad.JPG|thumb|200px|SP&amp;S also operated the ''Ocean Shore Limited'', shown here at [[Seaside, Oregon]]]]

In January 1908 "Spokane" was added to the railroad's name, making it the '''Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway'''.&lt;ref name="changes name"&gt;"Important Articles Filed: North Bank Changes Name [from Portland &amp; Seattle Railway Company to Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway Company], Increases Capital and Will Extend". (January 30, 1908). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; SP&amp;S freight and passenger service (from Pasco) to Portland was inaugurated in November 1908.&lt;ref name="regular service"&gt;"First Train on Hill Road: Regular Passenger Service Inaugurated From Local Terminus". (November 18, 1908). ''The Morning Oregonian'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909 the railroad had completed construction of its line up to Spokane along the [[Snake River]]. In 1910 SP&amp;S gained control of the [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] interurban railway, which the Great Northern had acquired two years before. Under the control of the SP&amp;S the railroad was extended southward to [[Eugene, Oregon]] by 1912. SP&amp;S also operated a second subsidiary railroad in western Oregon, the [[Oregon Traction Company]],&lt;ref name="schafer2003"/&gt; which owned a route to [[Seaside, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="american rails"/&gt; 

[[File:Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway.jpg|thumb|Oregon Traction Company route to Seaside (Holiday) in 1930]]
[[File:Oregon Trunk Line.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trunk RR route in 1931]]
A third route on which the SP&amp;S operated extended southward from [[Wishram, Washington]] to [[Bend, Oregon]] was the Oregon Trunk Railroad. Edward Harriman's Oregon &amp; Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Company also was building a railroad south from the Columbia River to Bend resulting in a railroad war in which each railroad attempted to sabotage the other. In the end, the railroad opened using mostly the track of the Oregon Trunk, with a short portion of the Oregon &amp; Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Company track, and both railroads used the route (an arrangement that still exists with BNSF owning the majority of the line and UP having trackage rights).&lt;ref name="schafer2003"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] the SP&amp;S carried war materials to the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Theatre]]; new industries located along the Columbia River, taking advantage of cheap electricity from [[hydroelectric]] dams on the river.  New industries served by the SP&amp;S included aluminum plants, sawmills, chemical factories and grain elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spshs.org/history.html|title=HISTORY|publisher=SP&amp;S Railway Historical Society Railroad|year=2004|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 an SP&amp;S train derailed after hitting a rockslide on the route to Bend, Oregon. Part of the train landed in the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], including a boxcar, which landed in a rapid that was later named "[[Boxcar Rapids]]" after the incident, which killed all crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasco-history.r9esd.k12.or.us/comm/maupin/oldpics/railroad/boxcar.html|title=S.P.&amp;S.

== Passenger trains ==
[[File:Spokane Portland and Seattle Railroad North Bank dining car.JPG|thumb|200px|Dining car of the ''North Bank Limited'']]
The SP&amp;S's passenger operations mostly involved hosting connections with parents' trains, such as the ''[[Empire Builder]]'' and ''[[North Coast Limited]]'', which were combined to form the Streamliner (#1/#2). ''[[Oriental Limited]]'', ''[[Mainstreeter]]'', and ''[[Western Star (train)|Western Star]]'' connected with (#3/#4).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  However, some of these SP&amp;S trains were named. The ''Inland Empire Express'' (daytime) and ''North Bank Limited'' (overnight) provided daily, through service between Portland ([[Union Station (Portland, Oregon)|Union Station]]) and Spokane.&lt;ref name=28feb1922&gt;"Mountain, River and Canyon Scenery to Spokane" (SP&amp;S advertisement). (February 28, 1922). ''[[The Oregonian|The Morning Oregonian]]'' (Portland), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Columbia River Express'' (#5/#6) operated between Portland and Pasco, connecting at Pasco with Northern Pacific #5/#6 for service to/from Spokane.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

'''''The One Minute Manager''''' is a very short book  by [[Ken Blanchard]] and [[Spencer Johnson (writer)|Spencer Johnson]]. The brief volume tells a story, recounting three techniques of an effective [[management|manager]]: one-minute [[goal setting|goals]], one-minute [[praise|praisings]] and one-minute [[reprimand]]s. Each of these takes only a minute but is purportedly of lasting benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bruinleaders.ucla.edu/documents/BLP_samplebookreview.pdf Book review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101235854/http://www.bruinleaders.ucla.edu/documents/BLP_samplebookreview.pdf |date=2011-01-01 }} by Eric Spamer, Bruin Leaders Project, [[UCLA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
It was followed by a sequel, ''Leadership and the One Minute Manager'', by Ken Blanchard, Patricia Zigarmi and Drea Zigarmi, which laid out Blanchard's Situational Leadership II concept.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth H. Blanchard, Patricia Zigarmi, and Drea Zigarmi. ''[http://www.kenblanchard.com/Store/Books_Audios/Leadership_Starters/Leadership_and_the_One_Minute_Manager/ Leadership and the One Minute Manager: Increasing Effectiveness through Situational Leadership]''. New York: Morrow, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The concept has been called a [[management fad]], and derivative of [[management by objectives]], itself derived from the business planning literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Controversies==
While the book was becoming a best-seller, the ''Wall Street Journal'' ran an article exposing it as a heavily plagiarized document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
The article asserted that almost half of the book was lifted directly from an article previously published by University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor Arthur Elliott Carlisle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonentine.com/reviews/sf_chronicle.htm The Liars' Club] by Jon Entine, ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard and Johnson offered conflicting stories on their reasons for not citing the original author, including an insistence, later abandoned, that one of them helped Carlisle write the original article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Theresa Alice "Tessie" Fair''' (June 30, 1871 – November 22, 1926)&lt;ref name="MrsHOObit1926"/&gt; was an American [[socialite]]. She went from being the daughter of a hard-scrabble California miner to become heiress to a fortune in [[Comstock Lode]] gold and silver, the wife of steamship magnate [[Hermann Oelrichs]], mistress of the [[Rosecliff]] estate in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and a member of the elite "Triumvirate" of American society.&lt;ref name="Columbia2007"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Tessie was born on June 30, 1871 in [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]].  Her father, [[James Graham Fair]], was born in [[Clogher]], [[County Tyrone]], and immigrated to the United States from [[Belfast, Ireland]] in 1843 at age twelve. He worked the California mines until 1860, when he moved to Nevada to work the newly-discovered traces there.  He met Theresa Rooney, an innkeeper's daughter, and they wed in 1861.  Tessie grew up in mining camps as her father prospected for gold and was the eldest of four children born to her parents, including [[Virginia Fair Vanderbilt|Virginia]] (nicknamed "Birdie"), Charles and James, Jr.&lt;ref name="Gavan1998"/&gt;

In 1873, her father and three partners,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The four partners were [[John William Mackay]], [[James Graham Fair]], [[James C. Flood]] and [[William S. O'Brien]], who were collectively known as the [[Bonanza Kings]].&lt;ref name="1876Kings"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE MINING ARISTOCRACY. SOCIAL STANDING OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BONANZA KINGS.

More than $100 million dollars worth of gold (over $2.5 billion in today's currency) was extracted from that mine before it was exhausted in 1898.  Fair used his share to expand into railroads and real estate, generating a fortune of $50 million.&lt;ref name="Gavan1998"/&gt;  Money led to a dissolute life of affairs and drinking for him, and in 1883 his wife filed for divorce, getting custody of Tessie and Virginia.

In 1889, in Newport, Tessie met steamship tycoon [[Hermann Oelrichs]], whom she wed the following year on June 3, 1890.&lt;ref name="1890Wedding"&gt;{{cite news |title=HERMANN OELRICHS WEDS.

James Fair's gift to his daughter was one million dollars, but even so he was not invited to the wedding. Now a wealthy heiress, Tessie moved east permanently to join the social circles of New York, Newport and Europe.&lt;ref name="Gavan1998"/&gt; Tessie later gave birth to her only child:

===Society life===
Tessie's social peers, [[Alva Vanderbilt]] and [[Grace Vanderbilt]], already had expensive mansions in Newport, which were called "summer cottages" by the elite of the day. Tessie set her sights on being mistress of her own grand estate, so she commissioned architect [[Stanford White]] to renovate their recently purchased [[Rosecliff]] on [[Bellevue Avenue]].&lt;ref name="MrsHOObit1926"/&gt;  Begun in 1899, and purchased from the estate of [[George Bancroft]], Rosecliff was modeled after the [[Grand Trianon]] at [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and was completed in 1902 with a final cost of $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="Rosecliff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosecliff {{!}} Newport Mansions |url=http://www.newportmansions.org/explore/rosecliff |website=www.newportmansions.org |publisher=[[Preservation Society of Newport]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, Tessie orchestrated a coup for the family by marrying her younger sister Birdie off to [[William K.

'''Trevor James Flugge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|l|uː|g|i}} {{respell|FLOO|ghee}}; born 1 February 1947) is an [[Australia]]n farmer and businessman. He is best known as a former official of the [[Australian Wheat Board]] (AWB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianwoolgrowers.com.au/media_links.html Australian Wool Growers Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206002825/http://www.australianwoolgrowers.com.au/media_links.html |date=6 February 2007 }} (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the board in 1984, was chair of AWB in 1995-2002, and was present at meetings in [[Iraq]] which were linked to the [[Oil-for-Food Programme#Oil for wheat|Oil-for-Food scandal]], and an [[Paul Volcker Committee|inquiry by the United Nations]].

==Background==
Flugge was educated at [[Aquinas College, Perth]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://owca.org.au/june2004.pdf ''OWCA'', June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; and became a farmer in the [[Katanning, Western Australia|Katanning]] area.

In 1987, he was an unsuccessful [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] candidate for the seat of [[Division of O'Connor|O'Connor]] (against [[Wilson Tuckey]]) at the [[Australian federal election, 1987|Australian election]] that year.

Flugge has also served as chair of the Australian Wheat Growers Association, and as a board member of the major diversified company [[Wesfarmers]]

==Oil-for-Food scandal &amp; the Cole Inquiry==
Trevor Flugge was chair of AWB until March 2002, when he was voted off the board by A-class shareholders (wheat growers). He was appointed a consultant to AWB after the vote and travelled to [[Baghdad]] later that year, with AWB chairman [[Andrew Lindberg]], to rescue an AWB wheat export deal with [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

There were later accusations that AWB had paid [[bribe]]s to secure the export contract. AWB officials agreed to pay [[US dollar|$]]2 million to the Iraqi regime, which would then allow wheat exports to resume. This payment was made by inflating the price of wheat contracts administered by the [[United Nations]] [[Oil-for-Food Program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/02/1138836372830.html The Age - The Odd Stray Shot] (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]] and overthrow of the Hussein regime, Flugge was made a senior adviser to the Iraqi agriculture department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/media/transcripts/2003/030422_flugge_iraq.html Transcript - Alexander Downer Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218154214/http://www.dfat.gov.au/media/transcripts/2003/030422_flugge_iraq.html |date=18 February 2007 }} (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bribery became public in 2005, Flugge denied to the UN's [[Paul Volcker Committee|Volker inquiry]] that he knew about AWB's payments to the Hussein regime. Flugge was also called before an Australian government investigation in 2005, the [[Cole inquiry]]. When giving evidence to the latter inquiry, Flugge frequently claimed to have no knowledge of matters discussed at meetings he attended, due to hearing loss.

'''Yaron Brook''' ({{lang-he|ירון ברוק}}; born May 23, 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ybrook/info|title=Yaron Brook|work=Facebook.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Israel]]i-[[United States|American]] entrepreneur, writer, and activist. He is an [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] and the current chairman of the board at the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], where he was executive director from 2000 to 2017. He is also the co-founder of BH Equity Research and the author of several books, in which he analyzes a variety of topics from an Objectivist perspective.

==Early life and education==
Yaron Brook was born and raised in [[Israel]]. His parents were [[Jewish]] [[socialism|socialists]] from [[South Africa]]. When he was sixteen, a friend lent him a copy of [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', leading him to abandon the socialism taught to him by his parents and to embrace [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name="ocregister.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/brook-rand-institute-1884783-self-money|title=Atlas came to Irvine|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=2015-03-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615164032/http://www.ocregister.com/news/brook-rand-institute-1884783-self-money|archivedate=2008-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, he served as a [[first sergeant]] in Israeli [[military intelligence]] (1979–1982) and then earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[civil engineering]] in 1986 from the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name="aynrand.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5151 |title=Yaron Brook |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he moved to the [[United States]], where he received his [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1989 and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[finance]] in 1994 from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

==Career==
Brook began his career as a finance professor at the [[SCU Leavey School of Business|Leavey School of Business]] at [[Santa Clara University]], a position he held for seven years and which won him awards of recognition.

In 1998, he co-founded a financial advisory firm with Robert Hendershott, BH Equity Research, where he continues today as managing director and chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhequity.com|title=BH Equity Research|work=Bhequity.com|accessdate=2015-03-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216222350/http://bhequity.com/|archivedate=2014-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook became an associate of leading Objectivist intellectuals, such as philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], and in 1994, he co-founded Lyceum International, a company that organized Objectivist conferences and offered distance-learning courses. In 2000, he left Santa Clara University to succeed Michael Berliner as President and Executive Director of the Ayn Rand Institute, which was then located in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. In 2002, ARI relocated to [[Irvine, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayn Rand Institute to Move to Orange County |first=Vivian |last=Letran |date=June 7, 2002 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/07/local/me-rand7 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook's  philosophical [[activism]] includes teaching and public lecturing at events and conferences held predominantly in [[North America]], speaking and debating at numerous American universities, delivering seminars for businesses and corporations in the [[United States]] and abroad, and writing opinion editorials for leading newspapers and websites. Speaking venues also include conferences, and professional and community groups. His subjects span a wide range of current events and philosophical issues, including: the causes of the financial crisis, the morality of capitalism, and ending the growth of the state, each discussed with Objectivism at its foundation. In recent years, he has spoken to audiences throughout the world, including those in China, Australia, Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmXDrm5Q-eQ|title=Anarchy and efficient law|date=10 December 2010|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zowty7CYl_c|title=Yaron Brook en Libertad Querida!|date=9 May 2011|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc-tv.com/yaron-brook-in-greece/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217135747/http://arc-tv.com/yaron-brook-in-greece/ |date=February 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland, Bulgaria, Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iISAR1H3Lds|title=Yaron Brook, Director of the Ayn Rand Institute at BGU MBA Program|date=13 June 2012|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmedia.ufm.edu/aynrandcapitalism|title=Ayn Rand: Radical for Capitalism|work=UFM New Media|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGY3apqmY5Q|title=Yaron Brook - How to be a Rational Egoist|date=13 September 2011|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook is a columnist for ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.forbes.com/search/colArchiveSearch?aname=Yaron+Brook&amp;author=yaron+and+brook|title=Forbes Search|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his articles have been featured in ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''USA Today'', ''Investor's Business Daily'', and many other publications. A frequent guest on a variety of radio and national television programs, he is the co-author of ''Neoconservatism: An Obituary for an Idea'' and ''Free Market Revolution: How Ayn Rand's Ideas Can End Big Government'', and contributing author of ''Winning the Unwinnable War: America's Self-Crippled Response to Islamic Totalitarianism.'' His newest book is ''Equal Is Unfair: America's Misguided Fight Against Income Inequality,'' co-authored with [[Don Watkins]].

==Views and opinions==
===Rational selfishness===
Brook promotes the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] ethical position that [[rational selfishness]] is a moral virtue and that [[altruism]] is evil. In addition to teaching classes on his moral view of self-interest at ARI and as a guest lecturer at [[Brown University]], Brook also defended the egoist position in a 2006 debate with former US Senator [[Robert Krueger]] at [[Texas State University]], San Marcos.

===Politics and economics===
Brook is an outspoken proponent of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. In appearances on [[CNBC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.cnbc.com/main.do?keywords=yaron+brook&amp;target=video&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=yaron brook - CNBC |publisher=Search.cnbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in several articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?news_iv_ctrl=-1&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5455 |title=Paralyzing America's Producers |first1=Alex |last1=Epstein |first2=Yaron |last2=Brook |date=October 22, 2002 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speeches, he has defended the rights of [[corporations]] and [[businessmen]] and upheld the [[virtues]] of capitalism. In a January 7, 2007 editorial in ''USA Today'', he defended multimillion-dollar [[CEO]] pay packages against the attempt by government to regulate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070108/oppose08.art.htm |title=Pay is company's prerogative |first=Yaron |last=Brook |date=January 7, 2007 |work=USA Today |page=19A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Brook called the efforts of Democrats to raise taxes on multi-millionaires "totally immoral." He criticized [[George W. Bush]] for signing the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], which regulates corporate [[accounting]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0703/0703businessassault.htm |title=The cost of the 'ethical' assault on honest businessmen |first2=Alex |last2=Epstein |first1=Yaron |last1=Brook |date=July 14, 2003 |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also argued that [[antitrust laws]] are "unjust and make no sense ethically or economically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/00/business/specials/brook0719.htm |title=Capitalism and Business Ethics: Yaron Brook, Executive Director of the Ayn Rand Institute |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=July 19, 2000 |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], Brook has stated, "The government certainly has a role in regulating ownership of weapons", but he states that it is a "complex" issue to do with the [[philosophy of law]]. He is inclined to draw the line of prohibition between "offensive" weapons, such as [[tank]]s and [[weapons of mass destruction]], and "defensive" weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2013/03/18/ybrook-did-ayn-rand-ever-discuss-her-views-on-the-second-amendment-and-gun-control-what-are-your-own-views-about-what-restrictions-if-any-a-proper-government-would-place-on-ownership-of-handguns-a/|title=YBrook: Did Ayn Rand ever discuss her views on the second amendment and gun control? What are your own views about what restrictions, if any, a proper government would place on ownership of handguns and other firearms? « Podcast « Peikoff|work=Peikoff.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook has stated that he does not believe regulation has any role to play in protecting the environment and believes human-originated [[climate change]] to be a doomsday scenario propagated by [[environmentalists]]. He has indicated that as an ideological iteration it goes back decades, and that he believes [[global warming]] is "another in a line of failed scare stories," with preferential funding given to researchers promoting it. Drawing a comparison between the role played by low quality housing and infrastructure in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and the contrasting resilience of more developed countries, he suggests the solution to supposed environmental changes is ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and the resultant rise in standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://vimeo.com/9311026|title=Yaron Brook - Q&amp;A Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy and war====
'''American foreign policy'''

Brook has gained much attention for his application of Objectivist moral philosophy to the question of [[American foreign policy]], particularly on the [[Middle East]].

He advocates an American foreign policy of rational self-interest that would serve only to protect the [[natural rights|rights]] of Americans, as opposed to any form of government monetary aid, state-building, or spreading democracy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_1yrlater]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005043238/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_1yrlater |date=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized the foreign policy of [[Ron Paul]] and other [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2014/01/27/to-yb-is-obama-worse-on-foreign-policy-than-ron-paul/|title=To YB: Is Obama worse on foreign policy than Ron Paul? « Podcast « Peikoff|work=Peikoff.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocates the withdrawal of US troops from [[Europe]], and US withdrawal from the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[United Nations]], calling the latter "one of the most immoral institutions ever created by man". He is ambivalent about the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2014/03/06/to-yb-should-the-united-states-be-a-member-of-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato/|title=To YB: Should the United States be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)? « Podcast « Peikoff|work=Peikoff.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook calls for an [[Trade embargo|embargo]] on [[North Korea]], denouncing the regime as "threatening" and "belligerent", but believes that war is not necessary at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2013/07/25/ybrook-i-recently-read-an-article-that-urged-the-united-states-establish-relationships-with-north-korea-similar-to-vietnam-under-clinton-was-it-a-good-idea-then-is-it-a-good-idea-now/|title=To YBrook: I recently read an article that urged the United States establish relationships with North Korea, similar to Vietnam under Clinton. Was it a good idea then? Is it a good idea now? « Podcast « Peikoff|work=Peikoff.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War against Islamic terrorism'''

Brook argues that Islamic terrorists initiated a war against the West because they hate its culture, wealth, love of life, and global influence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVz4hsx0uns|title=Dr. Yaron Brook speaks at UCLA panel on Totalitarian Islam|date=13 April 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they attack Israel because of the influence Western culture has had on it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He explicitly rejects the idea that Islamic terrorists attack Western nations because they support Israel or because of any other reason, such as poverty or retaliation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Brook claims that the West is not at war with terrorism but the ideology of [[Islamic totalitarianism]]. He repeatedly says that just like in [[World War II]], the US wasn't at war against Japanese [[Kamikaze]] pilots or German tanks, but the ideas of [[Nazism]] and [[Japanese Imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1184168546756&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZVNYH5aR9E|title=Dr. Yaron Brook  - Israel and the West's War against Islamic Totalitarianism|date=13 July 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook claims that Islamic totalitarians are Muslims who wish to dictate every part of life from the teachings of Islam, taken to its logical extreme.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; He believes Islamic totalitarians want to organize their governments according to Islam, and that they wish to spread a global Islamic government across the world, sometimes using legitimate means, but mainly by using physical force, i.e. terrorism.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Brook claims that the Islamic totalitarians repeatedly express this, openly.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it is a movement that believes in conquest ... Islam should rule every aspect of one's life ... they don't believe in separation of religion and state ... and those who disagree are second class citizens or worthy of death, they want an empire in middle east, but their goal ultimately is world domination, and they state this. They are never satisfied with oppressing their own people or the people around them, they want world domination.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Morality of war'''

Brook has done a fair amount of work to formulate a unique morality of war&lt;ref name="theobjectivestandard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2006-spring/just-war-theory.asp|title="Just War Theory" vs. American Self-Defense|work=The Objective Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_moralityofwar]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029155627/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_moralityofwar |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (but a morality originated by Ayn Rand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5138|title=Media Center|work=Aynrand.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also advocated by other Objectivists like [[Leonard Peikoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAWCwm-UXw|title=Leonard Peikoff Interview about attacking IRAN|date=18 June 2008|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onkar Ghate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6418&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021|title=Media Center|work=Aynrand.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Craig Biddle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theobjectivestandard.com/blog/2006/10/reply-to-question-about-targeting-non.asp|title=Reply to a Question about Targeting Non-Combatants in War|work=The Objective Standard|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook claims that when the US goes to war, it should only be to protect the rights of its people, and the government must do everything in its power to end the threat to its citizens, as soon as possible, by using overwhelming military force (or the threat of force).&lt;ref name="theobjectivestandard.com"/&gt; If torturing enemy POWs and purposely targeting civilian population centers will end a war against American citizens, Brook is for it. The specific goal of this total war would be to crush the will of the people who started the war against the United States. After the government of the enemy country is destroyed, the United States should leave unless there is a special circumstance in which the people of the defeated country are realistically willing to adopt Western-style governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_democracy]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183312/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_democracy |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "'Just War Theory' vs. American Self-Defense," co-authored with Alex Epstein in ''[[The Objective Standard]]'', Brook writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Without physical and spiritual support by these states, the Islamic Totalitarian cause would be a hopeless, discredited one, with few if any willing to kill in its name. Thus, the first order of business in a proper response to 9/11 would have been to end state support of Islamic Totalitarianism—including ending the Iranian regime that is its fatherland.&lt;ref name="theobjectivestandard.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brook further argues that these [[Islamic]] states must be severely attacked in order to crush their will to engage in and support [[terrorism]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The US has been attacked first thus it has the ''moral right'' to fight [[Islamism]]. The sole moral duty of the United States is to defend its citizens against its enemies by all means, even with the use of the [[atom bomb]] if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=4342 |title=No Apologies for Hiroshima and Nagasaki |publisher=Capmag.com |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What specific military actions would have been required post-9/11 to end state support of Islamic Totalitarianism is a question for specialists in military strategy, but even a cursory look at history can tell us one thing for sure: It would have required the willingness to take ''devastating military action against enemy regimes''—to oust their leaders and prominent supporters, to make examples of certain regimes or cities in order to win the surrender of others, and to inflict suffering on complicit civilian populations, who enable terrorist-supporting regimes to remain in power.&lt;ref name="theobjectivestandard.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the beginning of the [[War on Terrorism]], Brook has argued that [[Iran]] should be the primary target of US retaliation for [[9/11|Sept. 11]], secondary targets being Saudi Arabia and Syria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

He is for waging war on [[Islamic totalitarian]] states, but he believes that Bush's "Forward Strategy of Freedom" is [[altruistic]], self-defeating, and in opposition to America's national self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-spring/forward-strategy-for-failure.asp|title=The "Forward Strategy" for Failure|work=The Objective Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2006 speech "Democracy vs. Victory: Why the 'Forward Strategy of Freedom' Had to Fail"&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.wgbh.org/wgbh/forum.php?lecture_id=3228] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013153646/http://forum.wgbh.org/wgbh/forum.php?lecture_id=3228 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; given at the [[Ford Hall Forum|Ford Hall]] Forum in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] he said:

{{quote|Washington commanded the military to tip-toe around Iraq. Troops were coached in all manner of cultural sensitivity training, so they would not offend the customs of the locals. The welfare of Iraqis was placed above the lives of our soldiers, who were put in the line of fire but prevented from using all the necessary force necessary to win. US troops died as a result.

Washington treats the lives of our military personnel as expendable. Their blood is spilled for the sake of serving Iraqis, a people overwhelmingly hostile to America.

Bush had committed America to this selfless mission in the run-up to the war.}}

On December 17, 2004, Yaron Brook appeared on The O'Reilly Factor, Impact Segment, "Aftermath of Fallujah activities", the context was that an embedded journalist had reported about the shooting of previously disarmed Iraqi soldiers in Fallujah. During this interview he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm suggesting that we start bringing this war to the civilians, the consequences of this war, to the civilians who are harboring and helping and supporting the insurgents in Fallujah and other places. ... I would like to see the United States turn Fallujah into dust, and tell the Iraqis:  If you're going to continue to support the insurgents you will not have homes, you will not have schools, you will not have mosques ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brook argued that if "flattening Fallujah to end the Iraqi insurgency will save American lives, to refrain from [doing so] is morally evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Harkinson |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2007/12/apostles-ron-paul?page=2 |title=The Apostles of Ron Paul |publisher=Motherjones.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israel'''

Brook considers Israel to be a morally good nation because its Western-style government protects the rights of its citizens, Arab and Jewish alike, vastly more than neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_israel]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005043216/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reg_ls_israel |date=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=1674 |title=Israel Has A Moral Right To Its Life |publisher=Capmag.com |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Zionism]], Brooke argued that "Zionism fused a valid concern - self-preservation amid a storm of hostility - with a toxic premise - ethnically based collectivism and religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/You-dont-fight-a-tactic |title='You don't fight a tactic' |first=Orit |last=Arfa |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=July 12, 2007 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook advocates morally, but not necessarily financially, supporting [[Israel]], which he sees as a Western ally against [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=3522 |title=An Interview with Yaron Brook (Part I) |first=Bevan |last=Sabo |publisher=Free Market Mojo |date=October 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122071126/http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=3522 |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook strongly disagrees with many aspects of Israel's policies, including its collectivist and religious influences, and its 'self-sacrificial' foreign policy of giving its enemies land, money, and other goods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=1674 |title=Israel Has A Moral Right To Its Life |first=Yaron |last=Brook |date=June 23, 2002 |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
