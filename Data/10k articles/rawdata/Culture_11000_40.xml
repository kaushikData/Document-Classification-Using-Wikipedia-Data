'''Alberti bass''' is a particular kind of [[accompaniment]] [[figure (music)|figure]] in [[music]], often used in the [[classical music era|Classical era]], and sometimes  the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. It was named after [[Domenico Alberti]] (1710–1740/46), who used it extensively, although he was not the first to use it.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;"Alberti Bass." Baker's Student Encyclopedia of Music. Ed. Laura Kuhn. Schirmer-Thomson Gale, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti bass is a kind of [[broken chord]] or [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] accompaniment, where the notes of the [[chord (music)|chord]] are presented in the order lowest, highest, middle, highest. This pattern is then repeated.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; The broken chord pattern helps to create a smooth, sustained, flowing sound on the piano.

Alberti bass is usually found in the left hand of pieces for [[keyboard instrument]]s, especially for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s piano pieces. However, it is also found in pieces for other instruments. 

Well-known examples of Alberti bass include the beginning of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Piano Sonata, K. 545 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata, K 545]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rink|first=John|title=Musical performance: a guide to understanding|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A famous example from 20th-century American popular music is the rhythm guitar part of the 1962 "surf rock" standard "[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]", by [[The Chantays]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''''Angel of Grief''''' or the '''''Weeping Angel''''' is an 1894 sculpture by [[William Wetmore Story]] for the grave of his wife Emelyn Story at the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Its full title bestowed by the creator was ''The Angel of Grief Weeping Over the Dismantled Altar of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2015/08/14/vandalism-angel-grief-081415/|title=Stanford police seek information on vandalism of Angel of Grief|date=14 August 2015|work=Stanford News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was Story's last major work prior to his death, a year after his wife. The statue's creation was documented in an 1896 issue of ''Cosmopolitan Magazine'': according to this account, his wife's death so devastated Story that he lost interest in sculpture, but was inspired to create the monument by his children, who recommended it as a means of memorializing the woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan Magazine'', cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.hinghamcemetery.org/pie_3f.html|publisher=Hingham Cemetery|title=Angel of Grief|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the typical angelic grave art, "this dramatic life-size winged figure speaks more of the pain of those left behind" by appearing "collapsed, weeping and draped over the tomb".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The term is now used to describe multiple grave stones throughout the world erected in the style of the Story stone.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book|page=158|isbn=9781603441636|title=Houston's Silent Garden|author=Turner, Suzanne; Wilson, Joanne|publisher=Texas A&amp;M Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the design "one of the most copied images in the world".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/mar/02/the-10-best-famous-graves|newspaper=The Guardian|title=The 10 best... famous graves|author=Stanford, Peter|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Story himself wrote that "It represents the angel of Grief, in utter abandonment, throwing herself with drooping wings and hidden face over a funeral altar. It represents what I feel. It represents Prostration. Yet to do it helps me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FPpqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347|title=William Wetmore Story and His Friends|edition=abridged and annotated|author=James, Henry|publisher=Big Byte Books|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent replicas of the Angel of Grief sculpture include the Henry Lathrop monument, located in the Stanford Arboretum at [[Stanford University]]. Lathrop was the brother of [[Jane Stanford]], the co-founder of the university. The original replica was built in 1901, but was severely damaged in the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]], leading to its replacement in 1908. After years of neglect, the 1908 replacement was fully restored in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Labor of Love Leads to a Happy Ending for "Angel of Grief"| url =http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/mausoleum-418.html| accessdate = 10 May 2010|work=Stanford News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Angel of Grief Restoration| url =http://www.customstonecarving.com/stone%20restoration/Angel%20of%20Grief%20.pdf| accessdate = 10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =A photo of the Memorial after the 1906 quake, showing the fallen canopy.| url =http://quake06.stanford.edu/centennial/gallery/structures/palmdrive/pages/sc206_bx1_fldr9_pg10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the Cassard angel, erected around 1908 in the [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=41|isbn=9781423621027|title=

The image has also been used in popular culture, such as in an album cover for the band [[Nightwish]]'s album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' (2004) and in the 2012 film ''[[The Woman in Black]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

An '''artifact''',{{efn|From [[Latin]] phrase ''arte factum''~''ars'' skill + ''facere'' to make}} or '''artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is something made or given shape by humans, such as a tool or a work of art, especially an object of archaeological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=artefact. (n.d.)|work=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition|accessdate=2 August 2012|via=CollinsDictionary.com |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/artefact}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[archaeology]], however, the word has become a term of particular nuance and is defined as: an object recovered by archaeological endeavor, which may be a [[cultural artifact]] having [[archaeological culture|cultural]] interest. However, modern archaeologists take care to distinguish [[material culture]] from [[ethnicity]], which is often more complex, as expressed by [[Carol Kramer]] in the dictum "pots are not people".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Kramer, "Pots and Peoples" in; Louis D. Levine and T. Culyer Young (eds.), ''Mountains and Lowlands: Essays in the Archaeology of Greater Mesopotamia''; Malibu, Undena, 1977; cited in Serge Cleuziou, "Introduction", [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ag0F80okf-QC&amp;pg=PA17 ''Objets et symboles: de la culture matérielle à l'espace culturel : actes de la 1re Journée doctorale d'archéologie, Paris, 20 mai 2006''], Ed. Laurent Dhennequin, Guillaume Gernez and Jessica Giraud, Paris: Sorbonne, 2009, {{ISBN|9782859446222}}. {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samartian-Persian necklace and amulet.png|thumb|Archaeological artifact from Black Sea region: a Sarmatian-Parthian gold necklace and amulet, 2nd century AD.]]

Examples include [[stone tool]]s, [[pottery]] vessels, metal objects such as weapons, and items of personal adornment such as [[buttons]], [[jewellery|jewelry]] and clothing.  [[Bones]] that show signs of human modification are also examples. Natural objects, such as fire cracked rocks from a [[hearth]] or plant material used for food, are classified by archeologists as [[ecofacts]] rather than as artifacts. From the point of view of ethnography and archaeology, an ancestral artifact can be defined as "any object of natural raw material (chert, obsidian, wood, bone, native copper, and so on) made by a people following a lifestyle based on foraging (e.g. hunting, gathering) and/or basic agriculture or pastoralism (e.g. horticulture, transhumance)".&lt;ref&gt;Hortolà, Policarp (2017). [http://saa.uaic.ro/articles/SAA.23.2.2017.213-225.pdf “From antiquities to memorabilia: a standardised terminology for ancestral artefacts according to manufacture date”]. ''Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica''. '''23''' (2): 213–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Artifacts can come from any [[archaeological context]] or source such as:

* [[Burial|Buried]] along with a [[Human body|body]]
* From any [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]] such as a [[midden]] or other domestic setting
* [[Votive offering]]s
* [[Hoard]]s, such as at [[aquifer|well]]s

Artifacts are distinguished from the main body of the archaeological record such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] [[feature (archaeology)|feature]]s, which are non-portable remains of human activity, such as [[hearth]]s, [[road]]s, deposits, trenches or similar remains, and from [[Biofact (archaeology)|biofact]]s or ecofacts, which are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as [[seed]]s or [[animal]] [[bone]].

Natural objects that humans have moved but not changed are called [[manuport]]s. Examples include seashells moved inland, or rounded pebbles placed away from the water action that made them.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|[[Curmsun Disc]] - Obverse, Jomsborg, 980s, Burial site of king [[Harald Bluetooth]] ]]

These distinctions are often blurred. For instance, a bone removed from an animal carcass is a biofact, but a bone carved into a useful implement is an artifact. Similarly there can be debate over early stone objects that could be either crude artifacts or naturally occurring and happen to resemble early objects made by [[early humans]] or ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. It can be difficult to distinguish the differences between actual man-made [[Stone tool|lithic]] artifacts and [[geofacts]] – naturally occurring lithics &lt;!-- unlink, as overlink, but note that source uses this language, which seems to contrary to the usual sense that "lithic" implies artifact --&gt; that resemble man-made tools. It is possible to authenticate artifacts by examining the general characteristics attributed to man-made tools and local characteristics of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=Evan|title=Distinguishing between Artifacts and Geofacts: A Test Case from Eastern England|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|date=January 1, 1991|volume=18|issue=3|pages=345–361|url=http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/009346991791548645|doi=10.1179/009346991791548645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Caballo de Troya''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[Trojan Horse]]) is a novel (the first of a series of nine so far) written in 1984 by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[journalist]], writer and [[Ufology|ufologist]] [[J. J. Benítez|Juan José Benítez]]. It has reached considerable success in most Spanish-speaking countries as well as in [[Brazil]].  The first volume, ''Trojan Horse: Jerusalem'', has been translated into [[English language|English]] by LS Thomas; the copyright for this translation was submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office on May 31, 2012.  Translations into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] already exist.

The plot of the book unveils the last period in the life of [[Jesus Christ]] as revealed through the first-hand experience of two pilots (or rather "timenauts"), members of a [[US Air Force]] top-secret military experimental project on time travel codenamed "Operation Trojan Horse", who in 1973 supposedly succeeded in travelling back in time to the land of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the year 30 A.d.

Jerusalen: Caballo de Troya 1 (Trojan Horse: Jerusalem 1), the original work by J.J. Benitez, was translated from Spanish to English by Margaret Sayers Peden.

In 2007 Jerusalen: Caballo de Troya 1 (Trojan Horse: Jerusalem 1) work was registered with the US Copyright Office. The English translation was scheduled to be released in 2013.

==Plot summary==

The book is narrated as if it is a true report (The author of the book stated that the journal is  actually real and it is left for the readers interpretation) of how the author was approached by an unnamed retired [[US Air Force]] pilot, referred to as "The Major" throughout the book (Jasón in later books), who in an elaborated indirect way tells the author how to find classified documents telling the story of the Operation Trojan Horse, in which The Major took part as a time traveller sent to witness the last weeks of Jesus's life through a time-travelling device sent back in time by the US military in an Israel base in 1973.

A lengthy, detailed "technical" description of the time travel process ("inversion of [[quantum]] [[swivel]]s") is provided. The time-traveller and the time-travelling vehicle are said to have been wrapped by an artificial skin to avoid biological contamination. The Major, who becomes the narrator of the story, is codenamed "Jasón" during the mission, and has to learn fluent [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] as a necessary skill to interact with people of this era and place during the mission, as well as other extensive training.

It is "revealed" that many of the amazing stories of [[eclipses]], [[earthquakes]] after Jesus's death and his transfiguration were linked to extraterrestrial influences. Jesus's physical appearance is described as almost [[Nordic countries|Nordic]], with hazel eyes and very tall (he is sometimes called "The Giant", physically and metaphorically in the book).

Even as the 1970s UFO mania has lost traction in Spanish-speaking countries, Benítez has retained solid sales and certain celebrity on the basis of his book series.

The following 8 sequels expand on the issued and reveal more detail. ''Caballo de Troya 9, Caná'' was published in Spain in 2011.

He wrote in his website that he first became interested in the "real" life of Jesus around that time, when a team of researchers said that the [[Shroud of Turin]] showed traces of Jesus' body. These claims have later come under scrutiny, but the fact has not stopped the flow of new Caballo de Troya books.

The author has claimed the time-travel part of Caballo de Troya is [[fiction]], but that it contains "more truth than people think" suggesting, given he purports to be "a UFO researcher", that he might be claiming [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] contact. The author insists that most, if not all, events in his novels are real.

==List of volumes in "Caballo de Troya" series ==

* ''Caballo de Troya 2: Masada'' (1986)
* ''Caballo de Troya 3: Saidan'' (1987)
* ''Caballo de Troya 4: Nazaret'' (1989)

* ''[[Caballo de Troya 9: Caná]]'' (2011)
* ''El día del relampago (The day of the lightning)'' (2013)

==Influences==
*There have been accusations of plagiarism for a previous novel of his called ''[[La Rebelión de Lucifer]]'' (''Lucifer's insurrection''). In that novel, the male main character (Sinuhé), who is a member of a secret society, learns and then teaches several revelations to the female protagonist. These revelations bear a lot of resemblance to those portrayed in ''[[The Urantia Book]]''. Later on, these two characters participate in an adventure in which the material from ''The Urantia Book'' becomes merely the location where the action takes place. Therefore, the novel itself is not plagiarized, but instead the material described in the revelations forms a foundation from which the plot of the novel develops.

{{Culture of Kosovo}}
Cinematography in [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} in the [[Albanian language]] began its activities after the foundation of ''[[Kosovafilm]]'', which produced short movies, documentaries, cartoons and later feature movies. Since 2008, the central authority for cinematography in Kosovo is [http://www.qkk-rks.com/?id=1 Kosova’s Cinematography Center (KCC)] though there are numerous independent film companies active in Kosovo. Before Kosovafilm, there were no fully Kosovan movies for Kosovo. 

==History==

===Early beginning===
By 1937 on the territory of modern-day Kosovo (then within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), there were seven operating cinemas. There was one per town, located in [[Pristina]], [[Prizren]], [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], [[Gnjilane]], [[Uroševac]], [[Đakovica]], and [[Peć]]. Cinematography in the former Yugoslavia after World War II was developed in accordance with the criteria of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. Every republic in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had centres of cinematography, so Kosovo not being a republic had access to these centres only through Belgrade to participate in documentary film production, artistic play and education framework for cinematography. With the formation of the cultural centre began Albanian-language cinematography in Kosovo. The first artistic film was realised in 1955, ''Esalon doktora M.'' but the first movie in Albanian was ''Uka i Bjeshkeve te Nemura''. This film is about Uka, who is an old [[Albanians|Albanian]] that lives in the mountains on the border of Yugoslavia ([[Kosovo]]) and [[Albania]]. As an honorable man, he must deal with his son who befriended Italian fascists during [[World War II]]. ''Era dhe lisi'' is the first completely Kosovan production movie.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sq:Historia e kinematografise dhe televizionit ne Kosove|Historia e kinematografisë dhe televizionit në Kosovë]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063792/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 IMDB, Uka i Bjeshkëve të nemura (original title)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehmetaj|first=Gani|title=Magjia e ekranit|year=2005|publisher=Kosovafilm|location=Pristina|isbn=9951-8672-1-9|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJoaAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovafilm industry===

[[File:Picture made by Shukri Kacaniku.jpg|thumb|Filming "When Spring Comes Late"-1979, Kosovo]]

'''The Kosovo film industry''' dates from the 1970s. On 20 February 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

Kosovafilm produced eight feature films in BCS, mostly partisan war films, many of which were in collaboration with Filmske Novosti and Avala Film of Belgrade. Its first Albanian-language production was the film ''Kur pranvera vonohet'' (When Spring Comes Late), premiered on 12 July 1979 and was directed by Ekrem Kryeziu and was based on Fadil Hoxha's partisan diary. Perhaps the best known, and last of the nine Albanian-language feature films of the period, was ''Rojet e mjegulles'' (''The Keepers of the Fog''), premiered on 15 June 1988. It was also directed by lsa Qosja and starred Xhevat Qorraj, [[Enver Petrovci]], Florie Siarina and Cun Lajçi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=kosovafilm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vzJ-ksIhX2&amp;sig=WBJW_XQL3O9YPGBeJ1GCCJATEMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y5EjUc3fNNDptQb9wIGYCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=kosovafilm&amp;f=false Robert Elsie, Historical Dictionary of Kosovo] p60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo made by Shukri Kacaniku.jpg|thumb|The famous Kosovan actor Bekim Fehmiu. Kosovo, 1978.]]

[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was born on 1 June 1936 in [[Sarajevo]]. He was an ethnic Albanian and his family moved to the Kosovo region, where, as a 20-year-old amateur boxer and manual worker. His big break was the 1967 film [[I Even Met Happy Gypsies]], a subtle portrayal of Roma life which won two awards in Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar. In 1974 Fehmiu appeared in the title role The Adventures of Ulysses, with [[Irene Papas]] as Penelope, and in [[John Frankenheimer| John Frankenheimer's]] [[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]] (1977) he played a Palestinian terrorist alongside [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Marthe Keller]].

The New York Times dubbed him the "Yugoslav heart-throb" for his youthful conquests and acquaintances with the likes of [[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. Decades after his last appearance on the screen, readers of a leading Italian women's magazine voted him one of the ten most attractive men of the 20th century. He committed suicide in his Belgrade apartment on 15 June 2010. According to his last wish, [[Bekim Fehmiu]]'s ashes were scattered across the river [[Prizren Bistrica|Bistrica]] near his hometown of [[Prizren]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7877965/Bekim-Fehmiu.html The Telegraph, UK], Bekim Fehmiu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faruk Begolli]] was the most famous Kosovo Albanian actor and director in Yugoslavia (along with Bekim Fehmiu). He attended high school in Pristina and completed the academy of film in Belgrade (1966). Begolli played in more than 60 films, starting with [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s [[Looking Into the Eyes of the Sun|Pogled u zenicu Sunca]] (1966). He cooperated with director [[Puriša Đorđević]] in his films ''Podne'' (Noon), ''Jutro'' (The Morning), and ''San'' (The Dream). In the late 1980s, Begolli returned from Belgrade to Kosovo, where he worked at the University of Pristina as a professor at the Faculty of Drama. His last lead role was in Ekrem Kryeziu's ''Dashuria e Bjeshkeve te Nemuna'' (Love in the Damned Mountain), and his last piece was Etjet e Kosoves (Kosovo: Desperate Search), where he was also a co-scenarist. He died in 2007, after a long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066800/bio IMDb], Faruk Begolli-biography&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arta Dobroshi]] is famous with her role in the screen drama Lorna’s Silence (winner of Best Screenplay at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival). This young actress achieved her international breakthrough and a nomination for the 2008 [[European Film Awards]]. Born in Pristina, she has played many stage roles in her country, as well as a leading role in the prize-winning German-Albanian production Magic Eye (2005), a film about the situation in Albania in 1997, when it was rocked by unrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2009/04_jury_2009/04_Jury_2009.html Berlinale], Arta Dobroshi&lt;/ref&gt; She starred in these movies:[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2369497/ Three Worlds](2012),  [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1572502/ Late Bloomers](2011), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772761/ Baby (II)](2010), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186369/ Lorna's Silence ](2008), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494841/ The Sadness of Mrs. Snajdrova ](2008), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419934/ Magic eye](2005).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1671184/ IMDb ] Arta Dobroshi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Anibar Festival was already officially represented at the annual Dok Leipzig festival in Germany. Animated films that are screened in AniBar are divided into three categories: competitive program, special program and the program 'Kids for Kids Animations'.

'''Cross cultural sensitivity''' is the knowledge, awareness, and acceptance of other [[cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubokawa|first=Amanda|date=2009|title=Positive Psychology and Cultural Sensitivity: A Review of the Literature|url=https://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=gjcp|journal=Graduate Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=1|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the individual level, it allows travelers and workers to successfully navigate a different culture that they are interacting with whereas it is considered one of the primary factors that drive the way organizations behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Cross-Cultural Business Education|last=Maheshkar|first=Chandan|last2=Sharma|first2=Vinod|publisher=IGI Global|year=2018|isbn=9781522537762|location=Hershey, PA|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Support==
Support of cultural sensitivity is based on ideological or practical considerations.

Former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]] advocates cultural sensitivity as an essential value in the modern world:

{{Quote|Tolerance, inter-cultural dialogue and respect for diversity are more essential than ever in a world where people are becoming more and more closely interconnected.Kofi Annan, Former Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]|&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sgsm9195.doc.htm. United Nations. Retrieved on 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cultural sensitivity can increase the security of travellers because it helps them see things from the other person's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing Cross-Cultural Communication: Principles and Practice|last=Maude|first=Barry|publisher=Macmillan Education|year=2016|isbn=9781137507464|location=London|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking awareness of foreign cultures can also have adverse legal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/woman-raped-on-business-trip-in-dubai-jailed-for-having-extramarital-sex/story-fni0cx12-1226683049305&lt;/ref&gt; There are, for example etiquettes in a country that are considered violations of business codes in another.&lt;ref&gt;Maheshkar &amp; Sharma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For workers, this cross-cultural sensitivity can lead to competitiveness and success when working with or within organizations located in a different country. Experts stressed that this is a prime requisite for the satisfied expatriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cross-cultural Topics in Psychology|last=Adler|first=Leonore|last2=Gielen|first2=Uwe Peter|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=0275969738|location=2001|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits are highlighted in the way this concept is defined. It is concerned with the consideration of how two societies and cultures operate, particularly with respect to how they are similar and different from each other. Being able to determine these in terms of thoughts, behavior, beliefs, and expressions among others makes it possible to solve problems meaningfully and act in a manner that is acceptable to all stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Maheshkar &amp; Sharma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cultural sensitivity can have positive effects in academia. In 2002 [[Unity College, Murray Bridge]], began a Student Exchange Program with [[Chuo University Suginami High School]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. This program has been successful because of the both schools' focus on cross cultural awareness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitycollege.sa.edu.au. Unity College. Retrieved 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural sensitivity training in health care providers can improve the satisfaction and health outcomes of patients from different minority groups.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9745">In [[music]], a '''decet'''—sometimes '''dectet''', '''decimette''', or even '''tentet''' {{harv|Gerhart|2005}}—is a composition which requires ten musicians for a performance, or a musical group that consists of ten people. The corresponding German word is '''Dezett''', the French is '''dixtuor'''. Unlike some other [[musical ensemble]]s such as the [[string quartet]], there is no established or standard set of instruments in a decet.

==History==
Of the ensemble types named according to the number of musicians in the group, the decet and the larger undecet, [[Duodecet (music)|duodecet]], etc., are names less common in music than smaller groupings. In the eighteenth century, ten-part ensembles were most often encountered in the genre of the wind serenade, or divertimento (for example, [[Divertimenti for ten winds (Mozart)|Mozart, K. 186 and 166]], both for 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 English horns, 2 horns, and 2 bassoons). Because the wind-serenade tradition was carried on during the 19th century primarily in France, the term ''dixtuor'' is somewhat more widely used in French than is its English equivalent, and French works figure most prominently in this ten-instrument configuration—most commonly the double wind quintet. One of the earliest examples to use the English term is the Decet for oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon, piano, 2 violins, viola, cello, and contrabass (ca. 1841) by John Henry Griesbach (1798–1875) {{harv|Bashford|2001}}. Perhaps the best-known work in this genre from the nineteenth century is [[Joachim Raff]]’s Sinfonietta for ten winds, Op. 188.

{{other uses|Minority (disambiguation)}}
A '''dominant minority''' is a minority group that has overwhelming [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or [[cultural]] dominance in a [[country]], despite representing a small fraction of the overall population (a [[demographics|demographic]] [[minority group|minority]]). Dominant minorities are also known as '''alien elites''' if they are recent immigrants.

The term is most commonly used to refer to an [[ethnic group]] which is defined along [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[nationality|national]], [[religion|religious]], [[culture|cultural]] or [[tribal]] lines and that holds a disproportionate amount of power. A notable example is [[South Africa]] during the [[apartheid]] regime, where [[White South African]]s, or [[Afrikaner]]s more specifically, wielded predominant control of the country, despite never composing more than 22% of the population. [[Americo-Liberians|African American-descended nationals]] in [[Liberia]], [[Sunni Arab]]s in [[Ba'athist Iraq]], the [[Alawite]] minority in Syria (since 1970 under the rule of the Alawite [[Al-Assad family|Assad]] family), and the [[Tutsi]] in [[Rwanda]] since the 1990s have also been cited as current or recent examples.

Their earliest pressure perhaps drove some the native peoples of the mountains to migrate or infiltrate and sometimes come as invaders into Mesopotamia and northern Syria, even in the 3rd millennium. The Indo-Europeans then drove their way through these peoples, drawing many of them in their train as subjects or allies, and appeared themselves early in the 2nd millennium as invaders and conquerors in the Near East. For the first half of the millenium the highlanders under Indo-European leadership dominated the older peoples of the plains, most of whom were Semites. The most powerful of these Indo-Europeans were the Hittites who ruled Anatolia, and later extended their dominion over northern Syria, but their connection with our three cultures is not direct, unles more Hittite influence was felt in Urartu than has so far appeared. Two other peoples are directly relevant, namely the Kassites from the Zagros mountains in the region of Luristan, and the Hurrians, who spread from regions further north, particularly from Armenia. Both were themselves native peoples of the highland, and spoke languages which were not Indo-European, but belonged to a group sometimes loosely called Caucasian, once widespread but later surviving only in the Caucasus. They were led by Indo- European aristocracies small in numbers but great in energy and achievement. They were the first to use the horse in war to draw the light chariot with spoked wheels. Indo-European names of gods at least appear among the Kassites, and of gods and rulers much more obviously among the Hurrians, in whom this element was clearly stronger. In both cases the names reveal the Indic branch of the Indo-European family, of which the main body moved through Iran to conquer northern India.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Dong Son drum''' (also called '''Heger Type I drum''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iHHzP4uVpn4C&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=121|title=The Archaeology of Seafaring in Ancient South Asia|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 14 Aug 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bronze]] [[drum]] fabricated by the [[Dong Son culture]] in the [[Red River Delta]] of northern [[Vietnam]]. The drums were produced from about 600 BCE or earlier until the third century [[Common Era|CE]]; they are one of the culture's finest examples of [[metalworking]].

The drums, cast in bronze using the [[lost-wax casting]] method are up to a meter in height and weigh up to {{convert|100|kg|lb}}. Dong Son drums were apparently both [[musical instrument]]s and cult objects. They are decorated with geometric [[pattern]]s, scenes of daily life and war, animals and birds, and boats. The latter alludes to the importance of trade to the culture in which they were made, and the drums themselves became objects of trade and heirlooms. More than 200 have been found, across an area from eastern [[Indonesia]] to [[Vietnam]] and parts of [[Northern and southern China|Southern China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary Somers |last= Heidhues |title=Southeast Asia: A Concise History |location=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=2000 |pages=19&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dong Son bronze drums.JPG|thumb|Sites of Dong Son type drum findings]]

The earliest drum found in 1976 existed 2700 years ago in Wangjiaba in Yunnan [[Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture]] China. It is classified into the bigger and heavier Yue drums including the Dong Son drums, and the Dian drums, into eight subtypes, purported to be invented by Ma Yuan and [[Zhuge Liang]]. But the [[Book of the Later Han]] said Ma melt the bronze drums seized from the rebel [[Lạc Việt]] in [[Jiaozhi]] into horse.

The discovery of Dong Son drums in [[New Guinea]], is seen as proof of trade connections - spanning at least the past thousand years - between this region and the technologically advanced societies of [[Java]] and China.&lt;ref name="JDiamond"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Diamond  | first = Jared  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Guns, Germs, and Steel - The Fate of Human Societies  | publisher = W.

In 1902, a collection of 165 large bronze drums was published by F. Heger, who subdivided them into a classification of four types.&lt;ref name="h128"&gt;Higham, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==
[[File:Dong Son drums.jpg|thumb|Image on the Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, [[Vietnam]]]]
The drums have a symmetrical appearance with three parts:
* the barrel (upper body)
* the head (top part)
* the leg (bottom part)

The patterns on drums bear a realistic style and show stilted houses, dancing people, people pounding rice, beating drums and sailing, together with animal and birds. The scenes depict daily life of ancient Viet and reflect the artistic talent and mind. The drums were used as musical instruments in festivals, such as prayers for rain, for good harvest and rituals, such as weddings and funerals, as well as command in army. They were also used as funerary objects and symbol of power of tribe leaders.

== Classification ==
The Heger 1 drums of the Dong Son culture were classified and divided into five groups by the [[Vietnam]]ese scholar Pham Huy Thong in 1990, a division that implied a chronological succession. The earliest, group A, comprisees a set of large and intricated decorated drums. Group B consists of a smaller drums which almost universally have a group of waterbirds in flight as their key motif on the tympanum and the mantle designs. Group C has a central panel on the tympanum made up of a row of plumed warriors placed inside another panel of waterbirds in flight. Toads line the tympanum's edge while the mantle was decorated with either patterns involving boats or geometric patterns.&lt;ref name="h128"/&gt;

=== Ngoc Lu ===
{{Main|Ngọc Lũ drum}}
[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum surface.gif|thumb|Ngọc Lũ bronze drum's surface, [[Vietnam]]]]

The Ngọc Lũ drum is regarded as the most important of the Dong Son drums. The drum was accidentally discovered in 1893 in [[Hà Nam Province]], southeast of [[Hanoi]], rather than during a planned expedition. In contrast to most other drums of the Dong Son, the [[drumhead]] bears three concentric panels depicting animals or humans interleaved with bands of geometric or circular patterns. The innermost panel appears to be a self-referencing depiction, as it is decorated with pictures of humans who appear to be performing a ceremony involving the drums themselves. Other musical instruments and rice growing and harvesting activities are also shown. The two outer panels are decorated with scenes of [[deer]], [[hornbill]]s and crane [[egret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoàng Ha ===
[[File:Hoang Ha bronze drum surface.JPG|thumb|Hoàng Ha bronze drum's surface, Vietnam]]

The '''Hoàng Ha drum''' is a notable Dong Son drum.&lt;ref name="h126"&gt;Higham, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in [[Hòa Bình Province]] in 1937 near the village of Hoàng Ha, with an outer panel of crane egrets and an inner panel which shows a procession similar to that described in the Ngọc Lũ drum, the most famous of the Dong Son drums.&lt;ref name="h126"/&gt; It depicts four feathered men are depicted walking in a line, brandishing spears, with two musicians in tow. A person is depicted standing under the eaves of a house, beating a drum while the rice fields are unattended, allowing a bird to eat the rice that was intended for threshing. The boats depicted on the mantle of the drum are very similar, with an analogous cleft prow, archer standing on raised platform and a drum. However, the drum is different from the Ngoc Lu drum in that the animal is absent.&lt;ref name="h126"/&gt;

=== Co Loa ===
[[File:Co Loa bronze drum.jpg|thumb|Cổ Loa drum's surface, Vietnam]]

The '''[[Cổ Loa Citadel|Cổ Loa]] drum''' is a notable specimen&lt;ref name="h126"/&gt; showing a procession similar to that described in the Ngọc Lũ drum. The drum only has two warriors with spears, in contrast to that of the Ngọc Lũ drum. Another difference is that the ensemble of percussionists consists of three drummers, with one drum lying under the eaves of the house. Meanwhile, an extra person is depicted in the rice threshing process. The person has long hair and is winnowing grain into a bowl. The percussion ensemble is also depicted differently in that the drummers are not all drumming in synchronisation. Two of the drummers are depicted making contact with the drum, while the other two drummers have their batons in the raised position.&lt;ref name="h126"/&gt;

=== Song Da ===
The '''Song Da drum''' is a notable specimen discovered in Ha Son Binh in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="h127"&gt;Higham, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The drum shows a procession similar to that described in the Ngọc Lũ drum. This drum varies in that it depicts four sets of men in procession with feathered headgear, rather than two. Also, each set comprises three or four people none of whom appear to be armed. The posture of the men was interpreted as that they were participating in a dance rather than a military ceremony. In this drum, only one pair of people are depicted as threshing rice, and there is no cymbal player. However, the general motifs, such as the boats on the mantle, remain in place.&lt;ref name="h127"/&gt;

=== Others ===
[[File:TrongDongNho.JPG|thumb|left|Small sized bronze drums]]
The '''Quang Xuong drum''' from [[Thanh Hóa Province]] is another specimen, which is believed to be possibly later in origin. However, the drum is smaller and the images are harder to interpret.&lt;ref name="h128"&gt;Higham, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large drums found in northern Vietnam were generally in the minority, as most drums have simple decorations with fewer representations of people. The '''Ban Thom drum''' has only an inner panel with four houses and plumed humans standing alone or in couples.&lt;ref name="h128"/&gt;

== Modern customs ==
[[Zhuang people]] in [[Yunnan]] practice ''ningdong'' wine, ''ningdong'' music, etc. The ''ningdong''s used by them have same decoration with Dong Son drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KHNetjx6D8 | title=Ningdong | series=Ndei Lai Biengz Raeuz | network=[[CNTV]] | season=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eighteen Oddities in Yunnan''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[wikt:云南十八怪|云南十八怪]]; pinyin: Yúnnán Shíbā Guài; sometimes called '''Eighteen Wonders of Yunnan''') are eighteen unique traits of the [[Yunnan]] province of [[southwest China]]. The oddities, which are as follows, are generally presented in the form of a list, which is promulgated in promotional materials advertising the province to foreign and domestic tourists.

#[[Egg (food)|Eggs]] are tied up sold in rope-like clusters&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/evenpay/263019342/in/album-72157594316662176/ photo]&lt;/sup&gt;

#Children are raised by men - Yunnan women have a reputation for being hard-working, thus many men stay home to take care of their children 
#Automobiles move in the clouds - many roads are high in the mountains

The items on the list are not fixed, so other versions of the list may include other oddities, including:

#Stone grows in the clouds - Yunnan's [[Shilin (Stone Forest)|Shilin]], or Stone Forest resembles stalagmites growing out of the ground
#Locusts or grasshoppers are eaten as a delicacy
#Fresh flowers are served as a vegetable

The study of '''geometric morphometrics in anthropology''' has made a major impact on the field of [[morphometrics]] by aiding in some of the technological and methodological advancements. Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelditch2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form...&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Gerhard|title=Virtual Anthropology|journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology|date=2015|issue=156|pages=22–42|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22658|pmid=25418603|volume=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Slice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slice|first1=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2007|issue=1|pages=261–81|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120613|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitteroecker|first1=Philipp|last2=Gunz|first2=Philipp|title=Advances in Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|issue=2|pages=235–247|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed “two-point coordinates” or “Bookstein-shape coordinates”.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

In the 1940s, [[D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948)  looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohlf|first1=F. James|last2=Bookstein|first2=Fred L.|title=Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop|date=1990|publisher=Special Publication 2, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and [[David George Kendall]] (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|title=Anthropology Takes Control of Morphometrics|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|date=2004|volume=2|issue=28|pages=121–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous [[Ötzi|Ötzi skeleton]], which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods.&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004 /&gt;

==Traditional morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|left|BirdMorpho]] 
Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=Sheets|first2=David H.|title=A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=2010|volume=16|issue=Quantitative Methods in Paleobiology|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Dean C.|last2=Rohlf|first2=F. James|last3=Slice|first3=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics: Ten Years of Progress Following the 'Revolution'|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2004|volume=71|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/11250000409356545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: [[principal components]], [[factor analysis]], [[canonical analysis|canonical variate]], and [[discriminant function analysis]]. It is also possible to study [[allometry]], which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape.

==Steps in a geometric morphometric study==
There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study:
# '''Design Study''': what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this? 
# '''[[#Data Collection Methods|Collect Data]]''': choose your landmark set and method of collection
# '''[[#Superimposition|Standardize Data]]''': make your landmarks comparable across all specimens (superimposition) 
# '''[[#Statistical Analysis|Analyze Data]]''': choose a statistical approach depending on your original question and how you designed the study 
# '''[[#Some Applications in Physical Anthropology|Interpret Results]]''': take the outcome of your statistical analysis and reflect it back to the context of your original specimens

==Data collection methods==

===Landmarks===
The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===Semilandmarks===
[[File:3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl.png|thumb|upright=0.5|3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl]]
Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis.

===Deformation grid===
This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Bookstein proposed the use of a [[thin-plate spline]] (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Superimposition==

===[[Generalized Procrustes analysis]] (GPA)===
Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

==Statistical analysis==

===[[Principal components analysis]] (PCA)===
In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample’s covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

===[[Partial least squares regression|Partial least squares]] (PLS)===
Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate regression]]===
Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for [[allometric]] studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Some applications in anthropology==

===Human evolution===

====The human brain====
The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the [[visual cortex]], [[temporal lobe]], and [[parietal cortex]], and increased [[gyrification]] (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual [[endocasts]] (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and [[Neanderthals]] whose brains were similar in size.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Harvati|first2=Katerina|title=Geometric Morphometrics and Virtual Anthropology: Advances in human evolutionary studies|journal=Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology|date=2014|volume=71|pages=41–55|doi=10.1127/0003-5548/2014/0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of [[chimpanzees]] and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early “[[globularization]] phase” in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neubauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubauer|first1=S.|last2=Gunz|first2=P.|last3=Hublin|first3=J.|title=Endocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: A morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=555–566|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.011|pmid=20727571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the “globularization phase” does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Golovanova|first3=L.|last4=Doronichev|first4=V.|last5=Maureille|first5=B.|last6=Hublin|first6=J.|title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development: Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neanderthal newborn from Mezmaiskaya|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|issue=2|pages=300–313|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013|pmid=22221766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Maureille|first3=B.|last4=Hublin|first4=J.|title=Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=21|pages=921–922|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.018|pmid=21056830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pleistocene cranial morphology====
There have been many debates on the relationships between [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] hominin crania from [[Eurasia]] and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate. They found that some features were more Neanderthal like while others were primitive and likely from the Middle Pleistocene African hominins, so the argument could still go either way.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvati2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvati|first1=K.|last2=Hublin|first2=J.|last3=Gunz|first3=P.|title=Evolution of middle-late Pleistocene human cranio-facial form: a 3D approach|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=445–464|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.005|pmid=20708775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freidline and colleagues further added to the debate by looking at both adult and subadult crania of modern and Pleistocene hominins using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidline&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freidline|first1=SE|last2=Gunz|first2=G.|last3=Harvati|first3=K.|last4=Hublin|first4=J|title=Middle Pleistocene human facial morphology in an evolutionary and developmental context|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=63|issue=5|pages=723–740|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.08.002|pmid=22981042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern human variation===

====Ancestry and sex estimation of crania====
Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in [[forensic]] contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called [http://www.3d-id.org/ 3D-ID], can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used.&lt;ref name=RossSlice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ann H.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Williams|first3=Shanna E.|title=Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls|date=2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls]

====Sex estimation of os coxae====
Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as ''[[os coxae]]''. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the [[obturator foramen]]. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a [[Fourier Analysis|Discriminant Fourier Analysis]].&lt;ref name=Bierryetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierry|first1=Guillaume|last2=Le Minor|first2=Jean-Marie|last3=Schmittbuhl|first3=Mathieu|title=Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropológico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a [[K-means clustering|K-means Cluster Analysis]] to determine a sex category before performing a [[Discriminant function analysis|Discriminant Function analysis]]. The results had a classification accuracy for the [[greater sciatic notch]] of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1%&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Paula N.|last2=Bernal|first2=Valeria|last3=Perez|first3=Ivan S.|title=Geometric Morphometric Approach to Sex Estimation of Human Pelvis|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.012|volume=189|issue=1–3|pages=68–74|pmid=19442464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Incoherents''' (''Les Arts incohérents'') was a short-lived French art movement founded by Parisian writer and publisher [[:fr:Jules Lévy|Jules Lévy]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; (1857-1935) in 1882, which in its satirical irreverence anticipated many of the art techniques and attitudes later associated with [[avant-garde]] and [[anti-art]].  

Lévy coined the phrase ''les arts incohérents'' as a play on the common expression ''les arts décoratifs'' (i.e. arts &amp; crafts, but above all, a famous art school in Paris, the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|National School of Decorative Arts]]). The Incoherents presented work which was deliberately irrational and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]], contained [[found objects]], was [[nonsense|nonsensical]], included humoristic sketchs, drawings of children, and drawings "made by people who don't know how to draw."  Lévy exhibited an all-black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] called ''Combat de Nègres dans un Tunnel'' (Negroes Fight in a Tunnel).  The early film animator [[Émile Cohl]] contributed photographs which would later be called [[surrealism|surreal]].  

[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Joconde smoking pipe'' by Sapeck, in ''[[Le Rire]]'', 1887.]] 

Although small and short-lived, the Incoherents were certainly well-known.  The movement sprang from the same [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture that spawned the [[Hydropathes]]  of [[Émile Goudeau]] and [[Alfred Jarry]]'s ''[[Ubu Roi]]''.  The October 1882 show was attended by two thousand people, including [[Manet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Richard Wagner]].  Beginning in 1883 there were annual shows, or masked balls, or both.  In an 1883 show, the artist [[:fr:Eugène Bataille (Sapeck)|Sapeck (Eugène Bataille)]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; contributed ''Le rire,'' an "augmented" ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' smoking a pipe, that directly prefigures the famous [[Marcel Duchamp]] 1919 "appropriation" of the ''Mona Lisa'', ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]''.    

The movement wound down in the mid-1890s.

==History==
The Incoherent arts were born in the late nineteenth century, a period that was rich in scientific discoveries and social innovations. Cheeky and inventive, this time also marks a turning point in the field of art. The official art traditions were even being questioned in the newspapers through satirical images which implied it was a dying craft. It was in this creative lull that Jules Levy - former member of the literary club [[Hydropathes]] - decided to organize "an exhibition of drawings made by people who can not draw." This charitable carnival helped victims of a recent gas explosion to have an opportunity to present their works. The first "Incoherent arts" get-together, which took place on July 13, 1882 on the Champs Elysées hosts many curiosities. Taking advantage of a power outage, and lit only by candlelight, they created a jumble of rebellious works, using all types of materials and any inspiration with the ultimate goal of making people laugh. 

On October 2, 1882, Jules Lévy decided to repeat the experience at home. He gathered his friends under the pretense of having an "unusual evening". In his tiny apartment they worked under the phrase "Death to clichés, to us young people!" They received unexpected success and lots of newspaper coverage. As a result, the Incohérents arts movement became engrained into the Parisian cultural landscape. In October 1883 the Paris had its first official exhibition of Incoherent art, ran by local Galerie Vivienne. The purpose was charitable as with all Incoherent exhibits thereafter. A regulation 13-point proclamation was that "All the works are allowed, the serious works and obscene excepted". The exhibition adopts a true catalog, including a piece by Levy Orville in which he reverses an inkwell for the sake of aesthetics. The tone of the exhibition was set by an abundance of parodies and pictorial puns. More than 20,000 visitors took part over a month. 

A year later, the Incoherents returned to haunt the Galerie Vivienne with their cheeky pranks. They hoped this occasion would see the image of the "Chief pipes Poyle sand without number, on a silver field," an ancient statue carving chisel of an academician who does not lead wide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A catalog accompanied the exhibition with luxury engraved reproductions of most of the significant works. On its cover, a dancer brandishes a broom and scares away the gloom of black birds. The journalists accompanied the event with enthusiasm. The artists were increasingly familiarizing themselves with the pictorial map and the pun, both of which helped to establish this kind of "Incoherent" art. In 1886 the Incoherents at the Eden Theatre unveiled their new exhibit. Jules Chéret's poster included Levy going through the moon like a paper hoop. At the entrance, the rules regarding the event were framed prominently: "One goal you propose, laugh and cheer you frankly." The room was also full of visitors that worked in high, medium or low relief. Everything was recorded in catalog records which are decorated with "striking" portraits of exhibitors and zany references. 

In 1886 Jules Levy began to be the target of criticism. He was accused of using the Incoherent Arts for its own interests. He had in fact opened a publishing house in 1886 and published the works of his friends (Goudeau, Leroy, Monselet, etc..), illustrated by artists such as Boutet, Somm or Gray. He gradually lost the support of the French Courrier who had declared him as "the official unofficial Incoherent" in 1884. Meanwhile, some seeking to take advantage of the Incoherent movement by opening Incoherent cafes or established magazine operations, that the founders of the movement had nothing to do with. In 1887 Jules Levy promised the end of Inconsistency would be on April 16 of that year. A costume party was organized for the occasion with a [[Folies Bergère]] funeral procession. However, Incoherence has a brief renaissance on March 27, 1889 at a new dance held at the Eden Theatre. Levy wanted this event to remind the good memories of the Incoherent arts and to announce the return of his exhibitions. But in the spring of the 1889 exhibition he organized, while the Expo was in full swing in Paris, it was a fiasco. The press hardly covered the event, and even the [[French Courier]] remained silent. The Incoherent arts was no longer a novelty interest. Jules Levy, refusing to give up, created the magazine ''Folies Bergère'' in January 1891. Poorly organized, not repeated, the show is considered too long and the ball too short.
The last gasp of the inconsistency, his exhibition of 1893 had a brand new premise at Olympia, and passed almost unnoticed. Jules Blois of the French Mail wrote: "All that is outdated, outmoded. Inconsistency joined decadence, decay and other jokes with or without handles in the bag of old fashioned chiffes" Despite that, Levy still pulled on the Incoherent string until 1896 when it was met with massive indifference from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsincoherents.info%2F | title=History of the Incoherent arts | publisher=Les Arts incohérents | accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Russia}}
Of all the '''languages of [[Russia]]''', [[Russian language|Russian]] is the only official language at the national level. There are 35 different languages which are considered [[official languages]] in various regions of Russia, along with Russian. There are over 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html|title=Russia - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531133402/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html|archivedate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Russian was the sole official language of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed until 1917. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. The state helped develop [[alphabet]]s and [[grammar]] for various languages across the country that had previously been lacking a written form. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role, and superior status was reserved for Russian.

Russia lost its status in many of the new republics that arose following the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In Russia, however, the dominating status of the Russian language continued. Today, 97% of the public school students of Russia receive their education only or mostly in Russian, even though Russia is made up of approximately 80% ethnic [[Russians]].

==Official languages==
Although [[Russian language|Russian]] is the only federally [[official language]] of the [[Russian Federation]], there are several other officially recognized languages within Russia's various constituencies – article 68 of the [[Constitution of Russia]] only allows the various [[republics of Russia]] to establish official (state) languages other than Russian. This is a list of the languages that are recognized as official (state) in constitutions of the republics of Russia:

The Constitution of [[Dagestan]] defines "Russian and the languages of the peoples of Dagestan" as the state languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.garant.ru/region/cons_dagest/chapter/1/#block_11 Статья 11. Конституция Республики Дагестан]&lt;/ref&gt; though no comprehensive list of the languages was given.{{cn|date=October 2015}}{{dubious|date=October 2015}} In the project of the "Law on the languages of the Republic of Dagestan" 32 languages are listed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/printable/2014/02/03/reg-skfo/yaziki-anons.html В Дагестане сделают государственными 32 языка]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of Karelia|Karelia]] is the only [[republics of Russia|republic of Russia]] with Russian as the only official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.garant.ru/region/cons_karel/chapter/1/#block_11010 Статья 11. Конституция Республики Карелия]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists the special law about state support and protection of the [[Karelian language|Karelian]], [[Vepsian language|Vepsian ]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karelia-zs.ru/zakonodatelstvo_rk/prav_akty/759-zrk/ Закон Республики Карелия «О государственной поддержке карельского, вепсского и финского языков в Республике Карелия»]&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal law "On the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation" &lt;ref&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/10148970/ Закон РФ от 25 октября 1991 г. N 1807-I "О языках народов Российской Федерации" (с изменениями и дополнениями)]&lt;/ref&gt; allows the federal subjects to establish additionally official languages in the areas where minority groups live. This is the case, for example, of the [[Kazakh language]] in Altai Republic.&lt;ref name=LawAltai /&gt;

==Migrant languages==
As a result of mass migration to Russia from the former USSR republics (especially from the Caucasus and Central Asia) many non-indigenous languages are spoken by [[migrant worker]]s, among them most prominent are (from 2010 Census, in thousands):

{|
|-
|[[Armenian language|Armenian]]||830
|-
|[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]||515
|-
|[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]||472
|-
|[[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]||245
|-
|[[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]||247
|-
|[[Tajik language|Tajik]]||177
|-
|[[Georgian language|Georgian]]||102
|-
|[[Romanian language|Moldovan]]||90
|}

However, many migrant workers were not counted in the Census and many work illegally, so these numbers may be much greater. Compare 2.4 million Uzbek citizens and 1.2 million Tajik citizens entered Russia in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=XLS|url=http://www.russiatourism.ru/data/File/Statistika/2015/%D0%92%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%20%D0%B2%20%D0%A0%D0%A4%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%2050%202014.xls|script-title=ru:Страны, лидирующие по количеству прибытий на территорию Российской Федерации - Топ 50 по въезду в РФ за 2014 год (всего)|trans-title=Countries leading by the number of arrivals to the territory of the Russian Federation - Top 50 by entry into the RF for 2014 (total)|language=ru|publisher=RussiaTourism.ru|accessdate=11 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325030028/http://www.russiatourism.ru/data/File/Statistika/2015/%D0%92%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%20%D0%B2%20%D0%A0%D0%A4%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%2050%202014.xls|archivedate=25 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}

Some groups such as Kazakhs of [[Altay Republic]], Armenians from [[Myasnikovsky District]], Azerbaijanis from [[Derbentsky District|Derbent]] are not recent immigrants and have lived in their area for a long period of time.

==Endangered languages in Russia==
There are many [[endangered language]]s in Russia. Some are considered to be near extinction and put on the [[list of endangered languages in Russia]], and some may have gone extinct since data was last reported. On the other hand, some languages may survive even with few speakers.

Some languages have doubtful data, like [[Serbian language|Serbian]] whose information in the [[Ethnologue]] is based on the 1959 census.

===Languages near extinction===
Most numbers are according to [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]], 1995. Given the time that has passed, languages with extremely few speakers  might be extinct today. Since 1997, [[Kerek language|Kerek]] and [[Yugh language|Yugh]] have become extinct. 
* [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] (''extinct in Russia since 1994, still spoken in Japan'')
* [[Enets language|Enets]] (70)
* [[Tofalar language|Tofalar]] (25–30)
* [[Medny Aleut language|Medny Aleut]] (10) (an [[Aleut language|Aleut]]–Russian [[creole language]])
* [[Orok language|Orok]] (30–82)
* [[Akkala Sami|Sami, Akkala]] (''extinct since 2003'')
* [[Ter Sami|Sami, Ter]] (2)
* [[Udege language|Udege]] (100)
* [[Votic language|Votic]] (25)
* [[Northern Yukaghir language|Yukaghir, Northern]] (30–150)
* [[Southern Yukaghir language|Yukaghir, Southern]] (10–50)

===Other endangered languages===
*[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]
*[[Chulym language|Chulym]]
*[[Erzya language|Erzya]]
*[[Ingrian language|Ingrian]]

== Foreign languages ==
According to the various studies made in 2005-2008 by [[Levada-Center]]&lt;ref name=Levada2008 /&gt; 15% of Russians know a foreign language. From those who claim knowledge of at least one language:
{| class="wikitable"
!colspan=2|"Can speak freely":
|-
| English || 80%
|-
| German || 16%
|-
| French || 4%
|-
| Turkish || 2%
|-
| Others || 9%
|-
|colspan=2|''From 1775 respondents aged 15-29, November 2006'' 
|}

{| class="wikitable"
!colspan=2|"Know enough to read newspapers":
|-
| English || 44%
|-
| German || 15%
|-
| Ukrainian, Belarusian and other Slavic languages || 19%
|-
| Other European languages || 10%
|-
| All others || 29%
|-
|colspan=2|''From 2100 respondents of every age, January 2005''
|}

Knowledge of at least one foreign language is predominant among younger and middle-aged population. Among aged 18–24 38% can read and "translate with a dictionary", 11% can freely read and speak. Among aged 25–39 these numbers are 26% and 4% respectively.

Knowledge of a foreign language varies among social groups. It is most appreciable (15-18%) in big cities with 100,000 and more inhabitants, while in Moscow it rises up to 35%. People with higher education and high economical and social status are most expected to know a foreign language.

The new study by Levada-Center in April 2014&lt;ref name=Levada2014 /&gt; reveals such numbers:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan=2| Can speak freely at least one language:
|-
| English || 11
|-
| German || 2
|-
| Spanish || 2
|-
| Ukrainian || 1
|-
| French || &lt;1
|-
| Chinese || &lt;1
|-
| Others || 2
|-
! Can speak a foreign language but with difficulty !! 13 
|-
! Do not speak a foreign Language at all !! 70 
|-
|colspan=2|''From 1602 respondents from 18 and older, April 2014''
|}

The age and social profiling are the same: knowledge of a foreign language is predominant among the young or middle-aged population with higher education and high social status and who live in big cities.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, French was a common language among upper class Russians. The impetus came from [[Peter the Great]]'s orientation of Russia towards Europe and accelerated after the [[French Revolution]]. After the Russians fought France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia became less inclined towards French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yegorov, Oleg|url=https://www.rbth.com/politics_and_society/2017/05/25/why-was-french-spoken-in-russia_770185|title=Why was French spoken in Russia?|publisher=''[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]''|date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages of education ==
Every year the Russian Ministry of Education and Science publishes statistics on the languages used in schools. In 2014/2015 absolute majority&lt;ref&gt;[http://минобрнауки.рф/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-2014/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-2014 Статистическая информация 2014. Общее образование]&lt;/ref&gt; (13.1 million or 96%) of 13.7 million Russian students used Russian as a medium of education. Around 1.6 million or 12% students studied their (non-Russian) native language as a subject. The most studied languages are Tatar, Chechen and Chuvash with 347, 253, 107 thousand students respectively.

The most studied foreign languages in 2013/2014 were (students in thousands): 
{| class="wikitable"
|English||11,194.2

'''"Lemon"''' ({{lang-ja|[[:ja:檸檬 (小説)|檸檬]]}}, "Remon") is a collection of [[short story|short stories]] by [[Japan]]ese author [[Motojirō Kajii]]. "Lemon" was written in 1924 and was published as Kajii's first [[doujinshi]]. It was a 28-page handmade book: 4.25" x 5.5", staple-bound. The interior was color printed, with several high quality black-and-white photographs. The cover had a spine and a full color photograph on the front.

"Lemon" is one of Kajii's few works to have been translated into English. Although he was a relatively unknown writer during his short lifetime who published in a few literary magazines, Kajii's poetic short stories are recognized today as masterpieces in Japan. The eponymous story "Lemon" is known as his representative work.

== Plot ==

The protagonist, who has diseased lungs, is tormented by strange anxiety all the time. He lost his interest in the stationery store Maruzen, music, and poetry that he had been interested in before. He only continues walking around aimlessly in [[Kyoto]].

In one such incident, he visits a fruit shop he likes on a regular basis through Teramati (Kyoto Miyako Naka-ku "八百卯; Eight Hundred Rabbit," closed January 25, 2009). There were rare lemons placed side by side. He bought one lemon that he was interested in; the coldness of the fruit in his hand was just right. After that, he felt uncomfortable, even though he stopped by his favorite shop, Maruzen, he began feeling uneasy.

He felt an unchanged feeling of dissatisfaction. Even though he looked at the usual picture albums that he used to like, he put the lemon as a time bomb on the pile of illustrations. Then he imagines the works of fine art flying out of the Maruzen shop, the excitement of blasting a lemon as a time bomb.

He was satisfied with what he had done at the end.

== Interpretation ==
This short story describes the feeling of an ailing patient and the mischievous emotions which every person has. Kajii wrote many other works which had a main character with lung disease because the author was affected by tuberculosis himself. His life was a fight against poverty and sickness (he died from tuberculosis at the age of 31).

Maruzen was still near Sanjodori, Huyachotori in Kyoto at that time. After "Lemon" was published, it is said there was no end to people who continued leaving a lemon at Maruzen store in Kyoto (closed in October 2005).

'''''Lilith, The Legend of the First Woman''''' is a 19th-century narrative poem in five books, written by the American poet, [[Ada Langworthy Collier]], in 1885, and published in [[Boston]] by [[Daniel Lothrop|D Lothrop &amp; Company]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1885|p=411}} It has been reprinted several times in the 21st century.

''Lilith, The Legend of the First Woman'' is a 19th-century rendition of the old [[Rabbinical]] legend of [[Lilith]], the first woman, whose life story was dropped unrecorded from the early world, and whose home, hope, and [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] were passed to another woman. The author warns us in her preface that she has not followed the legend closely. In her hands, Lilith becomes an embodiment of mother-love that has existed forever, and it is her name that lends its itself to the lullabys repeated to young children.{{sfn|Charles H. Kerr Company|1884|p=9}}

==Literary basis==
Collier not only freely changes the legend of Lilith, but is free with the unities of her own story. It is full of internal inconsistencies in narrative, and anachronisms. The legend (doubtless made to reconcile the two accounts in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of woman, the first of which represents her made with man, and by implication, coequal; and the other as created second and subordinate), is to the effect that God first created Adam and Lilith, equal in authority; that the clashing this led to was so great, that Lilith was cast out from Eden, and the marital experiment tried again, on a different principle, by the creation of Eve. Lilith thereafter wedded Eblis, the prince of devils, and became the mother of demons and specters; and in vengeance upon her rival, Eve, the mother of mankind, became the special enemy of babies, whom she strangles with a thread of her golden hair. The obvious injustice to Lilith— who seems to have asked no more than her fair half, while Adam was the encroacher, on the assumption that they were created equal —inspired Collier's version of the legend, according to which Lilith leaves Eden voluntarily, rather than submit to dominance, but loses thereby the blessing of motherhood. This alone, not either Adam or Eden, she envies Eve, and at last steals the coveted first human baby, which dies, bereft of its mother, and so gives Lilith the reputation in legend of being a child-murderess.{{sfn|Carson|1885|p=438}}

When Collier discovered that the word "[[lullaby]]" (Lilla, abi—begone, Lilith!) denoted the songs which mothers soothed their babies, she adapted Lilith's acquired modern meaning, wholly removed from its original signification, into this poem. It enabled Collier to evolve the idea that Lilith, instead of being a fiend, was really a creature of strong maternal instincts and it is in this character that Lilith was presented.{{sfn|Wakeman|1885|p=411}}

==Plot== 
Created Adam's equal alike in stature, strength and power, Lilith's spirit is chafed by Adam's insistence on his own supremacy and her subjection, and rather than yield she chooses to find her own paradise without the walls.{{sfn|Charles H. Kerr Company|1884|p=9}} 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- {{sic}} --&gt;
:"In goodly Eden, Adam, safely bide,
:But I. for peace, nor love, nor life," she cried, 
:"Submit to thee." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Collier's narrative, Lilith, having left the Garden of Eden, never to return, goes out into the world.{{sfn|Charles H. Kerr Company|1884|p=9}} For a time, she enjoys the pleasure in [[Nature]]'s companionship.{{sfn|Wakeman|1885|p=411}} Far from Eden, she finds a beautiful land where she can rule supreme, though lonely. It is here that she is wooed by [[Eblis]], the fallen angel and prince of the powers of the air, who forgets to mourn the heaven he lost in the heaven of Lilith's love.{{sfn|Charles H. Kerr Company|1884|p=9}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unheeded, swiftly passed them o'er— 
:Glad summer days -till one hour softly laid 
:At Lilith's feet a fair lone babe that strayed 
:From distant Dreamland far. So might one deem 
:That looked upon its fuce: or; it might seem 
:From other climes a rose leaf blown apart. 
:Down drifted there to gladden Lilith's heart.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eblis woos Lilith and she becomes his wife. Lilith's children are little [[imp]]s without affection for her or her maternal yearnings; in fact, they torture her. When Lilith starts thinking about Eden, Eblis takes her there and, upon looking over its wall, she is annoyed to see Adam with another wife, Eve, who is breastfeeding. Lilith's discovery that she has been supplanted and that Eve's child loves its mother, arouses jealousy and later, Lilith steals the baby, devoting all her affectionate and attention to it, but the child subsequently grows ill. After Adam and Eve are driven from the Garden, Lilith relents and takes the child back to its mother, in whose arms it afterwards dies, and Lilith returns to her own land.{{sfn|Wakeman|1885|p=411}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- {{sic}} --&gt;
:::::There looking on the sea.
:Low-voiced, she sang. So sweet the idle song, 
:She said: "From Paradise, forgotten long, 
:It comes. An elfin echo that doth rise 
:Upward from summer seas to bending skies. 
:In coming days, from any earthly shore 
:It shall not fail. And sweet forever more 
:Shall make my memory. That witching strain 
:Pale Lilith's love shall lightly breathe again. 
:And Lilith's bitter loss and olden pain 
:O'er every cradle wake that sweet refrain. 
:My memory still shall bloom. It cannot die 
:While rings Earth's, cradle-song-—sweet lullaby." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Wakeman stated that Lilith is described as a graceful creation, but the effect of her appearance might have been enhanced if Eblis had been pictured darker in character. Eve is described as love and tenderness, while Adam's characteristics are not strongly marked.The poem has many beautiful, descriptive passages. It is generally smooth in its metrical expression, employing [[Iambic pentameter|iambic]]s.{{sfn|Wakeman|1885|p=411}} Kerr critiqued that while the story's verse was unequaled, the poem lacks sustained power. A certain looseness in the construction of sentences implies that the work didn't undergo much revision.{{sfn|Charles H. Kerr Company|1884|p=9}} In a third review it is said that while Collier's descriptive powers were analytical and microscopic, there is a sameness which results in too often exhibiting one picture in different lights.{{sfn|Critic Printing and Publishing Company|1886|p=62-63}}

'''''[[Doctor Who]]''''' is a British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme produced by the [[BBC]]. The show has been a large influence in the media since its inception. 1966 saw the first radio broadcast of the show.

There have been many ''Doctor Who'' radio broadcasts over the years. In addition to a small number of in-house BBC productions, a larger number of radio plays produced by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] began to be broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]] from 2005, featuring the Eighth Doctor (again played by Paul McGann) with mainstay companions [[Charley Pollard]] and later [[Lucie Miller]]. Initially, these were broadcasts of Big Finish productions that had already been released on CD. However, the series that began with ''[[Blood of the Daleks]]'' and concluded with ''[[Human Resources (Doctor Who audio)|Human Resources]]'' was specially commissioned by the BBC from Big Finish for broadcast prior to the CD release. Many more of these were released on CD than were broadcast on the radio; only those plays broadcast by the BBC are listed here. See the [[list of Doctor Who audio releases]] as a starting point for other audio plays and audio books, notably the [[list of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|List of ''Doctor Who'' audio plays by Big Finish]] which includes more plays than were broadcast.

{{distinguish|Action director}}
'''Action film directors''' guide the filming and creative elements in [[action movie]]s, a [[film genre]] where action sequences, such as [[Choreographed fight in cinema|fights]], [[shootout]]s, [[stunt]]s, [[car chase]]s or explosions either take precedence, or, in finer examples of the genre, are used as a form of exposition and character development. Action movie directors may also blend other genres into their films, such as romance, [[science fiction]], or even comedy (e.g. ''[[Rush Hour (film series)|Rush Hour]]''). This [[genre]] is closely linked with those of [[thriller film|thriller]] and [[adventure film]]s.

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;

{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Moralia''''' ({{lang-grc|Ἠθικά}} ''Ethika''; loosely translated as "Morals" or "Matters relating to customs and mores") of the 1st-century Greek scholar [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]] is an eclectic collection of 78&amp;nbsp;essays and transcribed speeches. They provide insights into [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] life, but often are also timeless observations in their own right. Many generations of Europeans have read or imitated them, including [[Michel de Montaigne]] and the [[Renaissance]] [[Humanists]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers.

Lang|year=1989|isbn=978-0-8204-1082-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' (which may, like the orations on Alexander's accomplishments, have been a rhetorical exercise),&lt;ref name=Stewart-Long&gt;{{cite book|title=Plutarch's Lives, Volume I (of 4)|author=Aubrey Stewart, George Long|chapter=Life of Plutarch |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033.txt|publisher=The Gutenberg Project|accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Plutarch criticizes what he sees as systematic bias in the ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]];."&lt;ref name=NewCriterion&gt;{{cite web | last=Kimball | first=Roger | title=Plutarch and the Issue of Character |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/19/dec00/plutarch.htm|publisher=The New Criterion Online|accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with more philosophical treatises, such as ''On the Decline of the Oracles'', ''On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance'', ''On Peace of Mind'' and lighter fare, such as ''Odysseus and Gryllus'', a humorous dialog between [[Homer]]'s [[Odysseus]] and one of [[Circe]]'s enchanted pigs. The ''Moralia'' were composed first, while writing the Lives occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarch's own life.

Some editions of the ''Moralia'' include several works now known to be [[pseudepigrapha]]: among these are the ''Lives of the Ten Orators'' (biographies of the [[Attic orators]] based on [[Caecilius of Calacte]]), ''On the Opinions of the Philosophers'', ''On Fate'', and ''On Music''.&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite book| last= Blank| first= D.| year= 2011| title= 'Plutarch' and the Sophistry of 'Noble Lineage'| editor-first= J. |editor-last= Martínez | work= Fakes and Forgers of Classical Literature| place= Madrid| publisher= Ediciones Clásicas| pages= 33–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; One "[[Pseudo-Plutarch]]" is held responsible for all of these works, though their authorship is unknown.&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite book| last= Blank| first= D.| year= 2011| title= 'Plutarch' and the Sophistry of 'Noble Lineage'| editor-first= J. |editor-last= Martínez | work= Fakes and Forgers of Classical Literature| place= Madrid| publisher= Ediciones Clásicas| pages= 33–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the thoughts and opinions recorded are not Plutarch's and come from a slightly later era, they are all classical in origin and have value to the historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Don E.| last= Marietta| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gz-8PsrT32AC&amp;dq= |title= Introduction to Ancient Philosophy| publisher= M.E.

===Books===
Since the [[Henry Estienne|Stephanus]] edition of 1572, the ''Moralia'' have traditionally been arranged in 14 books, as in the following list which includes the English, the original Greek and the Latin title:&lt;ref name=Helmbold1962&gt;[https://ryanfb.github.io/loebolus-data/L337.pdf ''Plutarch's Moralia'' in Fifteen Volumes, Volume VI, translated by W.

==Specific ideas contained==
===Origins dilemma===
In his essay "The Symposiacs," Plutarch discusses the famous problem of the [[chicken and the egg]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch of Chaeronea.

===On reincarnation===
Included in ''Moralia'' is letter addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not give way to excessive [[grief]] at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch of Chaeronea. "Letter of Consolation." http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Consolatio_ad_uxorem*.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Plutarch seems to hint at a possible belief in [[reincarnation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Hirsch-Luipold (2016). "Afterlife and Reincarnation in Plutarch." SBL Philo of Alexandria Seminar, http://torreys.org/sblpapers2016/S20-345_RHL_Reincarnation_Plutarch.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[soul]], being eternal, after [[death]] is like a caged bird that has been released. If it has been a long time in the body, and has become tame by many affairs and long habit, the soul will immediately take another body and once again become involved in the troubles of the world. The worst thing about old age is that the soul's memory of the other world grows dim, while at the same time its attachment to things of this world becomes so strong that the soul tends to retain the form that it had in the body. But that soul which remains only a short time within a body, until liberated by the higher powers, quickly recovers its fire and goes on to higher things.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch of Chaeronea. "Letter of Consolation." http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Consolatio_ad_uxorem*.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On the intellect===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}

[[File:Enkai in Kumamoto.jpg|thumb|A group of Japanese people in [[Kumamoto]] begin to drink]]
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
A {{nihongo|'''''nomikai'''''|飲み会|lead=yes}} is a drinking party phenomenon particular to [[Japanese culture]].  ''Nomikai'' are a part of the culture of most places of employment, from schools to nightclubs.  They are most often held in restaurants or ''[[izakaya]]'', usually with everyone seated at one large table or occupying a separated section of the venue.

Employees are usually expected to participate to some extent in various ''nomikai'', as it is considered a social aspect of work, although it is not expressly required.  Such parties focus on the bond between coworkers as a group, and are not considered private or somehow non-work related (see [[Japanese values]]).  Attendance does not necessarily imply that a person will drink any alcohol, however, and attendees generally pay a set amount for the food, drink, and venue regardless of consumption.  Any leftover money may be put toward organizing the next ''nomikai''.

The student version of the ''nomikai'' is called a ''[[konpa]]'' and contains some distinguishing characteristics.

==Procedure==

''Nomikai'' are held to mark a wide range of events, including completion of major projects, attainment of set goals, foundation anniversaries, school sporting events, entry of new coworkers, and retirement of senior employees.  There is always at least one {{nihongo|organizer|幹事}} responsible for the preparation of the venue.  This is usually not the same person or persons for whom the ''nomikai'' takes place.

With the exception of the end of year {{nihongo|''[[bōnenkai]]''|忘年会|extra=forget the year party}}, most nomikai consist of workers in one section or department of the workplace.  In the case of the ''bōnenkai'', everyone in the entire company may be present.  In large companies, however, separate ''bōnenkai''s are often the norm for each department.  Additionally, there may be both kinds of ''bōnenkai'' on separate dates.  For example, there may be a math department ''bōnenkai'' on one day, with a school-wide ''bōnenkai'' for all teachers the following week.

At onset of the ''nomikai'', the organizers give a brief welcome speech, followed by the manager, president, or principal, who offers words of reflection and encouragement.  The monologue is punctuated by a toast after which everyone begins eating and drinking.  If there are new employees or guests at the ''nomikai'', it is customary for them also to give a self-introduction and salutation to the other members.

''Nomikai'' are nearly always concluded after a few hours by everyone standing, clapping in unison.  There are two main styles of clapping: ''ippon-jime'' and ''sanbon-jime''. These translate roughly to "one-clap ending" and "three-clap ending", respectively.  A three-clap ending is actually three series of three claps, followed by a single clap.  Often this is repeated three times, leaving the total number of claps at thirty.  Sometimes the ''shime'' (ending) may happen in conjunction with a verbose salute to the organizer or honored participant, or the singing of the company or school song.

The {{nihongo|''nijikai''|二次会}} is the afterparty.  After the main nomikai is concluded, the attendees often break into smaller groups and move to different bars.  As attendance is not at all mandatory for nijikai, they usually are groups of friends or people interested in doing a lot of drinking, including [[Pub crawl|bar-hopping]]. Drinking that comes after a ''nijikai'' is referred to as {{nihongo|''sanjikai''|三次会}}.

==''Nomikai'' etiquette==

During ''nomikai'' there are rules of etiquette which are generally followed.  Generally, one tries to avoid filling one's own glass, but instead offers to fill others' for them.  This is especially true of [[Senpai|senpai-kōhai relationships]], where the participant of lower rank or age will first offer to serve his superior.  This relationship is often reciprocal, and the superior will offer to fill the junior's glass in return.  This is not perceived so much as currying favor as it is seen as acting in a manner conducive to workplace harmony (see [[Wa (Japanese culture)|Wa]]).

Another point of etiquette which differs from Western business culture is that it is considered acceptable to become drunk at ''nomikai''.  In the same vein, things said and done under such circumstances are not taken seriously, but are forgiven or ignored upon return to the workplace.  Consequently, there are sometimes frank and emotional displays between coworkers, regardless of rank, which may not occur in a normal workplace context. This phenomenon is called {{nihongo|''bureikō''|無礼講}} in Japanese.

On the other hand, it is generally regarded as unacceptable to pressure people into drinking alcohol or consuming more of it than they want.  Participants may drink non-alcoholic beverages or leave a glass full to signal that they are not willing to drink any (more) alcohol.

The '''Oath of the Peach Garden''' is a fictional event in the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]]. This event is set at the [[end of the Han dynasty|end]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] around the time of the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in the 180s A.D. [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] took an oath of fraternity in a ceremony in the Peach Garden (believed to be in present-day [[Zhuozhou]], [[Hebei]]), and became [[Blood brother|sworn brother]]s from then on. Their goal in taking the oath was to protect the Han Empire from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|Yellow Turban rebels]]. The oath bound the three men, who would later play important roles in the establishment of the state of [[Shu Han]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. It is also often alluded to as a symbol of fraternal loyalty.

==The oath==
The oath, as it appears in the [[Wikisource]] translation of Chapter 1 of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', was this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

When saying the names [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], although the surnames are different, yet we have come together as brothers. From this day forward, we shall join forces for a common purpose: to save the troubled and to aid the endangered. We shall avenge the nation above, and pacify the citizenry below. We seek not to be born on the same day, in the same month and in the same year. We merely hope to die on the same day, in the same month and in the same year. May the Gods of Heaven and Earth attest to what is in our hearts. If we should ever do anything to betray our friendship, may heaven and the people of the earth both strike us dead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many other translations, only the section dealing with "dying on the selfsame day" is present. However, the three brothers do not die on the same day: [[Guan Yu]] was killed by [[Sun Quan]]'s forces in 220; [[Zhang Fei]] was assassinated by his subordinates in 221; [[Liu Bei]] died of illness in 223, a year after his disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting]].

==Historicity==
There is no mention of the three men becoming sworn brothers in [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the authoritative source for the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. However, in Guan Yu's biography, their relationship was described to be "as close as brothers", to the point of "sharing the same bed".&lt;ref&gt;(先主與二人寢則同床，恩若兄弟。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Fei's biography also mentioned that Guan Yu was older than Zhang Fei, so Zhang regarded Guan as an elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;(羽年長數歲，飛兄事之。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
The oath inspired the present-day secret societies in Chinese communities, such as the [[Triad (underground society)|triad]]s, to use a similar ritual when swearing in new members. "Though not born on the same day of the same month in the same year, we hope to die so" — the phrase the three brothers made during the oath — had also become popular among present-day secret society members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

{{quote |''I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,&lt;br/&gt;My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,&lt;br/&gt;My gay apparel for an almsman's gown&lt;br/&gt;My figured goblets for a dish of wood.''&lt;br/&gt;

 – [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&lt;ref&gt; Baldick,2008. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. 
*''Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' ([[English language|English]] proverb)
*''Wounds caused by knives will heal, wounds caused by words will not heal.'' ([[Mongolian culture|Mongolian]] proverb)
*''The truth has legs and ran away; the lie has no legs and must stay.'' ([[Yiddish culture|Yiddish]] proverb)
*''When there is food in the house, what matter if a guest arrives? When there is faith, what is death?'' ([[Afghan proverbs|Pashto proverb]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 181. Bartlotti, Leonard and Raj Wali Shah Khattak. 2006. ''Rohi Mataluna'', revised and expanded ed. Peshawar, Pakistan: Interlit and Pashto Academy, Peshawar University.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patsy Stone''' is a fictional character on the UK television series ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', portrayed by actress [[Joanna Lumley]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/29/absolutely-fabulous-back-bolly-stolly |title=Absolutely Fabulous is back – crack open the Bolly and Stolly &amp;#124; Television &amp; radio |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2011-08-29|accessdate=2011-12-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Patsy was the last of a string of children born to an aging [[Czechs|Czech]] mother in [[Paris]], who gave birth "like a [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]], scattering bastard babies all over Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Happy New Year" Series 3 Ep. 2| date=1995-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a flashback showing Patsy's birth, after telling an attendant to cut the cord, Patsy's mother exclaims that she names the child '''[[Eurydice]] Colette [[Clytemnestra]] [[Dido]] [[Bathsheba]] [[Rabelais]] Patricia [[Cocteau]] Stone'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Birth" Series 2 Ep. 6| date=1994-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only sibling seen in the series is her older sister Jackie ([[Kate O'Mara]]), a former high-class escort whom Patsy worships, despite the fact that Jackie treats her horribly and twice tried to murder her through [[heroin]] overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Happy New Year" Series 3 Ep. 2| date=1995-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy and [[Edina Monsoon]] were childhood friends, and since her mother despised and neglected her—regarding her more as a rival than a daughter—she came to rely on the Monsoons for most of her shelter, comfort, and food (though she has only been seen eating twice since 1973). She mentioned that her mother would have had an [[abortion]], though she mistook her pregnancy for the onset of the [[menopause]]. The first few years of her life were spent locked in a room, and the rest of her childhood was dismal by Patsy's own description, without friends, parties, or presents. Although her mother eventually sent her to school, by the time she did Patsy was much older than all the other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Happy New Year" Series 3 Ep. 2| date=1995-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims to have forgotten everything before 1968, though occasionally memories come back to her in the form of flashbacks.

Although Patsy claims to have been an [[It girl]] and in-demand model in 1960's [[Swinging London]], flashbacks reveal she was totally unsuccessful, only getting work through latching on to high-profile designers and models. A flashback to the Sixties reveals Patsy wreaking havoc on the set of one of [[Zandra Rhodes]]' photo shoots. She dubs herself an "ex-[[Bond girl]]", but the films she starred in were actually Bond-inspired [[sexploitation]] films entitled ''Bond Meets [[Black Emmanuelle|Black]] [[Emmanuelle]]'', ''Boldfinger'', and ''The Man with Thunder Balls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Schmoozin'" Series 5 Ep. 6| date=2003-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Schmoozin'" a group of partygoers are treated to a viewing of Patsy's 70's [[softcore pornography|softcore]] porn film "Booberella." Patsy claims to have slept with every member of the [[Rolling Stones]], stating that "...you didn't have a favourite Stone, you had 'em all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Schmoozin'" Series 5 Ep. 6| date=2003-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claims to have slept with [[Keith Moon]] ("Well sort of. I woke up underneath him in a hotel room once."), and one of [[the Beatles]], although she cannot remember which one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.salon.com/2001/11/15/ab_fab/| title=The return of "Absolutely Fabulous"| author=Carina Chocano| publisher=Salon magazine| date=2001-11-15| access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times throughout the series it is alluded to that Patsy was at one time [[transgender]], having undergone a sex-change operation in [[Morocco]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3627663/Joanna-Lumley-reveals-Absolutely-Fabulous-alter-ego-Patsy-Stone-transgender.html| title=Joanna Lumley reveals her Absolutely Fabulous alter-ego Patsy Stone is transgender| author=Rebecca Davison| publisher=Daily Mail| date=2016-06-06|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy states that this only lasted a few months, "before it fell off",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Morocco" Series 2 Ep. 3| date=1994-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elton John]] recognizes her as someone he slept with when she was a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Schmoozin'" Series 5 Ep. 6| date=2003-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the series==

===Friendship with Edina===
Patsy shares a codependent existence with Edina and often acts as her [[enabler]], encouraging her to partake in addictive behaviors like smoking and drinking. The relationship usually results in hilarious, albeit dysfunctional, behaviour and over-the-top conflicts. The two usually spend their days shopping at high-end department stores and boutiques ([[Harvey Nichols]] being their favourite), going to lunch at trendy restaurants, and avoiding their respective work places. Patsy is more [[parasitic]] in her dependence than Eddie is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Absolutely-Fabulous| title=''Absolutely Fabulous'': British Television Show |work=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; she spends most of her spare time at Eddie's house, drinks Eddie's booze, uses her chauffeur-driven car, and at various points lives with her, in either the attic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title="Identity" Season 6 Ep. 1|date=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saffy's bedroom, or the utility room. In "Death" (Series 2) Patsy attempts to convince Eddy to leave her her multimillion-pound [[Holland Park]] house in the event of Eddy's death.

Her dependence on the friendship leads Patsy to sabotage any relationships which take Eddy's attention away from her, which is the root cause of her near-constant animosity towards Saffy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Magazine" Series 1 Ep. 6| date=1992-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Schmoozin'" Series 5 Ep. 5| date=2003-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy is also quite critical of Edina, often making passive jabs at her weight and poor fashion choices.

===Appearance===
Unlike Eddy, Patsy is usually conservatively, but stylishly, dressed and almost invariably wears her hair in a characteristic blonde [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] with a [[Bangs (hair)|fringe]] she is very attached to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Seales |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2076498/Absolutely-Fabulous-2011-Joanna-Lumley-celebrates-return-Patsy-Stone.html |title=Absolutely Fabulous 2011: Joanna Lumley celebrates the return of Patsy Stone &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2011-12-20|accessdate=2011-12-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a particular fondness for couture [[Chanel]] jackets, which she wears to editorial meetings to intimidate her colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Magazine Series 1 Ep. 6| date=1992-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy was born on 30 October, although her actual age is never clearly divulged; she often states herself to be between 39 and 43. She is so obsessed with projecting youth that she uses a false passport (obtained from "Johnny Fingers" on the [[Isle of Dogs]]) with a doctored picture from her modelling days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=glUm-cHeekc| title=ab fab patsy's passport| date=2010-04-28| publisher=Youtube| access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title="Identity" Season 6 Ep. 1|date=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one episode ("Cold Turkey") a nurse guesses that she is around 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Cold Turkey" Series 5 Ep. 8| date=2003-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Happy New Year" (Series 3), Patsy's sister Jackie reveals that she is 72 years old, to which Patsy replies "My God, then how old does that make me?"; suggesting that Patsy has lied about her age so often that she can no longer remember her real age. Her vanity and obsession with youth leads her to use radical beauty treatments, including [[sulfuric acid]] peels, [[collagen]] lip injections, and the [[Botox]]-like filler "Paralox", which takes away wrinkles but paralyses her face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Hospital" Series 2 Ep. 1| date=1994-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Paralox" Series 4 Ep. 1| date=2001-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series progresses, Patsy betrays her age more and more, appearing to become more feeble beginning in the 4th series. In "Menopause" Patsy has to visit the hospital after fracturing her bones doing simple tasks, like snapping her fingers. The doctor diagnoses her with [[osteoporosis]] and declares that she has the lowest [[bone density]] on record. In "Olympics" she admits to using [[adult diapers]] for occasional incontinence. Her poor eyesight is evident, with Patsy often colliding with objects and having to scrutinize type and images very closely.

===Personality===
Patsy usually seems quite cold and unemotive, especially in her behaviour toward her chief rival Saffy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/arts/television-through-thick-and-thin-thin-i-could-kill-her.html |title=TELEVISION; Through Thick and Thin (Thin? I Could Kill Her) - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1995-04-30 |accessdate=2011-12-21 |first=Anita |last=Gates}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she sometimes reveals a more vulnerable side (in flashbacks to her bleak life with her mother, in her overeager admiration for the awful Jackie, and in those rare moments when Eddy temporarily withdraws her friendship) and even occasionally asks Saffy for advice. She is also prone to intense outbursts of anger, usually directed at Saffy, who constantly chastises her for her many vices and the malign influence she has on Eddy. When faced with a situation that someone else might find alarming or disconcerting, Patsy often responds with a cool "right, cheers, thanks a lot."

Patsy is an alcoholic, a [[chain smoker]], and a frequent [[recreational drug]] user. She carries drugs with her at all times, storing [[Joint (cannabis)|joints]] in her trademark bouffant. She has nearly overdosed on several occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Menopause" Series 4 Ep. 6| date=2001-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on one occasion in the series has to have her stomach pumped after a [[rave]]-style drug binge in Edina's sitting room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Death"  Series 2, Ep. 2| date=1994-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "France" she is detained at customs for carrying [[cocaine]], only to be released when tests show she mistakenly bought [[baking powder]]. In "Identity" she is revealed to have stiffed her former dealer, Barron, of ₤50,000 worth of drugs, justifying her habit by saying "Have you seen the price of [[Methadone]] these days? Cheaper to buy [[crack cocaine|crack]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title="Identity" Season 6 Ep. 1|date=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her drinks of choice are [[Bollinger]] champagne or [[Stolichnaya]] vodka, though she will drink whatever alcohol is around. She jokes that her blood-alcohol level is so high that "the last mosquito that bit me had to check into the [[Betty Ford Clinic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=France (Series 1 Ep. 3)| date=1992-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Birth" (Series 2 Ep. 6) she causes a fire in Edina's kitchen when she passes out with a lit cigarette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMFKz7IRPnA| title=Ab Fab - Patsy makes the kitchen catch fire| author=AbFab clips| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2011-11-24|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her addiction to cigarettes is so strong that she carries [[nicotine patches]] in the event that she gets into a non-smoking cab, so that she can survive the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Poor" Series 2 Ep. 5| date=1994-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early series, Patsy is very promiscuous and frank about her sexuality, seducing anyone she finds attractive. When the 4th series commences, Patsy's attractiveness to men has begun to wane, though she refuses to admit this and still throws herself at men. Her obsession for staying thin means that she rarely eats; she claims that she has not eaten anything since 1973, having had a "stomach bypass" according to Eddy. There are only 2 instances where she does eat: in the episode "New Year's Eve" she painfully chews and swallows a potato crisp, then is visibly shaken from having actually eaten something; and in the Christmas Special "Cold Turkey" she renders the entire assembly speechless by demurely asking for a small slice of turkey during Christmas lunch, but chokes it up upon eating it.

===Career===
Throughout the first three series, Patsy is a [[creative director|fashion director]] at an unnamed magazine similar to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which she secured through sleeping with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Magazine Series 1 Ep. 6| date=1992-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saffy derisively says that Patsy's job is to "invent random adjectives for pointless clothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Small Opening" Series 4 Ep. 5| date=2001-09-28|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy rarely does any work or goes to the office (in "Magazine" she can't remember where her office is located in the building and needs to ask directions). The benefits she most enjoys are the many free products she is given and the 50% discount she gets at [[Harvey Nichols]]. She refers to herself as an "international beauty and style guru"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Jealous Series 3 Ep.4| date=1995-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, boasting that she is so influential that with "one snap of my fingers and I can raise hemlines so high that the world is your [[gynecologist]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Magazine Series 1 Ep. 6| date=1992-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episodes "Fear" and "The End" (Series 3) Patsy's magazine closes and she briefly moves to New York to take another fashion director job at "HQ" magazine. However she is so lonely without Eddy that she quickly returns to London. In part one of "The Last Shout" she is job-hunting, but blows off a job interview to go to the pub. In part two her old boss Magda ([[Kathy Burke]]) gets her a job as fashion editor at another unnamed magazine.

In the special "Gay" (2002), Patsy has taken a job as "executive creative director, chief buyer and lifestyle coordinator" for "Jeremy's", an upscale boutique whose clientele consists of "rich bitches whose faces are pulled so tight they can't see what they're buying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Gay" Series 5 Ep. 1| date=2002-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also briefly attempts to become a celebrity [[Personal stylist|stylist]], which ends after a disastrous encounter with [[Minnie Driver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title="Panickin'" Series 5 Ep.3| date=2003-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Birthin'" (Series 5) she is due to receive a "Global Style and Elegance" Award for promoting the importance of accessories, but fails to make the award show when Saffy goes into labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Birthin' Series 5 Ep. 5| date=2002-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th anniversary specials and the feature film, Patsy is once again working for a fashion magazine, under the direction of her old boss Magda.

Patsy's colleagues at her original magazine are Catriona ([[Helen Lederer]]) and Fleur ([[Harriet Thorpe]]), who tag along on her various career moves.

'''Phallus paintings''' in [[Bhutan]] are esoteric symbols, which have their origins in the [[Chimi Lhakhang]] monastery near [[Punakha]], the former capital of Bhutan. The village monastery was built in honour of Lama [[Drukpa Kunley]] who lived in the 15-16th century and who was popularly known as the "Mad Saint" ([[nyönpa]]) or “Divine Madman” for his unorthodox ways of teaching, which amounted to being bizarre and shocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phallus: Crazy Wisdom from Bhutan|year=2014|publisher=ButterLamp Publishers|location=Bhutan|isbn=978-9993691174|url=https://www.amazon.com/Phallus-Wisdom-Bhutan-Karma-Choden/dp/9993691178/|author=Karma Choden|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These explicit paintings, though embarrassing to many urbanites now (this folk culture is now informally discouraged in urban centres&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutansociety.org/newsletter/41.pdf|title=The Decline of the Phallus|publisher=Bhutan Society|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), can be seen painted on the walls of houses and buildings throughout Bhutan, particularly in villages, and are credited as Kunley's creations.&lt;ref name=British&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm|title=Bhutan's phalluses warn off evil|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | date=2005-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Lindsey |author2=Bradley Mayhew |author3=Stan Armington |author4=Richard Whitecross|title=Bhutan|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=1-74059-529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally symbols of an erect penis in Bhutan have been intended to drive away the evil eye and malicious gossip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan: aspects of culture and development|publisher=Issue 5 of Kiscadale Asia research series, Kiscadale|author=Aris, Michael, Hutt, Michael|year=1994|isbn=1-870838-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the history of use of phallus symbols is traced to Drukpa Kunley, the studies carried out at the Center of Bhutan Studies (CBS) have inferred that the phallus was an integral part of the early [[ethnic religion]] that existed in Bhutan before [[Buddhism]] became the state religion and is associated with [[Bon]]. In Bon, phallus was integral to all rituals.&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_art_phallus.php|title=Arts and Crafts of Bhutan|work=The Phallus : an arcane symbol|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Keys to Bhutan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127022531/http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_art_phallus.php|archivedate=2013-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasho Lam Sanga, a former principal of the Institute of Language and Culture Studies (ILCS), while stating that there are no written documents on it, elaborates: "But the worship of the phallus was believed to be in practice even before the arrival of [[Padmasambhava|Guru Rinpoche]] and Shabdrung [[Ngawang Namgyal]]&amp;nbsp;... What we know about it is what we heard from our forefathers."&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

The phallic symbols are, however, generally not depicted in community temples and [[dzong architecture|dzongs]], which are places of worship where [[lama]]s or [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]] who have adopted celibate lifestyles and pursue divine ideals live. However, rural and ordinary houses continue to display them.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name=Observe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/2009/readers-voices/09/the-decline-of-the-phallus.html|title=The decline of the phallus|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Bhutan Observer|date=2009-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808015906/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/2009/readers-voices/09/the-decline-of-the-phallus.html|archive-date=2010-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The often mentioned origin of the symbolic phallus is as a legacy of the popular Bhutanese saint [[Drukpa Kunley]] (1455–1529).&lt;ref name="Brown, p.79"&gt;Brown, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Kunley migrated from Tibet, was trained in [[Ralung Monastery]] in [[Tibet]], and belonged to the period of [[Pema Lingpa]] and was his disciple. He was a crazy saint who extensively travelled in Bhutan, who was fond of women and wine, and adopted blasphemous and unorthodox ways of teaching Buddhism. His sexual exploits included his hosts and promoters. He was utterly devoid of all social conventions and called himself the "Madman from Kyishodruk."

Drukpa Kunley's intention was to shock the clergy, who were uppity and prudish in their behaviour and teachings of Buddhism. However, his ways appealed to lay practitioners. It was he who propagated the legend of painting phalluses on walls and flying hanging phalluses from roof tops of houses to drive away evil spirits and subdue demonesses.&lt;ref name="Brown, p.136"&gt;Brown, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; He is, therefore, also called the "fertility saint", as the [[monastery]] he built, [[Chimi Lhakhang]], is visited by not only [[Bhutan]]ese women but also people from the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].

Kunley's organ, as painted, is called the "Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom" as it unnerved demons and demonesses and subdued them. It is also said that he is "perhaps the only saint in the religions of the world who is almost exclusively identified with phallus and its creative power". It is for this reason that his phallus, as a symbol, is depicted in paintings on the walls of the houses, and he is shown in [[thangka]] paintings holding a "wooden stick with penis head".&lt;ref name=Winer&gt;{{Cite book|last=Winer|first= Jerome A.|author2=James William Anderson|title= Psychoanalysis and history|pages=200–201|accessdate=2010-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3mR8TSnnIwC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Phallic+paintings+in+Bhutan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7l9eTLq4NseqcbvtldsO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-88163-399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chimi Lhakhang Divine Madman Monestary 1500.jpg|thumb|[[Chimi Lhakhang]], established by [[Drukpa Kunley]] and is known for its wooden phalluses.]]
The ''nyönpa'' lived in a place known as Lobesa close to Chimi Lhakhang to drive away demonesses and protect the local people. According to the legend, he used to hit the evil forces with his penis (or cohabited with them) and turn them into protective deities.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt; Chimi Lhakhang was built in the mad saint's honour by his cousin on a hillock (this hillock was called by Kunley a "woman's breast") in a valley for the good deeds done to his people by subduing the evil forces and demonesses with his "magic thunderbolt of wisdom". It was built in 1499 with a square plan and a golden spire. It is approached from the Yowakha village, and all the houses on the way are painted with phallic symbols.

The monastery now houses several wooden phalluses including a silver-handled phallus (the "Lama's Thunderbolt"), which the mad saint is supposed to have brought from Tibet. This is now frequently used by the current [[lama]] of the monastery to hit women on the head as a blessing to beget children. The monastery is also enshrined with a statue of Lama Kunley with his pet dog Sachi. Images of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Avalokiteśvara]] are also deified in the monastery. Women come to the monastery seeking blessings of children by getting hit on the head by the presiding lama with wooden and [[bone]] phalluses. The name of the yet-to-be-born child is also chosen by picking bamboo slips placed in the altar inscribed with names of boys and girls. It is also said that the small [[stupa]] at the altar was made by Kunley himself.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.145"&gt;Brown, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued  by social science researchers that the phallus is a representation of "Worldly illusion of desires", and it is said that as a symbol of power and fertility of the [[Animism|animists]] of the [[Bon|Bön religion]], the phallus's representation got enmeshed with Buddhism in Bhutan. Similar phallic depictions can be found in [[Thailand]], [[Bali]], and in other cultures.&lt;ref name=Linda&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marriedtobhutan.com/2010/02/dragon-and-phallus.html|title=Married to Bhutan|work=Dragon and Phallus|author=Linda York Leaming|date=2010-02-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608073126/http://www.marriedtobhutan.com/2010/02/dragon-and-phallus.html|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anecdotes and practices===
Several anecdotes are told of the zany ways of Drukpa Kunley. It is said that on a particular occasion he was gifted a sacred thread to put around his neck. However, he shocked the people by saying that he would tie the thread around his penis with the fond hope that it would bring him "luck with the ladies".&lt;ref name="Brown, p.136"&gt;Brown, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some communities in eastern Bhutan, every year during a particular period, phalluses are worshipped with flowers, ''[[ara (drink)|ara]]'' (red colored hooch) and milk, in an effort to seek protection from the evil spirits. In central Bhutan, a wooden phallus is immersed in the cups before the drinks are offered to the guests.&lt;ref name=key/&gt; Some phalluses, especially in rural Bhutan, are endowed with comic eyes.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

The phallus painting is also termed as an institutionalised [[graffiti]]. It is seen painted in different designs, and an unusual design seen is one with a [[dragon]] riding the phallus. One common feature noticed is that the phallus is always seen [[Ejaculation|ejaculating]].&lt;ref name=Linda/&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:Bhutan kitchen restaurant with phallic painting on the wall.jpg|thumb|300px|Phallic painting on the walls of the [[Bhutan Kitchen]] restaurant in [[Thimphu]].]]
The belief that such a symbol brings good luck and drives away evil spirits is so much ingrained in the psyche of the common populace in Bhutan that the symbols are routinely painted outside walls of the new houses and even painted on number plates of trucks. The carved wooden phalluses are hung (sometimes crossed by a design of sword or dagger) outside, on the eves of the new homes, at the four corners.&lt;ref name="Brown, p.144"&gt;Brown, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; 

The wooden phalluses are also driven in the agricultural fields as a kind of scarecrow, when the crops start sprouting. The ''Atsaras'' (masked clowns) also decorate their headgear with phallus painted cloth, during the popular [[Tsechu|Tsechu festival]] held every year in different monasteries throughout Bhutan. These clowns also dance with their holy whips and wooden phalluses.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.13"&gt;Brown, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; On a road drive from [[Paro airport]] to [[Thimpu]] these explicit paintings of phalluses are a common sight on “white-washed walls of homes, shops and eateries.”&lt;ref name=British/&gt;

In the Chimi Lhakhang monastery, the shrine dedicated to Drukpa Kunley, several wooden penises are seen being used to bless people who visit the monastery on pilgrimage seeking blessings to bear a child or for welfare of their children. The glaringly displayed phallus in the monastery is a brown wooden piece with a silver handle, a religious relic considered to possess divine powers and hence used for blessing the spiritually oriented people. It is also said to prevent quarrels among family members in the houses which are painted with these symbols.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.79"&gt;Brown, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

==House warming ritual==
[[File:Bhutan phallus worship.jpg|alt=Bhutan phallus worship|thumb|299x299px|Village next to Fertility Temple Chimi Lhakhang where phalluses are painted on walls [http://www.onceinalifetimejourney.com/once-in-a-lifetime-journeys/asia/the-country-that-worships-the-phallus/]]]
An interesting ritual is performed in Bhutan, as part of house warming ceremony of new houses, which entails erecting the phallus symbols at the four corners of the eaves of the house and one inside the house. It involves raising of a basket filled with the phalluses carved out of wood to the roof of the house to fix them at the four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] corners. Groups of both men and women get hired by the owner of the house in raising the basket to the roof.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

While the men pull the basket up with a rope tied securely from the roof, women try to pull it down; during this process, ribald phallic songs are sung and with every pull the people watching the fun shout "laso". A mock exercise is enacted by the men as if they have failed to lift the basket and the basket is dropped to the ground. The intention is to get free hooch (spirit) from the owner of the house so that they get energised to raise the basket. Following the free drinking binge, the men finally rise the basket to the roof and fix the phalluses at the four corners of the roof at the eve ends.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

The phalluses are also tied with a [[dagger]] (''redi'') and painted in five different colours; the colours are said to be significators of five divine expressions: "White dagger representing peace, purity, and harmony, a red coloured dagger representing wealth and power is placed on the west, the yellow dagger representing prosperity is placed on the south, and on the north is placed the green dagger representing protection. The fifth dagger placed inside the house is usually blue in colour and symbolises wisdom."&lt;ref name=key/&gt; The popular belief in fixing these symbols is that it wards off evil spirits, and not as a fertility symbol.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

:''For the full-body lab garment with similar purpose, see ''[[Positive pressure personnel suit]]''.''

A '''powered, air-purifying respirator''' (PAPR) is a type of [[personal protective equipment]] used to safeguard workers against [[contaminated]] air. PAPRs consist of a [[respirator]] in the form of a hood, or full-face mask, which takes ambient [[air]] that is contaminated with one or more type of [[pollutant]] or [[pathogen]], actively removes (filters) a sufficient proportion of these hazards, and then delivers the clean air to the user's face and/or mouth. PAPRs are sometimes called '''positive-pressure masks''', '''blower units''', or just '''blowers'''.

==Description==
There exist different types of PAPR units for different working environments. Regardless of type, a PAPR consists of (1) some kind of headgear (mask or hood), (2) a powered (motor-driven) [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through (3) a [[filter (air)|filter]] (or multiple filters) for delivery to the user for breathing, and (4) a battery or other power source. The mask may be hard and tight-fitting or flexible and loose-fitting. (The former affords a higher level of protection, but is less comfortable.) The fan, filter, and power-pack may be carried around freely by the user, often secured by a belt around the waist. Alternatively, with certain units, the air is fed to the user via lengthy tubing while the fans and filters are remotely mounted.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Filters==
The type of filter incorporated into a PAPR must be appropriate to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some respirators are designed to remove fine particulate [[matter]] such as the [[dust]] created during various [[woodwork]]ing processes. When used with [[high-efficiency particulate air]] (HEPA) filters, airborne particles containing pathogens (viruses, bacteria) smaller than 5 microns will be removed. (PAPRs are typically required for lab workers in [[BSL-3]] facilities, and sometimes in [[BSL-2]] as well.) When used in combination with the correct filters, PAPRs are suitable for working with volatile [[organic compound]]s such as those used in many [[spray paint]]s. At the same time filters that are suitable for volatile substances must typically have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter. In addition there is some confusion over terminology. Some literature and users will refer to a particulate filtering unit as a [[dust mask]] or filter and then use the term respirator to mean a unit that can handle organic [[solvent]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Paper Lightning:Prewriting Activities to Spark Creativity. Cottowood Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Kerry P. Show, Don't Tell: The Importance of Explicit Prewriting Instruction.

Prewriting can consist of a combination of [[Note-taking#Linear note-taking|outlining]], diagramming, storyboarding, [[Note-taking#Non-linear note-taking|clustering]] (for a technique similar to clustering, see [[mindmapping]]).

==Motivation and audience awareness==
Prewriting usually begins with motivation and audience awareness: what is the student or writer trying to communicate, why is it important to communicate it well and who is the audience for this communication. It helps you put your thought out onto the paper on what you want to write about. Writers usually begin with a clear idea of audience, content and the importance of their communication; sometimes, one of these needs to be clarified for the best [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Brian J.An Easy Outlining Approach for Producing Solidly Structured, Audience-Directed Reports. Journal of Business and Technical Communication, v8 n4 p475-82 Oct 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kenneth. Teaching Talented Writers in the Regular Classroom. Gifted Child Today, v31 n2 p19-26 Spr 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigelow, Terry Patrick; Vokoun, Michael J. Reminding Old Dogs of Old Tricks. English Journal, v96 n4 p106-109 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Student writers find motivation especially difficult because they are writing for a teacher or for a grade, instead of a real audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memfox.com/learning-from-learning.html Mem Fox on Writing&lt;/ref&gt; Often teachers try to find a real audience for students by asking them to read to younger classes or to parents, by posting writing for others to read, by writing a blog, or by writing on real topics, such as a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.

==Choosing a topic==
One important task in prewriting is choosing a topic and then narrowing it to a length that can be covered in the space allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Reduce, Anna Danon. Genre Study of Nonfiction Writing: Feature Articles, Editorials, and Essays. Primary Voices K-6, v8 n1 p37-44 Aug 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Oral [[storytelling]] is an effective way to search for a good topic for a personal [[narrative]]. Writers can quickly tell a story and judge from the listeners' reactions whether it will be an interesting topic to write about.

Another way to find a topic is to [[free writing|freewrite]], a method first popularized by [[Peter Elbow]]. When freewriting, you write any and every idea that comes to mind. This could also be a written exploration of your current knowledge of a broad topic, with the idea that you are looking for a narrow topic to write about. Often freewriting is timed. The writer is instructed to keep writing until the time period ends, which encourages him/her to keep writing past the pre-conceived ideas and hopefully find a more interesting topic.

Several other methods of choosing a topic overlap with another broad concern of prewriting, that of [[research]]ing or gathering information. [[Reading (process)|Reading]]&lt;ref&gt;Brodney, Bruce; Reeves, Carolyn; Kazelskis, Richard. Selected Prewriting Treatments: Effects on Expository Compositions Written by Fifth-Grade Students. Journal of Experimental Education, v68 n1 p5-20 Fall 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is effective in both choosing and narrowing a topic and in gathering information to include in the writing. As a writer reads other works, it expands ideas, opens possibilities and points toward options for topics and narrates specific content for the eventual writing. One traditional method of tracking the content read is to create annotated note cards with one chunk of information per card. Writers also need to document music, photos, web sites, interviews, and any other source used to prevent [[plagiarism]].

Besides reading what others  also make original observations relating to a topic. This requires on-site visits, experimentation with something, or finding original or primary historical documents. Writers interact with the setting or materials and make observations about their experience. For strong writing, particular attention should be given to [[senses|sensory]] details (what the writer hears, tastes, touches, smells and feels). While gathering material, often writers pay particular attention to the vocabulary used in discussing the topic. This would include slang, specific terminology, translations of terms, and typical phrases used. The writer often looks up definitions, synonyms and finds ways that different people use the terminology. Lists, journals, teacher-student conference, drawing illustrations, using imagination, restating a problem in multiple ways, watching videos, inventorying interests&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. The Craft of Revision, 5th edition. Boston, MA: Thomson Heinle, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; – these are some of the other methods for gathering information.

==Discussing information==
After reading and observing, often writers need to discuss material. They might [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] with a group or topics or how to narrow a topic. Or, they might discuss events, ideas, and interpretations with just one other person. Oral storytelling might enter again, as the writer turns it into a narrative, or just tries out ways of using the new terminology. Sometimes writers draw or use information as basis for artwork as a way to understand the material better.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzejczak, Nancy; Trainin, Guy; Poldberg, Monique. From Image to Text: Using Images in the Writing Process. International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts, v6 n12 p1-17 Oct 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. Landmark Essays on Writing Process: Volume 7, p. 26. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrowing the topic==
Narrowing a topic is an important step of prewriting. For example, a personal narrative of five pages could be narrowed to an incident that occurred in a thirty-minute time period. This restricted time period means the writer must slow down and tell the event moment by moment with many details. By contrast, a five-page essay about a three-day trip would only skim the surface of the experience. The writer must consider again the goals of communication – content, audience, importance of information – but add to this a consideration of the format for the writing. He or she should consider how much space is allowed for the communication and how What can be effectively communicated within that space?&lt;ref&gt;Kesselman-Turkel, Judi; Peterson, Franklynn. Secrets to Writing Great Papers. The Study Smart Series. ERIC database #ED482545, 2003-00-00&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing content==
At this point, the writer needs to consider the organization of content. [[Outline (list)|Outlining]] in a hierarchical structure is one of the typical strategies, and usually includes three or more levels in the hierarchy. Typical outlines are organized by chronology, spatial relationships, or by subtopics. Other outlines might include sequences along a continuum: big to little, old to new, etc. [[:wikt:clustering|Clustering]], a technique of creating a visual web that represents associations among ideas, is another help in creating structure, because it reveals relationships. [[Storyboarding]] is a method of drawing rough sketches to plan a picture book, a movie script, a graphic novel or other fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. Landmark Essays on Writing Process: Volume 7. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental acquisition of organizing skills==
While information on the developmental sequence of organizing skills is sketchy, anecdotal information suggests that children follow this rough sequence: 1) sort into categories,&lt;ref&gt;Sung, Yao-Ting; Chang, Kuo-En; Lee, Meng-Da. Designing Multimedia Games for Young Children's Taxonomic Concept Development. Computers &amp; Education, v50 n3 p1037-1051 Apr 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 2) structure the categories into a specific order for best communication, using criteria such as which item will best work to catch readers attention in the opening, 3) within a category, sequence information into a specific order for best communication, using criteria such as what will best persuade an audience. At each level, it is important that student writers discuss their decisions; they should understand that categories for a certain topic could be structured in several different ways, all correct. A final skill acquired is the ability to omit information that is not needed in order to communicate effectively.

Even sketchier is information on what types of organization are acquired first, but anecdotal information and research&lt;ref&gt;Hazel, Paul. Toward a Narrative Pedagogy for Interactive Learning Environments. Interactive Learning Environments, v16 n3 p199-213 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that even young children understand chronological information, making narratives the easiest type of student writing. Persuasive writing usually requires logical thinking and studies in child development indicate that logical thinking is not present until a child is 10–12 years old, making it one of the later writing skills to acquire. Before this age, persuasive writing will rely mostly on emotional arguments.

==Writing trials==
Writers also use the prewriting phase to experiment with ways of expressing ideas. For oral storytelling, a writer could tell a story three times, but each time begin at a different time, include or exclude information, end at a different time or place. Writers often try writing the same information. but using different voices, in search of the best way to communicate this information or tell this story.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. The Craft of Revision, 5th edition. Boston, MA: Thomson Heinle, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recursion==
Prewriting is recursive, that is, it can occur at any time in the writing process and can return several times. For example, after a first draft, a writer may need to return to an information gathering stage, or may need to discuss the material with someone, or may need to adjust the outline. While the writing process is discussed as having distinct stages, in reality, they often overlap and circle back on one another.

==Variables==
Prewriting varies depending on the writing task or [[rhetorical mode]]. [[Fiction]] requires more imagination, while informational essays or [[expository writing]] require stronger organization. [[Persuasive writing]] must consider not just the information to be communicated, but how best to change the reader’s ideas or convictions. [[Folklore|Folktale]]s will require extensive reading of the genre to learn common conventions. Each writing task will require a different selection of prewriting strategies, used in a different order.

==Technology==
Technological tools are often used in prewriting tasks,&lt;ref&gt;Bacci, Tina. Invention and Drafting in the Digital Age: New Approaches to Thinking about Writing. Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas, v82 n2 p75-81 Nov-Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Sandy, Ed. Wordle. Voices from the Middle, v16 n2 p66-68 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sherron Killingsworth. Taking a Technological Path to Poetry Prewriting. Reading Teacher, v55 n7 p678-87 Apr 2002&lt;/ref&gt; including word processors, spreadsheets&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Dani; Smithmier, Mike. Death of the 3" x 5" Note Cards. English Journal, v98 n2 p37-39 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing programs; however, technology appears to be more useful in the revision, editing and publishing phases of prewriting.

==Writing tests==
Teaching writing as a process is accepted pedagogical practice, but there is increasing concern that writing tests do not allow for the full writing process, especially cutting short the time&lt;ref&gt;Mike Sharples. How We Write: Writing as Creative Design. Routledge, 1999, p87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Passman, Roger. It's about Time! Increasing the Length of Student Classroom Writing without Setting Length Constraints. ERIC database #ED477860, 2003-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; needed for prewriting tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Edgar H.

The '''protocol relating to the status of refugees''' of 1967 broadens the definition of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of 1951. The main point of the protocol was to "grant all refugees the same status irrespective of the effective date of the 1st of January 1951."

The protocol was completed on the 31st of January 1967 in [[New York City]]. Switzerland ratified the protocol on the 20th of May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Publications from Switzerland: [https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19670017/201209280000/0.142.301.pdf ''Protokoll über die Rechtsstellung der Flüchtlinge''] (PDF) von 1968, Stand: 28.

'''''Scrambled Eggs Super!''''' is a 1953 book by American children's author [[Dr. Seuss]]. It tells of a boy named Peter T. Hooper, who makes [[scrambled eggs]] prepared from eggs of various exotic birds.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the story, Peter T. Hooper brags to a girl, Liz, in his mother's kitchen about how good of a cook he is. He tells the story of how, when he became fed up with the taste of regular [[scrambled eggs]] using hen's eggs, he decided to scramble eggs from other birds. He tells of how he travelled great distances and discovered a variety of exotic birds and their eggs. He explains his criteria for choosing some eggs, because of their sweetness, and avoiding others. He takes the eggs home but decides that he still needs more, and he calls on the help of some friends he knows from around the world, including a "fellow named Ali". After each bird Peter finds he states the phrase..."Scrambled Eggs Super Dee Dooper Dee Booper Special Deluxe a la Peter T. Hooper".

==Critical reception==
Ruth C. Barlow of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' called it a "gay extravaganza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/274072032.html?dids=274072032:274072032&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+30%2C+1953&amp;author=By+Ruth+C.+Barlow&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Keeping+Up+With+the+Juniors&amp;pqatl=google|title=Keeping Up With the Juniors|last=Barlow|first=Ruth C.|date=30 July 1953|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also received positive reviews from ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' and ''The New York Herald Tribune'' for Seuss's illustrations of the birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fensch|first=Thomas|title=The Man Who Was Dr. Seuss: The Life and Work of Theodor Geisel  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzqrX46iFwAC&amp;pg=PA106 |publisher=New Century Books|isbn=0-930751-11-6|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillip Nel, in the book ''Dr. Seuss: American Icon'', wrote that ''Scrambled Eggs Super!'' was one of Seuss's less politically oriented books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nel|first=Phillip|title=Dr. Seuss: American icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&amp;pg=PA148 |publisher=Continuum International|isbn=0-8264-1708-6|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Algebraist''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[Novel in Scotland|novel by Scottish]] writer [[Iain M. Banks]], published in print in 2004. It was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/credits/ |title=2005 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was his third science fiction novel not to be based or set in [[The Culture]], the earlier two being ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'' and ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]''.

== Plot summary ==
The novel takes place in 4034. With the assistance of other species, humans have spread across the galaxy,
which is largely ruled by the Mercatoria, a complex feudal hierarchy, with a religious zeal to rid the galaxy of [[artificial intelligences]], which were blamed for a previous war.

In centre-stage, Banks portrays the human Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers. The Beyonders, a large fleet of space marauders originating on the fringes of the galaxy, have cut the system of Nasqueron's star (Ulubis) off from the rest of Mercatoria civilization by destroying its [[Wormhole|portal]] (the only means of [[faster than light travel]]), and the local Mercatoria adherents await the delivery of a wormhole connection from a neighboring system via sub-lightspeed travel.

The Dwellers, an advanced and ancient civilisation of non-humanoids who inhabit [[gas giant]]s, lead an almost [[anarchic]] existence based on kudos, and inhabit the majority of gas-giant planets in the galaxy. They are the only major species outside the control of the Mercatoria, being rumoured to possess devastating defensive weaponry. Dweller societies try not to get involved with "Quick" species, those with sentient beings who experience life at around the speed human beings experience it. Dwellers are one of the "Slow" species who experience life at a much slower rate. Dweller individuals live for millions of years, and the species has existed for billions of years, long before the foundation of the Mercatoria. Slow Seers like Taak are a [[dynasty]] of researchers who attempt to glean information from the Dwellers' vast but disorganised libraries of knowledge, artificially slowing their metabolisms to better communicate with them.

Taak, looking forward to a life of quiet scholarship, is astonished to be [[military draft|drafted]] into one of the Mercatoria's religio-military orders. It turns out that in a previous research expedition to the Dweller-inhabited gas-giant Nasqueron, Taak inadvertently uncovered a book containing information about the legendary "Dweller List" of coordinates for their own private systems of wormholes. Since Dwellers are sufficiently long-lived to colonise the galaxy at sub-light speed, the very existence of such a network was considered doubtful.

The Dweller List is only a list of star systems. Portals are relatively small and can be anywhere within a system so long as it is a point of zero net [[gravitational attraction]], such as a  [[Lagrange point]]. The list is useless without a certain [[Transformation (mathematics)|mathematical transform]] needed to give the exact location of the portals. Taak must go on a further expedition to Nasqueron in order to find the Transform.

A tyrannical [[warlord]], the Archimandrite Luseferous of the Starveling Cult, in loose alliance with the Beyonders, sets out to invade the Ulubis system from the Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect, also aiming to possess the secrets of the Dweller portals. A Mercatoria counter-attack fleet hurries to defend Ulubis against the Starveling Cult ships and their Beyonder allies. Both fleets are forced to travel at sub light speeds, leaving the inhabitants of the Ulubis system anxiously wondering which will arrive first.

Taak's hunt for the Transform  takes him on a journey, partly through the Dweller wormhole network. In a back story, it is revealed that he has been out of sympathy with the Mercatoria for some time, particularly over their treatment of artificial intelligences, and has in fact been a Beyonder agent. It is also revealed that the Dwellers have been harbouring artificial intelligences from Mercatoria persecution.

The Beyonder/Starveling forces arrive and easily overwhelm Ulubis's native defences. They discover to their dismay that the counter-attack force is arriving much sooner than predicted, and is superior. The Beyonder factions despair of locating Taak and the secret in the time available before the recapture of Ulubis, and retreat. The Starvelings under Luseferous remain. He makes a last-ditch attempt to force the Dwellers to yield up Taak, threatening them with antimatter weapons. The Dwellers respond with devastating blows on his fleet. Luseferous flees under Mercatoria  pursuit.

Taak returns from his journey with his memory partly erased. He is still able to piece together the secret from the remaining clues: every massive body has a region of zero net gravitational attraction at its exact centre. The Dwellers have hidden wormhole portals in the cores of all their occupied planets, and the Transform was never necessary. It remains unclear whether the Dwellers will give the necessary cooperation in allowing other species access to their network, now that the secret is out.

The novel ends with Taak, having left Ulubis and joined the Beyonders, suggesting to a lifelong friend he has just discovered is an AI, "all will be free".

"'''The Highwayman'''" is a [[narrative poem]] written by [[Alfred Noyes]], first published in the August 1906 issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Highwayman|url=https://archive.org/stream/blackwoodsmagazi180edinuoft#page/244/mode/2up|work=Blackwood's Magazine on Internet Archive|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', based in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]. The following year it was included in Noyes' collection, ''Forty Singing Seamen and Other Poems'', becoming an immediate success.  In 1995 it was voted 15th in the [[BBC]]'s poll for "The Nation's Favourite Poems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Noyes|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/halloffame/arts/alfrednoyes.shtml|work=BBC Mid Wales|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The poem, set in 18th century rural England, tells the story of an unnamed [[highwayman]] who is in love with Bess, a landlord's  daughter. Betrayed to the authorities by Tim, a jealous [[hostler|ostler]], the highwayman escapes ambush when Bess sacrifices her life to warn him. Learning of her death, he dies in a futile attempt at revenge, shot down on the highway. In the final stanza, the [[ghost]]s of the lovers meet again on winter nights.

==Background==

The poem was written on the edge of a desolate stretch of land known as [[Bagshot Heath]], where Noyes, then aged 24, had taken rooms in a cottage. In his autobiography, he recalled: "Bagshot Heath in those days was a wild bit of country, all [Calluna|heather] and [pine]woods. "The Highwayman" suggested itself to me one blustery night when the sound of the wind in the pines gave me the first line." The poem was completed in about two days.&lt;ref name=Noyes&gt;Alfred Noyes 'Two Worlds for Memory. Philadelphia: J. B. Clipping, 1953, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary qualities==

The poem makes effective use of vivid imagery to describe surroundings; plus repetitious phrases to create the sense of a horseman riding at ease through the rural darkness to a lovers' tryst and soldiers marching down the same road to ambush him.

"The Highwayman" is reputed to be "the best narrative poem in existence for oral delivery".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]] (eds). ''The Oxford Book of Narrative Verse''. Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half a century later, Noyes wrote, "I think the success of the poem... was because it was not an artificial composition, but was written at an age when I was genuinely excited by that kind of romantic story."&lt;ref name=Noyes/&gt;

==Adaptations and use in popular culture==
*In 1933, a setting of the poem for chorus and small orchestra by the English composer [[C. Armstrong Gibbs]] received its first performance at [[Winchester College]] Music School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s204804395.websitehome.co.uk/html/Gibbs.pdf Armstrong Gibbs], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, the poem was used as the basis for a feature-length Hollywood [[The Highwayman (1951 film)|film of the same name]], starring [[Philip Friend]] and [[Wanda Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043638/|title=The Highwayman|date=12 August 1951|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes writes in his autobiography that he was pleasantly surprised by "the fact that in this picture, produced in Hollywood, the poem itself is used and followed with the most artistic care".&lt;ref name=Noyes/&gt;
*In 1965, a parody of the poem, "The Modern Highwayman – with apologies to Alfred Noyes", appeared in the June issue, #95, of [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madcoversite.com/mad095.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Mad #95|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 1966 the poem was put to music by [[Phil Ochs]] in his album ''[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]''.
*In 1976, rock singer and [[Fleetwood Mac]] vocalist [[Stevie Nicks]] wrote a song called "The Highwayman" that draws inspiration from the poem. The song was recorded and included in her 1981 solo album ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''. 
*In 1979, [[John Otway]] featured the poem set to music as the last track of his album ''[[Where Did I Go Right?]]''
*In 1981, [[Oxford University Press]] published an edition of the poem illustrated by [[Charles Keeping]] in black and white. He won the annual [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a [[British subject]].&lt;ref name="medal1981"&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=26 (Greenaway Winner 1981)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107093425/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=26 |date=2013-01-07 }}. Living Archive: Celebrating the Carnegie and Greenaway Winners. CILIP. Retrieved 2012-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1987, The poem was adapted as the story line of the video for the [[Fleetwood Mac]] song [[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|''Everywhere'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmyDosjjP5U|title=Fleetwood Mac - Everywhere (1987)|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1997, [[Loreena McKennitt]] set a shortened version of the poem to music and released the song on her album, ''[[The Book of Secrets]]''.
*In 2000, [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] released an adaptation of McKennitt's song on his album ''[[Way Out Yonder (album)|Way Out Yonder]]''.
*In 2004, singer/songwriter [[Don Partridge]] released an album entitled ''The Highwayman''&lt;ref&gt;The Highwayman, [[Don Partridge]], Longman Records (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; of which the title track was based upon the Alfred Noyes poem.
*The Scottish children's author [[Nicola Morgan]] used the poem as the background for her historical novels, ''The Highwayman's Footsteps'' and ''The Highwayman's Curse''.
*In 2019, A New Musical by [https://www.gregmosse.com Greg Mosse] and John Gleadall was performed by [https://dynamoyouththeatre.com/the-highwayman/ Havant Dynamo Youth Theatre]

'''''The Inheritance of Loss''''' is the second [[novel]] by [[India]]n author [[Kiran Desai]]. It was first published in [[2006 in literature|2006]]. It won a number of awards, including the [[Man Booker Prize]] for that year, the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Fiction Award in 2007,&lt;ref name="national-win" /&gt; and the 2006 [[Vodafone Crossword Book Award]].

It was written over a period of seven years after her first book, the critically acclaimed ''[[Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard]].''&lt;ref name="booker-win" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jabberwock" /&gt; Among its main themes are migration, living between two worlds, and between past and present.

== Summary ==
The story is centered on two main characters: Biju and Sai. Biju is an undocumented Indian immigrant living in the [[United States]], son of a cook who works for Sai's grandfather. Sai is a girl living in mountainous [[Kalimpong]] with her maternal grandfather Jemubhai, the cook and a dog named Mutt. Desai switches the narration between both points of view.  The action of the novel takes place in 1986.

The novel follows the journey of Biju, an undocumented immigrant in the US who is trying to make a new life; and Sai, an Anglicised Indian girl living with her grandfather in India. The novel shows the internal conflicts in India between groups, whilst showing a conflict between past and present. There is the rejection and yet awe of the English way of life, the opportunities for money in the US, and the squalor of living in India. Many leading Indians were considered to be becoming too English and having forgotten the traditional ways of Indian life, shown through the character of the grandfather, the retired Judge.

The major theme running throughout is one closely related to [[colonialism]] and the effects of [[post-colonialism]]: the loss of identity and the way it travels through generations as a sense of loss. Individuals within the text show snobbery at those who embody the Indian way of life and vice versa, with characters displaying an anger at the English Indians who have lost their traditions.

The [[Gorkhaland]] movement is used as a historic backdrop of the novel.

The retired judge Jemubhai Patel is a man disgusted at Indian ways and customs, so much so, that he eats [[chapati]]s with a knife and fork, hates all Indians including his father whom he breaks ties with and wife who he abandons at his father's place after torturing her, and is never accepted by the British in spite of his education and adopted mannerisms.

==Reception==
[[Natasha Walter]] found it a "grim" novel, highlighting "how individuals are always failing to communicate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walter|first1=Natasha|title=Mutt and the maths tutor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview17|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Observer'' found some excellent comic set-pieces amid the grimness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Sarah|title=Uncle Potty and other guides to the truth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/03/fiction.features1|work=The Observer|date=3 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' claimed Desai "manages to explore, with intimacy and insight, just about every contemporary international issue: globalization, multiculturalism, economic inequality, fundamentalism and terrorist violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wounded by the West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/wounded-by-the-west.html|work=New York Times|date=12 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macau''' is a special administrative district (SAR) located to the southeast of mainland China. Since Macau is using the “[[One_country,_two_systems|one country two systems]]” principle just like Hong Kong, acting as a special region of China, it gained many benefits from the principle. The population in Macau is approximately 582,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=about macau|url=http://www.macautourism.gov.mo/en/info/info.php|publisher=Macau government tourist office|accessdate=2 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402193015/http://www.macautourism.gov.mo/en/info/info.php|archivedate=2 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is a major industry in Macau. It is famous for the blend of [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Culture of China|Chinese]] cultures and its [[Gambling in Macau|gambling industry]], which includes [[Casino Lisboa, Macau]], [[Sands Macau]], [[The Venetian Macao]], and [[Wynn Macau]]. There are many choices of hotels and resorts since it is one of the world class tourism industry in Asia.

[[File:Zusammengelegte Handtücher.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A stack of colored towels]]
A '''towel''' is a piece of [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] [[cloth|fabric]] or [[paper]] used for drying or wiping a body or a surface. It draws [[moisture]] through direct contact, often using a blotting or a rubbing motion. 

In households, several types of fabric towels are used, including hand towels, bath towels and kitchen towels. In warm climates, people may also use beach towels. Paper towels are provided in commercial or office bathrooms for users to dry their hands. Paper towels are also used in households for a range of wiping, cleaning and drying tasks.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bath-towel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Middle Ages]] archaeological studies, "... closely held personal items included the ever present knife and a towel."&lt;ref&gt;Hatcler, Margret. ''Family Ties that Bind, Middle Ages Family Life''. Oxford University Press, 1968, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the invention of the towel is commonly associated with the city of [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]], in the 17th century. These Turkish towels began as a flat, woven piece of cotton or linen called a ''[[Peshtamal|pestamel]]'', often hand-embroidered. Long enough to wrap around the body, pestamel were originally fairly narrow, but are now wider and commonly measure {{convert|90|x|170|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=JH&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Towel|url=http://www.jennifershamam.com/education/history-of-the-towel.html|website=Jeniffer's Hamam|accessdate=28 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003955/http://www.jennifershamam.com/education/history-of-the-towel.html|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pestamel were used in [[Turkish baths]] as they stayed light when wet and were very absorbent.  

As the [[Ottoman Empire]] grew, so did the use of the towel. Weavers were asked to embroider more elaborate designs, aided by their knowledge of carpet-weaving.&lt;ref name=TFY&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Turkish Towels|url=http://www.turkeyforyou.com/turkey_turkish_towels_history|website=Turkey For You|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, towels began to feature loops sticking up from the pile of the material. These looped  towels became known as ''havly''; over time, this word has changed to ''havlu'', the Turkish word for towel, and means ‘with loops’.&lt;ref name=LidT&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History Of Towels|url=http://www.lidtime.com/a-brief-history-of-towels/|website=Lid Time|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Towels didn't become affordable until the 19th century, with the cotton trade and industrialization. With mechanization, cotton terry-towelling became available by the yard as well as being stocked in shops as pre-made towels.&lt;ref name=Made&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath Towel|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Bath-Towel.html|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today towels are available in a variety of sizes, materials and designs. Some hotels which provide towels and bath robes embed washable [[RFID]] tags into their linens to deter theft.&lt;ref name=RFIDwash&gt;{{cite news |agency= PopSci|authorlink= Associated Press|title= New Washable RFID Chips Track Hotel Towels and Bathrobes |url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-04/new-washable-rfid-chips-track-hotel-towels-and-bathrobes |work= |publisher= [[PopSci]]|date= 2008-02-28|accessdate=2011-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fouta bohemeria.JPG|thumb|Tunisian fouta towel]]
* A ''[[bathtub|bath]] towel'' is used for drying the body when it is wet, such as after bathing or showering.  It is typically rectangular, with a typical size around {{convert|30|x|60|in|cm|abbr=on}}, and is made of [[terry cloth]].
* A ''beach towel'' is usually a little bit larger than a bath towel.  Although it is often used for drying off after being in the water, its chief purpose is to provide a surface on which to lie.  They are also worn for privacy while changing clothes in a public area, and for wiping sand from the body or objects.  Beach towels often have colorful patterns.
* A [[foot towel]] is a small, rectangular towel which, in the absence of a rug, carpet or bathroom mat, is placed on the bathroom floor to stand on after finishing a shower or bath.
* A ''[[hand towel]]'' is significantly smaller than a bath towel (perhaps {{convert|12|x|24|in|cm|abbr=on}}), and is used for drying the hands after washing them.
* An ''oven towel'' or ''confectioner's mitten'' is a multipurpose household towel used for a kitchen or shop applications. The term came into use within Irish communities after a textile mogul, Owen Valley, created the line based on his own towel experiences.
* A ''[[paper towel]]'' is a piece of paper that can be used once as a towel and then be disposed of. A perforated roll of paper towels is normally mounted on a rod a little longer than the width of the roll, or in an alternative type of hanger that has protrusions on ears, the protrusions fitting into the ends of the paper towel roll.  Paper towels can also be found packaged like [[Facial tissue|facial tissues]], as individual folded sheets.
* A ''[[disposable towel]]'' (or non-woven towel) is a towel intended for a single user, but not necessarily for a single use, as it can be reused but not washed. It is often made of non-woven fibers, and popular for the hospital, hotel, geriatric and salon or beauty industries because it guarantees cleanliness and hygiene every time.
* A ''show towel'' is a bath or hand towel that has had trim—such as satin, lace or linen stitched onto it, or embroidery done on it—mainly to simply "look nice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/iadpenn/iadpenn-15112.0.html |title=The (American) National Gallery of Art |quote=Like elaborately decorated pottery and Jacquard coverlets, "show towels" were made primarily for display rather than for use. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609092538/http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/iadpenn/iadpenn-15112.0.html |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used to add a decorative touch—usually to a bathroom—most commonly in the United States. They are generally not to be used to for drying, as regular washing ruins the added trim, and the towel buckles as well (because the towel usually shrinks differently than the trim).
* A ''sports towel'', or (synthetic) [[Chamois leather|chamois]], is a towel originally developed for swimmers and divers, favored for its super-absorbent qualities.  Sports towels can be wrung out when saturated, leaving the towel able to absorb water again, although not dry.  Those qualities, along with their compact nature, have further popularized sports towels amongst general outdoor and athletic enthusiasts.  The absorbent material in sports towels may be composed of [[viscose]], [[Polyvinyl alcohol|PVA]] or [[microfiber]], with [[polyester]] woven in for durability.  Some manufacturers incorporate a [[Medical uses of silver#Mechanism of action|silver ion or compound treatment]] into their towels to better inhibit microbial growth and associated odors.{{cn|date=April 2015}}
* A ''sweat towel'' or ''gym towel'', often of similar size to a hand towel, is used during a workout to dry oneself from sweat or make a barrier between the gym machines and the skin. It can also be required in gyms in order to wipe down the machines after use{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.
* The term ''[[kitchen towel]]'' can refer to either a dish towel or to a paper towel, the latter usage being primarily British.
* A ''[[dishcloth]]'' (also known in British English as ''tea towel'' or ''drying-up cloth'' or in American English as a ''dish towel'') is a cloth which is used to dry dishes, cutlery, etc., after they have been washed. In 18th century England, a tea towel was a special linen drying cloth used by the mistress of the house to dry her precious and expensive china tea things. Servants were considered too ham-fisted to be trusted with such a delicate job, although housemaids were charged with hand-hemming the woven linen when their main duties were completed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Tea towels have been mass-produced since the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* {{anchor|Washcloth}}A ''flannel'', ''wash cloth'', ''washcloth'', ''wash rag'', ''face-washer ''(Australian)'' ''or ''face cloth'' is a small square about the width of a hand towel, and is used by wetting, applying soap to the towel, and then using the towel to apply the soap to skin. This increases abrasion, and can remove dead skin cells from the skin more effectively than just manual application and rubbing of soap. In some parts of the world, [[washing mitt]]s are used for this purpose.
* A ''wet towel'' ([[oshibori]]) is used in Japan to clean the hands before eating. It is often given to customers of an [[izakaya]].
*{{anchor|cloth towel dispenser|cloth roll towel dispenser}}A ''cloth towel dispenser'' or ''continuous cloth towel'' is a towel manipulated by a series of rollers, used as an alternative to paper towels and [[hand dryers]] in public [[washroom]]s. These may have a lower environmental impact than paper towels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celsias.com/actions/214/ Celsias] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118235130/http://www.celsias.com/actions/214/ |date=2013-01-18 }} Retrieved on 31 Oct 09&lt;/ref&gt; though concerns over hygiene mean they are not used by some organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communications.uwo.ca/com/western_news/opinions/cloth_towels_health_risk_20041124436373/ |title=Western News |publisher=Communications.uwo.ca |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have greatly declined in popularity. They can also be used in dangerous "choking games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D Le, A J Macnab |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/3/231.abstract |title=Self strangulation by hanging from cloth towel dispensers in Canadian schools |publisher=Injuryprevention.bmj.com |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''sanitary towel'' or [[sanitary napkin]] is an absorbent item worn by a person while they are menstruating.

In 2012, '''UTA Brand Studio''' was unveiled as the brand strategy division of [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA), one of the world’s largest literary and talent agencies. The studio is based in UTA’s Beverly Hills, CA headquarters.

[[Laurence Vincent]] and Michellene DeBonis are UTA Brand Studio co-founders. Vincent’s 20-year career in branding has included roles with [[Siegel + Gale]] and Octagon, Inc., for such clients as Disney, MasterCard, Microsoft, the NFL, PlayStation and Qualcomm. DeBonis also brings 20 years of brand experience including work for Bare Minerals, Panasonic, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Operation Smile and Susan G. Komen. Other UTA Brand Studio team members include Creative Director R. Marcus Bartlett—who joined the team from Futurebrand where he won a Clio Award for his work with American Airlines—and Director of Client Engagement Catherine Davie.

Vincent has written two brand strategy books. In March 2012, ''Brand Real'' was released, focusing on the strategic behavior that drives the success of the world’s leading brands. ''Brand Real'' was recognized by strategy+business magazine as one of the best business books of 2012. In 2001, ''Legendary Brands'' was released, examining the storytelling potential of brands and implications for strategic and creative development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140108005857/en/UTA-Brand-Studio-Launches-First-Ever-Brand-Dependence%E2%84%A2 |title=UTA Brand Studio Launches First-Ever Brand Dependence™ Index as Key Predictor of a Brand’s Influence and Potential |publisher=Business Wire |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brand Attachment Research==
In January 2014, a new quantitative research tool measuring brand attachment was launched by UTA Brand Studio. Brand Dependence™ is described as a tool to measure the personal connection consumers have to a brand and the degree to which they see a brand as being part of who they are. Developed in an exclusive partnership with uSamp and UTA Brand Studio, Brand Dependence™ is built upon the pioneering academic research on brand attachment of Deborah MacInnis, Vice Dean and Professor at [[USC Marshall School of Business]] and C. Whan Park Professor of Marketing at USC Marshall School of Business.

At CES 2014, the UTA Brand Studio announced the inaugural Brand Dependence™ index focusing on technology brands. Social media brands were examined in the second installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Champagne |first=Christine |url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027398/a-new-survey-reveals-which-social-media-brands-people-are-most-attached-to |title=A New Survey Reveals Which Social Media Brands People Are Most Attached To &amp;#124; Co.Create &amp;#124; creativity + culture + commerce |publisher=Fastcocreate.com |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of UTA Brand Studio’s clients include The Elizabeth Taylor Trust, Bare Minerals, Mattel and the Consumer Electronics Association. In 2014, the studio was named a winner of the CLIO Image Awards Shortlist in the Design category on behalf of client The Elizabeth Taylor Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clioimage.com/winners/2014/design/entry.cfm?entryid=801410450 |title=CLIO Image Awards 2014 &amp;#124; Winners : Design - Elizabeth Taylor / |publisher=Clioimage.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the media outlets that have featured Larry Vincent include [[Forbes]], [[Digiday]] and Ragan.com. Vincent has presented to such groups as CES, SXSW, The Conference Board, CMO Collective, and Digital Hollywood, among others. In April 2014, UTA Brand Studio in conjunction with Live Talks LA hosted Twitter co-founder and Jelly CEO Biz Stone in conversation with Vincent about Stone’s new book THINGS A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME: CONF Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livetalksla.org/blog/2014/02/16/april-9-biz-stone-co-founder-twitter/ |title=April 9 — Biz Stone, Co-founder, Twitter &amp;#124; Live Talks Los Angeles |publisher=Livetalksla.org |date=2014-04-09 |accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LocationFrance.svg|thumb|The rumour started in [[France]] and quickly spread across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa]]

The '''Villejuif leaflet''', also known as the '''Villejuif flyer''' and the '''Villejuif list''', was a [[pamphlet]] which enjoyed wide distribution. The leaflet listed a number of safe [[food additive]]s with their [[E number]]s as alleged [[carcinogen]]s. The leaflet caused [[Mass hysteria|mass panic]] in [[Europe]] in the late 1970s and 1980s. One of the entries on the list was [[citric acid]] (E330).

Its name derives from its false claim to have been produced at the hospital in [[Villejuif]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==History==
The earliest known sighting of the leaflet was in February 1976, in the form of a single typewritten page in [[France]]. Homemade copies were spread across Europe for a decade in the form of a leaflet or flyer pamphlet that was distributed between friends and apart from citric acid included 16 other chemicals in a list of substances that it called dangerous toxins and carcinogens.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rumour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mass Poisoning Rumor in Europe|author=J. N. Kapferer|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=53|issue=4|date=Winter 1989|pages=467–481|publisher=Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Association for Public Opinion Research|jstor=2749354|doi=10.1086/269167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original author of the typewritten list was never found, and the leaflet affected about 7 million people in its uncontrollable propagation.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; In a survey of 150 housewives, 19% said they have stopped buying these brands, and 69% planned to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pratkanis, Elliot Aronson, ''Age of propaganda: the everyday use and abuse of persuasion'', Mcmillan, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8050-7403-1}}, pages 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

==List contents==

Multiple versions of this leaflet circulated, the exact set of suspect and dangerous substances differing from version to version. The following substances have been included on at least one such leaflet:&lt;ref name="leaflet1"&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tract_de_Villejuif_1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leaflet2"&gt;http://penserclasser.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/capture-d_c3a9cran-2011-02-21-c3a0-16-26-50.png&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
This phenomenon became the subject of academic [[empirical research]] by [[J. N. Kapferer]], president of the [[Foundation for the Study and Information on Rumors]] (an organisation in [[Paris]], France) and professor of communication at [[HEC Paris|L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales and l'Institut Supérieur des Affaires]] (a [[university]] in France) because of its persistence contrary to all official denials about the safety of citric acid and its wide distribution, as about half of all French housewives had been exposed to it.&lt;ref name="rumour"/&gt;  The resulting [[scientific paper]] was published in 1989 in the 53rd volume of the ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', a journal associated with the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]] and published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] (now published by the [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;ref name="rumour"/&gt;).

According to a 1990 book also written by [[Jean-Noël Kapferer]], the leaflet drew the attention of [[expert]]s, who immediately recognised its dubious nature.  The leaflet  wrongly listed E330, citric acid, as the most dangerous of all carcinogens.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b0VYBLUC7Z0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=The+VILLEJUIF+Hospital+list+e330|title=Rumors: uses, interpretations, and images|author=Jean-Noël Kapferer|page=35|year=1990|isbn=0-88738-325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==
The rumour, considered one of the most important experienced&lt;!--the d spelling is correct: it is one of the most important rumours experienced in the French society, not a rumours which is one of the most important experiences in the French society--&gt; in the French society, spread via a translated leaflet in [[Great Britain]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="rumour"/&gt;

[[Journalist]]s working for [[newspaper]]s distributed the list of alleged carcinogens verbatim; even a 1984 book written by a medical [[Physician|doctor]] aiming at informing the general public about the dangers of [[cancer]] included the substances in the flyer in a list of carcinogens, without checking the flyer's accuracy.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==False connection with the hospital of Villejuif==
It was reproduced many times by many individuals as friends sought to inform other friends of the harmful chemicals in their food, and in the course of uncontrolled copying a version of the leaflet included the name of the [[Villejuif Hospital]], making victims to the rumour believe that the list was authorised by it.  Even though the hospital (as [[Institut Gustave Roussy|Gustave-Roussy Institute]]) denied any association, it was unable to stop the further dissemination of the flyer, which went on from hand to hand until at least 1986 and was passed to [[elementary school]]s, organisations, and even various [[hospital]]s, while [[medical school]]s and [[pharmacy school]]s also fell victim to the list because of its (unauthorised and untrue) reference to the well-known hospital of Villejuif.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

==Possible explanations==
Citric acid is important for a chemical process named [[Krebs cycle]], but ''Krebs'' means [[cancer]] in [[German language|German]], and it has been suggested that this linguistic confusion may have been responsible for false claims that citric acid is carcinogenic.&lt;ref name="ukfood"&gt;[http://www.ukfoodguide.net/e330.htm E330 Citric acid]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:
* [[WARC Software Development Kit]] (WSDK) represents a set of simple, compact, and highly optimized Erlang modules to manipulate (create/read/write) the [[Web ARChive|WARC]] ISO 28500:2009 file format.

"'''Whale Whores'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 192nd overall episode of the series, it aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 28, 2009. In the episode, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] joins an anti-whaling crew in order to save dolphins and whales from [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whalers]].

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA LV]] in the United States. "Whale Whores" addressed the topic of Japanese whaling, condemning both the whalers themselves and the activists who fight against them. The episode is particularly critical of the reality television series ''[[Whale Wars]]'' and its star [[Paul Watson]], an environmental activist who is prominently featured in "Whale Whores".

In a response to the episode, Paul Watson said he was not offended by the portrayal, and was glad the show brought the issue of illegal whaling to a large audience. The episode also featured references to the show ''[[Deadliest Catch]]'' and a rendition of the [[Lady Gaga]] song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" sung by [[Eric Cartman]] on the game ''[[Rock Band]]''. A downloadable version of the song was released for the game in March. "Whale Whores" was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]] along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010. The episode was nominated for a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]], but lost to the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Dog Gone]]".

== Plot ==
The [[List of South Park families#The Marshes|Marsh family]] is spending [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s ninth birthday at a public aquarium in [[Denver]]. As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] armed with spears suddenly storm the [[dolphinarium]] and kill all the dolphins. The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums, and at an [[National Football League|NFL]] game, where they kill members of the [[Miami Dolphins]] football team. Stan asks his friends [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese. Kyle declines, feeling they can't change Japan's views on the issue, while Cartman and Kenny are much more interested in playing the video game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'', professing they "don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales". Eventually, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] (who is also too busy) informs Stan about the television show ''[[Whale Wars]]'', stating that they can take volunteers to help them. Seeing this as his chance, Stan takes Butters' advice and joins host [[Paul Watson]] and his crew aboard the ''Sea Shepherd'', but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing [[Butyric acid|"stinky butter"]] at Japanese whalers in an effort to deter them. After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon, Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a flare gun. Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods. The crew ends up getting interviewed by [[Larry King]], who describes Paul Watson as an "incompetent media whore" and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence. Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales, not ratings.

Wanting to be on television, Cartman and Kenny join the ship's crew under false pretenses of wanting to save the whales (especially, in fact, since they are more interested in the fame and fortune). After a brief run-in with [[Sig Hansen|Captain Sig Hansen]] and his crew from the show ''[[Deadliest Catch]]'', Japanese pilots launch [[kamikaze]] attacks on the ''Sea Shepherd''. The suicidal planes kill the ''Whale Wars'' crew except for Stan, Cartman and Kenny. The trio are captured and brought to Japan, where [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]] tells them retaliation for the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] is the primary motive for Japan's whaling efforts, with Cartman finding the whole nuclear drop and mass devastation hilarious. He shows them a doctored photograph—given to Japan by the United States after the bombing—of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' piloted by a dolphin and a [[killer whale]]. According to him, Japan was so grateful the Americans gave the Japanese these photos they declared peace. Knowing the picture is a fake, Stan decides to reveal the truth about the bombing, but Cartman reminds him that the Japanese seek to drive the entire species of the perpetrators to extinction. Claiming the U.S. government has authorized him to show the "original" photo, Stan presents the Emperor, Prime Minister [[Yukio Hatoyama]], and other Japanese officials with a new doctored photo showing a [[cow]] and [[chicken]] in the ''Enola Gay'' (created by Kyle, who Stan managed to phone beforehand). The Japanese become infuriated, now believing cows and chickens had modified the original photo to frame the innocent whales and dolphins. The Japanese agree to cease their whaling efforts and start slaughtering cows and chickens, storming farms full of the animals. The episode ends as Randy congratulates Stan for making the Japanese "normal, like us".

==Theme==
[[File:Paul Watson portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Watson]] ''(pictured)'', environmental activist and star of the reality series ''[[Whale Wars]]'', is parodied in "Whale Whores".|alt=A heavyset man with white hair and a white beard, standing in front of a boat with the words "Shepherd" written on it in yellow paint]] 
"Whale Whores" addresses the controversies surrounding [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]], which had been a subject of considerable media attention around the time the ''South Park'' episode first aired. The episode condemns all sides involved in the matter, including the Japanese whalers themselves and the activists who fight against them.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Murphy |first=Dan |title=South Park puts spotlight on Paul Watson and his "Whale Wars" |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=October 29, 2009 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1029/south-park-puts-spotlight-on-paul-watson-and-his-whale-wars |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi"&gt;{{Cite news |last=d'Estries |first=Michael |title=South Park "Whale Whores" Manages To Hilariously Offend Everyone Equally |date=October 29, 2009 |work=ecorazzi |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/10/29/south-park-whale-whores-manages-to-hilariously-offend-everyone-equally/ |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv" /&gt; By having the Japanese attack the dolphins at the Denver Aquarium in the middle of a dolphin riding demonstration, it has been suggested the episode highlights the link between visiting dolphins at marine parks and the reality of how aquatic wildlife are captured and slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park Whale Whores |publisher=GreenMuze |date=October 27, 2009 |url=http://www.greenmuze.com/animals/wild/1727-south-park-whale-whores.html |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the final scene, the show also draws parallel between Japanese whaling industry and generally accepted meat and poultry industries.

However, the episode prominently features and mocks animal rights and environmental activist Paul Watson and his [[Animal Planet]] reality series, ''Whale Wars''. Watson has received wide criticism for his method of disrupting whale hunts by at times attacking and sinking Japanese and [[Norway|Norwegian]] whaling ships. "Whale Whores" presents Watson and his show in a way that mocks his attempts to garner media attention by simply lying rather than doing anything productive.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?l=e&amp;country=0&amp;special=&amp;monthyear=&amp;day=&amp;id=34388&amp;ndb=1&amp;df=0|title=Whaling, comedy and eco-terrorism|last=Loubet|first=Michel|date=October 30, 2009|work=[[Fish Information and Services]]|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode mocks ''Whale Wars'' and its attempts to present mundane ship-board activities as dramatic television. This is particularly illustrated in newspaper headlines after Stan takes over Watson's ship: "New Captain Turns Vegan Pussies Into Real Pirates" and "Whale Wars Gets Better: Things Actually Happen!"&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt; Watson himself is also portrayed in a physically unflattering way, with his stomach too fat to be entirely covered by his shirt.&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt; "Whale Whores" also refers to the criticisms that Watson bends the truth in order to further his popularity. This is particularly reflected through the fictional interview with Larry King, who calls Watson "an unorganized, incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause".&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIS" /&gt; The fact that ''Whale Wars'' gets better ratings after Stan takes over and employs more violent tactics is a satire of the tendency in ''Whale Wars'', and television in general, to exploit violence for money and viewership.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt;

== Cultural references ==
The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] are identified as the cause of Japanese whaling. The two Japanese cities were destroyed by [[atomic weapons]] during the final stages of [[World War II]] under orders by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry Truman]], which killed about 220,000 people. In "Whale Whores", the Japanese are presented with a doctored picture of the ''Enola Gay'', the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress bomber]] that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The picture shows a dolphin and a whale piloting the plane to bomb the city.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt; The Miami Dolphins, a [[National Football League]] professional football team, are killed along with real dolphins by the whalers in "Whale Whores".&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt; Near the end of the episode, Stan and the crew of the [[MY Steve Irwin]] encounter fishing ship captain [[Sig Hansen]] and his crew from the [[Discovery Channel]] reality series, ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''.&lt;ref name="Ecorazzi" /&gt; The scene with Paul Watson's crew throwing "stinky butter" at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew's practice of throwing stink bombs containing [[butyric acid]], an acid found in rancid butter and cheese, at Japanese whaling vessels, including the factory vessel, the ''[[Nisshin Maru]]''.&lt;ref name="FIS" /&gt;

An ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine cover is shown with the headline, "We’re STILL Remembering Michael Jackson", a reference to the extremely large amount of media coverage surrounding the [[Death of Michael Jackson|then-recent death]] of pop singer [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; During one scene, Stan frightens off a group of Japanese whalers by uncovering a large statue of [[Godzilla]], the famous Japanese movie monster.&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; During the episode Kyle, Kenny and Cartman are shown performing [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" on the video game ''[[Rock Band]]''.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; On March 16, 2010, ''Rock Band'' developer [[Harmonix]] released this version of the song (along with the original version) as downloadable content for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Frushtick |first=Russ |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/03/09/lady-gaga-finally-coming-to-rock-band/ |title=Lady Gaga Finally Coming To 'Rock Band' | work=[[MTV News]] |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3552140#post3552140 |title=Lady GaGa Hits Rock Band| publisher=[[Harmonix Music Systems]] |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
"Whale Whores" was controversial and received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the criticism of the save-the-whales conservationists as a "delightfully savage ridicule".&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news | title = "South Park" and "Whale Whores": Lady Gaga and Entertainment Weekly harpooned, er, lampooned | url = http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/10/29/south-park-and-whale-whores-lady-gaga/ | first = Ken | last = Tucker | date = October 29, 2009 | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''  | accessdate = 2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jacks of ''[[MTV]]'' complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at ''South Park'' to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together."&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news | title = "South Park" Takes On Lady Gaga's "Poker Face"| url = http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/10/29/south-park-lady-gaga/ | first = Brian | last = Jacks | date = October 29, 2009 | work = [[MTV]] | accessdate = January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'s}} said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was "culturally insignificant" and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off [[South Park]]'s creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat me over the head with information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?"&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news | title = South Park: Whale Whores | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/whale-whores,34726/ | first = Josh | last = Modell | date = October 29, 2009 | work = ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' | publisher = [[The Onion]] | accessdate = January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' called "Whale Whores" an entertaining episode, but said the episode could have provided more meaningful satire and did not explain the whaling issue very well, especially considering the show's target audience was probably unfamiliar with it. Isler praised some of the individual jokes revolving around the Japanese attacks, and called Cartman's "Poker Face" rendition a classic ''South Park'' moment, but dismissed the ''Enola Gay'' twist as "stupid".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |title=South Park: "Whale Whores" Review |date=October 29, 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1040366p1.html |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Delgado of ''iF Magazine'' said "''South Park'' swung and missed" with "Whale Whores". Delgado said many of the jokes were random and "weird", particularly the ''Enola Gay'' twist and the Japanese kamikaze attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park – Season 13 – "Whale Whores" |work=iF Magazine |date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Watson said he was not offended by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad "Whale Whores" brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful ''Whale Wars'' and the Sea Shepherd has been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-091103-1.html Fears, Jeers, Cheers, and Loathing for Sea Shepherd In South Park], Editorial by Captain Paul Watson on SeaShepherd.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2010, "Whale Whores" was nominated for a [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]] in the television comedy category. The Genesis Awards pay tribute to news and entertainment media for outstanding work that raise public understanding of animal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Up' among Genesis Award nominees|date=February 17, 2010|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Kilday |first=Gregg}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Whale Whores" ultimately lost to the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Dog Gone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307122122/http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html|archivedate=March 7, 2012 |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/nominees.html|publisher=[[Humane Society]]|title=Nominees for the Genesis Awards|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bullying in academia''' is a form of [[workplace bullying]] which takes places in the institutions of [[higher education]], such as [[college]]s and [[universities]]. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as [[bullying]] in some other contexts.&lt;ref name="keashlyarticle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keashly |first1=Loraleigh |last2=Neuman |first2=Joel H. |title=Faculty Experiences with Bullying in Higher Education: Causes, Consequences, and Management |journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis |date=2010 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=48-70 |doi=10.2753/ATP1084-1806320103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academia is highly competitive and has a well defined hierarchy, with junior staff being particularly vulnerable. Although most universities have policies on workplace bullying, individual campuses develop and implement their own protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We need a bigger conversation about bullying in academia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/26/we-need-a-bigger-conversation-about-bullying-in-academia |website=The Guardian |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often leaves victims with no recourse. 

Academic mobbing is a sophisticated form of bullying where academicians gang up to diminish the intended victim through intimidation, unjustified accusations, humiliation, and general harassment. These behaviors are often invisible to others and difficult to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Academic Mobbing: Hidden Health Hazard at Workplace |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170397/ |website=NCBI |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of academic mobbing may suffer from stress, depression and suicidal thoughts, as well as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

==Workplace bullying ==
{{main|Bullying|Workplace bullying}}
Bullying is the longstanding violence, physical or psychological, conducted by an individual or group and directed against an individual who is not able to defend himself in the actual situation, with a conscious desire to hurt, threaten, or frighten that individual or put him under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson |first=David |last2= Arora |first2=Tiny|last3=Sharp |first3=Sonia |date=2002 |title=Bullying: Effective strategies for long-term improvement}} (Summaries [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED471990 at Eric], [https://www.questia.com/library/108047844/bullying-effective-strategies-for-long-term-improvement at Questia], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1555882?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents at Jstor])&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace bullying ranges into the following categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rigby |first=Ken |date=2002 |title=New Perspectives on Bullying|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781853028724|oclc=875667926}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Threat to professional status, such as, public professional humiliation, accusation of lack of effort  and belittling.
* Threat to social status, such as, teasing and name calling. 
* Isolation, such as, withholding information and preventing access to opportunities, such as training workshops, attendance and deadlines.
* Overwork, such as setting impossible deadlines and making unnecessary disruptions.
* [[Destabilization]], for example, setting meaningless tasks, not giving credit where credit is due, removal from positions of authority.

== Bullying and academic culture ==
Several aspects of academia lend themselves to the practice and discourage its reporting and mitigation. Its leadership is usually drawn from the ranks of [[Faculty (university)|faculty]], most of whom have not received the management training that could enable an effective response to such situations.&lt;ref name="clute"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1072863|title=Bullying In Academe: Prevalent, Significant, and Incessant (2010 IABR &amp; ITLC Conference Proceedings )|publisher=The Clute Institute for Academic Research|author=Macgorine A. Cassell, [[Fairmont State University]]|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators may possess [[tenure]]—a high-status and protected position—or the victims may belong to the increasing number of [[adjunct professor]]s, who are often part-time employees.&lt;ref name="clute" /&gt;

Academic mobbing is the most prominent type of bullying in academia.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Academic victims of bullying may also be particularly conflict-averse.&lt;ref name="clute" /&gt;

The generally decentralized nature of academic institutions can make it difficult for victims to seek recourse, and appeals to outside authority have been described as "the kiss of death."&lt;ref name="guns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cant"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Cantwell|author2=Jill Scevak|title=An Academic Life: A Handbook for New Academics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iziJW_nAY7oC&amp;pg=PA168|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Australian Council for Educational Research|isbn=978-0-86431-908-1|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, academics who are subject to bullying in workplace are often cautious about reporting any problems. [[Social media]] has recently been used to expose or allege bullying in academia anonymously.&lt;ref name="PI-Reviews"&gt;{{citation |url=http://pi-reviews.blogspot.com/ |title=Reveal bullying in academia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bullying research credits an organizational rift in two interdependent and adversarial systems that comprise a larger structure of nearly all colleges and universities worldwide: faculty and administration. While both systems distribute employee power across standardized bureaucracies, administrations favor an ascription-oriented business model with a standardized criteria determining employee rank.

Faculty depend on greater open-ended and improvised standards that determine rank and job retention.  The leveraged intradepartmental peer reviews (although often at a later time, these three reviews are believed to be leveraged by the fact the peers determine promotions of one another at later times) of faculty for annual reappointment of tenure-track, tenure, and post-tenure review is believed to offer "unregulated gray area" that nurture the origin of bullying cases in academia. {{fact|date=November 2018}} Although tenure and post-tenure review lead to interdepartmental evaluation, and all three culminate in an administrative decision, bullying is commonly a function of administrative input before or during the early stages of intradepartmental review.

=== Mobbing ===
[[Kenneth Westhues]]' study of [[mobbing]] in academia found that [[vulnerability]] was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in a [[post-modern]] field such as music or literature; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Other factors included [[envy]], [[heresy]] and [[campus politics]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{citation |url=http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |title=Workplace Bullying in the Academic World? |date=13 May 2007 |publisher=Higher Education Development Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manifestations ==
The bullying in this workplace has been described as somewhat more subtle than usual.&lt;ref name="cant" /&gt; Its recipients may be the target of unwanted physical contact, violence, obscene or loud language during meetings, be disparaged among their colleagues in venues they are not aware of, and face difficulties when seeking promotion.&lt;ref name="cant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; It may also be manifested by undue demands for compliance with regulations.&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Workplace-Mediators-Seek-a-/65815/|title=Workplace Mediators Seek a Role in Taming Faculty Bullies|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A 2008 study of the topic, conducted on the basis of a survey at a Canadian university, concluded that the practice had several unproductive costs, including increased [[employee turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8662028u1vt556n/|title=Workplace Bullying In Academia: A Canadian Study|author=McKay, R. Arnold, D. H. Fratzl, J. Thomas, R.|accessdate=7 March 2011|doi=10.1007/s10672-008-9073-3|volume=20|journal=Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal|pages=77–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of academic mobbing may suffer from "stress, depression and suicidal thoughts" as well as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="clute" /&gt; The psychological scars have been described as potentially worse than with [[sexual harassment]], and they may not heal for many years.&lt;ref name="clute" /&gt;

== Incidence ==
In 2008 the United Kingdom's [[University and College Union]] released the results of a survey taken among its 9,700 members.&lt;ref name="inno"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Innovation|author2=Universities|author3=Science and Skills Committee|title=Students and universities: eleventh report of session 2008–09, Vol. 2: Oral and written evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDtmRVjshEUC&amp;pg=PA531|accessdate=8 March 2011|year=2009|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-54072-0|pages=531–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 51% of respondents said they had never been bullied, 16.7% that they had occasionally experienced it, and 6.7% that they were "always" or "often" subjected to bullying.&lt;ref name="inno" /&gt; The results varied by member institutions, with respondents from the [[University of East London]] reporting the highest incidence.&lt;ref name="inno" /&gt;

The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' commissioned a survey in 2005 and received 843 responses.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=198392&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Bullying rife across campus|publisher=[[Times Higher Education]]|author=Anthea Lipsett|date=16 September 2005|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40% reported they had been bullied, with 33% reporting "unwanted physical contact" and 10% reporting physical violence; about 75% reported they were aware that co-workers had been bullied.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The incidence rate found in this survey was higher than that usually found via internal polling (12 to 24 percent).&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

Author [[C. K. Gunsalus]] describes the problem as "low incidence, high severity", analogous to [[research misconduct]].&lt;ref name="guns"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. K. Gunsalus|title=The college administrator's survival guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqj3WPppDXcC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=30 September 2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02315-4|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; She identifies the aggressors' misuse of the concepts of [[academic freedom]] and [[collegiality]] as a commonly used strategy.&lt;ref name="guns" /&gt;

University bullying policies and processes are open to misuse, however, and the AAUP notes that faculty who dissent on academic governance issues or who complain about workplace inequities may become the target for retaliatory bullying complaints aimed to silence unpopular views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AAUP Collegiality Report |url=https://www.aaup.org/report/collegiality-criterion-faculty-evaluation |website=American Association of University Professors |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying of medical students ==
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
In a 2005 British study, around 35% of medical students reported having been bullied. Around one in four of the 1,000 students questioned said they had been bullied by a doctor, while one in six had been bullied by a nurse. Manifestations of bullying included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Polly|title=Medical students complain of bullying |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/may/04/highereducation.science |accessdate=9 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* being [[humiliated]] by teachers in front of patients
* been [[victimised]] for not having come from a "medical family"
* being put under pressure to carry out a procedure without supervision.
