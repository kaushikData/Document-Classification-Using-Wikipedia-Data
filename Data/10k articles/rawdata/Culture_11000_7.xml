'''''A Clockwork Orange''''' is a [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[Satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]] novel by English writer [[Anthony Burgess]], published in 1962. It is set in a near future English society featuring a subculture of extreme youth violence. The teenage protagonist, [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]], narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 March 1963|title=Books of The Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is partially written in a [[Russian language|Russian]]-influenced [[argot]] called "[[Nadsat]]", which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to '-teen' in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:A_Clockwork_Orange|title=Appendix:A Clockwork Orange - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burgess, it was a ''[[wikt:jeu d'esprit|jeu d'esprit]]'' written in just three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://litreactor.com/columns/book-vs-film-a-clockwork-orange |title=A Clockwork Orange - The book versus the Film |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

===Part 1: Alex's world===
[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] is a 15-year-old living in near-future dystopian England who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random "ultra-violence". Alex's friends ("droogs" in the novel's Anglo-Russian [[slang]], '[[Nadsat]]') are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Characterised as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] and hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for [[classical music]]; he is particularly fond of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], referred to as "Lovely Ludwig Van".

The [[novella]] begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the [[Korova Milk Bar]], and drinking "milk-plus" — a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice — to prepare for a night of mayhem. They [[assault]] a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. [[Joyride (crime)|Joyriding]] through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and [[rape|raping]] his wife. In a [[metafiction]]al touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called "''A Clockwork Orange''", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him [[orgasm]]ic bliss before falling asleep.

Alex coyly feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his "post-corrective adviser", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. The next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a "man-sized" job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie. Then, in a show of generosity, he takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious; but, when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.

===Part 2: The Ludovico Technique===
Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison. (His parents visit one day to inform him that Georgie has been killed in a botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels, playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's [[Bible]] studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental [[behaviour modification]] treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of [[aversion therapy]], in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an [[unintended consequence]], the soundtrack to one of the films, [[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]], renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.

The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of [[VIP]]s, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison.

===Part 3: After prison===
Alex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but they turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the [[gang rape]]. He does not recognise Alex but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.

Alex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. Placed in a [[mental institution]], Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, "I was cured all right."

In the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children could possibly end up being just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.

== Omission of the final chapter ==&lt;!--linked from 'A Clockwork Orange (film)'--&gt;
The book has three parts, each with seven chapters. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in [[Maturity (psychological)|human maturation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-clockwork-orange-anthony-burgess/|title=Burgess' Myopic Morality: Why Anthony Burgess' Infamous ''A Clockwork Orange'' is Stronger Without its Original Last Chapter|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=1 March 2016|website=The Gemsbok|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Clockwork Orange|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=ix-xv|chapter=Introduction: A Clockwork Orange Resucked}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a moment of [[Metanoia (psychology)|metanoia]]).

At the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex succumbing to his violent, reckless nature—an ending which the publisher insisted would be "more realistic" and appealing to a US audience. The film adaptation, directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be "badly flawed"). Kubrick called Chapter 21 "an extra chapter" and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html|title=Kubrick on ''A Clockwork Orange''|last=Ciment|first=Michel|year=1981|website=The Kubrick Site|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kubrick's opinion—as in the opinion of other readers, including the original American editor—the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Characters==
* '''[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]]''': The novel's  [[protagonist]] and leader among his droogs. He often refers to himself as "Your Humble Narrator". Having coaxed two ten-year-old girls into his bedroom, Alex refers to himself as "Alexander the Large" while raping them; this was later the basis for Alex's claimed surname ''DeLarge'' in the 1971 film.
* '''George''', '''Georgie''' or '''Georgie Boy''': Effectively Alex's greedy second-in-command. Georgie attempts to undermine Alex's status as leader of the gang and take over their gang as the new leader. He is later killed during a botched robbery while Alex is in prison.
*'''Pete''': The only one who does not take particular sides when the droogs fight among themselves. He later meets and marries a girl named Georgina, renouncing his violent ways and even losing his former ([[Nadsat]]) speech patterns. A chance encounter with Pete in the final chapter influences Alex to realise that he has grown bored with violence and recognise that human energy is better expended on creation than destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefloatinglibrary.com/2009/04/20/a-clockwork-orange-resucked/ A Clockwork Orange Resucked]. The Floating Library. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dim''': An idiotic and thoroughly [[wikt:gormless|gormless]] member of the gang, persistently condescended to by Alex, but respected to some extent by his droogs for his formidable fighting abilities, his weapon of choice being a length of bike chain. He later becomes a [[police officer]], exacting his revenge on Alex for the abuse he once suffered under his command.
* '''P. R. Deltoid''': A criminal rehabilitation [[social worker]] assigned the task of keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has no clue about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him.
* '''Prison Chaplain''': The character who first questions whether it is moral to turn a violent person into a behavioural automaton who can make no choice in such matters. This is the only character who is truly concerned about Alex's welfare; he is not taken seriously by Alex, though. He is nicknamed by Alex "prison charlie" or "chaplin", a pun on [[Charlie Chaplin]].
* '''Billyboy''': A rival of Alex's. Early on in the story, Alex and his droogs battle Billyboy and his droogs, which ends abruptly when the police arrive. Later, after Alex is released from prison, Billyboy (along with Dim, who like Billyboy has become a police officer) rescues Alex from a mob, then subsequently beats him in a location out of town.
* '''Prison Governor''': The man who decides to let Alex "choose" to be the first reformed by the Ludovico technique.
* '''The Minister of the Interior''': The government high-official who determined that the Ludovico's technique will be used to cut [[recidivism]]. He is referred to as ''the Inferior'' by Alex.
* '''Dr. Branom''': A scientist, co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He appears friendly and almost paternal towards Alex at first, before forcing him into the theatre and what Alex calls the "chair of torture".
* '''Dr. Brodsky''': Branom's colleague and co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He seems much more passive than Branom and says considerably less.
* '''F. Alexander''': An author who was in the process of typing his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]  ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his droogs broke into his house, beat him, tore up his work and then brutally gang-raped his wife, which caused her subsequent death. He is left deeply scarred by these events and when he encounters Alex two years later, he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the Ludovico technique unsound. He is given the name Frank Alexander in the film.
* '''Cat Woman''': An indirectly named woman who blocks Alex's gang's entrance scheme, and threatens to shoot Alex and set her [[cat]]s on him if he does not leave. After Alex breaks into her house, she fights with him, ordering her cats to join the melee, but reprimands Alex for fighting them off. She sustains a fatal blow to the head during the scuffle. She is given the name Miss Weathers in the film.

==Analysis==

===Background===
''A Clockwork Orange'' was written in [[Hove]], then a senescent [[seaside town]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite interview |last=Ahmed |first=Samira |subjectlink= |title=A Clockwork Orange - interview with Will Self |publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b01k9v1y|date=3 July 2012 |work=Nightwaves |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that much had changed. A youth culture had grown, including coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs.&lt;ref&gt;A Clockwork Orange ([[Penguin Modern Classics]]) (Paperback) by Anthony Burgess, Blake Morrison xv&lt;/ref&gt; England was gripped by fears over [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Burgess claimed that the novel's inspiration was his first wife Lynne's beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during [[World War II]]. She subsequently miscarried.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, A. ''A Clockwork Orange'', Penguin UK, 2011, introduction by Blake Morrison, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qUI8pbpCNJUC&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=Lynne page 17] : « his first wife, Lynne, was beaten, kicked and robbed in London by a gang of four GI deserters ».&lt;/ref&gt; In its investigation of free will, the book's target is ostensibly the concept of [[behaviourism]], pioneered by such figures as [[B. F. Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Clockwork Orange'' (Hardback) by Anthony Burgess, [[Will Self]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess later stated that he wrote the book in three weeks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Title&lt;!--linked from 'A Clockwork Orange (film)'--&gt;===
Burgess has offered several clarifications about the meaning and origin of its title:

* He had overheard the phrase "as queer as a clockwork orange" in a London pub in 1945 and assumed it was a [[Cockney]] expression. In ''Clockwork Marmalade'', an essay published in the ''[[The Listener (magazine)|Listener]]'' in 1972, he said that he had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from [[William K. Everson|William Everson]] on the television programme ''[[Camera Three]]'' in 1972, "Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase "as queer as a clockwork orange" is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined.

* In a prefatory note to ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music'', he wrote that the title was a metaphor for "an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable odour, being turned into a mechanism."&lt;ref name=dexter/&gt;
* In his essay ''Clockwork Oranges'', Burgess asserts that "this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Anthony|title=1985|date=2013|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781847658937|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=4dB-zMYQJR0C&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This title alludes to the protagonist's negative emotional responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his [[free will]] subsequent to the administration of the Ludovico Technique. To induce this conditioning, Alex is forced to watch scenes of violence on a screen that are [[Operant conditioning|systematically paired]] with negative physical stimulation. The negative physical stimulation takes the form of [[nausea]] and "feelings of terror," which are caused by an [[emesis|emetic]] medicine administered just before the presentation of the films.

===Use of slang===&lt;!--"Ultra-violence" redirects here, please update if renamed --&gt;
{{Main|Nadsat}}
The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called [[Nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words, [[rhyming slang]] and derived Russian (like ''baboochka''). For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: ''droog'' = friend; ''korova'' = cow; ''gulliver'' ("golova") = head; ''malchick'' or ''malchickiwick'' = boy; ''soomka'' = sack or bag; ''Bog'' = God; ''khorosho'' ("horrorshow") = good; ''prestoopnick'' = criminal; ''rooka'' ("rooker") = hand; ''cal'' = crap; ''veck'' ("chelloveck") = man or guy; ''litso'' = face; ''malenky'' = little; and so on. Some words Burgess invented himself or just adapted from pre-existing languages. Compare [[Polari]].

One of Alex's doctors explains the language to a colleague as "odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of [[Romani people|gypsy]] talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. [[Subliminal message|Subliminal]] penetration." Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. "in-out, in-out" or "the old in-out" means sexual intercourse. ''Cutter'', however, means "money", because "cutter" rhymes with "bread-and-butter"; this is [[rhyming slang]], which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like ''appypolly loggy'' ("apology") seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex's age of 15.

In the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle "the raw response of pornography" from the acts of violence.

The term {{anchor|Ultraviolence}}"ultraviolence", referring to excessive or unjustified [[violence]], was [[Neologism|coined]] by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase "do the ultra-violent". The term's association with [[Aestheticization of violence|aesthetic violence]] has led to its use in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=AFP |title=Gruesome 'Saw 4' slashes through North American box-office |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |id= |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116054923/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |archivedate=16 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A With 'Hostel' Director Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino - New York Magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/ |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080109171639/http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/| archivedate= 9 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ADV Announces New Gantz Collection, Final Guyver &amp; More: Nov 6 Releases |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases |accessdate=2008-01-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205150753/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases| archivedate= 5 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|title="Manhunt 2": Most Violent Game Yet?, Critics Say New Video Game Is Too Realistic; Players Must Torture, Kill|date=30 October 2007|work=|author=CBS News|accessdate=2008-01-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102153252/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml|archivedate=2 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning and censorship history in the US===
In 1976, ''A Clockwork Orange'' was removed from an [[Aurora, Colorado]] high school because of "objectionable language". A year later in 1977 it was removed from high school classrooms in [[Westport, Massachusetts]] over similar concerns with "objectionable" language. In 1982, it was removed from two [[Anniston, Alabama]] libraries, later to be reinstated on a restricted basis. Also, in 1973 a bookseller was arrested for selling the novel. The charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics |title=Banned &amp; Challenged Classics |date=26 March 2013 |publisher=[[American Library Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each of these instances came after the release of Stanley Kubrick's popular 1971 film adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'', itself the subject of much controversy.

==Reception==
===Initial response===
''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' review was positive, and described the book as "entertaining ... even profound".&lt;ref&gt;Chitty, Susan. "Is That the Lot?" Sunday Telegraph, 13 May 1962, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review was negative, and described the book as "a very ordinary, brutal and psychologically shallow story".&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Jeremy. "A Bedsitter in Dublin." Sunday Times, 13 May 1962, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' also reviewed the book negatively, describing it as "a somewhat clumsy experiment with science fiction [with] clumsy cliches about juvenile delinquency".&lt;ref name="New Fiction 1962, p. 16"&gt;"New Fiction." Times, 17 May 1962, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The violence was criticised as "unconvincing in detail".&lt;ref name="New Fiction 1962, p. 16"/&gt;

===Writer's appraisal===
[[File:Burgess1.jpg|right|thumb|Burgess in 1986]]

Burgess dismissed ''A Clockwork Orange'' as "too didactic to be artistic".&lt;ref&gt;''A Clockwork Orange'' (Penguin Modern Classics) (Paperback) by Anthony Burgess, Blake Morrison xxii&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the violent content of the novel "nauseated" him.&lt;ref&gt;Calder,, John Mackenzie, and Anthony Burgess,. "Ugh." The Times Literary Supplement, 2 Jan. 1964, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Burgess published ''Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence'' and while discussing ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with ''A Clockwork Orange'': "We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a ''jeu d'esprit'' knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''."&lt;ref&gt;''Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence'' (Heinemann, London 1985) Anthony Burgess, p 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The best known adaptation of the novella to other forms is the 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Stanley Kubrick]], starring [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Alex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=A Clockwork Orange (1971) 'A Clockwork Orange' Dazzles the Senses and Mind|authorlink=Vincent Canby|first=Vincent|last=Canby|date=20 December 1971|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9a02e1d61038ef34bc4851dfb467838a669ede}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1965 film by [[Andy Warhol]] entitled ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' was an adaptation of Burgess's novel.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1987 Burgess published a stage play titled ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music''. The play includes songs, written by Burgess, which are inspired by Beethoven and Nadsat slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Clockwork Orange on Stage|url=http://www.anthonyburgess.org/about-anthony-burgess/a-clockwork-orange-on-stage|website=anthonyburgess.org|publisher=International Anthony Burgess Foundation|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a German adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at the intimate theatre of [[Bad Godesberg]] featured a musical score by the German [[punk rock]] band [[Die Toten Hosen]] which, combined with orchestral clips of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and "other dirty melodies" (so stated by the subtitle), was released on the album ''[[Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau]]''. The track ''[[Hier kommt Alex]]'' became one of the band's signature songs.

(photo: Peter Zuehlke)]]
In February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. Titled ''A Clockwork Orange: 2004'', it received mostly negative reviews, with [[John Peter (critic)|John Peter]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London calling it "only an intellectual ''[[Rocky Horror Show]]''", and John Gross of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' calling it "a clockwork lemon". Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', he called the score, written by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]] of the rock group [[U2 (band)|U2]], "neo-wallpaper." Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of [[hip hop]], [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[gothic music]]. Lise Hand of ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' reported The Edge as saying that Burgess's original conception was "a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter". Calling it "meaningless glitz", Jane Edwardes of ''20/20 Magazine'' said that watching this production was "like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant – and being served with a [[Big Mac]]."

In 1994, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of ''A Clockwork Orange'' directed by [[Terry Kinney]].  The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess's own adaptation of his ''A Clockwork Orange'' starred [[K. Todd Freeman]] as Alex. In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the Canadian premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirateca.com/projects/unitheatre/default.aspx |title=Mirateca Arts |publisher=Mirateca.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at [[Manhattan Theatre Source]]. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] (2005). While at [[Edinburgh]], the production received rave reviews from the press while playing to sold-out audiences. The production was directed by Godlight's Artistic Director, Joe Tantalo.

In 2003, Los Angeles director [[Brad Mays]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bradmays.com/ |title=Brad Mays |publisher=Brad Mays |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ARK Theatre Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arktheatre.org/ |title=Ark Theatre |publisher=Ark Theatre |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; staged a [[multi-media]] adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradmays.com/clockwork.html |title=Production Photos from '&amp;#39;A Clockwork Orange,'&amp;#39; 2003, ARK Theatre Company, directed by Brad Mays |publisher=Bradmays.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/clockwork-orange-musical_n_904375.html?ir=Arts&amp;ref=fb&amp;src=sp |title='A Clockwork Orange' Songs To Be Performed For First Time In History |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 20 July 2011|accessdate=2011-11-28 |first=Lucas |last=Kavner}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was named "Pick Of The Week" by the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' and nominated for three of the 2004 [[LA Weekly Theater Award]]s: Direction, Revival Production (of a 20th-century work), and Leading Female Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A A A Comments |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2004-02-12/stage/the-25th-annual-la-weekly-theater-award-nominees/ |title=LA Weekly Theatre Awards Nominations '&amp;#39;A Clockwork Orange'&amp;#39; - nominations for "Best Revival Production," "Best Leading Female Performance," "Best Direction" |publisher=Laweekly.com |date=12 February 2004 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vanessa Claire Smith]] won Best Actress for her gender-bending portrayal of [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]], the music-loving teenage [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A A A Comments |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2004-04-29/stage/jack-black-goes-to-hollywood-high/ |title=LA Weekly Theatre Awards '&amp;#39;A Clockwork Orange'&amp;#39; - Vanessa Claire Smith wins for "Best Leading Female Performance" |publisher=Laweekly.com |date=29 April 2004 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This production utilised three separate video streams outputted to seven onstage video monitors – six 19-inch and one 40-inch.

There are various '''allegorical representations of Argentina''' or associated in any way with [[Argentina]]. There is not, however, a [[national personification]] with its own name, like [[Marianne]] from [[France]], or [[Allegory of Hispania|Hispania]] from [[Spain]], but sculptures and engravings representing [[liberty]], [[republic]], [[fatherland]] or other concepts that have been used officially by the Argentine state.

== Sculptures ==
Despite the absence of a character with fixed characteristics, the allegory of Argentina usually is a female figure dressed in robes and wearing a [[Phrygian cap]]. Figures such as these appear in dozens of engravings, reliefs, plaques, paintings, memorials and sculptures, such as the equestrians ones to General Urquiza, Bernardo de O'Higgins or Garibaldi, the "Monumento de los Españoles", to the Coast Guards, to Avellaneda (all in Buenos Aires) to San Martin (La Plata), Alberdi (Tucumán), to the  Army of the Andes in "Glory Hill" (Mendoza) or the ''Monument to the fallen soldiers in the Malvinas War'' of the city of [[Necochea]], to name just a few. It regularly appeared in official memorabilia for the Centenary celebrations, as well as a prominent decorative feature in state buildings and logos of government departments at the turn of the century.

=== May Pyramid ===
The [[May Pyramid]] was remodeled in 1856 under the artistic direction of [[Prilidiano Pueyrredón]] who commissioned the French artist Joseph Dubourdieu to build what the press of that period defined "a colossal statue of Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;El Historiador: ''La Pirámide de Mayo'', available at http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/frases/revolucion/piramide_de_mayo.php. Consulted on February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurated a few days before the [[Argentina Centennial|anniversary of May Revolution]], the statue represents a figure very similar to the representation of the goddess [[Athena]], crowned with a Phrygian cap, armed with a spear in one hand and an [[Coat of Arms of Argentina|Argentine shield]] as a defense in the other one.&lt;ref name="escultura"&gt;Banco Central de la República Argentina: ''La escultura en las monedas y billetes de la República Argentina'', available at http://www.bcra.gov.ar/pdfs/institucional/LaEsculturaMonedasyBilletes.pdf. Consulted on February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most sources mention the statue as an allegory of Liberty, in a publication of the Historic and Numismatic Museum of the [[Central Bank of Argentina]], is considered an allegory of the Republic.&lt;ref name="escultura" /&gt;

=== Bust in the White Hall ===
[[File:Salón Blanco.jpg|thumb|200px|View of ''The Republic'',&lt;ref&gt;Correo Oficial de la República Argentina: ''Emisiones - 2007'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.correoargentino.com.ar/filatelia/2007.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129021225/http://www.correoargentino.com.ar/filatelia/2007.php |archivedate=2008-01-29 |df= }}.

Chairing the [[Casa Rosada#Interior|White Hall]] in the [[Casa Rosada]], where traditional ceremonies and important announcements related to the [[executive branch]] are made, a bust of a woman with thick hair and the [[Coat of Arms of Argentina]] as a brooch in her chest is located. The work, done by [[Italy|Italian]] sculptor [[Ettore Ximenes]], is entlited "The Republic", but others consider it a bust of "Homeland".&lt;ref&gt;Presidencia de la Nación Argentina: ''Casa Rosada - Puntos de interés'', available at http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?Itemid=75&amp;id=135&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view. Consulted on March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mausoleum of General San Martín ===
In 1880, the remains of [[General José de San Martín]] were brought from France and placed in a [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral#Mausoleum of General San Martín|mausoleum]] inside the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The black sarcophagus is guarded by three life-size female figures that represent [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], three of the regions freed by the General.

== Monetary emissions ==
The first representation of an allegorical figure to appear on Argentine banknotes was the goddess [[Athena]] (historical symbol of Athenian democracy), commissioned by the National Bank of the [[United Provinces of Río de la Plata]] during the [[Cisplatine War]]. The Greek goddess also appeared in banknotes issued by the National Bank during the governorship of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in the [[Buenos Aires Province]]. However, the first figure to transmit a ''sense of regionality'' is displayed in a series of banknotes printed by Britain and emitted by the [[Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires]] in 1867, where a young woman is seen holding a shovel in her left hand and a shepherd's crook in her right hand (representations of agriculture and animal husbandry, respectively).

In some of the first [[peso moneda nacional]] banknotes, various unidentified female figures showing her legs or her chest appear, "as the seductive image of a State that attracts citizens via women". The monetary reorganization, that begun during the first presidency of [[Julio Argentino Roca]], imposed the use of designs which were developed as to have a greater permanence in time. Two allegorical figures present in the first unified issues of currency and banknotes, the ''Bust of Liberty'' and the ''Effigy of Progress'', would be recurring in later releases.

=== Bust of Liberty ===
[[File:Argentina 20 centavos 1883.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Liberty of Oudiné'' in the flip of a [[coin]] of [[peso moneda nacional|twenty cents m$n]], 1883.]]
One of the most recurrent figures in Argentine currency is the ''Effigy of Liberty'' by the [[France|French]] artist [[Eugène André Oudiné]], which shows the profile of a woman with a serene face, abundant hair loose to the wind and a [[Phrygian cap]]. Oudiné carved his ''Effigy of Liberty'' in 1881, by order of the engineer Eduardo Castilla, first president of the [[Casa de Moneda de la República Argentina|Casa de Moneda]], to illustrate the reverse of the coins of the [[peso moneda nacional]], whose creation was enacted that same year to unify the monetary system of country. The ''Liberty of Oudiné'' was present in monetary emissions without interruption until 1942, when it was replaced by a modern bust made in 1940 by French sculptor Lucien Bazor. However, it reappears in the emission of 1957, and is present in subsequent designs of [[argentine peso ley|peso ley]], [[argentine peso argentino|peso argentino]] and [[argentine austral|austral]].

A slightly different version appears on the banknotes of fifty cents [[peso moneda nacional|m$n]],  in circulation between 1942 and 1960. This effigy can be compared with the design of Oudiné, and considered inspired by ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''. The ''Liberty of Oudiné'' also appears in the logo of the [[Central Bank of Argentina]], and the former company ''Gas del Estado''. It is also used in the seals of the Internal Revenue law present in [[cigarette]] packs.

=== Effigy of Progress ===
[[File:1 Peso Moneda Nacional A-B 1903.jpg|thumb|350px|Effigy of Progress on 1 m$n banknote, 1903]] 
Another common allegorical figure, in this on banknotes, is an Effigy of Progress which features a woman sitting, holding an Argentine shield with one hand and a lighted torch with the other. The design, which is usually attributed to the French writer Louis-Eugène Mouchon was carried out for illustrating the front of the [[peso moneda nacional]] banknotes as a result of Act. 3505 of 1897, which authorized the ''Caja de Conversión'' to renew and unify all paper currencies in the period. The Effigy of Progress would be present in all series of banknotes by the ''Caja de Conversión'' from 1899 until 1935, when it was replaced by the [[Central Bank of Argentina]], and will not be replaced until 1942, when the Central Bank made its first series of banknotes. The same figure, surrounded by laurels, reappears half a century later on the back of all [[Argentine austral|austral banknotes]].

Apart from being identified with Progress, whose formalization is posterior, the figure was initially interpreted as an Effigy of the Republic.

== Bicentennial celebrations ==
During the festivities and celebrations of the [[Argentina Bicentennial|Argentine bicentennial]], the young actresses Josefina Torino and Ivanna Carrizo interpreted the figure of [[Homeland]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Ivanna-Josefina-mujeres-dia-Patria_0_269373110.html Ivanna y Josefina, las mujeres que por un día fueron la Patria]", ''Clarín'', 27/05/2010.

Many of Mexico's older [[Architecture|architectural]] structures, including entire sections of [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Hispanic]] and colonial cities, have been designated [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] sites for their historical and artistic significance. The country has the largest number of sites declared World Heritage Sites by [[UNESCO]] in the Americas.

Important archaeological finds of the remains of structures built by the indigenous peoples of Mexico have been made in the country. The [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations that arose there developed a sophisticated architecture that evolved from simplistic to complex forms; in the north it was manifested in buildings of adobe and stone, the multi-storied housing as seen in [[Casas Grandes|Paquimé]], and the cave dwellings of the Sierra Madre Occidental.

[[Monte Albán]] was long the seat of the dominant political power in the [[Valley of Oaxaca|Central Valleys of Oaxaca]], from the decline of [[San José Mogote]] until the demise of the city, which occurred around the 9th century. The native name of this city founded by the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] in the late Preclassic is still the subject of discussion. According to some sources, the original name was ''Dani Baá''. It is known, however, that the local [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] called the city ''Yuku kúi'' (Green Hill) in their [[Mixtec language|language]].

Like most of the great [[Mesoamerica]]n cities, Monte Albán was a city with a multi-ethnic population. Throughout its history, the city maintained strong ties to other peoples in Mesoamerica, especially with the [[Teotihuacan]]s during the early Classic period.&lt;ref name="KowalskiKristan-Graham2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Karl Kowalski|author2=Cynthia Kristan-Graham|title=Twin Tollans: Chichén Itzá, Tula, and the Epiclassic to Early Postclassic Mesoamerican World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZVUd9I0gpAC&amp;pg=PA5451|year=2007|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=978-0-88402-323-4|page=5451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was abandoned by the social elite and much of the rest of its population at the end of Phase Xoo. However, the ceremonial enclosure that constitutes the complex of the archeological site of Monte Albán was reused by the Mixtec during the Postclassic period. By this time, the Zapotec people's political power was divided among various city-states, including [[Zaachila]], [[Yagul]], [[Lambityeco]] and [[Tehuantepec]].

The Maya appear to have founded ''Lakam Ha'' about 100 B.C., during the Formative period (2500 B.C. - 300 A.D.),&lt;ref name="BrickerSabloff2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A. Diehl|editor=Victoria Bricker, Jeremy A. Sabloff|title=Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians, Volume 1: Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpUZBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT497|date=7 January 2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79171-8|page=497|chapter=Tula}}&lt;/ref&gt; predominantly as a farmers' village favored by the numerous springs and streams nearby. The population of ''Lakam Ha'' grew during the Early Classic period (200-600) as it became a full-fledged city; during the Late Classic period (600-900) it was made the capital of the ''B'akaal'' (''bone'') region in Chiapas and [[Tabasco]]. The oldest of the structures that have been discovered were built around the year 600.

B'akaal was an important center of Mayan civilization between the 5th and 9th centuries, during which it formed various, shifting alliances, and fought numerous wars with its enemies. On more than one occasion it made an alliance with [[Tikal]], the other great Mayan city of the time, to contain the spread of militant [[Calakmul]], also called the "Kingdom of the Serpent". Calakmul won two of these wars, in 599 and 611. B'akaal rulers claimed that their royal lineage originated in the distant past, some even boasting that their genealogy dated to  the creation of the world, which in Mayan mythology was in the year 3114 B.C. Modern archaeological theories speculate that the first dynasty of their rulers was probably of [[Olmec]] ethnicity.

During the Tollan phase, the city reached its greatest extent and population. Some authors estimate the urban area of Tollan-Xicocotitlan at the time was between 5 and 16&amp;nbsp;km², with a population of between 16,000 and 55,000 people.&lt;ref name="BrickerSabloff201438"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon R. Willey|editor=Victoria Bricker, Jeremy A. Sabloff|title=Supplement to the Handbook of Middle American Indians, Volume 1: Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpUZBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38|date=7 January 2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79171-8|pages=38–39|chapter=Recent Researches and Perspectives in Mesoamerican Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase the monumental space that constitutes the [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] archaeological zone was consolidated in two pyramidal bases, two courts for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] and several palaces occupied by the Toltec elite. By this time, Tollan-Xicocotitlan had become not only the nexus of the Mesoamerican commercial networks, it also hosted a military-theocratic elite who imposed their rule in various parts of Mesoamerica, whether by military [[conquest (military)|conquest]] or [[political alliance]], or by establishing colonies in strategic places.

[[Teotihuacan]] was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[Unesco]] in 1987. Teotihuacan archaeological excavations continue to this day, and have resulted in a gradual increase in the quality and quantity of knowledge of the city's history; even so, such important facts as its original name and the ethnic affiliation of its founders are still unknown. It is known that it was a cosmopolitan place, however, by the documented presence of groups from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coast or the [[Valley of Oaxaca|Central Valleys of Oaxaca]].

[[File:Comalcalco.Templo VI y Templo VII.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Comalcalco (archaeological site)|Comalcalco]] is only Mayan city built of baked brick and stucco]]
Located in the modern [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|town]] of the same name, [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] was the ceremonial center of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Tarascan state]] capital. Its ruins are situated on a large artificial platform excavated into the Yahuarato hillside, with a commanding view of [[Lake Pátzcuaro]]. There, five rounded pyramids  called "Yácatas" face the lake. The site has a small archaeological museum.

===Puuc style===
The buildings of Chichen Itza show a large number of architectural and iconographic elements that some historians have called Mexicanized. The influence of cultures from central Mexico, mixed with the [[Puuc]] style of the upper peninsula, is visible in its Classic Maya architecture. The presence of these elements from the cultures of the [[Mexican Plateau]] was conjectured recently to have been a result of a mass migration to, or conquest of, the Mayan city by [[Toltec]] groups. However, recent studies suggest that they may have been the cultural expression of a prestigious and widespread political system during the Early Postclassic in [[Mesoamerica]].

===Oasisamerican style===
[[File:Paquime4.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Multi-family room in [[Casas Grandes|Paquimé]].]]
[[File:Cueva de las Jarillas.jpg|160px|thumb|The adobe houses of the troglodytes of [[Casas Grandes]].]]

[[Oasisamerica]]n peoples, whose influence was marked primarily by commercial exchanges between the north and south of Mexico, had widespread contact with the other peoples of Mesoamerica in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to a unique style of building construction in the Americas. The archaeological record of this style is scant compared to that of [[Chan Chan]] in northern Peru.

Paquimé was a prehistoric settlement that had cultural influence in the northwest of the Sierra Madre Occidental, most of modern-day western [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and some areas of what is now the states of [[Sonora]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]]. Researchers estimate that the population probably grew to about 3,500 inhabitants, but their linguistic and ethnic affiliation is unknown.

The site is known for its [[adobe]] buildings and their "T" form doors. Only a fraction of its total length is fenced and less is excavated. Its buildings have traits of Oasisamerican culture and demonstrate the skill of the Prehispanic architects of the region who designed multifamily adobe houses up to four stories high utilizing wood, reed, and stone as supplementary building materials.

With the establishment of Spanish rule in Mexico, the first churches and monasteries were built utilizing architectural principles of classical order and the Arabic formalities of Spanish [[mudéjar]]ismo.&lt;ref name="Moffitt2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F. Moffitt|title=The Islamic Design Module in Latin America: Proportionality and the Techniques of Neo-Mudejar Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsfjJPUz668C&amp;pg=PA144|date=1 July 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1806-0|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great cathedrals and civic buildings were later built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] styles, while in rural areas estate manor houses and [[hacienda]] buildings  incorporated [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] elements. The [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretic]] Indian-Christian mode of architecture developed organically as Indians interpreted European architectural and decorative features in the native, pre-Columbian style called ''tequitqui'' ("laborer" or "mason", from [[Nahuatl]]).&lt;ref name="Aguilar-Moreno2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Aguilar-Moreno|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZseasJq3WzEC&amp;pg=PA263|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533083-0|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizing local indigenous communities around [[monasteries|monastic centers]] was one of the solutions devised by friars of the [[mendicant orders]] in the 16th century to convert the large number of indigenous non-Catholics in [[New Spain]]. These were conceived of as [[fortress]]es, but based architecturally on the European [[convent]]ual model, incorporating new features such as the open chapel and [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s with a stone cross at the center; they were characterized by different decorative elements.&lt;ref name="Torres2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mónica Domínguez Torres|title=Military Ethos and Visual Culture in Post-conquest Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_b3sg-tLvQC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6671-4|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the history of the [[Indian reductions]] (''reducciones de indios''), the convents became community training centers, so to speak, where the Indians could learn various arts and trades as well as European social customs and the [[Spanish language]], obtain medical treatment, and even hold funerals. These buildings, spread across the central part of what is now Mexico, contain superb examples of the indigenous mastery of architecture and the sculptural arts. Their work, created under the supervision of the Catholic friars, was done in the ''tequitqui'' style, which originated in the architectural stone carving and decorative painting practiced by their ancestors before the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref name="WickstromYoung2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sofía Irene Velarde Cruz|editor=Stefanie Wickstrom, Philip D.

The first cathedrals in Mexico were built beginning in 1521 when New Spain was established; from that time onward ever more elaborate structures were built, a prime example being the [[Mérida Cathedral]] in Yucatán, built in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architectural style and one of the oldest cathedrals in the New World.&lt;ref name="PerryPerry1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard D.

===The New Spanish Baroque===

[[File:Querétaro, ex convento San Agustín 1.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Ex-Convent of San Agustín in Querétaro.]]
The dominant form of art and architecture during most of the colonial period was [[Baroque]]. In 1577, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] created the [[Academy of Saint Luke]] with the purpose of breaking with Renaissance style. Its aim was to use painting and sculpture in and on churches to create iconography to teach and reinforce Church doctrine. In Spain, the first works in Baroque include the Patio of the Kings in [[El Escorial]] monastery.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p23"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CupolaRosarioPuebla3.JPG|thumb|The cupola of the Capilla del Rosario in Puebla.]]
Spanish Baroque was transplanted to Mexico and developed its own varieties from the late 16th to late 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p14"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque art and architecture were mostly applied to churches. One reason for this was that in nearly all cities, towns and villages, the church was the center of the community, with streets in a regular pattern leading away from it. This reflected the Church’s role as the center of community life. Church design in [[New Spain]] tended to follow the rectilinear pattern of squares and cubes, rather than contemporary European churches that favored curves and orbs.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spaces of Mexican Baroque churches tend to be more introverted than their European counterparts, focusing especially on the main altar. The purpose was contemplation and meditation. The rich ornamentation was created to keep attention focused on the central themes. This was especially true of the main altar.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Templo de San Francisco de Asís Acatepec 2.jpg|thumb|180px|The facade of the Tonantzintla church with Baroque Talavera tiling.]]
Columns and [[pilaster]]s were an important element of Mexican Baroque style, in particular the part of the column between the [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] and the base, which can be categorized in six types including [[Solomonic column|Salomonic]] and [[estipite]] (an inverted truncated pyramid) in the later colonial period. Even if the rest of the structure was not covered in decoration, such as in the “purist” style, columns and spaces between doubled columns were profusely decorated.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p1213"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it developed in Mexico, the Baroque split into a number of sub-styles and techniques. “Estucado” Baroque was purely decorative and did not employ any architectural features. Features were molded from stucco with intricate detail and either covered in gold leaf or paint. This form reached its height in the 17th century in Puebla and Oaxaca. Surviving examples include the Chapel del Rosario in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and the Church at [[Tonantzintla]]. One reason this style fell out of favor was that the stucco work eventually dissolved.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p89"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Talavera Baroque was a variety mostly confined to the states of [[Puebla]] and [[Tlaxcala]]. The main defining feature was the use of hand-painted ceramic tiles of the [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera type]]. This style came into being here because of the pottery industry. Tiles are mostly found on the bell towers, domes and main portals of the exterior. They are also found interspersed on the rest of the facade as accents to brickwork. This type of Baroque first appeared in the 17th century and reached its height in the 18th. While wholesale use of this style is mostly confined to two states, elements of this tile work appear, especially in domes, in many other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late Baroque era artists in the provincial area of New Spain created intricately textured church facades and interiors similar to those of the major cities. It had a more two-dimensional quality, which led it to be called Mestizo Baroque or Folk Baroque. The two-level effect was less based on sculptural modeling and more on drilling into the surface to create a screen-like effect. This has some similarities to pre-Hispanic stone and wood carving, allowing elements of indigenous art tradition to survive.&lt;ref name="mestizo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253324 |title=Mestizo Baroque |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Baroque styles in Mexico did not adorn all of the surfaces of the interior or exterior but focused their ornamentation on columns, pilasters and the spaces between pairs of these supports. Medallions and niches with statues commonly appear between columns and pilasters, especially around main portals and windows. Decorative patterns in columns after were wavy grooves (called estrías móviles).&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p1213"/&gt;

[[File:Altar Reyes Catedral Metropolitana.JPG|thumb|Details of the Altar of the Kings in the [[Mexico City Cathedral]].]]
Another late Baroque style in Mexico is often called Mexican [[Churrigueresque]] after the Spanish Churriguera family, who made altarpieces at this time. However, the more technical term for this very exuberant, anti-classical style is ultra Baroque. It originated in Spain as architectural decoration, spreading to sculpture and furniture carving.&lt;ref name="ultrabaroque"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253325 |title=Ultra baroque |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the definitive element of ultra Baroque was the use of the Salomonic column along with the profuse decoration.&lt;ref name="salvatvol5p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 5, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, the Salomonic column appears as well but the main distinctive aspect of Mexican ultra Baroque is the use of the [[estipite]] column in both buildings and altarpieces. This is not a true column, but rather an elongated base in the form of an inverted, truncated pyramid. This can be seen in the [[Mexico City Cathedral]] in the Altar of the Kings and the main portal of the Tabernacle.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p14"/&gt;

Ultra Baroque was introduced by [[Jerónimo Balbás]] into Mexico, whose design for an altar at the [[Seville Cathedral]] was the inspiration for the Altar of the Kings, constructed in 1717. Balbás used estípites to convey a sense of fluidity, but his Mexican followers flattened the facades and aligned the estepites, with less dynamic results. This is what Lorenzo Rodríguez did to Balbás design for the Altar of the Kings. He also created a stronger horizontal division between the first and second levels, which derived Mexican ultra Baroque from the Spanish version. The ultra Baroque appeared when Mexican mines were producing great wealth, prompting numerous building projects. Much of Mexican ultra Baroque can be seen in and the city of Guanajuato and its mines. For this reason, the style became more developed in Mexico than in Spain.&lt;ref name="ultrabaroque"/&gt;

The combination of Indian and Arabic decorative influences, with an extremely expressive interpretation of the churrigueresque, could explain the variety and intensity of the Baroque in New Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, the American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin towers facades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century have medieval roots.

To the north, the richest province of the 18th century, [[New Spain]], the current Mexico, was an architecture fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic that is Mexican [[churrigueresque]]. This ultrabaroque style culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodríguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano in [[Mexico City]] (1749-1769). Other notable examples are in remote mining towns. For example, the sanctuary of [[Ocotlán, Tlaxcala|Ocotlán]] (begun in 1745) is a first-Baroque cathedral, whose surface is covered with bright red tiles, which contrast with a plethora of compressed ornament applied generously on the front and sides of the towers. The true capital of Mexican Baroque is [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], where the abundance of hand painted tiles and local gray stone led to a very personal and localized evolution of style, with a pronounced Indian flavor.

The '''New Spanish Baroque''' is an artistic movement that appeared in what is now Mexico in the late 16th century, approximately, which was preserved until the mid-18th century. From the Portuguese word ''barrueco'' meaning unclean, mottled, flamboyant, daring, the most striking example of New Spanish Baroque art is in religious architecture, where indigenous artisans gave it a unique character. Highlights include the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City]] with his Altar of the Kings, the church of Santa María [[Tonantzintla]] in the Puebla State, the Jesuit convent of [[Tepotzotlán]] in the State of Mexico, the Chapel of the Rosary in the church of Santo Domingo of the city of Puebla, the convent and the church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán in Oaxaca, and the [[Santa Prisca Church (Taxco)|church of Santa Prisca]] in [[Taxco]], [[Guerrero]] State.

The [[Biblioteca Palafoxiana]], considered by some historians the first public library in the Americas, was founded in 1646 by [[Bishop]] [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] of Puebla, with a gift of 5,000 volumes&lt;ref name=Jornada&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Arturo Garcia|title=Historia de una pasión por los libros y el conocimiento|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/08/26/05an2cul.php?printver=1&amp;fly=|accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper=La Jornada|date=26 August 2003|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Colegio de San Juan'' (which he had also founded), on the condition that they be made available to the general public,&lt;ref name="Jornada2016"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Arturo Garcia Hernandez |title=Historia de una pasión por los libros y el conocimiento |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/08/26/05an2cul.php?printver=1&amp;fly= |accessdate=8 November 2016 |work=La Jornada |publisher=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios |date=26 August 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108053649/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/08/26/05an2cul.php?printver=1&amp;fly= |archivedate=November 8, 2016 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and not just to ecclesiastics and seminarians.

More than a century later, [[Francisco Fabián y Fuero]] ordered the construction of the premises which currently house the library in the [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] hall on the Colegio's second floor. This was finished in 1773, and has two levels of bookshelves and a [[retablo]], or altarpiece, a delicate work which houses an image of the [[Madonna of Trapani]], an oil painting presumably modeled on the sculpture carved by the Sicilian master [[Nino Pisano]] in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name="Kirk2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Kirk|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and the Gender Politics of Knowledge in Colonial Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imd9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-05256-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bookshelves were the work of the viceregal cabinetmakers who carved in [[Pinus ayacahuite|ayacahuite pine]], cedar, and ''coloyote'' wood. The size of the collection continually increased, and a third level of bookshelves was added in the mid-19th century.

===Neoclassicism===
[[File:Hospicio Cabañas.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[Hospicio Cabañas]] in Guadalajara.]]
[[File:Palacio_de_Mineria.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio de Minería]], Mexico City]]

As part of the [[Spanish Enlightenment]]'s cultural impact on New Spain, neoclassicism drew on the inspiration of the clean lines of Greek and Roman architecture.  Neoclassicism in architecture was directly linked to crown policies that sought to rein in the exuberance of the baroque, considered in "bad taste" and creating public buildings of "good taste" funded by the crown, such as the [[Palacio de Minería]] in Mexico City and the [[Hospicio Cabañas]] in Guadalajara, and the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas]] in Guanajuato, all built in the late colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp.132-33, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th and early 20th century architecture==
[[File:Casa de máquinas.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Industrial Architecture in Yucatán]]

Townscapes changed little during the first half of the 19th century  in Mexico, until the French occupation during the [[Second Mexican Empire]] in the 1860s. Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] brought a new set of urban design ideas to Mexico. Drawing from the mid-century Parisian revelopment plan of [[Baron Haussmann]], Maximillain administered the building of a broad new diagonal avenue- [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This elegant boulevard ran for miles from the downtown National Palace to the lush [[Chapultepec Park]] where the Austrian ruler lived in the [[Chapultepec Castle]]. Along the Reforma, double rows of eucalyptus trees were planted, gas lamps installed, and the first mule-drawn streetcars were introduced. The development was the catalyst for a new phase of growth from downtown Mexico City to the west, a direction that would define the city's structure for the next half century.

During President [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s presidencies (1876–1880, 1884–1911), patrons and practitioners of architecture manifested two impulses: to create an architecture that would indicate Mexico's participation in modernity and the emphasize Mexico's difference from other countries through the incorporation of local characteristics into the architecture. The first goal took precedence over the second during most of the 19th century.

A modern, sophisticated Mexico City was the goal of President Diaz. [[Cast iron]] technology from Europe and the United States allowed for new building designs. Italian [[marble]], European [[granite]], bronzes and [[stained glass]] could now be imported. Diaz was determined to transform the landscape of the nation's capital into one reminiscent of Paris or London. It is not surprising that the most important architectural commissions of the [[Porfiriato]] were given to foreigners. Italian architect [[Adamo Boari]] designed the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Postal Palace]] built by Gonzalo Garita (1902) and the [[National Theatre of Mexico]] (1904). The French architect [[Émile Bénard]], who worked on the [[Palacio Legislativo Federal|Legislative Palace]] in 1903, founded an architectural studio where he took Mexican students. [[Silvio Contri]] was responsible for the [[Palace of the Secretariat of Communications and Public Works|Secretariat of Communications and Public Works]] (1902–11). Neo-Gothic designs incorporated into the monumental public buildings of the early 20th century. The two best examples were the Central post office and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], designed by Italian architect [[Adamo Boari]].

President Diaz had enacted a decree in 1877 that called for the placement of a series of political statues of Mexican heroes along the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Classical designs were used to build structures such as the [[El Ángel de la Independencia|Angel of Independence monument]], the [[Monument to Cuauhtémoc]], the monument to [[Benito Juárez]], and the [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] Statue. Diaz's conviction about the importance of public monuments in the urban landscape started a tradition that has become permanent in Mexico: public monuments in the 20th century landscape.

[[File:San-Angel-Casa-Rivera-Kahlo.jpg|250px|thumb|House of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo (built by [[Juan O'Gorman]] in 1930)]]

In the 19th century, Neo-Indigenist architecture played an active part of the representation of national identity as constructed by the Porfirian regime. The representation of the local in Mexican architecture was achieved mainly through themes and decorative motifs inspired by pre-Hispanic antiquity. These representations were essential to the construction of a common heritage by which the nation might be unified. The first building based on the ancient Mexican motifs built in the 19th century was the [[Monument to Cuauhtémoc]] executed by engineer Francisco Jiménez and the sculptor Miguel Norena. Other 19th-century buildings incorporating pre-Hispanic decorative motifs include the monument to Benito Juarez in [[Paseo Juarez]], [[Oaxaca]] (1889).

At the beginning of the 20th century, Luis Zalazar enthusiastically encouraged architects to create a national style of architecture based on the study of pre-Hispanic ruins. His writings would be influential for the nationalistic tendencies in Mexican architecture which developed during the second and third decade of the 20th century.

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], successive Mexican regimes would use the pre-Hispanic past to represent the nation. Later architects also took inspiration from the architecture of the colonial period and regional architecture as the creation of a genuinely Mexican architecture became a pressing issue during the 20th century.

==Modern and contemporary architecture==

[[File:Torre Latinoamericana 1.jpg|thumb|220px|right|La [[Torre Latinoamericana]]]]

Fifteen years after the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1917, government endorsements for federal housing, educational, and health care building programs began. While the development of [[modern architecture]] in Mexico bears some noteworthy parallels to its North American and European counterparts, its trajectory highlights several unique characteristics, which challenged existing definitions modern architecture. During the post-Revolutionary period, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.

[[File:Alejandravgl2.jpg|thumb|[[Santa Fe, Mexico City]]]]

Functionalism, expressionism, and other schools have left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and North American techniques.

The Institute of Hygiene (1925) in Popotla, Mexico, by [[José Villagrán García]], was one of the first examples of this new national architecture. The studio designed by [[Juan O'Gorman]] in San Angel, Mexico City, for [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] (1931–32) is a fine example of vanguard architecture built in Mexico. Mexico's first project of high-density, low-cost housing was the Centro Urbano Alemán (1947–49), Mexico City, by [[Mario Pani]].

Perhaps the most ambitious project of modern architecture was the construction, begun in 1950, [[Ciudad Universitaria]] outside Mexico City, a complex of buildings and grounds housing the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. A cooperative venture, the project was directed by [[Carlos Lazo]], [[Enrique Del Moral]], and Pani. In the new campus the art of the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican muralists]] was incorporated into the architecture, beginning with Rivera's relief in the new [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario]] (1952), by [[Augusto Pérez Palacios]], [[Jorge Bravo]], and [[Raúl Salinas]]. The Rectory (1952), by Pani, del Moral, and [[Salvador Ortega Flores]], includes murals by [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. Perhaps the best integration of mural art with the new architecture is seen in the University Library, by O’Gorman, [[Gustavo Saavedra]], and [[Juan Martínez de Velasco]], which features a monumental mosaic design on the facade by O’Gorman. Another architect of note is [[Felix Candela]] (Spanish), who designed the expressionistic church Nuestra Señora de los Milagros.

This was a period of diverse experimentation and even structural innovation, as seen in the thin-shell concrete structures by the Spanish architect Felix Candela, such as his Church of the Miraculous Virgin (1953) in Mexico City and the Cosmic Ray Pavilion (1952) on the university campus. The integration of art and architecture became a constant in Mexican modern architecture, which can be seen in the courtyard of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|Anthropology Museum]]
(c. 1963–65) in Mexico City, by [[Pedro Ramírez Vázquez]].

Another side of Mexican modern architecture is represented in the work of [[Luis Barragán]]. The houses that he designed in the 1950s and ’60s explored a way to reconcile the lessons of [[Le Corbusier]] with the Spanish colonial tradition. This new synthesis created a completely original Modernist architecture that is uniquely adapted to its environment.

[[Ricardo Legorreta]]'s Camino Real Hotel (1968) in Mexico City is a composition of courtyards and roof terraces within the walls of one downtown block. This work is indebted to the work of Barragán, applying his methods on a larger public scale. In Mexico the [[Brutalism]] of [[Teodoro González de León]]'s Music Conservatory (1994) and the Neo-Barragánesque library (1994) by Legorreta coexist in the new National Centre of the Arts with the work of a younger generation of architects who are influenced by contemporary architecture in Europe and North America.

The School of Theatre (1994), by [[TEN Arquitectos]], and the School of Dance (1994), by [[Luis Vicente Flores]], express a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence. [[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectors, was presented with the "Legacy Award" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for his contributions to the US arts and culture through his work.  In 2005 he received the "Leonardo da Vinci" World Award of Arts by the World Cultural Council and was the first Mies van der Rohe Award recipient for Latin American Architecture.

The refined work of [[Alberto Kalach]] and Daniel Alvarez stands out both in their numerous residences as well as in the San Juan de Letrán Station (1994) in Mexico City. The residential work of [[José Antonio Aldrete-Haas]] in Mexico City shows both the influence of the attenuated Modernism of the great Portuguese architect [[Álvaro Siza]] and a continuity with the lessons of Barragán. Other notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Tatiana Bilbao]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman|Isaac Broid]] and [[Bernardo Gómez-Pimienta]], with award winning works in Mexico, USA and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-3127941_ITM | work=Reforma | title=Jacinto Avalos : Emociones junto al mar.(Entremuros) | first=Rubén | last=Hernández | date=1999-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Houses-Sea-Mexicos-Pacific-Coast/dp/9709241079 Amazon.com: Houses by the Sea: Mexico&amp;#39;s Pacific Coast (9789709241075): Mauricio Martinez: Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Nolan Feeney gave "Bon Appétit" a B+ rating writing, "she is back to garish, stupid-fun party jams that don't even try to be subtle about cramming in as many sex metaphors as possible in three-and-a-half minutes.

[[File:Roy Choi from Koji BBQ (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Chef [[Roy Choi]] appeared in the music video]]
Dent De Cuir directed the song's music video, which was released on May 12, 2017 and features chef [[Roy Choi]]. It first shows Perry wrapped in plastic before chefs cut the wrapping open and "start kneading her like dough" before she is boiled in a pot with carrots while singing her lyrics and Choi serves her as a meal to various cannibalizing patrons. Migos watch and rap their verses as Perry rings the bell, signaling them to turn a switch allowing her to turn the tables on the patrons. The patrons are then bound, gagged and then dismembered by the chefs as Perry then dances on a pole. Perry then is served a pie containing dismembered body parts of the patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7793006/katy-perry-bon-appetit-video-migos|magazine=Billboard|date=May 12, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2017|title=Katy Perry Is the Main Course in Eerie New 'Bon Appetit' Video With Migos: Watch|first=Da'Shan|last=Smith|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516000942/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7793006/katy-perry-bon-appetit-video-migos|archive-date=May 16, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}
In [[European classical music|classical music]], a '''bravura''' is a style of both music and its performance intended to show off the skill of a [[performer]]. &lt;ref name=jafm&gt;[[John Alexander Fuller-Maitland]], ''A dictionary of music and musicians (A.D. 1450-1889)'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=J962AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 p. 271-272]&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly it is a [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] [[passage (music)|passage]] performed as a [[Solo (music)|solo]], and often in a [[cadenza]].

The term implies "effect for effect's sake". Therefore, while many pieces of Beethoven do require a high skill, they are not described as "bravura".   Fuller-Maitland suggests the following arias as examples of bravura: ''[[Let the bright Seraphim]]'', "[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen]]" (Act II of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'') and "Non più mesta" from ''[[ La Cenerentola]]''. &lt;ref name=jafm/&gt;

Musical terms "allegro di bravura" and "con bravura" indicate boldness, fire and brilliancy.&lt;ref name=jafm/&gt;

The term "bravura" also refers to daring performance in ballet, e.g., in reference of the ''[[pas de deux]]'' from ''[[Le Corsaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YcNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Garafola]] describes the [[Russian ballet]] school of [[Marius Petipa]] as "marrying the new [[Italian ballet|Italian bravura technique]] to its more lyrical [[French ballet|French counterpart]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Ballet]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9U7tO1u6nU4C&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View in Clay Figure Zhang Art Museum 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Museum of Clay Figure Zhang in Tianjin]]
'''Clay Figure Zhang''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|泥|人|張}}|s={{linktext|泥|人|张}}|p=Nírén Zhāng}}) is a famous [[folk art]] in [[Tianjin]], China. It was created by '''Zhang Mingshan''' ({{zh|t=張明山}}; 1826–1906) during the [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang reign]] (1821–50) of the [[Qing dynasty]].

==Production Procedure==
Clay Figure Zhang is made of ripe [[clay]] which is pure puddle with little sand through the process of weathering, slurrying, filtrating, evaporating and adding cotton to rub up. It has the characteristics of viscosity. The side materials include wood, vine, lead, paper, flowers and so on. After completely drying, the clay figure is put into stove for firing. The temperature is up to 700 degree Celsius or so. After coming out of stove, the clay figure is polished and painted. It takes about 30 days or so to finish a piece of work.

==Artistic Attractiveness==
The images of Clay Figure Zhang vary from palace maids in costume, historic figures, religious figures, and modern figures to local customs. It is usually displayed indoor, on the shelf for example, because of its small size (usually 20&amp;nbsp;cm high). Therefore, it is also called shelf sculpture. Clay Figure Zhang has vivid realistic characteristics, and can portray the figures' personality and posture, pursue dissection structure, reasonable exaggeration, suitable acceptance and rejection, special applying to give attention to both shape and spirit and have great originality.

==Modern Development==
The Clay Figure Zhang Workshop, established in 1958, is engaged in the research of painted sculpture. It has 46 staff members, 5 creation rooms and 3 shops. Many of its art works have been awarded and are collected by domestic and abroad Art Gallery. In 2006, Clay Figure Zhang was listed as first grade national legacy of China.

'''''Colosseum: Road to Freedom''''' (originally '''''Gladiator: Road to Freedom''''' in Japan) is a [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]. It is a hybrid [[Fighting game|fighting]] [[role-playing video game]] loosely based on the [[Roman Empire]] around the time of the [[Commodus|Emperor Commodus]].

==Gameplay and story==
''Colosseum: Road to Freedom'' has the player take on the role of a slave that must partake gladiatorial games in order to earn enough money to purchase his freedom. The majority of the game is spent training the player's character and fighting in arena battles. The story in Colosseum takes a backseat in order to allow a higher degree of open-ended gameplay. Players have the freedom to tailor their game avatar to their liking depending on how they answer questions prior to gameplay.  Before entering the arena players can participate in training sessions, allowing them to improve their skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/19/colosseum-road-to-freedom&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the player's performance, it is possible to pay off the character's debts and still remain a freeman gladiator. The game allows for multiple endings depending on the player's performance over its course.

[[File:Jingle Bells outro Ab.png|thumb|300px|"[[Jingle Bells]]"'s outro {{audio|Jingle Bells outro Ab.mid|Play}}]]

In [[music]], the '''conclusion''' is the ending of a [[musical composition|composition]] and may take the form of a [[coda (music)|coda]] or [[#Outro|outro]].

Pieces using [[sonata form]] typically use the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] to conclude a piece, providing closure through the [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of [[Theme (music)|thematic]] material from the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] in the [[tonic key]]. In all musical forms other techniques include "altogether unexpected digressions just as a work is drawing to its close, followed by a return...to a consequently more emphatic confirmation of the structural relations implied in the body of the work."&lt;ref name=Perle&gt;[[George Perle|Perle, George]] (1990). ''The Listening Composer''. California: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06991-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* The slow movement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Brandenburg Concertos|Brandenburg Concerto No. 2]]'', where a "diminished-7th chord progression interrupts the final cadence."&lt;ref name=Perle/&gt;
* The slow movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], where, "echoing afterthoughts", follow the initial statements of the first theme and only return expanded in the coda.&lt;ref name=Perle/&gt;
* [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse]]'s ''[[Density 21.5]]'', where partitioning of the chromatic scale into (two) whole tone scales provides the missing tritone of b implied in the previously exclusive partitioning by (three) diminished seventh chords.&lt;ref name=Perle/&gt;

==Coda==
{{main|Coda (music)}}
''Coda'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "tail", plural ''code'') is a term used in [[music]] in a number of different senses, primarily to designate a passage which brings a piece (or one [[movement (music)|movement]] thereof) to a conclusion.

==Outro==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}

An '''outro''' (sometimes "outtro", also "extro") is the opposite of an [[Introduction (music)|intro]]. "Outro" is a [[Blend word|blend]] as it replaces the element "in" of the "intro" with its opposite, to create a new word.

The term is typically used only in the realm of [[popular music]]. It can refer to the concluding track of an album or to an '''outro-solo''', an instrumental [[Solo (music)|solo]] (usually a [[guitar solo]]) played as the song fades out or until it stops.
===Examples===
* "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]" as recorded by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] is an excellent example of an outro-solo, as is "[[Hotel California (song)|Hotel California]]" as recorded by [[The Eagles]].
* "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]" as recorded by [[Pearl Jam]].
* "Outro" - The final track of the [[M83 (band)|M83]] album "''[[Hurry Up, We're Dreaming]]''".

==Repeat and fade==
'''Repeat and fade''' is a musical direction used in [[sheet music]] when more than one repeat of the last few measures or so of a piece is desired with a fade-out (like something traveling into the distance and disappearing) as the manner in which to end the music. It originated as a sound effect made possible by the volume controls on sound recording equipment and on the sound controls for speaker output. No equivalent Italian term was in the standard lexicon of musical terms, so it was written in English, the language of the musician(s) who developed the technique. It is very difficult to approximate this effect on an instrument such as the piano, but instrumentalists can simulate it by thinning the musical texture while applying diminuendo within the limits of their instruments, and by taking advantage of the open-ended feeling of an unresolved harmony or melodic tone at the end. 

It is in the family of terms and signs that indicate repeated material, but it does not substitute for any of them, and it would be incorrect to describe it as a "shortcut" to any of the other repeat signs (such as ''[[Dal segno]]'').&lt;ref name=Perricone&gt;{{cite book| title = Melody in Songwriting: Tools and Techniques for Writing Hit Songs| edition = | author = Perricone, Jack| year = 2000| publisher = Berklee Press| isbn = 0-634-00638-X| page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direction is to be taken literally: while repeating the music contained within the section annotated "''repeat and fade''", the player(s) should continue to play/repeat, and the [[Production sound mixer|mixer]] or player(s) should [[fade (audio engineering)|fade]] the volume while the player(s) repeat the appropriate musical segments, until the song has been faded out (usually by faders on the [[mixing board]]).

===Examples===
'''Repeat and fade endings''' are rarely found in live performances, but are often used in studio recordings.&lt;ref name=Perricone/&gt; Examples include:
* "[[Hey Jude]]" as recorded by [[The Beatles]]
* "[[Time and a Word]]" as recorded by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]&lt;ref name=Yesterdays&gt;{{cite book

'''Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature''', which opened in 1854, was set up by the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] as a new enterprise to occupy part of its buildings when it  re-erected the Crystal Palace in suburban [[Sydenham]] in 1853. Civil engineer and later first director of the [[Royal College of Music]], [[George Grove]] was appointed secretary. It was a part of the great movements for educational and social reform of the nineteenth century.

The main buildings were destroyed by fire in 1936.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Letter to The Editor, ''The Times'', Monday Dec. 07, 1936. page 10, issue 47551&lt;br&gt;
The end of the Crystal Palace brings to mind  memories of the School of Engineering which was housed  in the South Tower, fortunately still standing firm as a rock. This school, founded by J. W. Wilson, M.I.M.E., an engineer who helped to build the Great Exhibition of 1851, sent many of its students to the four quarters of the globe. The curriculum of the school included mechanical and civil courses and about five of the circular rooms were used. There was a fitting shop, pattern shop, and drawing office. Those in the mechanical section built a 4 h.p. vertical engine which was generally exhibited at the head of the stairs on the south side of the Palace. In the Civil Engineering section we surveyed the whole of the grounds, and drew plans and made estimates for an imaginary railway which extended from one side to the other. This entailed all the necessary estimates for embankments, a cantilever bridge etc. Then there was the Colonial section presided over by a most congenial superintendent, who had no doubt seen much of a pioneer's life and infused his enthusiasm into those who belonged to his section. Concerning the rigidity of the South Tower, I was working in a high storey soon after joining the school when there was a strong wind, and, feeling giddy, I mentioned it to the superintendent. He informed me that it rocked several inches at the top, which made it safer than absolute rigidity.–Mr F. C. Bell, 74, Berners Street, Ipswich.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Culture Factory Polymer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Culture Factory Polymer|Culture Factory Polymer]]
'''Culture Factory Polymer''' ({{lang-et|Kultuuritehas Polymer}}) is a multidisciplinary centre for artistic creation and diffusion in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. Located in [[Lilleküla]], [[Kristiine|Kristiine District]], on the fringes of the [[Kesklinn, Tallinn|Tallinn city centre]], this former toy factory became in 2003 one of the main strong points for alternative un-institutionalized culture in Tallinn.

==History==
During the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet era]], Polymer was a [[toy]] factory. In 1993, closed this branch of activities, leaving a large building in a state of abandonment. 

A few years after, a group of artists, intrigued by this big empty space, decided to turn a room into a rehearsal place. Step-by-step, other artists wished to enjoy different spaces to create, to rehearse. The new owner of the building gave its agreement for necessary rearrangements and renovations.

Nowadays, the factory disposes of {{convert|3000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, dedicated to creation and diffusion. The building aesthetics of Polymer are typical Soviet industrial style. Concrete production facilities were transferred over time to incorporate new space for living, artistic use and events, with the old flair and keeping its authenticity. The conservation of the old factory's name, "Polymer", perpetuates the memory of this historic past.&lt;ref&gt;Polymer website&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different spaces==
Polymer, it is nowadays:
*studios for artists,
*rehearsals rooms for music bands,
*a center for art courses,
*two exhibition galleries,
*a Media Lab,
*two concert halls,
*two spaces which can be converted for several kinds of events,
*a bar,
*and two studios for guest artists.

A traditional letterpress print shop was also installed in the building; it's kept alive through realisation of posters for different organizations and animation of workshops for different publics.

==Activities &amp; events==
Gradually, Polymer became a place for residencies and diffusion with multiple spaces, where live together about 30 artists and organizations, working on diverse artistic fields. 
Constituted as a non profit organization, Polymer works as a platform, as a venue for different events and activities, offering thus a new space for alternative culture in Tallinn. Public events take place every week, involving [[artist in residency]] and guest artist also, from Tallinn, Estonia and Europe.

Every year in August, Polymer organizes its own festival, "Culture Factory Festival"; during 2 weeks, artists of the house open their studios and hang their art out to take some fresh air, and artists and a multitude of events from diverse universes take possession of the place: exhibition openings, concerts, film screenings, dance performances. Important is involving the audience in action through the workshops during the festival.

Polymer is an organization involved in local life and open to outwards contacts. Polymer leads different cultural and social actions at a local level, and develops its partnerships in Tallinn, in Estonia and in Europe.

Polymer was a member of the Trans Europe Halles network in years 2005-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Europe Halles website&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DC Animated Universe''' ('''DCAU'''; also referred to as the '''Timmverse''' by fans) is the [[shared universe]] centered on a group of [[Animated series|animated television series]] based on [[DC Comics]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] from the early 1990s to mid-2000s; beginning with ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in 1992, and ending with ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p7.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greatestcartoons"&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html "The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529093939/http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}. IGN. January 26, 2007. Retrieved May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the associated media franchise including [[direct-to-video]] feature films and [[Short film|shorts]], comic books, video games and other multimedia adaptations are also included in the continuity.

== List of DCAU media ==
[[File:DCAU batsuits.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Batman]]'s various character designs from the DCAU; he has been the most-featured character in this animated continuity, due to being the star of the original TV series in the DCAU.]]
While there have been several animated projects based upon DC Comics characters over the decades, what is commonly accepted as the DC animated universe consists of the stable of TV series and films that spin off from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' (1992–1995), the first TV show in this continuity. Two characters outside of the normal [[Batman]] canon, [[Zatanna]] and [[Jonah Hex]], appeared on the show, but the first series to indicate a shared continuity with other well-known characters was the subsequent show, ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', in which the [[Superman|title character]] has encounters with heroes such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and the [[Green Lantern]].

Older shows such as ''[[Super Friends]]'' and newer shows such as ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' are not part of this continuity. The direct-to-video [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], such as ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' and ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', are also not considered part of the DCAU, despite utilizing similar character designs and several of them featuring much of the same voice cast as previous DCAU series.

An animated series based on the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comic books was planned for the DC animated universe during the mid-1990s, but was finally scrapped.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063619/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a ''Teen Titans'' series not related to the DC animated universe was released. Also, after the success of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the early 1990s, Fox approached producer [[Bruce Timm]] to create a spin-off series focusing on [[Catwoman]], but the project never materialized.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Feature-length films ===
The following animated feature films also are part of the DCAU continuity:

*''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (1993; theatrical release)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ca.ign.com/articles/2010/06/25/top-25-animated-movies-of-all-time| title=''Top 25 Animated Movies of All-Time''| publisher= [[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/ |title=''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''| work =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate=2008-01-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080130003635/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/| archivedate= January 30, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (2000; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' (2003; direct-to-video)

&lt;!--editnote | NOTE: Do not add a series or section to the "DC animated universe" article without first reading the edit guidelines and criteria section at the top of the talk page (found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:DC_animated_universe). Any additions made will be reverted unless said guidelines are followed. Thank you!--&gt;
Before the release of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', a third animated feature based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' was planned, entitled ''Batman: Arkham''. The film was supposed to be a follow-up for ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', and [[Boyd Kirkland]] was attached to write and direct; but the project was soon scrapped. A second ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' movie was planned for release but was finally scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516063839/http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2003, during the production of ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] approached Kirkland to write a [[Catwoman]] [[direct-to-video]] feature film as a tie-in with the [[Catwoman (film)|2004 live-action film]]. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live-action film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010942/http://worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |archivedate=May 30, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a direct-to-video feature-length animated film entitled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'' was planned to connect ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' with its follow-up ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', but the production was finally cancelled in 2004, and the script was later rewritten for the animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', that was not part of the DC animated universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182731/http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action%3Dfullnews%26id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920221050/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=222 |archivedate=September 20, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short films ===
&lt;!-- While the Superman 75th Anniversary short does feature a few frames in the DCAU styling, please do not include it on this list. The short is an homage to Superman as a character throughout the years and not set in the canon of the DCAU --&gt;
&lt;!-- Batman Strange Days is not part of the DCAU. While it features a similar style due to being drawn by Bruce Timm, it's set in a different time period, and the character models are different. Please do not include it on this list--&gt;
*''The Dark Knight's First Night'' (1990) – A short film which acted as the developmental pilot for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
*''[[Chase Me]]'' (2003)&amp;nbsp;– A short film with no dialogue based on ''The New Batman Adventures''.
*''Batman Black &amp; White: Two of a Kind'' (2008) - A motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm's "Two-Face: Two of a Kind"
*''Mad Love'' (2008) - A 3 part motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's "Batman Adventures: Mad Love"
*''Batman Beyond'' (2014) – A short film based on ''Batman Beyond'' created by [[Darwyn Cooke]] for Batman's 75th anniversary. The short features the original voice cast of the show, as well as cameos of robotic batmen from ''The New Batman Adventures'', ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Michael Keaton]]'s Batman, [[Adam West]]'s Batman, and the original comic book Batman from 1939.

=== Web cartoons ===
*''[[Gotham Girls]]'' (2000–2002)&amp;nbsp;– A [[Adobe Flash|Macromedia Flash]] web cartoon series, this was downloadable from the WB website, and featured DCAU versions of characters voiced by their original actors. A DC Comics [[miniseries]] inspired by the web series was released in 2004. All three seasons of ''Gotham Girls'' were released on the ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' DVD box set in 2008.
*''[[Lobo (DC Comics)#Webseries|Lobo]]'' (2000)&amp;nbsp;– A Flash cartoon series starring [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], the galactic bounty hunter, the web-series is a spin-off of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' episode "The Main Man." A wax statue with the same character design as Lobo in this series appeared in an episode of ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' and he also made a reappearance in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter" briefly becoming a member of the Justice League. Both of these examples somewhat support that the webseries is part of the official DCAU, although this is still disputed. Unlike the other cartoons set in the DCAU, it has graphic violence, sexual content and strong profanity.

=== Comic books ===
{{Main article|DC animated universe (comics)}}
Many of the DCAU productions have also had [[comic book]]s created based on the characters of the various series, though their canonicity is disputable. The comics are:
&lt;!-- While some may see it as debatable that the Beyond series from 2010-2014 are canon due to their inclusion of elements from mainstream DC comics, author Kyle Higgins has stated that they "continue the animated universe" and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Although the Shadow of Sin Tzu comics don't use the animated style, they are a follow up to the DCAU based game and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;

*[[Nora Fries]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Harley Quinn]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Renee Montoya]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Sewer King (Batman)|Sewer King]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Condiment King|The Condiment King]] (''Batman: The Animated Series'')

In addition, the backstory of [[Mr. Freeze]] was adapted from his portrayal in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and the visuals and/or characterization of [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Supergirl]], [[Toyman]], [[Two-Face]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Metallo]], [[Clayface]], and many others have been applied to their comic counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} On a different note, issue #22 of DC Comics' ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, which explores alternate realities, had [[Bizarro]] transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]] patrolled by a [[Batman]] using the ''Batman Beyond'' version of the costume. A version of the future of ''Batman Beyond'' made an appearance in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #21, as part of the new Multiverse in the wake of the ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52'', and a ''Batman Beyond'' series is planned. In January 2015, DC published ''[[The Multiversity|The Multiversity Guidebook]]'' which revealed that a universe inspired by the DCAU is Earth-12 in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], and currently in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' era, while the Justice Lords Earth from the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World" has also been added to the canon as Earth-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=Wyatt, Jake|title=Maps and Legends|volume=1|issue=1|date=January 28, 2015|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|page=35|panel=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Daggett]] was adapted into the live-action film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' as a minor [[antagonist]] (renamed "John Daggett") and CEO of a rival company to Wayne Enterprises.

== The future of the DCAU ==
With the conclusion of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' animated series, Warner Bros has moved on to adapting new versions of the various DC comics properties rather than reviving the DCAU counterparts.

The last script written for DCAU continuity was titled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide''. This screenplay was created to bridge the several month gap between ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''. The draft was eventually adapted into the February 2010 film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', with the removal of any references specific to DCAU continuity, replacing Green Lantern John Stewart with Hal Jordan, and the casting of different voice actors than those of the DCAU.

In 2009, [[Bruce Timm]] was asked at a ToonZone forum if the DCAU will return in the future, and he stated this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CrTCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA517&amp;lpg=PA517&amp;dq=I+very+much+appreciate+that+so+many+of+you+guys+have+so+much+love+for+the+old+series,+from+BTAS+through+JLU+(I+do+too)+--+but+frankly,+I+doubt+that+we%27ll+be+formally,+%22officially%22+doing+another+movie+or+TV+series+set+in+that+continuity+(...)+anything+is+possible,+so+conceivably+that+could+change+someday+--+instead+of+saying+%22THE+DCAU+IS+DEAD%22,+maybe+we+can+just+say+it%27s+in+a+state+of+suspended+animation+until+further+notice...?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmuYnKz-wF&amp;sig=G1RqXQ0vAvkRHKxZtjUBUqgUea4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbvurG0r7UAhVK5SYKHY50C8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Green Lantern History: An Unauthorized Guide to the DC Comic Book Series|publisher=google.com|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I very much appreciate that so many of you guys have so much love for the old series, from BTAS through JLU (I do too) -- but frankly, I doubt that we'll be formally, "officially" doing another movie or TV series set in that continuity (...) anything is possible, so conceivably that could change someday -- instead of saying "THE DCAU IS DEAD", maybe we can just say it's in a state of suspended animation until further notice...?|Bruce Timm, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/showpost.php?p=3380444 | title=''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'' News &amp; Discussion | date=September 18, 2009 | last=Timm | first=Bruce | work=Toon Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2018, Kevin Conroy said work on the DCAU had stalled because the writers ran out of ideas for stories and believed stopping was best, as they did not want to "compromise on the quality of what they had and start creating kind of silly stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonomolo|first1=Cameron|title=Kevin Conroy Reveals The Real Reason They Stopped Making ‘Batman: The Animated Series’|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/05/27/kevin-conroy-batman-animted-series-stopped-making/|website=ComicBook.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018|date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics ===
The ''Batman Beyond'' comic series is a loose adaptation of the ''Batman Beyond'' franchise, intended to fit the character and storylines from the series into the mainstream DC continuity. The miniseries began in June 2010, under the title ''Future Evil''. In August 2010, the series was announced to continue following the completion of the first arc as an ongoing series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/08/28/batman-beyond-to-receive-an-ongoing-series/ |title=Batman Beyond To Receive An Ongoing Series |publisher=Inside Pulse |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; That series concluded alongside the entire line of ongoing monthly [[DC Comics]] superhero books during the 2011 revamp and relaunch, titled [[The New 52]].

''Superman Beyond'', a one-shot comic set in the same universe as ''Batman Beyond'', was released in 2011.

''Batman Beyond Unlimited'', a title chronicling the adventures of the future Justice League introduced in the DCAU, was released in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/11/14/dc-comics-launches-batman-beyond-unlimited/ |title=DC Comics Launches Batman Beyond Unlimited |publisher=DC Comics |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series published monthly triple-sized issues, containing three stories of Terry McGinnis, Clark "Cal" Kent, and the future Justice League Unlimited, respectively.&lt;ref name=june2013solicit&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL June 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/11080-dc-comics-full-june-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013|quote=...don't miss the epic conclusion of Superman Beyond!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Beyond Universe'' succeeded ''Unlimited'' in August 2013, condensing to double-monthly issues upon the elderly Superman's rejoining the future Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL August 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/17794-dc-comics-full-august-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry McGinnis was the central figure in ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'' weekly series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.newsarama.com/21147-dc-reveals-creative-line-ups-for-september-s-futures-end-titles.html|title=DC Reveals Creative Line-Ups For September's Futures End Titles|last=Arrant|first=Chris|publisher=Newsarama|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015-2016, DC Comics and [[IDW Publishing]] released a jointly produced, six-issue miniseries comic titled ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Batman/TMNT]]'', where the ''New 52'' Batman encounters the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|IDW incarnation]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. The success of this miniseries inspired a similar crossover story, with Batman's DCAU incarnation meeting the ''Amazing Adventures'' comic version of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 CGI series']] Turtles. The concept was first announced in late July 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-classic-90s-cartoon-batman-is-teaming-up-with-the-n-1784128183 |title=The Classic '90s Cartoon Batman Is Teaming Up With the Ninja Turtles for a New Comic |publisher=io9.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is scheduled for a six-issue release starting November 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://batman-news.com/2016/07/22/animated-style-batmanteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-announced/|title=Animated-style Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover announced|publisher=Batman-news.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Der Postillon''''' is a [[German Language|German]] [[website]], run by Stefan Sichermann featuring satirical articles reporting on international, national, and local news in newspaper and TV format. In October 2015, the Postillon had more than 14 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/p/auf-der-postilloncom-werben.html ''Auf der-postillon.com werben''.] Der Postillon, retrieved, 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Der Postillon also appears as an English version titled "The Postillon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2016/11/the-postillon.html] Der Postillon, retrieved, 10 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Stefan Sichermann, a PR expert, started the page 2008 as a hobby. Until 2011 he continued working for a PR agency.&lt;ref name="medienwoche"&gt;Ronnie Grob: [http://medienwoche.ch/2012/01/19/wahre-lugen-aus-dem-posthorn/ ''Wahre Lügen aus dem Posthorn''.] Medienwoche.ch, 19. Januar 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Onion]] was one of the inspirations for the website.&lt;ref name="Acad"&gt;[http://www.academicworld.net/artikel-allgemein/article/gestatten-der-postillon/ ''Gestatten: Der Postillon!''] Academicworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; However the website itself claims a continuous history since October 1845.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/p/der-postillon-1845-2010.html ''Der Postillon 1845–2012''.] Der Postillon.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Postillon refers to French [[postilion]] and is used in the German language in traditional or literary circumstances.

After a satirical article about the closure of [[video-on-Demand]]-page Kino.to went viral on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], Postillon received a much broader audience.&lt;ref name="medienwoche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acad"/&gt; In the meantime, Sichermann started to run the page professionally, hired some assistants and financed the emissions via advertisements, a shop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2011/10/punktlich-zum-166-jahrigen-jubilaum.html ''Pünktlich zum 166-jährigen Jubiläum: Postillon-Shop Shopillon eröffnet!''] Der Postillon, 28 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flattr]] donations. The social media impact of Postillon is higher than that of many official newsportals, such as Focus Online, Süddeutsche.de and Frankfurter Allgemeine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meedia.de/2014/04/17/social-media-charts-rtl-de-und-postillon-mit-neuen-like-rekorden/ ''Social-Media-Charts: RTL.de und Postillon mit neuen Like-Rekorden''], meedia.de, 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scoops ==
Shortly after the death of [[Steve Jobs]], the Postillon speculated about the technical features of the tech-guru's [[coffin]] and the enscription ''buried in my iTomb''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2011/10/technikjournalisten-und-fanboys.html ''Technikjournalisten und Fanboys spekulieren über Design und Features von Steve Jobs’ Sarg''.] Der Postillon, 6.10.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Angry comments of readers containing the phrase „ein Leser weniger“ (one reader less) gained notoriety as a [[running gag]] among the reader community.&lt;ref name="medienwoche" /&gt; Fans of [[Felix Baumgartner]] got angry about a Postillon entry claiming the [[Red Bull Stratos|record jump]] was declared invalid, since the Austrian crossed a foul line before the start signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2012/10/linie-ubertreten-rekordsprung-aus-39.html ''Linie übertreten: Rekordsprung aus 39 Kilometern Höhe für ungültig erklärt''.] Der Postillon, 15.10. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michèle Binswanger]]: [http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/diverses/Teenager-von-sich-selbst-sexuell-belaestigt/story/18839355 ''Teenager von sich selbst sexuell belästigt''.] tagesanzeiger.ch, 17 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2012/10/links-zwo-drei-vier-baumgartner-spezial.html ''Links! Zwo! Drei! Vier! (Baumgartner Spezial)''.] Der Postillon, 20.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 German TV host Dieter Moor used a satirical notion about the delays at [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] without reference to the origin. The Postillon had implied, the ongoing delays would require to introduce a new form of German [[Future tense]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2012/08/neue-zeitform-futur-iii-eingefuhrt-um.html ''Neue Zeitform Futur III eingeführt, um Gespräche über Berliner Flughafen zu ermöglichen''.] ''Der Postillon'', 15 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knüwer"&gt;Thomas Knüwer: [http://www.indiskretionehrensache.de/2012/08/dieter-moor-der-freundliche-plagiator-der-ard/ ''Dieter Moor, der freundliche Plagiator der ARD''.] Indiskretion Ehrensache, 20. August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Various media asked Moor to excuse himself and to mention the joke's origin.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Kruse: [http://www.stern.de/kultur/tv/ard-kultursendung-wo-titel-thesen-temperamente-seine-witze-klaut-1881516.html ''Wo „Titel, Thesen, Temperamente“ seine Witze klaut''.] Stern.de, 20 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moor acted accordingly.&lt;ref name="Knüwer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/satire-beitrag-zu-ber-moor-schreibt-bei-postillon-ab/7037284.html ''Moor schreibt bei „Postillon“ ab''.] In: ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', 22 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Pofalla]]'s change from politician to the railroad operator [[Deutsche Bahn]] was interpreted by some as fake news from Postillon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.der-postillon.com/2014/01/ex-kanzleramtsminister-ronald-pofalla.html|work=Der Postillon|title=Exklusiv: Ex-Kanzleramtsminister Ronald Pofalla wechselt in den Vorstand der Deutschen Bahn|date=2 January 2014|author=Stefan Sichermann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.de/nachrichten/netzwelt/news_artikel,-Pofalla-absurd-Wie-der-Postillon-das-Netz-doppelt-trollte-_arid,1088341.html|work=Rhein-Zeitung|title=Pofalla absurd: Wie der Postillon das Netz doppelt trollte|date=3 January 2014|author=Lars Wienand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/blogs/startseite/Pofalla-geht-zur-Bahn-Wie-die-Satire-Seite-Postillon-das-Netz-verwirrte;art145862,2236156|work=RuhrNachrichten.de|title=Pofalla geht zur Bahn - Wie die Satire-Seite Postillon das Netz verwirrte|date=3 January 2014|author=Jan Falk, Oliver Koch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postillon claimed a landlord offering [[Shooter (drink)|shots]] for each guest and German goal during [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)]] had faced ruin. The article was spread and quoted on various Russian news outlets as a true story&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2014/07/kneipenwirt-der-fur-jedes-deutsche-tor.html Kneipenwirt, der für jedes deutsche Tor einen Schnaps gratis versprochen hat, pleite], Der Postillon, 9.July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; including TV broadcaster [[Russia-24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://meedia.de/2014/07/11/der-bankrotte-barkeeper-russen-tv-faellt-auf-postillon-witz-herein/ Der bankrotte Barkeeper: Russen-TV fällt auf Postillon-Witz herein], [[Meedia]], 11 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/only_video.html?vid=608634 Video] auf vesti.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.der-postillon.com/2014/07/links-zwo-drei-vier-232.html Links!

The '''emo killings in Iraq''' were a string of homicides that were part of a campaign against Iraqi teenage boys who dressed in a Westernized [[emo#Fashion and subculture|emo style]].

== Background ==
The emo subculture gained popularity among Iraqi teens in 2011. Earlier, it had become popular in other Arab countries. Emo, an offshoot of [[hardcore punk]] music,{{cn|date=May 2014}} is associated in most of the world with teen [[fashion]] and [[social alienation |alienation]], but in the Arab world is also strongly associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bambury|first=Brent|title=Iraq emo killings: Associated Press Bureau Chief in Baghdad Lara Jakes talks about emo culture in Iraq (audio report)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Day+6/Full+Episodes/2012/ID/2210891443/?page=13&amp;sort=MostPopular|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{!}} CBC Radio|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Saudi Arabia]]'s religious police arrested 10 emo women for allegedly causing a disturbance in a coffee shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-23/saudi-emo-girls-busted-by-religious-cops/836866|title=Saudi 'emo' girls busted by religious cops|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, conservative Egyptians criticized emo fashion-followers in [[Cairo]] for being "disciples of Satan and homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=al-Attabi|first=Kadhim|title=Emo subculture on the rise among Baghdad teens|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1656804.php/Emo-subculture-on-the-rise-among-Baghdad-teens|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Monsters and Critics|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is not illegal in Iraq but it is taboo, and many [[LGBT]] (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender) people in Iraq are discriminated against, abused or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi 'emo' youths reportedly killed by conservative militias|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17333275|accessdate=11 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2012, the Baghdad [[Morality Police (Iraq)|Morality Police]] published a statement on the Iraqi Interior Ministry website criticizing emo teens for wearing "strange, tight clothes with pictures of skulls on them," and "rings in their noses and tongues." The statement condemned emo as [[Quake 3 Arena|Satanic]], and quoted Colonel [[Mushtaq Taleb al-Mahemdawi]] as saying the Morality Police had been given official approval by the Interior Ministry "to eliminate [the phenomenon] as soon as possible since it's detrimentally affecting the society and becoming a danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Truth Check: Is Iraq Killing Hundreds of Emo Teens?|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/03/truth-check-iraq-killing-hundreds-emo-teens/49736/|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Monthly|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that in the weeks following, anti-emo flyers, threatening death "unless gay men cut their hair, stopped wearing the clothing of devil worshippers and stopped listening to metal, emo and rap music", began appearing in neighbourhoods across Baghdad.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

[[Ministry of Interior (Iraq)|Interior Ministry]] security officers say the number of dead is six.

Following coverage of the murders, Iraqi officials denied there is any campaign to kill gay or emo teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruhayem|first=Rami|title=Iraq's Emo killings: A horror story out of control?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450437|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and said the story has been made up to serve anti-religious, anti-government agendas. They say emo teens can dress as they please, and that the government will protect them.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Arabiya News" /&gt;

In September 2012, the BBC interviewed 17 gay men and former policemen in Baghdad, all of whom had friends or boyfriends killed, and reported that all blamed the Iraqi Interior Ministry for inciting the murders, and said arrests and killings are still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=BBC investigation reveals police persecution of gays in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19570870|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
In May 2012 as a result of the emo killings, according to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]], the Dutch government "expanded" its asylum policy towards LGBT Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Baseline Study 2013|url=http://iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003222620/http://www.iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 October 2013|publisher=The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission  (IGLHRC)|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. State Department|U.S. State department]]'s 2013 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] for Iraq reported that in 2013, Iraq's [[Cabinet of Iraq|Council of Ministers]] established an inter-ministerial committee that issued a statement saying LGBT people are "no different" from others, and that established a [[charter]] to describe the baseline protection owed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Human Rights Report 2013|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220565.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State • Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Israeli intelligence analyst Daniel Brode claims the murders are part of an overall shift inside the Iraqi Shiite-Arab population towards becoming "more religious, more conservative and more assertive," with the goal of consolidating its own power by creating a "fundamentalist Shiite government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brode|first=Daniel|title=Iraq: The Next Shiite Islamic Republic?|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=51322|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=Middle East Online|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[2003_invasion_of_iraq|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], sexual minorities there enjoyed a fair amount of freedom. But the invasion brought to power the conservative [[Islamic Dawa Party]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] says that since 2004, hundreds of Iraqi gay men have been killed. The campaign has been said to be led by the Mahdi Army, with Iraqi security forces said to have "colluded and joined in the killing." Witnesses told Human Rights Watch the killers break into houses and pick up people in the street, interrogating them to extract the names of other victims, and then kill them and mutilate their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-gay attacks on rise in Iraq|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8204853.stm|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, according to the London-based human rights organization [[Iraqi LGBT]], Iraqi political and religious organizations had launched an organised, coordinated campaign to hunt, arrest, torture and kill everyone they perceived as gay. Iraqi LGBT says the Iraqi government forces gay people to give names and addresses of other gays, then arrests them and hands them over to paramilitary groups to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilli|first=Ali|title=Viewpoint: Iraqi gays in 'hell on earth'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19525137|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, American [[human rights]] activist [[Scott_Long_(human_rights_activist)|Scott Long]] described Iraq as "a devastated society with a broken political process and a fractured public" and said "it's not just wrong, it's counterproductive to call these murders "gay killings."" He called on Iraq to begin a debate about difference, saying "Iraqis need to discuss why the horrors of the last four decades have made otherness seem intolerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Long|first=Scott|title=Massacre of emos in Iraq goes to core of a damaged society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/iraq-massacre-emos-killing-gay|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[chronology]] and [[periodization]], an '''epoch''' is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular [[calendar era|era]]. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. [[Time#Measurement|Time measurement units]] are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.

Events taking place before the epoch can be dated by counting negatively from the epoch, though in pragmatic [[periodization]] practice, epochs are defined for the past, and another epoch is used to start the next era, therefore serving as the ending of the older preceding era. The whole purpose and criteria of such definitions are to clarify and co-ordinate scholarship about a period, at times, across disciplines.

Epochs are generally chosen to be convenient or significant by a consensus of the time scale's initial users, or by authoritarian fiat. The epoch moment or date is usually defined by ''a specific clear event'', condition, or criterion—the epoch event or epoch criterion—from which the period or era or age is usually characterized or described.

== Calendar eras ==
=== Regnal eras ===
{{see|Regnal era}}
The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year.
A similar [[Chinese era name|system]] existed in [[China]] before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the [[Xuantong]] period). With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

=== Pre-modern eras ===
* [[Olympiad]]s, the ancient Greek era of four-year periods beginning in 776 BC.
* [[Ab urbe condita]] (753 BC), used in the Roman imperial period.
* The [[Anno Domini]] or "[[Common Era]]" era, still in use with the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Julian calendar]]s today, marks the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]] as calculated in the 6th century by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackburn |first1=B |last2=Holford-Strevens |first2=L |date=2003 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Incarnation era |page=881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Byzantine calendar]] (5509 BC).
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (3761 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/counting-the-years/ |title=Counting the Jewish Years |website=myjewishlearning.com |last=Solomin |first=Rachel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Scott E. |date=2006 |url=http://www.rosettacalendar.com/calendars.html |title=Overview of Calendars |website=rosettacalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Islamic calendar]] counts "lunar years" by ''Anno Hegiræ'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') or ''AH'' era (AD 622). The year count shifts relative to the solar year as the calendar is [[lunar calendar|purely lunar]]. The official [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] (used in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iran]]) also dates from the ''hijra'', but as it is a [[solar calendar]] its year numbering does not coincide with the religious calendar.
* The term [[Hindu calendar]] may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the [[Vikram Samvat]] (58 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-70238-6| last1 = Dershowitz| first1 = Nachum| authorlink1 = Nachum Dershowitz | last2 = Reingold| first2 = Edward M.| authorlink2 = Edward Reingold  |title = Calendrical Calculations| date = 2008 | page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used in modern times as  "national calendar" of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].
*   [[Buddhist calendar]]s tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of Buddha's ''[[parinirvana]]'').

=== Modern eras ===
* The [[Baha'i calendar]] is dated from the vernal equinox of the year the [[Báb]] proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in Váḥids of 19 years, and Kull-i-Shay’s of 361 (19 x 19) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. G. |last=Richards |chapter=Calendars |editor-first1=S.

* In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
* In the [[French Republican Calendar]], a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy).
* The [[Indian national calendar]], introduced in 1957, follows the [[Saka era]] (AD 78).
* [[Minguo calendar]] used by officials of [[Taiwan]] and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|its predecessor]] since January 1, 1912, the first year after [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] and the subsequent establishment of the republic.
* [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* In the scientific [[Before Present]] system of numbering years for purposes of [[radiocarbon dating]], the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the use of January 1 is quite irrelevant, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c14dating.com/agecalc.html |website=c14dating.com |title=Radiocarbon dating – Age calculation |last=Higham |first=Thomas |authorlink1= Thomas Higham |publisher=Thomas Higham |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver |first=Minze |author2=Polach HA |year=1977 |title=Discussion; reporting of C-14 data. |journal=Radiocarbon |publisher=University of Arizona |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=355–363 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/493/498 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different branches of [[Freemasonry]] have selected different years to date their documents according to a [[Masonic era]], such as the [[Anno Lucis]] (A.L.).

== Astronomy ==

{{Main|Epoch (astronomy)}}

In astronomy, an epoch is a specific moment in time for which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] or [[orbital elements]] are specified, and from which other orbital parametrics are thereafter calculated in order to predict future position. The applied tools of the mathematics disciplines of [[Celestial mechanics]] or its subfield [[Orbital mechanics]] (both predict orbital paths and positions) about a [[center of gravity]] are used to generate an [[ephemeris]] (plural: ''ephemerides''; from the Greek word ''ephemeros'' = daily) which is a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by some point on the orbit, and the two foci of the [[ellipse]]. Viewing from another orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. These dynamics in three dimensions are also elliptical, which means the ephemeris need only specify one set of equations to be a useful predictive tool to predict future location of the object of interest.

Over time, inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of prediction, so ephemeris factors need to be recalculated from time to time, and that requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define epochs to suit themselves, but in these days of speedy communications, the epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers worldwide can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone for data observed by one group to need translation (mathematic transformation) so other groups could compare information.

=== J2000.0 ===
The current standard epoch is called "[[J2000.0]]" This is defined by international agreement to be equivalent to:
# The [[Gregorian date]] January 1, 2000 at approximately 12:00 GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]).
# The [[Julian date]] 2451545.0 TT ([[Terrestrial Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI ([[International Atomic Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |title=Glossary: Terrestrial Dynamical Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]).{{efn|This article uses a 24-hour clock, so 11:59:27.816 is equivalent to 11:59:27.816 AM.}}

== Computing == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Microsoft Office Excel]] --&gt;
The [[system time|time kept internally]] by a [[computer]] system is usually expressed as the number of time units that have elapsed since a specified epoch, which is nearly always specified as midnight [[Universal Time]] on some particular date.

Software timekeeping systems vary widely in the granularity of their time units; some systems may use time units as large as a day, while others may use [[nanosecond]]s. For example, for an epoch date of midnight UTC (00:00) on January 1, 1900, and a time unit of a second, the time of the midnight (24:00) between January 1 and 2, 1900 is represented by the number 86400, the number of seconds in one day. When times prior to the epoch need to be represented, it is common to use the same system, but with negative numbers.

These representations of time are mainly for internal use. If an end user interaction with dates and times is required, the software will nearly always convert this internal number into a date and time representation that is comprehensible to humans.

=== Notable epoch dates in computing ===
{{See also|System time}}
The following table lists epoch dates used by popular software and other computer-related systems. The time in these systems is stored as the quantity of a particular time unit (days, seconds, nanoseconds, etc.) that has elapsed since a stated time (usually midnight UTC at the beginning of the given date).

=== Problems with epoch-based computer time representation ===

Computers do not generally store arbitrarily large numbers. Instead, each number stored by a computer is allotted a fixed amount of space. Therefore, when the number of time units that have elapsed since a system's epoch exceeds the largest number that can fit in the space allotted to the time representation, the time representation [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]], and problems can occur. While a system's behavior after overflow occurs is not necessarily predictable, in most systems the number representing the time will reset to zero, and the computer system will think that the current time is the epoch time again.

Most famously, older systems which counted time as the number of years elapsed since the epoch of January 1, 1900 and which only allotted enough space to store the numbers 0 through 99, experienced the [[Year 2000 problem]]. These systems (if not corrected beforehand) would interpret the date January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, leading to unpredictable errors at the beginning of the year 2000.

Even systems which allocate more storage to the time representation are not immune from this kind of error. Many [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s which keep time as seconds elapsed from the epoch date of January 1, 1970, and allot timekeeping enough storage to store numbers as large as  {{nowrap|2 147 483 647}} will experience an overflow problem on January 19, 2038 if not fixed beforehand. This is known as the [[Year 2038 problem]]. A correction involving doubling the storage allocated to timekeeping on these systems will allow them to represent dates more than 290 billion years into the future.

Other more subtle timekeeping problems exist in computing, such as accounting for [[leap second]]s, which are not observed with any predictability or regularity. Additionally, applications which need to represent historical dates and times (for example, representing a date prior to the switch from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]) must use specialized timekeeping [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Finally, some software must maintain compatibility with older software that does not keep time in strict accordance with traditional timekeeping systems. For example, [[Microsoft Excel]] observes the fictional date of [[February 29, 1900]] in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of [[Lotus 1-2-3]].&lt;ref name="excel-leapyear" /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 observed the date due to an error; by the time the error was discovered, it was too late to fix it—"a change now would disrupt formulas which were written to accommodate this anomaly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward |author-link2=Edward Reingold |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author-link1=Nachum Dershowitz |date=2008 |edition=3rd |title=Calendrical Calculations |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70238-6 |pages=xxi, xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epoch in satellite-based time systems ===

There are at least six [[satellite navigation]] systems, all of which function by transmitting [[time signal]]s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage, [[GPS]] calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas [[GLONASS]] calculates time as an offset from [[UTC]], with the UTC input adjusted for [[leap seconds]]. Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage, [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] calculates from an epoch and [[Compass navigation system|Beidou]] calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Time_References_in_GNSS |title=Time References in GNSS |first1=J.

Juan |last2=Zornoza |first3=M. |last3=Hernández-Pajares |date=2011 |website=gssc.esa.int/navipedia |publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a [[leap second]], requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.
The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the [[European Space Agency]] in Galileo documentation under "Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/gst2016.pdf |title=GNSS Timescale Description Galileo |publisher=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs |date=2016 |at=Section 5d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Jan Jedermann (played by [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]) is an ingenious [[fashion designer]], but also an unscrupulous [[showman]]. He dies in a car accident and ruminates during his last hours about how one more night in his life could have gone by. He just cannot accept that Death comes to get him on the evening of his greatest triumph, a fashion show set on the roof of the [[Vienna]] [[Opera]]. He makes a pact with Death, allowing him to remain among the living at least until the morning.

C. Heath and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil status can also occur for [[word sense]]s and for [[phrase]]s. An example for a word sense is 'navy' in '[[merchant navy]]', which means 'commercial fleet' (although that sense of navy is obsolete elsewhere). An example for a phrase is '[[wikt:in point|in point]]' (relevant), which is retained in the larger phrases '[[wikt:case in point|case in point]]' (also 'case on point' in the legal context) and '[[wikt:in point of fact|in point of fact]]', but is rarely used outside of a legal context.

'''Gaur''' ('today' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) was a Basque artistic group founded in 1966 by [[Amable Arias]], [[Rafael Ruiz Balerdi]], [[Nestor Basterretxea]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Remigio Mendiburu]], [[Jorge Oteiza]], [[José Antonio Sistiaga]], and [[José Luis Zumeta]].&lt;ref name="Bilbao"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/amable-balerdi-basterretxea-chillida-mendiburu-oteiza-sistiaga-zumeta-243|title=Amable, Balerdi, Basterretxea, Chillida, Mendiburu, Oteiza, Sistiaga, Zumeta|publisher=Bilbao Fine Arts Museum|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-guard group, based in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain, provided the springboard for a wide [[History of the Basques|Basque]] artistic movement with close links to influential social, cultural and political agents in the Basque Country opposed to Franco's dictatorship during the 70s and early 80s. 

The group launched with an exhibition on 28 April 1966 at the Barandiarán Gallery in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss2016.eu/en/news/item/2630-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-gaur-group-the-barandiaran-gallery-and-the-contemporary-art-in-the-exhibition-1966-gaur-konstelazioak-2016|title=The 50th anniversary of the Gaur Group, the Barandiaran Gallery and the contemporary art in the exhibition 1966 {{!}} Gaur Konstelazioak {{!}} 2016|work=dss2016.eu|publisher=San Sebastian 2016 – Donostia 2016|date=22 January 2016|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/1/eduardo-chillida/obra/grupo-gaur|title=Grupo Gaur|trans-title=Gaur Group|publisher=Artium|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged the aesthetic moulds and artistic conventions prevailing during that period in Gipuzkoa, and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] altogether. The artists founding the movement stirred at the rapid economic and social changes taking place at the moment, the virtually non-existent cultural scene, and the crisis of the Basque collective identity.

It stood out as the most prolific artistic group in a constellation of groups founded across all the Basque Country during the same period that made up the Basque Art School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">'''Genealogy Tourism''', sometimes called roots tourism, is a segment of the [[tourism]] market consisting of tourists who have ancestral connections to their holiday destination. These [[genealogy]] tourists travel to the land of their ancestors to reconnect with their past and "walk in the footsteps of their forefathers".&lt;ref&gt;Feng, K., &amp; Page, S. (2000). An exploratory study of tourism, migration–immigration nexus: 	Travel experience of Chinese residence in New Zealand. Current Issues of Tourism, 3(3), 246–281&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Genealogy tourism is a worldwide industry, although it is more prominent in countries that have experienced [[Mass migration|mass emigration]] at some time in history and thus have a large worldwide [[Diaspora]] community.

==Europe==
Genealogy tourism has been prominent in [[Ireland]]; recorded genealogy tourism peaked in the year 2000 as 116,000 genealogical visitors traveled to the island.&lt;ref&gt;Bord Fáilte (2001), Genealogy Facts 2000. Dublin: Bord Fáilte, Market research Planning&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fáilte Ireland|Irish Tourist Board]] ceased recording genealogy visitors numbers from 2004, and its present levels are now unknown.  [[Scotland]] staged a homecoming festival in 2009 to appeal to genealogy tourists.

Genealogy tourism is very common to countries of [[Central Europe]] where the [[World War II]] caused mass migrations of population. Particularly Jewish genealogy tourism is very popular and on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewish-guide.pl/genealogy/genealogy-in-poland|title=Genealogy in Poland - Polin Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jewish-guide.pl|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
Many African Americans and other Diaspora Africans were motivated to travel to the African homelands by  [[Alex Haley|Alex Haley's]] [[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|best-selling book]] and 1977 television mini-series ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, K. M. "Mapping Transnationality: Roots Tourism and the Institutionalization of Ethnic Heritage". In K. M. Clarke &amp; D.A. Thomas (Eds.), ''Globalization and Race: Transformations in the Cultural Production of Blackness'', Duke University Press, Durham, 2006. pp. 133-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Santana Pinho, P. "African-American roots tourism in Brazil", ''Latin American Perspectives'', 2008, Vol.35 No. 3, pp 70-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mensah&gt;Mensah, I  (2015): The roots tourism experience of diaspora Africans: A focus on the Cape Coast and Elmina Castles, Journal of Heritage Tourism, DOI:10.1080/1743873X.2014.990974&lt;/ref&gt; Areas frequently visited include [[Cape Coast]] and [[Elmina Castle|Elmina]] in Ghana, [[Goree Island]] in Senegal, [[Jufureh|Juffureh]] in Gambia and [[Bahia]] in Brazil. African governments recognized this opportunity for development in tourism. Successive governments in Ghana, for example, have made efforts through the Ministry of Tourism to attract Diaspora Africans to Ghana, including the African African-American summit in 1999, the biannual Pan-African Historical Theatre Festival, [[Emancipation Day]] celebrations and [[Juneteenth]].&lt;ref name=mensah /&gt;

==Genealogy==
Genealogy tourists often participate in tracing their ancestral lineages; digital access to historical records, as well as DNA studies in recent years, have allowed an increasing number of people to identify the homelands of their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, G. (2012). Seeking roots and tracing lineages: constructing a framework of reference for roots and genealogical tourism. Journal of Heritage Tourism, 7(3), 189-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8999">[[File:Gunthertuch.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}'', Diocesan Museum, [[Bamberg]]]]
The so-called '''''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘Gunther's shroud’) is a [[Byzantine silk]] [[tapestry]] which represents the [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] return of a [[Byzantine Emperor]] from a victorious campaign. The piece was purchased, or possibly received as a gift, by [[Gunther von Bamberg]], [[Bishop]] of [[Bamberg]], during his 1064–65 pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. Gunther died on his return journey, and was buried with it in the [[Bamberg Cathedral]]. The fabric was rediscovered in 1830, and is now exhibited in the Bamberg Diocesan Museum.

== History ==
In November 1064, Gunther took part in the so-called "[[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–1065|Great German Pilgrimage]]" to [[Jerusalem]], under the leadership of the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] [[Siegfried I (Archbishop of Mainz)|Siegfried I]], the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishop of Utrecht]] [[William I (Bishop of Utrecht)|William I]], and the [[Bishop of Regensburg]], [[Otto von Riedenburg]]. The pilgrims, numbering some 7,000 people, journeyed through [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and then through the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last= Holder-Egger | editor-first=Oswald | title = Lamperti monachi Hersfeldensis Opera.

At [[Constantinople]], the Byzantine capital, Gunther's imposing stature and his elegant clothes led to the belief that he was the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], travelling incognito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schmugge | first = Ludwig | title = Über "nationale" Vorurteile im Mittelalter | journal = Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters | volume = 38 | year = 1982 | pages = 439–459 | url = http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/gcs-wrapper/?gcsurl=http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8086%252Fgcs%252Fgcs%253F%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526%2526action%253Dpdf%2526metsFile%253DPPN345858735_0038%2526divID%253Dlog32%2526pdftitlepage%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.digizeitschriften.de%25252Fmain%25252Fdms%25252Fpdf-titlepage%25252F%25253FmetsFile%25253DPPN345858735_0038%252526divID%25253Dlog32%2526targetFileName%253D_log32.pdf | language = de }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how Gunther came by the silk. The Byzantinist Günter Prinzing theorized that the cloth was actually used as a wall tapestry in the [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref name="prig"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Günter | last = Prinzing | contribution = Das Bamberger Gunthertuch in neuer Sicht | title = Byzantium and Its Neighbours, from the Mid-9th till the 12th Centuries | editor-first = Vladimír | editor-last = Vavrínek | journal = Byzantinoslavica | volume = 54 | year = 1993 | pages = 218–231|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther von Bamberg died on 23 July 1065 during his return journey at [[Székesfehérvár]] due to a severe illness. The other pilgrims brought his body home to Bamberg, wrapped in the cloth. There he was buried until rediscovered on 22 December 1830, when Gunther's grave was opened as part of extensive restoration works on the cathedral.&lt;ref name="steph"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stephenson | first = Paul | title = The Legend of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0PmrXKnczUC | isbn = 978-0-521-81530-7 | pages = 62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the ''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}'' is exhibited alongside 11th-century imperial robes, the regalia and vestments of [[Pope Clement II]] and other items in the Diocesan Museum of Bamberg (''{{lang|de|Diözesanmuseum Bamberg}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Exponate im Haus | publisher = Diözesanmuseum des Erzbistums Bamberg | accessdate = 06-09-2010 | url = http://www.dioezesanmuseum-bamberg.de/exponate/index.html|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The cloth is a woven using the [[tapestry]] technique.&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Muthesius, Anna, "Silk in the Medieval World". In Jenkins, David, ed., ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-34107-8}}, pp. 350-351.&lt;/ref&gt; It is 218 cm high and 211 cm wide, showing a Byzantine emperor on a patterned background. He is riding on a white horse, wears a Byzantine-style imperial crown, and carries a miniature ''[[labarum]]'' on his right hand. The emperor is flanked by two ''[[Tyche]]'' figures, female personifications of a city's fortune. They are crowned with [[mural crown]]s and dressed in ankle-long yellow undergarments and coloured transparent over-tunics. The ''Tyche'' on the right, with a green over-tunic, presents the emperor probably with a crown, while the left one, dressed in blue, holds the ''[[toupha]]'', a headgear reserved exclusively for triumphs. Both figures are represented barefoot, a symbolic convention typical of slaves, signifying their submission to the emperor, or to represent their divinity as the goddess of fortune.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Tzimiskes returns.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The triumphal return of John Tzimiskes to Constantinople in 971, as depicted in the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]''. A carriage with the icon of the Virgin Mary precedes the emperor, who is followed by the captive Bulgarian tsar [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris II]].]]
The emperor was initially identified, by the French Byzantinist [[André Grabar]], with [[Basil II]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 976–1025), and his triumphal return from his [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|wars]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="Grabar"&gt;{{cite journal | first = André | last = Grabar | title = La soie byzantine de l'eveque Gunther a la Cathedrale de Bamberg | journal = Münchener Jahrbuch | volume = 7 | year = 1956 | page = 227|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research however has concluded that the cloth represents [[John I Tzimiskes]] (r. 969–976) and his return in 971 from his [[Siege of Dorostolon|campaign]] against the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], who had [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invaded and occupied]] Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="prig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;

According to the contemporary historian [[Leo the Deacon]], during his triumphal procession Tzimiskes rode on a white horse behind a wagon carrying an icon of the [[Virgin Mary]] as well as the Bulgarian regalia, with the captive [[Boris II of Bulgaria]] and his family following behind Tzimiskes.&lt;ref name="steph2"&gt;{{citation | last=Stephenson | first=Paul| title=Byzantium's Balkan Frontier: A Political Study of the Northern Balkans, 900–1204  | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 | isbn=0-521-77017-3  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ILiOI0UgxHoC | pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later account of [[John Skylitzes]] differs in some details in the description of the procession, but both sources agree that on this occasion, Tzimiskes rode a white horse, and that two Bulgarian crowns played an important role in the proceedings. Both authors also agree that one of these crowns was a ''[[tiara]]'' (i.e. the ''toupha''), in accordance with the ''{{lang|de|Gunthertuch}}''’s depiction.&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;

Older sources interpreted the two ''Tychae'' as representing [[Rome]] and Constantinople ("New Rome"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Percy Ernst | last = Schramm | title = Das Herrscherbild in der Kunst des frühen Mittelalters | journal = Vorträge der Bibliothek Warburg, 2 (1922–23) | pages = 159–161|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Josef | last = Deér | title = Die heilige Krone Ungarns | publisher = Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften | location = Vienna | year = 1966 | page = 59|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[Athens]] and Constantinople, the two cities where Basil II celebrated his victory over the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="Grabar"/&gt; A different proposal suggested, based on the colour of their clothes, that they represented the Blues and the Greens, the two traditional ''demoi'' ([[Chariot racing|circus parties]]) of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="prig"/&gt; Modern scholarship on the other hand suggests that they may represent the two major cities captured during Tzimiskes' campaign, [[Preslav]] and [[Dorostolon]]. It is significant in this context that these two cities were renamed into ''Ioannoupolis'' (after the emperor) and ''Theodoroupolis'' (after [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodore the Stratelate]], who was believed to have intervened in the final battle against the Rus' before Dorostolon).&lt;ref name="steph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steph2"/&gt;

'''''Harvester''''' is a 1996 [[point-and-click adventure game]] written and directed by Gilbert P. Austin, known for its violent content, cult following, and examination of the relationship between fictional violence and actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elston|first=Brett|title=The bloodiest games you've never played|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-bloodiest-games-youve-never-played/?page=3|publisher=Games Radar|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storyline ==
The game stars Steve, who awakes with a case of [[amnesia]] in a strange town in 1953 called Harvest. No one there believes he is genuinely amnesiac. All of the town inhabitants are extremely eccentric and many appear to be more a satire or stereotype than real people. They all continuously stress to Steve that he should join the Lodge, which is a large building located at the center of town that serves as the headquarters of the Order of the [[harvest moon|Harvest Moon]]. Steve visits the [[Sergeant at Arms]] at the Lodge, who tells him that all of his questions will be answered inside the building. To enter, he must first join the Order of the Harvest Moon. But in order to join, he must perform a series of tasks that range from simple vandalism to arson for his initiation.

While snooping around town, performing these tasks and learning more about Harvest, Steve visits the Pottsdam residence. Here he meets the overweight and perverted Mr. Pottsdam, who tells Steve that he is to marry his daughter, Stephanie, in a few weeks. Steve meets his alleged wife-to-be upstairs. She explains that she has amnesia as well, and, like Steve, notices that something doesn't seem right about the town. Over a series of days Steve successfully performs all of the required tasks. When he visits Stephanie in her room, he finds nothing but a mutilated skull and spinal cord. He takes it to the Sergeant of Arms and asks him if this is really the remains of Stephanie, to which the Sergeant explains that, inside the Lodge, he will learn the truth, and grants Steve access.

Inside the Lodge Steve visits three floors consisting of mayhem and murder. He must solve various puzzles along the way as well as visit different rooms, referred to as “temples” by their occupants, where he must take on several moral decisions. Eventually he makes it to the Inner Sanctum, where he talks to Principal Herrill of Harvest's Gein Memorial School, who explains that he is second in command of the Harvest Order and is to be addressed as Vice Muck Herrill. The head of the Harvest Order, the Grand Muckity Muck, shares a few short words with Steve, and then attacks him. Steve kills the Grand Muckity Muck and meets the Sergeant at Arms one last time.

He reveals Stephanie to him, who is alive but hooked up to a special torture device, which gave her pain whenever Steve climbed a rope in the Lodge. He releases her from the device and explains to Steve that everything in Harvest is created by a [[virtual reality]] simulator, which he and Stephanie are hooked up to. The Sergeant at Arms explains that this simulation was created in hopes of successfully turning Steve into a [[serial killer]] in [[real life]]. He then gives Steve an ultimatum: Marry and live out the rest of his life with Stephanie in the virtual reality that is Harvest or kill Stephanie. She will die in real life but Steve will be released and free to live in the real world as a serial killer.

If the player chooses to kill Stephanie, Steve beats Stephanie to death and then removes her skull and spinal cord. After the murder is complete, Steve awakens within the virtual reality simulator. Steve, hitchhiking, brutally murders the driver. Steve returns home, where he plays ''Harvester'' with his computer. His mother disapproves the game and criticizes violence in video games by saying that people who watch violence commit violence. Steve ridicules his mother's assertions and laughs at her comparison of violent media to "[[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Road Runner cartoons]]."

If the player chooses to spare Stephanie's life, the Sergeant at Arms expresses disappointment. Steve says that he'd rather die than become a serial killer, to which the Sergeant at Arms responds that he should enjoy his life "such as it is". Steve marries Stephanie in a ceremony officiated by the Sergeant at Arms and the two have a child together. Their graves are then shown, followed by the death of their bodies in real life as their virtual lives only lasted a few minutes.

== Gameplay==
The game utilizes a [[point and click]] interface. Players must visit various locations within the game's fictional town of Harvest via an overhead map. By speaking to various townspeople and clicking on special "hotspots", players can learn information and collect items that progress the game's story and play. ''Harvester'' also features a fighting system where players can attack other characters by selecting a weapon and then clicking on the target. Both the target and the player's character have a limited amount of health available, allowing for either the player or the target to die. Players can choose to progress through the game by solving puzzles or by killing one of the non-playable characters.

== Development and controversy ==
''Harvester'' was developed by FutureVision (renamed DigiFX by the time of the game's release). Writer/director Gilbert P. Austin recounted:{{quote|My feeling was that FutureVision, being a small company, would need something “high concept” to compete with the industry giants of the time, and I argued that Harvester was exactly that idea. It was really the only idea that I pitched. I remember that it came to me in a flash. That’s how I get a lot of my ideas, in creative rushes where I can barely write fast enough to get it all down. ... The concept of Harvester, the idea that at the end of the game I wanted the player to mull over whether he had internalized the over-the-top violence and surreal imagery of the game in the same manner that Steve had, and the primary ending…all this was in the initial concept that I jotted down in one of those small reporter spiral notepads in about 30 minutes. That’s what I pitched to FutureVision, and they bought it.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gogcom.tumblr.com/post/92424446858/harvester-gilbert-austin-interview|title=Inside Harvester - A Fan Interview with Gilbert P.

''Harvester'' was first announced to the public at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1994 in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; The video footage was all filmed in the back warehouse of publisher Merit Software.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; Though he was only contracted as the game's writer, Austin voluntarily directed the filming to ensure it stayed true to his vision for the game.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; Austin finished the creative work in autumn 1994 and moved on to the other projects, leaving producer Lee Jacobson in sole charge of the remaining development.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; The game was set to be released the same year but the programming took two years to finish, and it became a commercial failure.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;

In a December 1996 press conference, [[David Walsh (psychologist)|Dr. David Walsh]] released a list of games that he considered to be excessively violent. Jacobson publicly demanded that ''Harvester'', which was not included in Dr. Walsh's list, be added to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=What Is Senator Lieberman's Problem with Videogames? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaming journalist Christian Svensson described Jacobson's actions as "shameless", and did not refer to Jacobson, DigiFX, or ''Harvester'' by name so as not to provide positive reinforcement for such publicity seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Svensson |first=Christian |title=Lieberman Back in Action |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene in which children cannibalize their mother was censored in Europe.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt; In Germany, the game was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weirdretro.org.uk/captains-blog/retro-gaming-harvester-1996|title=Retro Gaming: Harvester (1996)|website=Weird Retro|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was designed by DigiFX Interactive and published by Merit Studios in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=qDDmUujPNezgsATnyYHYBA&amp;id=6eEzAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Harvester%22+%22+DigiFX+Interactive%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Harvester%22+|title=Computer Gaming World, Volumes 150-153|publisher=Golden Empire Publications|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2014, Lee Jacobson [[Reissue|re-release]]d it in [[GOG.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/release_harvester|title=Release: Harvester|author=[[GOG.com]]|date=2014-03-06|publisher=[[CD Projekt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for PC and Mac.

''Harvester'' received "mixed or average" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave ''Harvester'' a positive review upon its initial release,&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; but panned it in a 2011 review where they called it  the "goriest, most confusing, and above all ''stupidest'' horror game ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=May 14, 2011 |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-harvester/ |title=Saturday Crapshoot: Harvester |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Allgame]]'' remarked that the game's delayed release negatively impacted its reception, as the game felt dated when it was finally released.

{{IPA notice}}
The '''[[phonology|phonological]] system of the [[Hawaiian language]]''' is based on documentation from those who developed the Hawaiian alphabet during the 1820s as well as scholarly research conducted by lexicographers and linguists from 1949 to present.

Hawaiian has only eight consonant [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/{{IPA link|p}}, {{IPA link|k}} ⁓ {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|ʔ}}, {{IPA link|h}}, {{IPA link|m}}, {{IPA link|n}}, {{IPA link|l}} ⁓ {{IPA link|ɾ}}, {{IPA link|w}} ⁓ {{IPA link|v}}/}}. There is [[allophone|allophonic variation]] of {{IPA|[k]}} with {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[w]}} with {{IPA|[v]}}, and {{IPA|[l]}} with {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. The {{IPA|[t]}}–{{IPA|[k]}} variation is highly unusual among the world's languages.

Hawaiian has either 5 or 25 vowel phonemes, depending on how long vowels and [[diphthong]]s are analyzed. If the long vowels and diphthongs are treated as two-phoneme sequences, the total of vowel phonemes is five. However, if the long vowels and diphthongs are treated as separate, unit phonemes, there are 25 vowel phonemes. The short vowel phonemes are {{IPA|/{{IPA link|u}},&amp;nbsp;{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|o}}, {{IPA link|e}},&amp;nbsp;{{IPA link|a}}/}}. If long vowels are counted separately, they are {{IPA|/uː,&amp;nbsp;iː, oː, eː,&amp;nbsp;aː/}}. If diphthongs are counted separately, they are {{IPA|/iu,&amp;nbsp;ou, oi, eu, ei, au, ai, ao, ae, oːu, eːi, aːu, aːi, aːo,&amp;nbsp;aːe/}}. There is some [[allophone|allophonic]] variation of the vowels, but it is much less dramatic than that of the consonants.

Hawaiian syllable structure is (C)V(V) where C is any consonant and V is any vowel. Double vowels (VV) may be long vowels or diphthongs. All CV(V) syllables occur except for ''wū'', but ''wu'' occurs only in two words borrowed from English. Word stress is predictable in words of one to four syllables but not in words of five or more syllables. Phonological processes in Hawaiian include palatalization and deletion of consonants and the raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels. Phonological reduction (or "decay") of consonant phonemes during the historical development of Hawaiian has resulted in the phonemic glottal stop. The ultimate loss (deletion) of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in long vowels and diphthongs.

==Phonemes and allophones ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hawaiian language]] --&gt;
The following description of Hawaiian phonemes and their allophones is based on the experiences of the people who developed the Hawaiian alphabet, as described by Schütz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=83–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the descriptions of Hawaiian pronunciation and phonology made by Lyovin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|pp=258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elbert &amp; Pukui.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui |1979|pp=10–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pukui1986a"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui |1986|p=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional details on glottal consonants are found in Carter.&lt;ref name="Carter1996"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that Hawaiian does not distinguish between {{IPAblink|t}} and {{IPAblink|k}}. Few languages do not make this distinction, though several [[Polynesian languages]] have independently undergone the historical shift from /t/ to /k/ after the change of /k/ to /ʔ/; Samoan is notable for using [t] in colloquial speech where [k] is used in formal speech. The American missionaries who developed written Hawaiian during the 1820s found that a {{IPA|[t]}} reflex was common at the Kaua{{okina}}i (''Taua{{okina}}i'') end of the island chain, and a {{IPA|[k]}} reflex at the Big Island (island of Hawai{{okina}}i) end. They decided to use {{angle bracket|k}} rather than {{angle bracket|t}} to represent this phoneme. However, that does not prevent anyone from using the ''t'' realization, in speaking or in writing, if they so desire. ''T'' is used more than ''k'' by speakers of Ni{{okina}}ihau Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionaries also found allophonic variation between {{IPAblink|ɹ}} and {{IPAblink|ɾ}} (written with ''d'') and {{IPAblink|l}}, between {{IPAblink|v}} and {{IPAblink|w}}, and between {{IPAblink|b}} and {{IPAblink|p}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consonants ==
Hawaiian has one of the smallest consonant inventories ([[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], the smallest, has 6) and one of the smallest phoneme inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPAblink|p}} and {{IPAblink|b}} are reported to be in [[free variation]], although reports of {{IPA|[b]}} could be a misinterpretation of unaspirated {{IPA|[p]}} by English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is basic free variation of {{IPAblink|t}} and {{IPAblink|k}}. However, since Hawaiian has no [[affricate consonant|affricates]], no fricative besides {{IPAslink|h}}, and no other stops besides {{IPAslink|p}} and {{IPAslink|ʔ}}, any non-labial and non-glottal stop, fricative, or affricate, can function as a {{IPA|/k/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, {{IPAblink|d}}, {{IPAblink|s}}, {{IPAblink|z}}, {{IPAblink|ts}}, {{IPAblink|dz}}, {{IPAblink|c}}, {{IPAblink|ɟ}}, {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPAblink|dʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, {{IPAblink|x}}, {{IPAblink|ɣ}} can all "work" as an allophone of {{IPA|/k/}}. Nevertheless, the main allophones noted by the missionaries in the 1820s, and by linguists, are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}. Elbert &amp; Pukui&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; point out some instances of a {{IPAblink|ʔ}} allophone. Schütz&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=77, 79, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured that a ''t''-dialect existed in the northwestern islands, and a ''k''-dialect in the southeastern islands. Roberts documented a sound between that of English {{angbr|th}} {{IPAblink|θ}} and {{IPAblink|k}} in free variation with {{IPA|[k]}} among elders from O{{okina}}ahu and Kaua{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Roberts|1967|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2011}}{{clarify|date=May 2011}}

There is some evidence for instances of free variation between {{IPAblink|n}} and {{IPAblink|ŋ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also free variation between {{IPAblink|l}} ([[lateral consonant|lateral]]), {{IPAblink|ɾ}} ([[tap consonant|tap]]), and {{IPAblink|ɹ}} ([[approximant consonant|approximant]]). Elbert &amp; Pukui&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui |1979|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out some instances of {{IPAblink|n}} and {{IPAblink|ʔ}} as allophones. Schütz&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=59, 63, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; has conjectured that {{IPA|[ɾ]}} is prevalent in the northwestern islands and {{IPA|[l]}} is prevalent in the southeastern islands.

There is [[free variation]] of {{IPAblink|w}} and {{IPAblink|v}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Pukui| Elbert|1986|p=xvii}} have conjectured that there is [[complementary distribution|conditioned variation]] of {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[v]}}, but their use of "usually" makes their theory an admission of free variation. Schütz&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; has conjectured that there was neither {{IPA|[w]}} nor {{IPA|[v]}}, but rather "something between the two". This is most likely {{IPAblink|ʋ}}, a [[labiodental approximant]] (see also Schütz's (1994:113) quotes from letter of Artemas Bishop).

Carter&lt;ref name="Carter1996" /&gt; has shown instances of [[descriptive linguistics|synchronic]] [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] of every non-glottal Hawaiian consonant {{IPA|/p, k, m, n, l, w/}} with glottal fricative {{IPAslink|h}} and glottal stop {{IPAslink|ʔ}}. (See [[Hawaiian phonology#Glottal stop]])

There are also instances of variation with zero allophones. For example: {{IPA|/huli/ ⁓ /hui/}} ('turn');&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/luhia/ ⁓ /luia/}} ('variety of shark').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glottal stop ===
In Hawaiian, a phonemic glottal stop historically derives from an earlier consonant. A number of words have variant pronunciations between glottal (that is, both {{IPAslink|h}} and {{IPAslink|ʔ}}) and non-glottal consonants; it is conjectured that the forms with a non-glottal consonant are older and that this phenomenon is part of a process of consonant deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter |1996|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can still be seen in the historical development of the dual personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|pp=213, 361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exhibited in the suffixes for dual and plural number, which come from ''lua'' ('two') and ''kolu'' ('three') respectively.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=268"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{IPA|/l/}} of {{IPA|/-lua/}} in the first and third person forms has "died" or "vanished", resulting in the modern forms ''māua'', ''kāua'', and ''lāua''. The presence of the glottal stop marks the absence of a "phonetically fuller" consonant. The second person form, ''{{okina}}olua'', contains a glottal stop, implying that the {{IPA|/l/}} used to be there and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} still exists in place of {{IPA|/l/}} in the intermediate forms, {{IPA|/maː + ʔua/}}, {{IPA|/kaː + ʔua/}}, and {{IPA|/laː + ʔua/}}.

A Hawaiian glottal stop thus represents the maximal phonetic reduction of other consonants in centuries past.

Elbert &amp; Pukui&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=12, 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown instances of {{IPA|k ⁓ ʔ}}, and {{IPA|l ⁓ ʔ}}, such as ''mukumuku ⁓ mu{{okina}}umu{{okina}}u'' ('cut'), and ''pūliki ⁓ pū{{okina}}iki'' ('embrace'). Carter (1996:373–374) has shown examples of all seven of the (other) Hawaiian consonants alternating synchronically with glottal stop:

== Vowels ==
Depending on how one analyzes the inventory of Hawaiian [[vowel]] phonemes, it has either 5 or 25 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=259"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum figure of 5 is reached by counting only {{IPAslink|u}}, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o}}, {{IPAslink|e}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} as phonemes. Diphthongs and long vowels are analyzed as being sequences of two vowels. For example, the written form {{angle bracket|au}} is phonemically {{IPA|/au/}}, and the written form {{angle bracket|ā}} is phonemically {{IPA|/aa/}}. The maximum figure of 25 is reached by counting separately the 5 short vowels, the 5 long vowels, the 9 short diphthongs, and the 6 long diphthongs. A reason given to support this analysis is that the diphthongs "act as unit phonemes in regard to stress."&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=259" /&gt;

It is not necessary to postulate that the long vowels and diphthongs should be counted as separate single phonemes, because they can be treated as sequences of two vowels. They are in fact historically derived from two-syllable sequences. This is easily seen in the synchronic co-existence of allomorphic pairs of Hawaiian forms such as ''kolu'' with ''-kou'', both meaning 'three'.&lt;ref name="Pukui1986"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|pp=164, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example can be analyzed as a four-phoneme CVCV sequence alternating with a three-phoneme CVV sequence, where the CVV form is derived from the CVCV form through loss of the second consonant. In other words, {{IPA|/kolu/}} loses the {{IPA|/l/}}, resulting in {{IPA|/kou/}}. ''Kolu'' is a root form, while ''-kou'' is found in the plural personal pronouns (indicating three or more referents) ''mākou'', ''kākou'', ''{{okina}}oukou'', and ''lākou''.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=268" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pukui1986" /&gt;

The vowel phonemes are shown in the following tables. The information given on allophones constitutes a basic description, not exception-free laws. Native speakers of any language can get away with tweaking their own personal pronunciation.

=== Monophthongs ===

Vowel quality is the same for long and short vowels, except for {{IPA|/eː/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{IPA|/aː/}} vs. {{IPA|/ɐ/}}:

* When short {{IPAslink|e}} is stressed it is lowered to {{IPAblink|ɛ}}. In a sequence of two or more syllables with {{IPA|/e/}}, unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} can also be lowered to {{IPA|[ɛ]}} but it is otherwise {{IPA|[e]}}. For example, ''{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele'' ('black') is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔɛlɛ.ʔɛlɛ]}}. But ''{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale'' ('full') is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔɐleʔɐle]}}. There are also instances where unstressed short {{IPA|/e/}} can be raised to {{IPA|[i]}}. For example, the negating form, {{IPA|/ʔaʔole/}} or {{IPA|/ʔaʔohe/}}, can be pronounced {{IPA|[ʔaˈʔoli]}} or {{IPA|[ʔaˈʔohi]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short {{IPAslink|a}} is phonetically {{IPAblink|ɐ}} when stressed and {{IPAblink|ə}} when unstressed.

One might argue for free variation of {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} for stressed short {{IPA|/a/}}. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=22–24}} have made citations to Kinney (1956) and Newbrand (1951), based on tape-recorded evidence, which specifically noted {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, but not {{IPA|[a]}}. Even so, the pronunciations {{IPA|[ʔaˈʔoli]}} and {{IPA|[ʔaˈʔohi]}} exhibited above, show that there are at least a couple of forms where {{IPA|/a/}} is realized as {{IPA|[a]}}.

=== Diphthongs ===

|}

Unlike the other falling diphthongs (that is, falling from higher to lower sonority), {{IPA|/iu/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} are rising diphthongs. For example, ''kiu'' ('spy') is pronounced {{IPA|[kju]}}, like the English name for the letter ''Q''.

As with its constituent vowels, diphthongs with short {{IPAslink|e}} and {{IPAslink|a}} are subject to the same free variation described above. In rapid speech, {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/au/}} can become {{IPA|[ei]}} and {{IPA|[ou]}} respectively.

All long diphthongs are falling.

==Phonotactics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hawaiian language]] --&gt;
Hawaiian [[syllable]]s may contain one consonant in the [[syllable onset|onset]], or there is no onset. Syllables with no onset contrast with syllables beginning with the glottal stop: {{IPA|/alo/}} ('front') contrasts with {{IPA|/ʔalo/}} ('to dodge'). [[Syllable coda|Codas]] and [[consonant cluster]]s are prohibited in the phonotactics of Hawaiian words of Austronesian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the borrowed word ''Kristo'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkri.sto]}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syllable has a minimum of one vowel, and a maximum of two. A one-vowel syllable has any one of the short or long vowels. A two-vowel syllable has any one of the diphthongs.

The structure of the Hawaiian syllable can be represented as being (C)V(V), where the round brackets around C and second V mean that the syllable-initial consonant is optional and the syllable may have a long vowel or diphthong.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* V syllables. Every theoretically possible V syllable occurs in Hawaiian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;
* CV syllables. Every theoretically possible CV syllable occurs, with the single exception of ''wū'' [see Hawaiian headwords]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|pp=1–386}} see Hawaiian headwords&lt;/ref&gt; The syllable ''wu'' occurs only in borrowed words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|p=29}} note 4&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two such words, with ''wu'', in the Pukui-Elbert dictionary: ''Wulekake'' (or ''Vulegate'') ('Vulgate'), and ''wulekula'' (or ''vuletura'' 'vulture'), the very last Hawaiian headwords listed in the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbert &amp; Pukui&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=35}} citing Krupa&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out that "Certain combinations of sounds are absent or rare." For example, no content word has the form {{IPA|CVVʔV}}, and the form {{IPA|CVVCV}}, is also not common. They also noted that monovocalic content words are always long.

== Stress ==
Word stress is predictable in Hawaiian for words with three or fewer [[mora (linguistics)|moras]] (that is, three or fewer vowels, with diphthongs and long vowels counting as two vowels). In such cases, stress is always on the penultimate mora.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Lyovin |1997|p=259" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pukui1986a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer words will also follow this pattern, but may in addition have a second stressed syllable which is not predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz |1994|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hawaiian, a stressed syllable is louder in volume, longer in duration and higher in pitch.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

# CVCV, VCV, with both vowels short: ''áhi, káhi''
# CVCVCV, CVVCV, VCVCV, VVCV—that is, as in (1) but preceded by a short syllable: ''uáhi, alóha, huáli, kakáhi''
# CVV, VV, with either a long vowel or diphthong: ''ái, wái, ā (= áa), nā (náa)''
# CVCVV, VCVV, CVVV, VVV—that is, same as (3) but preceded by a short syllable: ''uái, uhái, kuái' wawái, iā (= iáa), inā (ináa), huā (huáa), nanā (nanáa)''

For other Hawaiian words longer than three moras, stress is not predictable. However, every word can be analyzed as consisting of a sequence of these stress units:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1978|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''{{okina}}éle.makúle'' ('old man'), stressed as CVCV plus CVCVCV
* ''makúa.híne'' ('mother'), stressed as CVCVV plus CVCV

Etymology is not a reliable guide to stress. For example, the following proper names are both composed of three words, of 1, 2, and 2 moras, but their stress patterns differ:

* ''Ka-imu-kī,'' pronounced ''kái.mukíi''
* ''Ka-{{okina}}ahu-manu,'' pronounced ''ka{{okina}}áhu.mánu''

==Phonological processes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hawaiian language]] --&gt;
Phonological processes at work in Hawaiian include palatalization of consonants, deletion of consonants, raising and diphthongization of vowels, deletion of unstressed syllables, and compensatory lengthening of vowels. Elbert &amp; Pukui&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited Kinney (1956) regarding "natural fast speech" (vowel raising, deletion of unstressed syllables), and Newbrand (1951) regarding Ni{{okina}}ihau dialect (free variation of {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}, deletion of consonants, allophone of {{IPA|/a/}}, vowel raising).

Kinney (1956) has studied tape recordings of 13 or 14 native speakers of Hawaiian. She noted assimilatory raising of vowels in vowel sequences. For example, {{IPA|/ai/}} was very frequently pronounced {{IPA|[ei]}}, {{IPA|/au/}} was often {{IPA|[ou]}}, and {{IPA|/io/}} was often {{IPA|[iu]}}. She cited specific words, such as {{IPA|/mai/}} (directional adverb) as {{IPA|[mei]}}, {{IPA|/mau/}} (plural morpheme) as {{IPA|[mou]}}, and {{IPA|/lio/}} ('horse') as {{IPA|[liu]}}. The pronunciation of the island name Maui, ''Maui'', {{IPA|/maui/}}, was {{IPA|[ˈmʌu.i]}}, with the quality of {{IPA|[ʌ]}} compared to that of ''u'' in English ''cut''. She observed deletion of unstressed syllables, such as {{IPA|/ke akua/}} ('God') pronounced {{IPA|[ke ˈkuə]}}, and {{IPA|/hele akula/}} ('go') pronounced {{IPA|[ˈhɛlɛ ˈkulə]}}. She also documented pronunciations of {{IPA|/loaʔa/}} ('gotten') as {{IPA|[ˈloʔə]}}, and {{IPA|/puaʔa/}} ('pig') as {{IPA|[ˈpuʔə]}}.

Newbrand (1951) found that a Niihauan ''wrote'' {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|k}} interchangeably, and freely varied the pronunciation of both {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|k}} as {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[k]}}. She found {{IPA|/ʔaʔohe/}} ('no') pronounced {{IPA|[ʔaˈʔohi]}}, showing vowel raising of {{IPA|/e/}} to {{IPA|[i]}}. She documented {{IPA|/noho ʔana/}} ('staying') pronounced {{IPA|[noo ˈɐnə]}}, showing deletion of the glottal consonants {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. The vowel quality of stressed short {{IPA|/a/}} was noted as {{IPA|[ɐ]}}.

Palatalization of consonants in Hawaiian is demonstrated by the well known pronunciation of {{IPA|/kaː/}} (mood adverb) as {{IPA|[tʃæː]}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1986|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siporex-house-under-building.jpg|thumb|House-building in Kuopio, Finland]]

'''House-building''' is the construction of houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5-uPQAACAAJ |title=House-building, from a cottage to a mansion |author=C. J. Richardson |year=1873 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The process often starts with a planning stage in which plans are prepared by an [[architect]] and approved by the client and any regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://agcsf.com/approaching-home-construction/ | title=Approaching Home Construction | publisher=Aaron Gordon Construction Inc. | accessdate=13 February 2015 | author=Gordon, Aaron | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213114529/http://agcsf.com/approaching-home-construction/ | archivedate=13 February 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the site is cleared, [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are laid and [[trench]]es for connection to services such as [[sewerage]], water, and electricity are established.  If the house is wooden-framed, a framework is constructed to support the boards, siding and roof. If the house is of brick construction, then courses of bricks are laid to construct the walls. Floors, beams and internal walls are constructed as the building develops, with plumbing and wiring for water and electricity being installed as appropriate. Once the main structure is complete, internal fitting with lights and other fitments is done, and the house may be decorated and furnished with furniture, cupboards, carpets, curtains and other fittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xw3FBgoDfDwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Building+a+House&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7T12UsbkHsG60QXmhoHICQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Building%20a%20House&amp;f=false|title=Building a House |author=JoAnn Early Macken |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2013}}

==Home size==
{{Globalize|date=July 2018}}
According to  data from the U.S. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics found the average floor area of a home in the [[United States]] has steadily increased over the past one hundred years, with an estimated 18.5 square foot increase in the average floor area per year. In 1920, the average floor area was {{convert|1048|sqft|m2}}, which rose to {{convert|1500|sqft|m2}} by 1970 and today sits at around {{convert|2657|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://supplychenmanagement.com/2018/07/15/average-house-size/ |title=How Has the Average House Size Changed? |work=Supply Chen Management |accessdate=2018-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some have criticized the house-building industry. Mass house-builders can be risk averse, preferring cost-efficient building methods rather than adopting new technologies for improved building performance.&lt;ref name="Suburban paradigm"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arieff |first=Allison |title=Shifting the Suburban Paradigm |work=The New York Times |date=October 2, 2011 |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/shifting-the-suburban-paradigm/?_r=0 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional vernacular building methods that suit local conditions and climates can be dispensed with in favour of a generic 'cookie cutter' housing type.&lt;ref name="Suburban paradigm" /&gt;

'''''Ingress''''' is a [[location-based game|location-based]], [[augmented reality|augmented-reality]] [[mobile game]] developed by [[Niantic (company)|Niantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=Myk |url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/ingress-game-lifestyle-social-network/ |title=Ingress: A Game, Lifestyle and Social Network in One! |publisher=When In Manila |date=July 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on December 14, 2013 and for [[iOS]] devices on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref name="13magnus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iTunes Shop"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ingress/id576505181?mt=8/ |title=iTunes official App shop |date=July 14, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Russell |first1=Jon |title=Google’s Ingress augmented reality game quietly launches for iOS devices |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/07/14/googles-ingress-augmented-reality-game-quietly-launches-ios-devices/ |website=TNW News |publisher=The Next Web |accessdate=August 13, 2015 |date=July 14, 2014 |quote=Google is inviting iPhone and iPad owners into its augmented reality game Ingress after it finally launched an iOS app.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has a [[science fiction]] [[back story]] with a continuous open narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nianticproject.com/ |title=What is this 'Niantic Project'? |publisher=NianticLabs@Google |date=November 1, 2012 |access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+NianticProject/posts |title=Niantic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ingress'' is also considered to be a location-based [[exergame]].

The competition in ''Ingress'' is primarily between the two opposing factions rather than between individual players, and players never interact directly in the game or suffer any kind of damage other than temporarily running out of "XM", the power that fuels all actions except movement and communication. The gameplay consists of capturing "portals" at places of cultural significance, such as [[public art]], landmarks, [[monuments]], etc., and linking them to create virtual triangular "control fields" over geographical areas.

Progress in the game is measured on an individual level primarily by accumulating "Access Points" (or AP), and AP are awarded for a variety of in-game actions: destroying or damaging an enemy portal, capturing, linking, or recharging a portal, creating a control field, and other actions. Players of opposing factions can "battle" indirectly in approximate real time for control of portals, with one faction attacking a portal to destroy its resources and defenses and the other faction restoring them as they are damaged, but there is no personal penalty for "losing" a portal, the destruction of a field the player created, or any other reason. The only scored competition is between the factions.

== Setting ==
The game makers' [[framing device]] for the game is as follows: Alongside the discovery of the [[Higgs Boson]] by the physicists at [[CERN]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Before Pokémon GO There Was Ingress |url=http://pixelkin.org/2016/07/14/before-pokemon-go-there-was-ingress/ |website=Pixelkin |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been discovered that the Earth has been seeded with "Exotic Matter" (XM). This substance has been associated with the Shapers, a mysterious phenomenon or alien race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Haahr, Mads |editor1=Koenitz, Hartmut |editor2=Ferri, Gabriele |editor3=Haahr, Mads |editor4=Sezen, Digdem |editor5=Sezen, Tonguc Ibrahim |title=Interactive digital narrative : history, theory and practice |publication-date=2015 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-138-78239-6 |chapter=Everting the Holodeck: Games and Storytelling in Physical Space |pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factions ===
Within the game, human reactions to this discovery fall into two opposing factions: the Enlightened fight believing their actions will uplift humanity and bring about the next chapter in human evolution, whereas the Resistance believes that it is protecting humanity from Shaper ingression and preserving humanity's freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ingresshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207441277-Faction-choice |title=Faction Choice |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023323/https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/207441277-Faction-choice |archivedate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two factions are the opposing "sides" or "teams" in the game: the Resistance is represented in the game by the color blue and the Enlightened by green. Both teams have naturally tended to balance each other out in population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Andrew McMillen |title=Ingress: The friendliest turf war on Earth |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/ingress-the-friendliest-turf-war-on-earth/ |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, the Resistance are colloquially referred to as "[[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]" and lower-level Resistance players as "Smurflings". Similarly, the Enlightened in general are referred to as "Frogs" or "[[Toad]]s", lower-level Enlightened players as "[[Tadpoles]]".

In real life, the factions occasionally ignore the [[back-story]] and co-operate for the sake of real-life gameplay and [[game balance]]:  for example, by establishing neutral zones and rules of engagement; for training new players; for socializing; and occasionally for serious real-life purposes such as honoring fallen heroes.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#MIT-truce]].&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic Labs supports these activities and often arranges them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/communities/103727946232179539813 |title=Greater Boise Ingress community on Google Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress Live Events |url=https://www.ingress.com/events |website=Ingress |accessdate=August 13, 2015 |quote=Mission Days bring together Agents from both factions to explore cities around the world through the lens of Ingress with unique and local adventures on foot. ...  Once a month, First Saturdays are a get together of the local Ingress family, new and old, to level up new recruits, make new friends, and strengthen Cross-Faction relations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Ingress'' has been described as combining elements of [[geocaching]] with [[capture the flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=Michael |title=Ingress in Geography: Portals to Academic Success? |journal=Journal of Geography |date=October 5, 2016 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00221341.2016.1227356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Play environment ===
[[File:Ingress Intel Map full-screen.png|thumb|right|An example of the Intel Map. Virtual portals ([[octagon]]s with spokes), links (lines joining portals), and control fields (colored spaces) overlay a map of real geographical and civic space via [[Google Maps]]; green represents the Enlightened faction, and blue the Resistance.|295x295px]]

A player using the mobile app is presented with a map representing the surrounding area. The map has a black background and is completely unmarked, except for buildings and roads which are outlined in grey but not labeled, and bodies of water (pale blue). These geographical features are supplied by [[OpenStreetMap]] and formerly [[Google Maps]].{{efn-ua|From the ''Sources'' button found within the Ingress app under the "Device" tab.}} Visible on the map are portals, Exotic Matter (XM), links, control fields, and items that players have dropped from their inventory. Distances from the player to in-game locations are displayed only in [[metric system|metric units]]. The app is available in sixteen languages.{{efn-ua|name=langs|Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, English (US), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. There is also an "Automatic" setting within the app.}}

Players must be physically near objects on the map to interact with them. The mobile client represents the player as a small arrowhead in the center of a circle {{convert|40|m|sp=us}} in radius, which represents the perimeter within which direct interaction is possible. A player sees only their own location, not that of any other player. The color of the arrowhead corresponds with the faction of the player (blue for Resistance, green for Enlightened), as will the XM storage. XM can be thought of as "energy" – a high amount of XM is needed to perform actions in the game, and it can be replenished by walking through an area of XM (common near portals). A player can "hack" a nearby portal to acquire in-game items, some of which can also be used to replenish XM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808247?hl=en |title=Acquire Items via Hacking |website=Ingress Help |publisher=Google |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714104302/https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808247?hl=en |archivedate=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are rewarded with Action Points (AP) for actions within the game. Accumulating AP beyond certain thresholds grants higher access levels,&lt;ref name=fevgames-ap&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress &gt; Ingress Guide &gt; Concepts &gt; Access Points (AP) |url=https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/concepts/access-points-ap/ |website=Fev Games |accessdate=May 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502064342/https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/concepts/access-points-ap/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |date=May 16, 2016 |quote='''Access Points''' (sometimes referred to as '''Action Points''' and commonly called '''AP''') constitute your “score” in Ingress. Various actions will award you AP. Reaching certain AP thresholds is a requirement for leveling up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  i.e., access to stronger items and longer portal recharging capabilities. The access levels are numbered 1 through 16, with 16 being the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ingress |url=https://support.google.com/ingress/ |title=Official Ingress Support Page |publisher=Google |accessdate=February 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317232234/https://support.google.com/ingress/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 }} {{failed verification |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because more AP are awarded for taking over enemy portals than for maintaining your own team's, if a player is outnumbered by members of the other team, they will accumulate AP at a faster rate as a way of leveling the playing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Haahr, Mads |editor1=Koenitz, Hartmut |editor2=Ferri, Gabriele |editor3=Haahr, Mads |editor4=Sezen, Digdem |editor5=Sezen, Tonguc Ibrahim |title=Interactive digital narrative : history, theory and practice | publication-date=2015 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-138-78239-6 |chapter=Everting the Holodeck: Games and Storytelling in Physical Space |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to earning AP, certain actions within the game can earn a player a Badge. Badges are typically multi-tiered (ranked Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Onyx respectively) and become a requirement for level advancement starting with Level 9. Most badges are statistic-based: for instance, capturing portals, total MUs captured, fields and links created, various offensive actions, and even successfully discovering new portals. Some badges are exclusive and can only be obtained by attending special ''Ingress'' events.

In September 2014, Niantic Labs introduced missions to the game. A mission is a user-created set of places to visit (''[[waypoint]]s'') and interact with in specified ways. Some missions list all the waypoints from the start, while others only reveal them one at a time as the user progresses from one to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hindy |first1=Joe |title=Huge new Ingress Missions feature will forever change how we play Ingress |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/huge-new-ingress-missions-feature-will-forever-change-how-we-play-ingress-529012/ |website=Android Authority |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927082848/http://www.androidauthority.com/huge-new-ingress-missions-feature-will-forever-change-how-we-play-ingress-529012/ |archivedate=September 27, 2014 |date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing missions reward the player with a virtual medal of the mission that is displayed on their agent profile.

=== Portals ===
In the game, Earth has a large number of "portals", made visible by the "scanner" (the mobile phone game app). They are colored green, blue, or grey, depending respectively on whether they are currently controlled by the Enlightened, by the Resistance, or are unclaimed. Players acquire portals for their faction by "deploying" at least one "resonator" on them. They can also add "mods" (modifications) to protect the portals or increase their power in various ways. A portal with no resonators is unclaimed, also called a "ghost" portal.

Players acquire game items (resonators, weapons, etc.) by maneuvering themselves, typically by walking, biking, or driving, to within {{convert|40|m}} of a portal and "hacking" it by selecting this option on their scanners. Any player can hack any portal and receive items, subject to limits on frequency: Hacking a portal starts a "cool down period", initially 5 minutes, until that player can hack that portal again; and attempting more than 4 hacks within 4 hours will cause the portal to "burn out" for that player for 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress FAQ |url=http://www.ingressportal.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IngressFAQ.pdf |website=Ingress Portal |accessdate=January 14, 2016 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These periods can be reduced with the "Heat Sink" and "Multi-hack" mods. Hacking a portal controlled by the opposing faction also earns the player 100 additional AP (Access Points), at the risk of being attacked by the portal in the form of losing XM. Players can also earn additional items and AP for glyph hacking a portal, where they are briefly shown several patterns and retrace them within a time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glyph Hacking |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/206618698-Glyph-Hacking |website=Ingress Help |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed, difficulty and rewards of glyph hacking can be further modified with special Commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glyph Hack Command Channel is Open |url=http://decodeingress.me/2015/12/22/glyph-hack-command-channel-is-open/ |website=Decode Ingress |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/a7Nr6iCt1a7 |website=[[Google+]] |publisher=Niantic |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |title=Agents, the Simple and Complex Glyph can now be entered in the command channe...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To claim a portal for a faction, a player equips, or deploys, at least one resonator on it. If a portal is claimed by the enemy, the player must first neutralize it by destroying the opponents' resonators with weapons called XMP ("Exotic Matter Pulse") Bursters, the principal means of attacking a portal. XM itself is neutral, not aligned with either faction, but an XMP Burster fired by a player of one faction will damage any portal of the other faction within range, while having no effect on portals of the player's own faction.

Portals are typically associated with buildings and landmarks of historic or architectural significance— such as [[sculptures]], [[murals]], and other [[public art]], [[libraries]], [[post offices]], [[memorial]]s, [[places of worship]], [[public transit]] [[Transit hub|hubs]], [[parks]] and other [[recreational]] or [[Tourism|tourist]] spaces, or with business locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ingress |url=https://ingresshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207343987-Candidate-Portal-criteria |title=Candidate Portal criteria |work=Ingress Help |publisher=Niantic Labs |accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may submit requests for the creation of new portals if they meet the level requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/207343987-Candidate-Portal-criteria |title=Candidate Portal criteria |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought upon launch that this would allow Google to generate data for its location-based services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Hal |title=Why Google’s ''Ingress'' game is a data gold mine |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=November 28, 2012 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/ |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, 15 million portals had been submitted by the Ingress community, and five million of those had been included in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bogle |first1=Ariel |title=How the gurus behind Google Earth created 'Pokémon Go' |url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/10/john-hanke-pokemon-go/#_qYBgw5Sfmq0 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |work=[[Mashable]] |date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Operation Portal Recon ====
In November 2016, "Operation Portal Recon" (OPR) was launched in beta in San Francisco, Tohoku and Kyushu. Operation Portal Recon is a service where high-level Ingress players can evaluate Portal candidates for the Portal Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/niantics-invite-only-portal-recon-tool-lets-players-vote-new-real-world-locations-into-ingress/ |title=Niantic’s new invite-only "Portal Recon" tool lets players vote real-world locations into Ingress |first=Greg |last=Kumparak |publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPR exited beta in May 2017 and made available for all Level 16 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/RnpJxPwdAKU |title=Starting today, Operation Portal Recon (OPR) will now be available globally t... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=May 10, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level requirement for OPR has been reduced several times with the most recent change made in July 2017, making OPR available for all Level 12 players or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/hPZFqa7Q4qs |title=Agents, Level 12 or above now have access to Operation Portal Recon via... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=July 11, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portal Submissions returned to Ingress in September 2017, after a two-year hiatus, as a result of Operation Portal Recon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/7sz94RLePop |title=From the intrepid explorers who helped discover countless Portals during the... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=September 25, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic announced in September 2018 the ability to submit PokéStop nominations through [[Pokémon Go]] with an initial beta test in South Korea and Brazil.

=== Portal, links, and control fields ===
Two portals that have all eight resonators deployed and are controlled by the same faction can be linked by a player from that faction who stands within range of one and has a portal key for the other. (Keys are obtained by hacking but, like most such in-game objects, can be dropped. After twelve hours they disappear, unless picked up by another player.) The maximum possible length of a link depends on the level of resonators on a portal (higher level resonators equal longer linking range) and mods (specifically, link amps and SoftBank Ultra Links). However, one cannot create a link that crosses an existing link from either faction. Both portals must have at least three resonators deployed to maintain the link. The opposing faction can destroy the link by attacking one or both portals so that one portal's resonator count falls below three.

Links between portals may range in length from meters to kilometers or hundreds of kilometers, created in operations of considerable logistical complexity.&lt;ref name=Tran /&gt; International links and fields are not uncommon, as ''Ingress'' has attracted an enthusiastic following in cities worldwide&lt;ref name="d" /&gt; amongst both young and old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Wassom, Brian |editor2=Bishop, Allison |author=Wassom, Brian D. |title=Augmented reality law, privacy, and ethics : law, society, and emerging AR technologies | publication-date=2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Syngress |chapter=Chapter 6 – Real Property Rights |page=168 |isbn=978-0-12-800524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that the gameplay is itself a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] for some, including [[tattoo]]s.&lt;ref name="13magnus"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Ingress/posts/2wvNoTjd9jG |title=We, at Niantic Labs at Google, are really excited to let you know that our bi... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=November 4, 2013 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When three portals are linked in a triangle, they create a control field, claiming the Mind Units (MU) within that field for their faction. Portals within a field cannot originate links, but can be linked to from any portals on the perimeter (that is, any of the three portals defining the triangle). The opposing faction can destroy a control field by destroying one or more of the links that form it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/206737888-Create-Links-Control-Fields |title=Create Links &amp; Control Fields |website=Ingress Help| access-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Mind Units" are related to the population that resides within a control field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sascha Lobo |title=S.P.O.N. - Die Mensch-Maschine: Google macht die Welt zum Spielfeld |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/google-ingress-die-ganze-welt-als-spiel-a-902267.html |accessdate=July 22, 2016 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=May 28, 2013|trans-title=SPON – The Man-Machine: Google makes the world into a playing field |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest control field formed had points between Germany, Greece and Ukraine, and took four months of planning and 200 players to create.&lt;ref name=Tran&gt;{{cite news |author1=Edmond Tran |title=Pokemon GO Devs Still Exploring Multiplayer, Say Players Will Shape The Game |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-devs-still-exploring-multiplayer-say-pl/1100-6441610/ |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to capture as many MUs as possible, additional fields can be created that blanket other fields. This is called layering, and each subsequent field that is created "recaptures" the MUs from the previous field(s), adding to the count. Layering is most often accomplished by utilizing one or two common portals, called anchors, to host inbound and outbound links and using a unique portal(s) each time to create each additional layered field. Periodically, faction members will coordinate large-scale layered fields that span multiple countries.

=== ''Ingress Prime'' ===
In December 2017, Niantic announced a thoroughly revamped version of the game, branded as '''''Ingress Prime''''', would be released in 2018 using a completely rewritten new client and the lessons learned from the massive popularity of ''Pokémon Go''. The new version features a subtly different back story akin to a [[superhero]] origin theme and a more florid graphic design. Technologically the new version uses Apple's [[ARKit]] and Google's [[ARCore]], and the network layer transitioned from [[JSON]] to [[Protobuf]] in keeping with the engineering style of ''Pokémon Go''.&lt;ref name="Ingress Prime"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go |title=Niantic’s first AR game Ingress is getting a massive overhaul in 2018 3 Ingress Prime features a new look, new story, and new tech |last=Webster |first=Andrew |date=December 2, 2017 |website=The Verge |access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Network layer details."&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fevgames.net/beginning-ingress-2-0-prime-announced/ |title=The Beginning: Ingress 2.0 (Prime) Announced |last=n/a |first=Fevenis |date=December 3, 2017 |website=Fev Games |access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update launched on November 5, 2018 as an update to the existing Ingress game.&lt;ref name="Prime"&gt;{{cite web |date=November 5, 2018 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |title=Welcome to Ingress Prime - Niantic |url=https://www.nianticlabs.com/blog/ingress-prime/ |website=Niantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic also retained the older Ingress game as a separate download named ''Scanner [REDACTED]''. The intention of the older Ingress game is to help aid the transition to Prime as feature parity is reached between both games in 2019. The older game will be available until Ingress Prime offers support for Portal submissions and edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=November 19, 2018 |title=Scanner [REDACTED] |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002076527-Scanner-REDACTED- |website=Ingress Help Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Ingress (TV series)|anime based on the game]] premiered on [[Fuji TV]]'s +Ultra anime programming block on October 18, 2018.

=== Split from Google ===
On August 12, 2015, Niantic announced that it was being spun off as an independent company:&lt;ref&gt;Email to players, approximately  01:30 on August 12, 2015 (UTC)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this operation, Google was to begin transferring user data to Niantic on September 11.

== Special events ==
In addition to the ongoing competition between the factions wherever there are players, there are several kinds of special events held on specific dates.

=== Anomalies ===
XM Anomalies are events where players from both factions compete in portal-based games in order to win points for their faction.&lt;ref name= live&gt;{{cite web |website=Ingress |title=Ingress Events— XM Anomalies |url=https://www.ingress.com/events |publisher=Niantic Labs |access-date=August 30, 2018 |quote=These events are for Ingress players of ALL levels and last approximately 4-5 hours including 3-4 hours of walking/biking gameplay and a two hour social meetup at the end.

A "series" for the XM Anomalies usually spans two different weekends. Anomaly locations may be chosen based on the player activity in a region. Players, upon registering as being part of the event, organize within each faction into squads based on player level, local knowledge, and mode of transport (for example, walking or biking).&lt;ref name=MajorekduVall&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majorek |first1=Marta |last2=du Vall |first2=Marta |title=Ingress: An Example of a New Dimension in Entertainment |journal=[[Games and Culture]] |date=March 20, 2015 |doi=10.1177/1555412015575833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest event, in Japan, attracted over 10,000 players.&lt;ref name="Recode" /&gt;

Anomaly sites are divided into two categories: Primary and Satellite locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Games Event Moved Over Zika Virus Fears |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/02/games-event-moved-over-zika-virus-fears/ |website=Kotaku Australia |accessdate=March 23, 2018  |date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic Labs employees, as well as characters from the story, often attend events at Primary anomaly locations. More points are awarded to the prevailing faction at Primary sites than at Satellite sites. Players who participate in an anomaly are awarded a unique badge with the emblem of that anomaly. The outcome of XM Anomalies often influences future events in the plot.

''Ingress'' has been read as a [[gift economy]] in which players swap [[datafication]] of their physical location for gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nathan Hulsey |author2=Joshua Reeves |title=The Gift that Keeps on Giving: Google, Ingress, and the Gift of Surveillance |journal=Surveillance &amp; Society |year=2014 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=389–400 |url=http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/gift |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |issn=1477-7487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ingress'' is considered to be a location-based [[exergame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Minhua Ma |editor2=Lakhmi C.

Legal expert Brian Wassom regards this as an important factor in AR games reducing the legal risk they bear when directing players to go to a location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Wassom, Brian |editor2=Bishop, Allison |author=Wassom, Brian D. |title=Augmented reality law, privacy, and ethics : law, society, and emerging AR technologies | publication-date=2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Syngress |chapter=Chapter 7 – Torts and Personal Injury |pages=185–186 |isbn=978-0-12-800524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai-Uwe Werbeck argues that the role-playing of the ''Ingress'' storyline challenges and reinforces [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Byers, Andrew |editor2=Crocco, Francesco |title=The role-playing society : essays on the cultural influence of RPGs |publication-date=2016 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |chapter=Shapers, Portals and Exotic Matter: Living Fiction and Augmented Reality in Google's Ingress |author=Kai-Uwe Werbeck |page=235 |isbn=978-0-7864-9883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and incidents ===
The basic idea of ''Ingress'' is very similar to that of the older, now-defunct, augmented reality game, ''[[Shadow Cities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Accused Of "Blatantly" Ripping Off Grey Area Games’ Shadow Cities |url=http://indiestatik.com/2012/11/27/google-accused-of-blatantly-ripping-off-grey-area-games-shadow-cities/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129084454/http://indiestatik.com/2012/11/27/google-accused-of-blatantly-ripping-off-grey-area-games-shadow-cities/ |work=Indiestatik | archive-date=November 29, 2012 |author=Chris Priestman |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have two factions which are fighting for the future of the world with smart phones.  Though the games have similar game mechanics and look-and-feel, there are clear differences. In ''Shadow Cities'', players are in the virtual world, which is dynamically mapped around them, and can teleport within the virtual world, whereas in ''Ingress'', the portals are real world locations that players generally have to actually move to in order to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside Ingress, Google’s Augmented Reality Android Game |url=http://www.geekosystem.com/google-ingress-review/ |work=Indiestatik |author-first=  Glen | author-last=Tickle |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Shadow Cities'' was shut down on October 7, 2013 due to lack of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/20/shadow-cities-closing-down-october-7/ |title=Shadow Cities closing down October 7 |work=Engadget | author-first=Shawn | author-last= Schuster |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |quote=Finnish developer Grey Area has announced that they will be closing down ''Shadow Cities'' on October 7 of this year.

Portals which had been approved within the [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] were removed in July 2015; Gabriele Hammermann, director of the memorial site at Dachau, told the [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] that Google's original approval of these portals was a humiliation for victims of the Nazi camps and their relatives, and Niantic Labs' founder John Hanke stated that "we apologize that this has happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/googles-niantic-labs-sorry-over-death-camps-smartphone-game-n385741 |title=Google's Niantic Labs Sorry Over Death Camps in Smartphone Game |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some players have attracted the attention of [[law enforcement]] while playing the game, and hence commentary on the interaction of augmented reality games with real life.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://readwrite.com/2012/12/11/augmented-reality-game-gets-player-arrested-the-first-of-many Augmented Reality Game Gets Player Arrested the First of Many]", ''Read Write Web'', December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it can take some time for players to successfully "hack" a portal, they can draw the attention of law enforcement.  In addition, some players play while driving slowly around an area, which is not recommended by the game developers and attracts the attention of law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Wassom, Brian |editor2=Bishop, Allison |author=Wassom, Brian D. |title=Augmented reality law, privacy, and ethics : law, society, and emerging AR technologies | publication-date=2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Syngress |chapter=Chapter 8 – Criminal Law |pages=209–210 |isbn=978-0-12-800524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Internet Security]] recommended that law enforcement officers be apprised of the game, and warned that it may be difficult to determine if a malicious actor is using the game as a cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google's Ingress Game Will Likely Increase Reports of Suspicious Activity |url=https://msisac.cisecurity.org/daily-tips/google-ingress-game.cfm |website=MS-ISAC Cyber Tips Newsletter |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, players have used unofficial apps to [[stalking|stalk]] each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ingress Players Use Unofficial Tools To Stalk One Another |url=https://kotaku.com/ingress-players-use-unofficial-tools-to-stalk-one-anoth-1820196357/amp |accessdate=November 9, 2017 |work=''kotaku.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">'''Interpretive planning''' is an initial step in the planning and design process for [[informal learning]]-based institutions like [[museum]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]]s, nature centers, [[botanical garden]]s, heritage sites, parks and other cultural facilities where interpretation is used to communicate messages, stories, information and experiences. It is a decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor needs and desires to determine the most effective way to communicate a message to a targeted audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.definitionsproject.com/definitions/def_full_term.cfm National Association for Interpretation]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation at [[informal learning]] institutions builds on [[Freeman Tilden]]’s principles of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], focusing especially on ''relating'' content in a meaningful way to a visitor’s own experience, ''provoking'' emotion, thought or further inquiry into a subject. 
The communication goals of interpretation at [[Mission statement|mission-based]] institutions are based on achieving previously specified outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagedestination.com/interpretive-planning.aspx Heritage Destination Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most interpretive plans are based on a [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach to interpretation]], and therefore, place emphasis on which themes are important to communicate to various audiences.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive Planning: The 5-M Model for Successful Planning Projects|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive planning may also guide how audiences will react to and interact with a particular site or exhibit. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/interpretive-planner-insights/[[History Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpretive plan establishes these specific goals for an institution’s market(s) and builds a structured vision of how to achieve them by communicating to an audience through appropriate and meaningful experiences. It combines developing, organizing and analyzing content into relevant and engaging messages, with creating exciting ways for visitors to experience this content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldrichpears.com [[AldrichPears Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An interpretive plan establishes the communication process, through which meanings and relationships of the cultural and natural world, past and present, are revealed to a visitor through experiences with objects, artifacts, landscapes, sites, exhibits and people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpcan.ca/new/ Interpretation Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

To effectively engage a visitor and achieve these objectives, as well as any other institutional objectives and requirements (financial, operational, environmental, etc.), an interpretive plan is built through addressing the following issues:  
# Why do you want to interpret something?
# Who should be involved in the interpretive process?
# What are you interpreting?
# Who you are interpreting for?
# What messages do you want to communicate?
# What are your specific objectives?
# What media will you use?
# How will your interpretation be implemented?
# How will it be evaluated?
# How will it be maintained? &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/heritage-interpretation/interpretive-planning/ Scottish Natural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting product provides a vision for the future of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], [[education]], and visitor experience opportunities. It identifies and analyzes interpretation, education, and visitor experience goals and issues and recommends the most effective, efficient, and practical ways to address those goals and issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/ip-lrip.htm [[National Park Service]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan guides the further design and development of the project, becoming a resource for [[architecture]], [[Exhibit design|exhibit development]] and [[fundraising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woed.com/services/master.html West Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonah''' or '''Jonas'''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|יוֹנָה|Yona, Biblically transliterated '''Yonah'''|Yônā|dove}}; {{lang-ar|يونس}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnus, Yūnis}}'' or {{lang|ar|يونان}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnān }}''; [[Latin]]: ''Ionas''}} is the name given in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]/[[Old Testament]]) to a [[prophet]] of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] in about the 8th century [[Common Era|BCE]]. He is the eponymous central figure of the [[Book of Jonah]], in which he is called upon by [[Yahweh|God]] to travel to [[Nineveh]] and warn its residents to repent of their [[sin]]s or face [[Divine retribution|divine wrath]]. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]]. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Three days later, after Jonah agrees to go to Nineveh, the fish vomits him out onto the shore. Jonah successfully convinces the entire city of Nineveh to repent, but waits outside the city in expectation of its destruction. God shields Jonah from the sun with a [[kikayon|plant]], but later sends a worm to cause it to wither. When Jonah complains of the bitter heat, God rebukes him.

In [[Judaism]], the story of Jonah represents the teaching of ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuva]]'', which is the ability to repent and be forgiven by [[God in Judaism|God]]. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] calls himself "greater than Jonah" and promises the [[Pharisees]] "the sign of Jonah", which is [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]]. Early [[Christianity|Christian]] interpreters viewed Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for Jesus. Later, during the [[Reformation]], Jonah came to be seen instead as an [[archetype]] for the "envious Jew". Jonah is regarded as a prophet in [[Islam]] and the [[Bible|biblical]] narrative of Jonah is repeated, with a few notable differences, in the [[Quran]]. Mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Bible scholars]] generally regard the Book of Jonah as [[fiction]]al{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} and often at least partially [[satire|satirical]],{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}} but the character of Jonah may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name mentioned in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}.

Although the word "whale" is often used in English versions of the Jonah story, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase  ''dag gadol'', which means "giant fish". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore have noted similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]] and the Greek hero [[Jason]].

==Book of Jonah==
[[File:Pieter Lastman - Jonah and the Whale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Jonah and the Whale'' (1621) by [[Pieter Lastman]]]]
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which [[Yahweh|God]] commands him to go to the city of [[Nineveh]] to prophesy against it "for their great wickedness is come up before me,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jonah instead attempts to flee from "the presence of the Lord" by going to [[Jaffa]] (sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''Joppa'' or ''Joppe''), and sailing to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:3|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, [[Cleromancy|cast lots]] and discover that Jonah is to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:4-7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:8-12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:13-15|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:15-16|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to thanksgiving and to paying what he has vowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:1-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dore jonah.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''[[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Jonah Preaching to the Ninevites]]'' (1866) by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:1-2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time he goes and enters the city, crying, "In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:2-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:6-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} in sackcloth and ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:1-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God causes a plant (in Hebrew a ''[[kikayon]]'') to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:6|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve [[minor prophets]] included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by [[Elijah]] the prophet in {{bibleverse||1 Kings|17|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|pages=126–127}} Another tradition holds that he was the son of the [[woman of Shunem]] brought back to life by [[Elisha]] in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|4|9}}{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} and that he is called the "son of [[Amittai]]" (''Truth'') due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:24|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on [[Yom Kippur]] – the Day of Atonement, as the [[Haftarah]] at the afternoon [[mincha]] prayer.{{sfn|Mirsky|1990|page=354}}{{sfn|Isaacs|2006|page=65}} According to [[Rabbi Eliezer]], the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and the inside of its mouth was like a [[synagogue]];{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} the fish's eyes were like windows{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}}

According to the [[Midrash]], while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the [[Leviathan]] would eat them both.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Jonah promised the fish that he would save them.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was [[circumcision|circumcized]], and realized that he was protected by the [[God in Judaism|Lord]],{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (1092 – 1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} stating that the "experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} The later scholar [[Isaac Abarbanel]] (1437 – 1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=18}} because "after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=18–19}}

[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]] – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father "Amitai" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of [[Nineveh]] to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, "fasting, including the sheep," and the Jewish scripts are critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Babylonian Talmud | chapter = Sanhedrin | at = 61a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.

[[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for [[Jesus Christ]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–20}} Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's crucifixion]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus's resurrection]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} [[Saint Jerome]] equates Jonah with Jesus's more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] side,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}} and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that "Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}}

Other Christian interpreters, including [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Martin Luther]], have taken a directly opposite approach,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–25}} regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} Luther likewise concludes that the ''kikayon'' represents Judaism,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–24}} and that the worm which devours it represents Christ.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=24}} Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it had never been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Luther's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=24–26}} [[J. D. Michaelis]] comments that "the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against "the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} [[Albert Eichhorn]] was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=25–26}}

[[John Calvin]] and [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=32–33}} While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of [[Hell]], intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=34–36}} Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} describing the sailors on the boat as "hard and iron-hearted, like [[Cyclops]]",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} the penitence of the Ninevites as "untrained",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} and the king of Nineveh as a "novice".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[dissident]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} Hooper deplores such dissidents,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} decrying: "Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!"{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=40}} In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}}

====In the Quran====
'''Jonah''' ([[Arabic]]: يُونُس Yūnus) is the title of the [[tenth chapter of the Quran]]. He is traditionally viewed as highly important in [[Islam]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] who was faithful to [[God in Islam|Allah]] and delivered His messages. Jonah is mentioned four times in the [[Quran]]{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} and is the only one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]] to be mentioned by name.&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348" /&gt; In [[Surah]] 68:48, Jonah is called '''Dhul-Nun''' ([[Arabic]]: '''ذو النون'''; meaning ''The One of the Fish'').{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}}

{{Quote|So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).&lt;br&gt;When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,&lt;br&gt;He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:&lt;br&gt;Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.&lt;br&gt;Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,&lt;br&gt;He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the [[Last Judgment|Day of Resurrection]].&lt;br&gt;But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,&lt;br&gt;And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.&lt;br&gt;And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.&lt;br&gt;And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.|Quran, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verses]] 139–148&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Quran never mentions Jonah's father,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} but [[Muslim]] [[tradition]] teaches that Jonah was from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] and that his father was [[Amittai]].&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Yunus'', pg. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. In some instances, Jonah's name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical [[Hadith|narrations about Muhammad's life]], after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of [[Ta’if]] to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than [[Mecca]], but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They sent their servant, [[Addas]], to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers" Muhammad replied. "Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized from ''The Life of the Prophet'' by [[Ibn Hisham]] Volume 1 pp. 419–421&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of [[Imam Bukhari]], says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Jonah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|page=172}}{{sfn|Graham|1977|page=167}}{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} A similar statement occurs in a hadith written by [[Yazid I|Yunus bin Yazid]], the second [[caliph]] of the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} but, because of his prayer, Jonah "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

The ninth-century Persian historian [[Al-Tabari]] records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the "wonders of the deep"{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah.{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} [[Kisai Marvazi]], a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} and that he died soon afterwards,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a [[cornucopia]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

Jonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=22}} The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as [[Ahab]] and [[Zedekiah]].{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}} as does Jonah's greater love for ''kikayon'' providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}}

Though it is often called a whale today, the Hebrew, as throughout scripture, refers to no species in particular, simply saying "great fish" or "big fish" (whales are today classified as [[mammal]]s and not fish, but no such distinction was made in antiquity). While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the [[great white shark]] correspond better to the representations given of Jonah's being swallowed, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole.&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;[http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 Theological Topic Search] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230239/http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[whaling]] from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale were incapable of swallowing a man, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.&lt;ref name="Kemp1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Peter Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships &amp; the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-586-08308-6|page=434|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217011744/https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point ''cetus'' became synonymous with "whale" (the study of whales is now called ''[[cetology]]''). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as "greate fyshe" and the word ''kétos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:40|9}} as "whale". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the [[King James Version|Authorized Version]] of 1611. Since then, the "great fish" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word "whale" for Matthew 12:40, while others use "sea creature" or "big fish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Did God Do It?

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=42–45}} In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], professor of Hebrew at [[Oxford University]], claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=47–48}} hoping to "shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=48}}

The debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during [[Clarence Darrow]]'s cross-examination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] at the [[Scopes Trial]] in 1925.{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Darrow asked Bryan "When you read that... the whale swallowed Jonah... how do you literally interpret that?"{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} Bryan replied that "a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases."{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible,{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a "buffoon".{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}

The largest whales—[[baleen whale]]s, a group which includes the [[blue whale]]—eat [[plankton]] and "it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring."&lt;ref&gt;Lydekker's New Natural History, Vol, III, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  As for the [[whale shark]], Dr. E. W. Gudger, an Honorary Associate in [[Ichthyology]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], notes that, while the whale shark does have a large mouth,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} meaning that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it.{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} He concludes that "the whale shark is not the fish that swallowed Jonah."{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}}

==Suggested connections to legends==
[[File:Chapiteau Mozac Jonas 1.JPG|thumb|Jonah being swallowed by a great toothed sea-monster. Sculpted column capital from the nave of the abbey-church in [[Mozac]], France, 12th century.]]
[[Joseph Campbell]] suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', in which [[Gilgamesh]] obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} In the Book of Jonah, a [[worm]] (in Hebrew ''tola'ath'', "maggot") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither;{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} whereas in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=118–119}} Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=119}}

Campbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of [[Jason]] in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is ''Jonas'', which differs from ''Jason'' only in the order of sounds—both ''o''s are [[omega]]s suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] sources—including [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] and the accounts of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] and [[Argonautica|Orphic Argonautica]]—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of "fleeing" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the "gourd" (kikayon).{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=1–20}} Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own, quite different message.{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=18–20}}

'''Lanterns of the Dead''' ({{lang-fr|Lanternes des morts|links=no}}) are small stone [[tower]]s found chiefly in the centre and west of France, pierced with small openings at the top, where a light was exhibited at night to indicate the position of a [[cemetery]].

These towers were usually circular, with a small entrance in the lower part giving access to the interior, so as to raise the lamps by a pulley to the required height. One of the most perfect in France is that at [[Cellefrouin]] ([[Charente]]), which consists of a series of eight attached semicircular shafts, raised on a pedestal, and is crowned with a conical roof decorated with [[fir]] cones; it has only one aperture, towards the main road. Other examples exist at [[Ciron]] ([[Indre]]) and [[Antigny, Vienne|Antigny]] ([[Vienne]]).

There is one surviving example in England, in the churchyard at [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]], which is referred to as the [[Grade II* listed buildings in Stroud (district)|Poor Souls' Light]].

==Misconceptions==
[[File:Cellefrouin lanterne3.JPG|thumb|right|Lantern of the Dead at [[Cellefrouin]] in the [[Charente]] department.]]
The origin and use of such lanterns are controversial. Some of those lanterns are said to be "lanterns of the [[Moors]]" instead of "lanterns of the Dead". The illiteracy of most of the population in the past can easily explain this [[folk etymology]]: in French, "the Moors" (''{{lang|fr|les Maures}}'') and "the dead" (''{{lang|fr|les morts}}'') are near-homophones. Moreover, some of those lanterns do not indicate any cemetery and their architecture has strong oriental influences. The proximity of [[Al-Andalus]], [[Crusades|Crusaders]] coming back to France, or trade in the Mediterranean may explain such monuments. For instance, the "lantern of the Moors"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vergeze.fr/vergeze.asp?idpage=12270&amp;id=30975]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115040909/http://www.vergeze.fr/vergeze.asp?idpage=12270&amp;id=30975 |date=November 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vergèze]], southern France, looks like the chimneys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hot-tour.mk.ua/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/3.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image |website=Hot-tour.mk.ua |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Bakhchisaray Palace]], the Palace of the [[Crimean Tatars]] in [[Crimea]], and doesn't indicate any cemetery. Actually, its other name is indeed the "[[Saracen]] chimney".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc-rhony-vistre-vidourle.fr/ot/monuments.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720210121/http://www.cc-rhony-vistre-vidourle.fr/ot/monuments.htm |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "lantern of the Dead" of [[Carlux]], Southern France, is called a "Saracen chimney"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/photo-carlux.html |title=Photos de Carlux, la Mairie de Carlux, sa commune et son village |website=Annuaire-mairie.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; too. Another example is the "lantern of the Moors" in [[Sarlat-la-Canéda]], in Southern France too. The origin of the lantern is linked with the abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who played a major role in the [[Second Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francemonthly.com/n/0808/index-f.php |title=Lettre d'information de France Monthly - été 2008 |website=Francemonthly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to have been built after a visit of the abbot in the city, in 1147, possibly by [[Knights Templar]] as would prove a sculpture on the tower representing a horse and two [[Cross pattée|Crosses pattée]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guiho |first=Ivy-Stevan |title=L'Ordre des Templiers: petite encyclopédie|publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2009 |isbn=978-2-296-09240-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PEoFDuN3biMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=L%27Ordre+des+Templiers:+petite+encyclop%C3%A9die++Par+Ivy-Stevan+Guiho p. 250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, "Saracen chimneys" (''{{lang|fr|Cheminées sarrasines}}'') are a typical local architecture feature of [[Bresse]], a region in Eastern France. It seems to bear the same name only coincidentally. And the origin of the name remains a mystery in that case too. Various fanciful origins exist for those who introduced this tradition, such as: survivors from the [[Battle of Tours]] (during which [[Charles Martel]] fought the [[Saracens]] in 732, 350&amp;nbsp;km and many centuries away), refugees from the Balkans fleeing the [[Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Burgundians]] settling in Bresse in the 5th-6th century and carrying with them Nordic-style chimneys, or monk-soldiers of the 12th century. Last given explanation, "Saracen", or "Arab" also meant "apocryphal" in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insolite.asso.fr/insolite/cheminee.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301090409/http://www.insolite.asso.fr/insolite/cheminee.htm |date=March 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Die Lesewut''' ([[German language|German]] for the ''reading craze'') or '''Die Lesesucht''' (''reading mania''), are terms that describe a period in [[German history]] beginning in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arthor, Art, and the Market: Rereading the History of Aesthetics |last=Woodmansee |first=Martha |authorlink=Martha Woodmansee |year=1994 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-10601-7 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe's]] [[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/bodotheauthorart00woodrich/bodotheauthorart00woodrich_djvu.txt |title=Novel Content Creation |accessdate=2008-06-25 |last=Galbi |first=Douglas |date=March 18, 2007 |work= |publisher=Purple Motes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement are considered to have been the catalyst for this event.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28758">The following is a list of '''languages''' used in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' since its inception in 1956, including songs (as) performed in finals and, since 2004, semi-finals.

The rules concerning the language of the entries have been changed several times. In the past, the Contest's organizers have sometimes compelled countries to only sing in their own national languages, but since 1999 no such restriction has existed.

==Rule changes==
From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the language(s) in which the songs could be sung. For example, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|1965 Contest]], [[Ingvar Wixell]] of [[Sweden]] sang his song in [[English language|English]].

From 1966 to 1972, a rule was imposed that a song must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating.

From [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] inclusive, participants were allowed to enter songs in any language. Several winners took advantage of this, with songs in English by countries where other languages are spoken, this included [[ABBA]]'s [[Waterloo_(song)|Waterloo]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] for [[Sweden]] &lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/facts-figures|title=Facts &amp; Trivia|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]], [[Teach-In_(band)|Teach-In]] with [[Ding-a-dong]] for [[The Netherlands]].

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), the Contest's organisers, reimposed the national language restriction. However, [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]] were given a special dispensation to use English, as their national song selection procedures were already too advanced to change. During the language rule, the only countries which were allowed to sing in English were [[Ireland]], [[Malta]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as English is an official language in those countries. The restriction was imposed from 1977 to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]].

From 1999 onwards, a free choice of language was again allowed. Since then, several countries have chosen songs that mixed languages, often English and their national language. Prior to that, songs such as [[Croatia]]'s "[[Don't Ever Cry]]" ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]]), [[Austria]]'s "[[One Step (song)|One Step]]" and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s "[[Goodbye (Alma Čardžić song)|Goodbye]]" ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]) had a title and one line of the song in a non-native language. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] Poland caused a scandal when [[Edyta Górniak]] broke the rules by singing her song in English during the dress rehearsal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=309|title= Eurovision Song Contest 1994|publisher=Eurovision.tv|date= |accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=309|title= Poland1994 - Edyta Gorniak To Nie Ja (Polish/English)|publisher=YouTube clip|date= |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (which is shown to the juries who selected the winner).  Only six countries demanded that Poland should be disqualified, though the rules required 13 countries to complain before Poland could be removed from the competition, the proposed removal did not occur. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision-contest.eu/news-archive/1994-eurovision-song-contest-facts|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1994 facts|publisher=eurovision-contest.eu|date=|accessdate=9 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109144728/http://www.eurovision-contest.eu/news-archive/1994-eurovision-song-contest-facts|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 some songs have used fictional or non-existent languages: the [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgian]] entries in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] ("[[Sanomi]]") and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] ("[[O Julissi]]") were entirely in fictional languages. In 2006 the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch]] entry, "[[Amambanda]]", was sung partly in English and partly in a fictional language.

The entry which used the most languages was "[[It's Just a Game]]", sung by the [[Bendik Singers]] for [[Norway]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]]. It was performed in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], with some lyrics in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. In 2012 [[Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bulgaria]]'s entry, "[[Love Unlimited (Sofi Marinova song)|Love Unlimited]]" had lyrics in Bulgarian, with phrases in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, [[French language|French]], [[Romani language|Romani]], Italian, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and English. 1969 Yugoslav entry "[[Pozdrav svijetu]]" was mainly sung in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], but it had phrases in Spanish, German, French, English, Dutch, Italian, Russian and Finnish.

As of 2017, only two countries have never entered a song in one or more of their national languages: [[Azerbaijan]] has not used [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] since its debut in 2008 (leading Bulgaria to be the first country to enter a song with Azerbaijani lyrics), and [[Monaco]] has not used [[Monégasque language|Monégasque]], its traditional national language.

On the other hand, as of 2016, there are only ten countries whose representatives have performed all their songs at least partially in an official, regional or national language: [[Andorra in the Eurovision Song Contest|Andorra]], [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italy]], [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]], [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]], [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]], and [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portugal]]. In addition, former countries [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia]], and current countries [[Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Australia]], [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]], [[Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest|Malta]] and [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|the United Kingdom]], only have been represented by songs fully in an official language.

===Criticism===
French legislator [[François-Michel Gonnot]] criticized French television and launched an official complaint in the French Parliament, as the song which represented France in 2008, "[[Divine (Sébastien Tellier song)|Divine]]", was sung in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/arts/17arts-FRENCHSINGER_BRF.html?_r=2&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin |title= French Singer Stirs Storm  | publisher = ''https://www.nytimes.com'' | date=2008-04-17 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first=Lawrence | last=Van Gelder}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident occurred again in 2014, when Spanish artist [[Ruth Lorenzo]] was criticized by the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] after [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|the Spanish national selection]] for singing her entry, [[Dancing in the Rain (song)|Dancing in the Rain]], with some lyrics in English.

==Languages and their first appearance==
Languages are fully counted below when they are used in at least an entire verse or chorus of a song. First brief uses of a language are also noted.

The term [[Croatian language|Croatian]] came into use during the 1970s; [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] evolved politically in the 1990s, and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] in the 2000s ''(see [[Serbo-Croatian]] for more details)''. Another view is that the first post-breakup entries can be considered the first for the respective languages: "[[Ljubim te pesmama]]" for Serbian in 1992, "[[Sva bol svijeta]]" for Bosnian in 1993, "[[Don't Ever Cry]]" for Croatian, also in 1993, and "[[Zauvijek moja]]" for Montenegrin in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1966 and 1973, and again between 1977 and 1998, countries were only permitted to perform in their own language; see the main [[Eurovision Song Contest#Language|Eurovision Song Contest]] article. In 2017 "[[Amar pelos dois]]" became the first [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] song to win the contest, the first winner since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] to both be in a language that had never produced a winning song before and be entirely in a language other than [[English language|English]]. Among all Eurovision winning entries, only Ukraine's were performed in more than one language.

The '''Mananambal''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] practitioner of [[traditional medicine]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Maturan | first =E.G. | title = Folk medicine and health care in Bohol: the mananambal and the mananabang | url=http://www.popline.org/docs/797390 | accessdate = 2008-07-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[medicine man]] who is also capable of performing [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. The ''mananambal'' treats both natural and [[supernatural]] maladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =McClenon | first =James | title =Island of the Sorcerers | url=http://www.mysiquijor.com/IslandoftheSorcerers.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The appellation ''mananambal'' is a derivative of the term for the art of ''panambal'' or "traditional folk healing" in the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref name="masc"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Mascuñana | first1 = Rolando V.  | last2 =Mascuñana    | first2 =Evelyn F.  | title =The Folk Healers-Sorcerers of Siquijor  | publisher =REX Book Store, Inc.  | date =  | year =2004  | isbn =971-23-3543-7  | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used most especially in the islands of [[Siquijor]] and [[Bohol]] in the [[Visayas]]. The term is synonymous with the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''[[albularyo]]'', a type of [[folk healer]].

==Methodology==
The ''mananambal'' uses a combination of traditional practice and [[Christian]] beliefs. The amalgamation of folk healing and Christian spiritism may have begun at the onset of the [[Spain|Spanish]] influence in the Philippines &amp;ndash; when [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] converted the Queen of [[Cebu]] to [[Catholicism]]. The ''mananambal'' observed the marked success in [[exorcism]] of the Spanish friars and wished for their part to be mediums of the high spirit (the [[Holy Spirit]]) that granted the Catholic friars such power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =What is Christian Spiritism?  | url =http://www.christianspiritism.com/christianspiritism/Christian%20Spiritism.html  | accessdate =2008-07-16  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081102023739/http://www.christianspiritism.com/christianspiritism/Christian%20Spiritism.html  | archivedate =2008-11-02  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This link with the Catholic faith is evident in their yearly quest, called ''pangalap'', for materials used as ingredients in the [[concoction]]s for their traditional practice. The ''pangalap'' begins seven Fridays after [[Ash Wednesday]], prior to the Christian observance of [[Holy Week]]. It culminates on [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]]. The ''mananambal'' also uses ''orasyones'' or "magical prayers".

===Pharmacopoeia===
The ''mananambal'''s pharmacopoeia is made up of plants (80%), animals (10%) and minerals (10%).&lt;ref name="masc"/&gt; 

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by the ''mananambal'' include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

==Sorcery==
The powers of sorcery may be gained after a practitioner "learns methods of malign magic and establishes a relationship with a spirit that supports this magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lieban | first =R.W. | authorlink = | title =Cebuano Sorcery: Malign Magic in the Philippines | publisher =University of California Press | date =1967 | pages =20–21 | isbn =0-520-03420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of sorcery include:

*''[[Barang (Philippine mythology)|Barang]]'' - the use of [[familiar spirit]] to inflict pain and sickness in a person
*''Haplit'' - using a [[doll]] to represent the victim; the Filipino sorcerer's equivalent of using a [[voodoo doll]]
*''Paktol'' - ''paktol'' means to "knock on the head"; the use of a skull or some other representation of the victim. Any insult done the representation, the victim feels the corresponding harm
*''Anyaw'' - the art of courting the favor of malign spirits with food containing no [[salt]]; the sorcerer then asks the spirit to bring harm on an intended victim
*''Là-gà'' - "to boil", the sorcerer boils objects belonging to the victim; the victim suffers from unease, sleeplessness, fatigue, malaise and later, death

These forms of sorcery equate with the Tagalog term, ''[[Kulam]]'' and are resistant to the ministrations of Western medicine. Only a ''mananambal'' can reverse the effects of such sorcery.

[[File:Spiro Wulfing and Etowah repousse plates HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Plates from [[Wulfing cache|Malden]], [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]]]]

'''Mississippian copper plates''', or plaques, are plain and [[Repoussé and chasing|repousséd]] plates of beaten [[copper]] crafted by peoples of the various regional expressions of the [[Mississippian culture]] between 800 and 1600 CE.  They have been found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. The plates, found as far afield as Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. Some of the more notable examples are representations of [[Bird of prey|raptorial birds]] and avian-themed dancing warriors.

==Copper in the Eastern Woodlands==
[[File:Anishanabe1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Diorama of [[Anishinaabe]] people mining copper near [[Lake Superior]]]]
Copper trade routes throughout the [[Eastern Woodlands]] were established during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] (3000 - 1000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 28-9&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into historic times.&lt;ref name="Broseet"&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 149&lt;/ref&gt; Copper was usually imported from the [[Great Lakes]] region; however other sources of copper have been found elsewhere including in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the Etowah Site in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 184&lt;/ref&gt;

For generations the [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Indigenous peoples of North America]] pursued copper sources and transmitted the skill of copper’s manipulation and preparation as a special material for use in elite goods on to their descendants. Elites at major political and religious centers during the Mississippian period used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These elites used a trade network that spanned most of North America to acquire exotic trade items from far away, trading their own locally manufactured elite goods and materials.&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/files/spotlightMar10_2.pdf|title=Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum-Spotlight Series March 2010|first=Matthew H.|last=Robb|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in [[medicine bundle]]s among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee (Creek)]], a group of copper plates carried along the [[Trail of Tears]] are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.&lt;ref name="Broseet" /&gt;

==Methods of manufacture==
[[File:NatCopper.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Unworked copper nugget]]
The [[native copper]], as well as the [[Work hardening|knowledge to work it]], is believed to have come from the Great Lakes area, hundreds of miles to the north of the Cahokia polity and most other Mississippian culture sites, although the copper workshops discovered near [[Mound 34]] at Cahokia are so far the only copper workshops found at a Mississippian culture [[archaeological site]].&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern’s]] [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] used an electron microscope to analyze pieces of the flat copper sheets found during excavations at the Mound 34 site at Cahokia. The researchers found that the metal had been repeatedly heated and cooled and while it was softened by the heat, had been hammered, a process known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], similar to how blacksmiths work iron.

After the flat sheets of copper were produced, designs were then embossed into the surfaces probably with stone, bone or wooden tools. [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], an anthropologist working in the early 20th century, worked out a method for flattening and embossing the plates. He hammered raw nuggets of copper smooth and removed imperfections by scouring the surface with a piece of sandstone. He was then able to duplicate the avian designs by resting the sheet of copper on a rawhide pad and pressing into the surface using a piece of pointed deer antler and pressing with his chest. This produced a sharp thin line that when the plate was reversed resembled the embossed lines of the aboriginal artifacts. This process is considered to be roughly similar to how Mississippian coppersmiths probably worked.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wulfing Plates : Products of Prehistoric Americans|author=Watkins, Virginia D.|year=2010|origyear=1950|publisher=Gustavs Library|asin=B004618COA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
===Avian themed plates===
Avian themed plates are thought to depict aspects of the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|Birdman]]'', a major figure in Mississippian iconography closely associated with warfare, ritual dancing, and the game of [[chunkey]].&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; Numerous examples of similar avian themed plates have been found in locations across the Midwest and Southeast, from the large cache found in [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] near the  bootheel region in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] to others from [[Mangum Mound Site|Mangum]] in Mississippi,&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mangum Plate|journal=[[American Antiquity]]|volume=18|date=July 1952|page=65|jstor=276247|issue=1|doi=10.2307/276247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] in Oklahoma, [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in Georgia, [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds]] in Florida and other sites in Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

====Cahokia and the Birdman====
[[File:Bird Man Cahokia USA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Birdman burial from Cahokia]]
Years of study by archaeologists, ethnologists and historians of artifacts of different materials found at many sites throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States has led many of these researchers to conclude that the cosmology associated with the avian imagery of this artwork originated at [[Cahokia]] (the largest Mississippian culture site, in western Illinois near St Louis, Missouri) between 1100 - 1300 CE. This cosmology was expressed as the "[[Braden style]]", a label applied to [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceramics]], [[Mississippian shell artwork|shell pieces]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]] and copper artifacts all bearing the hallmarks and elements of the same sophisticated style. These pieces were exported to other centers where they were emulated by regional craftsman and became the basis of local styles, such as the "Craig style" of Spiro Mounds, the "Hightower style" of Etowah Mounds and the "[[Hemphill style]]" of Moundville.&lt;ref name=2BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=Sequencing the Braden style within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|editor-first=F.

Avian imagery occupied a central place in Cahokian iconography, with examples including an incised sandstone tablet with a birdman excavated from [[Monks Mound]] and an elaborate elite personage burial in [[Mound 72#Birdman burial|Mound 72]] with thousands of shell beads arranged in the shape of a bird.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Other themes===
[[File:Etowah copper pieces HRoe 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Bi-lobed arrow plates from Etowah]]

==Known locations==

===Arkansas plates===
[[File:Toul Creek plate HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Toul Creek plate from northern Arkansas]]
A number of plates have been found in various sites in eastern [[Arkansas]]. At least three of the Arkansas examples (Rose Mound, Scott Place, and Clay Hill) and two others (a {{convert|32.6 |cm|in|sp=us}} found in a [[Dallas Phase]] burial at the [[Henry Farm Site]] (40 LO 53) in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]] in 1975 and a specimen unexamined by archaeologists thought to come either from the [[Neeley’s Ferry Site|Neeley’s Ferry]] (3 CS 24) or Rose Mound sites in Cross County) have stylistic similarities that indicate they may have all been made by the same artist. Four of the five were found in the [[St. Francis River]] Valley area of Arkansas. Researchers think the five plates may represent a composite creature that is part snake and part hawk as the shape of the tail feathers resemble a rattlesnakes' rattle or that the design may represent a hawk in the act of swallowing a snake.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Southeastern Archaeological Conference|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|date=November 13, 2008|title=Mississippian copper artifacts from Arkansas|author=Mitchem, Jeffrey M.|url=https://uark.academia.edu/JeffreyMMitchem/Papers/1288775/Mississippian_Copper_Artifacts_from_Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copper plate found at the [[Clay Hill Site]] (3 LE 11) in [[Lee County, Arkansas]] has the same chest region design and long narrow shape and distinctive tail feathers as the Scott Site and Rose Mound examples. Although fragmented it is approximately {{convert|14|in|cm}} in length. It was recorded to be in a private collection in 1978 but has not been seen since. The plate was found in an [[Armorel Phase]] burial that also contained a [[Clarksdale bell]], an item of European manufacture that is a hallmark of the 1541 [[Hernando de Soto]] excursion through the southeast. This does not date the era for the production of the plate though as such items were often kept as heirlooms for long periods, even many generations, before they ended up becoming [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In 1910 [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] found a stylized hawk or eagle plate while excavating graves at the [[Rose Mound Site]] (3 CS 27) in [[Cross County, Arkansas]]. The plate was {{convert|16.25|in|cm}} and remarkably well preserved, missing only the tip of one wing. The plate is not embossed but merely a shape cut from a flat copper sheet.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In the 1970s a copper bird {{convert|28|cm|in|sp=us}} in length was found by looters at the [[Scott Site]] (3 MS 24), also known as Big Lake Bridge, in [[Mississippi County, Arkansas]]. The specimen was located at the back of the head of an extended adult burial, and may have been bent over the top of the head. Eight plain pottery vessels grave good vessels were found with it.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

A possible partial avian style plate was found at the [[Magness Site]] (3 IN 8) in [[Independence County, Arkansas]] along with several [[Mississippian culture shell objects#Shell Cups|engraved shell cups]]. The plate is a typical head portion with the forked eye, earspool, and elaborate headdress and hairdo known from other examples. As the lower portion of the plate is missing it is impossible to tell if the figure is a dancer or a human headed bird like the Wulfing A plate.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;
 
A {{convert|8|in|cm}} avian themed plate very similar to the Wulfing Plates copper plate was discovered at the [[Toul Creek Site]] in [[Baxter County, Arkansas]] by several local farmers. The plate was located in the chest area of an extended adult who was also wearing the two limestone ear spools. Other grave goods found in the burial included a marine shell dipper and a {{convert|6|in|cm}} chert knife. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

===Etowah and the Rogan plates===
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Rogan plate, A91117]]
{{main|Etowah plates}} 
The Rogan plates were discovered in a [[stone box grave]] within Mound C at the [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Site]] by [[John P. Rogan]] in the 1880s. Several are very similar to plates later found at Lake Jackson Mounds, and it is believed that the Lake Jackson plates came from Etowah. The designs of the plates are in the Classic Braden style from the Cahokian area, and it is generally thought that some of the plates were manufactured at Cahokia before ending up at sites in the Southeast.&lt;ref name=BOLFING2010/&gt; The two Rogan plates were interred as a pair and are very similar to one another. The first is approximately {{convert|20|in|cm}} and the second {{convert|16|in|cm}}. Holes in the plates suggest they were once hung as a decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : Feathered Serpents &amp; Winged Beings|first=Susan C.|last=Power|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcEp9_6TPtMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=rogan+plates#v=onepage&amp;q=rogan%20plates&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0820325019|date=May 24, 2004|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plates were found by [[Warren K. Moorehead]] at the Etowah site in excavations during the mid-1920s. The other plates are in a slightly different style and indicate that local artisans had begun production of their own copper plates in emulation of the Braden style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=honorprog|page=39|last=LeDoux|first=Spencer Curtis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos, University College, University Honors Program|accessdate=October 25, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

These plates, along with artifacts from Spiro and [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept of the S.E.C.C.

===Florida plates===
[[File:Lake Jackson Braden Style Birdman Plate HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Copper Solar Ogee Deity plate found at Lake Jackson Mounds, Florida]]
Although at the periphery of the Mississippian world, Florida has been the site of the discovery many S.E.C.C. associated copper artworks. Archaeologists believe that this is because of the [[busycon]] shell trade, the shells being a valuable ritual and high status trade good to Mississippian elites. It has even been proposed that the [[Fort Walton culture]] founders of the [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds Site]] moved east and founded the settlement in approximately 1100 CE to strategically position themselves in this trade network. Lake Jackson trade for copper pieces seems to have taken place almost exclusively with the Etowah polity of north central Georgia. When Mound 3 at the site was excavated it yielded fourteen copper plates, deposited in the burial mound sometime between 1300—1500 CE.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|author= LeDoux, Spencer C.|degree=Honors|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos |chapter=Chapter 4 : The Lake Jackson Site|url= https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/3248/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Copper Solar Ogee Deity," a {{convert|21|in|cm}} high repoussé copper plate, depicts the profile of a dancing winged figure, wielding a ceremonial mace in its right hand and a severed head in the left. The extended, curling nose resembles a [[proboscis]] and resembles another S.E.C.C. motif, the long-nosed god maskette. The figures elaborate headdress includes a bi-lobed arrow motif and, at the top of the plate, an ogee motif surrounded by a chambered circle. Some art historians have argued that this plate and one of the Rogan plates may represent a female or "Birdwoman" because the breast on the figure protrudes slightly more than it does on other examples, while others have argued that the plate may represent a third gender or "[[two-spirit]]" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Power (2004), Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birdman, Birdwoman : Queering archeology at Lake Jackson|author=Bloch, Lee|url= http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00209/47j|volume=62|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=June 2010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Etowah polity in approximately 1375 trade continued for the Lake Jackson peoples, albeit now with peoples located in the northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee area. No longer able to get the elaborate copper plates from Etowah, a local style developed, producing a new style of such as that depicted on the "Elder Birdman" plate, thought to represent the merger of the Birdman corpus with a local solar deity.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009/&gt;

Further east and south into Florida were non-Mississippian culture peoples who were involved in long distance trade of local high status items such as busycon shells for gorgets and [[yaupon]] holly for the [[black drink]]. The [[Mill Cove Complex]] is a [[St. Johns culture]] site in [[Duval County, Florida]] with two sand burial mounds, one [[platform mound]] shaped and associated village habitation areas. [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] excavated the mounds in 1894 and found numerous copper grave goods, including two copper [[long-nosed god maskette]]s and 11 copper plates. The one plate found in the Shields Mound was plain, but several of the other 10 found in the Grant Mound were decorated with an oval central boss and ringed with an oval embossed or beaded line. They measured {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|15|cm|in|sp=us}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}. They had perforated holes for hanging. Archaeologists speculate they were used either for gorgets or headdress ornaments. Analysis of the metal in the plaques has connected them to locations in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin and the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the periphery of the Early Mississippian world : Looking within and beyond Northeastern Florida|author=Ashley, Keith H.|journal=Southeastern Archaeology| url=http://www.unf.edu/~kashley/Other%20Files/2002-periphery.pdf|volume=2|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in central Florida, the [[Old Okahumpka Site]] (8 LA 57) is a now destroyed burial mound in [[Lake County, Florida]] near the modern town of [[Okahumpka, Florida|Okahumpka]]. The site was excavated by Clarence B. Moore in the 1890s. During his excavation he found a burial associated plate measuring {{convert|7.1|cm|in|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|15.2|cm|in|sp=us}} in length and depicting the lower portion of a dancing figure wearing a sash, kilt, cuffed [[moccasin]]s, and holding a knife. The design is almost identical to two examples known from Spiro and a site in [[Jackson County, Alabama]], although of the three it is the only one to show a figure wielding a knife. Archaeologists estimate the plate was deposited in the mound sometime between 1100 and 1300 CE.

It has a mostly intact tail, which the Malden plates do not, and has helped archaeologists understand what the tails of the other pieces would have looked like.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; The Dancing Figures plate is a rectangular {{convert|15.5|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|16.5|cm|in|sp=us}} plate depicting two Birdman figures holding ceremonial chipped flint maces, possibly dancing, and shielding themselves from a possible liquid or ropelike motif falling from the top center of the plate.

===Malden plates or the Wulfing cache===
[[File:Wulfing plate A human headed avian HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=0.75|Human headed avian Malden Plate A]]
{{main|Wulfing cache}}
The plates of the ''Wulfing cache'', named after an early owner, were discovered by a farmer named Ray Groomes while plowing a field south of [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 213&lt;/ref&gt; The eight plates, made in the Late Braden style associated with Cahokia, are thought to date to the late 13th or early 14th century.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; The Wulfing plates depict raptors and one bird-human hybrids, ranging human heads to raptor's heads to double-headed raptors on stylized bird's bodies, with naturalistic bird's claws.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; The plates were found buried in a field with no known local mounds or village sites. They had been considerably used prior to their burial, as each plates shows multiple episodes of aboriginal repair work including patch repairs and riveted cracks.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

The eight plates are designated Plates A-H. Plate A, the only anthropomorphic human headed avian in the Wulfing cache, measures {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} in length by {{convert|13.5|cm|in|sp=us}} in width and weighs {{convert|84|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

Many similar plates found in other states are now believed to have come from the same workshop, if not the same artist, as the Wulfing cache. The sites of the discovery of these other plates span the United States from central Florida to northern Illinois to Oklahoma, and include the Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate, the Toul Creek plate, the Reed Mound plate, the Edwards plate,&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; and the Wilcox plate,&lt;ref name="MITCHEM" /&gt; as well as showing stylistic links to plates found in burials at Etowah and Spiro.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Spiro plates===
[[File:Spiro human headed avian plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro]]
[[Spiro Mounds]] is a [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] archaeological site located in present-day [[LeFlore County, Oklahoma]]. In the 1930s the only burial mound at the site, the Craig Mound, was looted by locals who used [[dynamite]] on the mound to gain access to its interior. Once inside the {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide cavity the looters discovered almost perfectly preserved fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, feathers and copper. The Great Mortuary, as the hollow interior has since became known to archaeologists, was a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred [[Ulmus crassifolia|cedar posts]] sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a ''[[tipi]]''. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it or with such large and distinctive collection of preserved artifacts. Among the grave goods were numerous copper pieces, including [[ear-spool]]s, [[Celt (tool)|{{not a typo|celts}}]], copper sheathed wooden knives&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt; and 265  repoussé plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; One of the more famous of these copper plates depicts a man's head, possibly severed, in profile, with a Forked Eye motif, an ear-spool, and hair styled into an occipital hair knot from which a single feather projects.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; The plate measures {{convert|24|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|17.4|cm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 211&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the plates is the avian themed "naturalistic hawk cutout", which measures {{convert|11.5|in|cm}} in width.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound:A photo essay|author1=Larry G. Merriam|author2=Christopher J.

Some of the other repoussé copper pieces found include eight examples of copper "feathers" that were worn as hair ornaments.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt;
Many of the  plates found at Spiro are in the "Braden Style" and are thought by archaeologists to have been imported from Cahokia.&lt;ref name=LAVERE&gt;{{cite book | title= Looting Spiro Mounds: An American King Tut's Tomb | author= La Vere, David | publisher= University of Oklahoma Press | date = April 1, 2007 |isbn=  978-0806138138 |pages= 80–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mangum plate HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Reconstruction of the plate found at Mangum]]
Besides the Spiro site, four other plates have been found during excavations at Caddoan Mississippian sites. The [[Reed Mound]] in Oklahoma produced a fragmentary Malden style plate thought to be from the same workshop as the Wulfing set.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; Three other plates were found at the [[Gahagan Mounds Site]] in [[Red River Parish, Louisiana]] in the early 20th century, along with numerous other copper objects including copper covered ear spools and a matched set of large copper long-nosed god maskettes. The plates were large rectangular plaques embossed with concentric circles or squares&lt;ref name=FUND107-108&gt;Fundaburk, ''Sun Circles and Human Hands'' : 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; and are similar to the Mount Royal plates from Florida. A matching pair of large thin sheet copper cutout human hands were also found at Gahagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caddo Ancestors : Early Caddo, A.D. 800-1200|url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/early.html|publisher=University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two plates were found in a [[Plaquemine culture]] site in Mississippi. Three fragments of a repoussé plate with an avian design were found in a burial in the [[Mangum Mound Site]] in [[Claiborne County, Mississippi]] in 1936 by a farmer who owned the site. When pieced together the plate was about {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width and weighed a total of {{convert|53|g|oz}}. The plate had been reinforced and riveted in several places to protect weak spots in the metal.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; A second plate was found during archaeological excavations at the site in 1963.&lt;ref name=GALLOWAY&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Patricia Galloway|last=Galloway|first=Patricia|title= Choctaw Genesis, 1500-1700 (Indians of the Southeast)|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2HVOImebydMC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=Mangum+copper+plate#v=onepage&amp;q=Mangum%20copper%20plate&amp;f=false|isbn=0-8032-7070-4|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mangum plates stylistically resemble the Rogan plates from Etowah.&lt;ref name=BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=On the identity of the Birdman within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|pages=56–106|editor-first=F.

==Other copper items==
[[File:Spiro copper ear spools HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Copper earspools from Spiro]]
Besides the repoussé copper plates, Mississippian people also created copper axes, knives, gorgets, beads, and fishhooks, as well as wooden beads and [[ear spool]]s covered in copper.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 69, 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s, a special kind of ear ornamentation, are sometimes found made of copper. Copper examples have been found at the Gahagan Mounds Site in Louisiana and at the Grant Mound in Florida, each of which produced two of the earpieces.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002/&gt; Several copper covered cedar knives were found in the Great Mortuary mound at Spiro. Several matching pairs were found, although of slightly differing lengths, ranging up to {{convert|17|in|cm}} long. One set had Weeping eye motifs repousséd into the copper sheathing.&lt;ref name=MERRIAM2004-a&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound :A photo essay|author1= Merriam, Larry|author2=Merriam, Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lX5sAAAAMAAJ|asin=B000V6S52S|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of copper and copper covered items have been found at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Alabama, although no copper plates have been found there. Moundville copper artifacts generally consist of copper covered ear spools and tear drop shaped pendants thought to represent trophy scalps. A unique copper piece was discovered at the [[Emmons Cemetery Site]] in [[Fulton County, Illinois]]. It is a wooden {{convert|11.9|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|9.9|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|5.5|cm|in|sp=us}} copper covered object shaped like a human face with a crenelated crown-like decoration on its forehead. It resembles the small human face that makes up part of the headdress of Malden plate A (including the distinctive crenelated crown-like structure) and archaeologists believe it was in fact part of a real headdress.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">The '''National Summer Learning Association''' ('''NSLA''') is an organization in the [[United States]] that claims to aspire "for every child to be safe, healthy, and engaged in learning during the summer."&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summerlearning.org/?page=about_us|title = About Us|publisher = National Summer Learning Association|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1992, Matthew Boulay, a student at [[Johns Hopkins University]], recruited his fellow undergraduates to provide tutoring and academic support to Baltimore City public schools students during the summer months. This led to a successful program called Teach Baltimore.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summerlearning.org/?page=our_history|title = Our History|publisher = National Summer Learning Association|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the growing research on [[summer learning loss]], Teach Baltimore evolved into the Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University in 2001. In September 2009, the Center transformed into the National Summer Learning Association, an independent organization.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Activities==

NSLA serves as a network hub for different summer learning programs and others interested in summer learning across the United States. According to their website, their efforts are focused on achieving the following results:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

* Increase the number of providers offering high-quality summer learning programs to young people living in poverty;
* Increase the number of organizations and policymakers that identify summer learning as a public policy priority; and
* Increase funding for high-quality summer learning programs for young people who currently lack choices and opportunities.

Partners of the NSLA include the [[American Camp Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acacamps.org/education/summer-learning-resources/nsla|title = Resources from the National Summer Learning Association|publisher = [[American Camp Association]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130107232502/http://www.acacamps.org/education/summer-learning-resources/nsla|archivedate = January 7, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sylvan Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tutoring.sylvanlearning.com/national_summer_learning_association_2013.cfm|title = National Summer Learning Association and Sylvan Learning Offer Solution to Boosting Summer Reading: Let Children Choose the Books|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Sylvan Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Media reception===

NSLA has been cited in the many articles discussing [[summer learning loss]] and its implications for the [[achievement gap in the United States]] in publications including the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/opinion/28smink.html?_r=0|title = This Is Your Brain on Summer|last = Smink|first = Jeff|date = July 27, 2011|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/education/at-retooled-summer-schools-creativity-not-just-catch-up.html?pagewanted=all|title = At Retooled Summer Schools, Creativity, Not Just Catch-Up|date = June 30, 2013|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''|last = Rich|first = Motoko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/302116-using-summer-to-narrow-achievement-gap/|title = Using Summer to Narrow Achievement Gap|last = Khan|first = Yasmeen|date = July 31, 2012|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[WNYC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/untapped-strategy-for-ed-reform-summer-learning/2012/06/18/gJQA3L9amV_blog.html|title = Untapped strategy for ed reform: summer learning|last = Strauss|first = Valerie|last2 = Huggins|first2 = Gary|date = June 19, 2012|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP43fe535cd76c4d8b983e8babdd260024.html|title = Not vacation: Summer learning programs crucial|date = August 10, 2013|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (via ''[[Associated Press]]'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age travellers''' are persons who often espouse [[New Age]] and [[hippie]] beliefs, and travel between [[music festival]]s and fairs, in order to live in a community with others who hold similar beliefs. Their transport and homes consist of vans, lorries, buses, cars, and caravans converted into [[mobile home]]s. They also make use of improvised [[bender tent]]s, [[tipi]]s and [[yurt]]s. "New Age" travellers largely originated in 1980s and early 1990s Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://subcultureslist.com/new-age-travellers/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The movement originated in the [[free festival]]s of the 1970s&lt;ref name=newold&gt;{{cite web|title=New Travellers, Old Story | url=http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/tcs/research_docs/Heritage%20pack_v5.pdf|publisher=The Children's Society|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Windsor Free Festival]], the early [[Glastonbury Festival]]s, [[Elephant Fayre]]s, and the huge [[Stonehenge Free Festival]]s in [[Great Britain]]. However, there were longstanding precedents for travelling cultures in Great Britain, including travelling [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]], itinerant [[journeyman|journeymen]] and traders, as well as [[Romani people|Romani]] groups and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivakhiv|first1=Adrian|title=Claiming Sacred Ground: Pilgrims and Politics at Glastonbury and Sedona|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-33899-9|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNHTOvnZ3poC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=romany+%22peace+convoy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=romany%20%22peace%20convoy%22&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later events included the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]], a huge free and unlicensed event which attracted widespread media coverage and prompted government action. Some legal festivals, such as [[WOMAD]], continue to take place in a variety of countries, including the UK.

==Peace convoy==
In the UK during the 1980s the travellers' mobile homes—generally old vans, trucks and buses (including double-deckers)—moved in convoys. One group of travellers came to be known as the Peace Convoy after visits to [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]] protest camps.&lt;ref name=newold /&gt; The movement had faced significant opposition from the British government and from mainstream media, epitomised by the authorities' attempts to prevent [[Stonehenge Free Festival|free festivals]] at [[Stonehenge]], and the resultant [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985—the largest mass civil arrest in English history.

In 1986 and subsequent years police again blocked travellers from "taking the Stones" on the [[Summer Solstice]] (June 21). This led Travelers to spend summers [[squatting]] by the hundreds on several sites adjacent to the [[A303 road|A303]] in Wiltshire.

==International manifestations==
===New Zealand===
[[File:Housetrucks and camping at Nambassa 1981.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Housetrucks at the [[Nambassa]] 5-day festival, 1981]]

[[Housetrucker]]s—whether individuals, families or groups—convert old trucks and [[school buses]] into mobile homes and live in them, preferring an unattached and transient lifestyle to using more conventional housing. These unique vehicles began appearing around [[New Zealand]] during the mid-1970s and even though there are fewer {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} they continue to adorn New Zealand roads.

An early manifestation of this culture came with the [[Blerta]] (1970–1973) traveling circus of music, light theatre and art. This involved a well-known New Zealand actor, [[Bruno Lawrence]], and 30 or 40 hangers-on who traveled around the country in a clapped-out Bedford bus, sang, wrote and did hippie art. Most of the riders were radicals, hippies, groovers and free thinkers. They attracted a following and had a hit single with "Dance around the world" which was nominated for the [[Loxene Golden Disc]] in 1971, a local musical award at the time. After 1973 the Blerta project ran out of steam, and Lawrence turned his hand back to acting in such movies as ''[[Smash Palace]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, eds., ''Nambassa: A New Direction'', A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979.{{ISBN|0-589-01216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary British travelling scene==
Many people see the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] in 1992, a weeklong festival that attracted up to 30,000 travellers and ravers, as a significant turning point for New Age Travellers in Britain, as it directly resulted in the government granting new powers to police and local authorities under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] to prevent such events in the future. The Criminal Justice Act included sections against disruptive trespass, squatting and unauthorised camping which made life increasingly difficult for travellers, and many left Britain for Ireland and mainland Europe, particularly Spain.

However, thousands of people still live a traveller lifestyle in Britain.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Few, if any, travellers live on the local authority sites reserved for [[Romani people|Romani/Gypsy]], [[Scottish Travellers|Scottish Gypsies/Travellers]] and [[Irish Traveller]]s, so instead stay on unauthorised sites throughout the countryside, particularly in Wales and the south-west of England, and in urban areas.{{fact|date=September 2018}} London hosts a large number of traveller sites in places such as disused factories and warehouse yards, and there is often a crossover between travellers and [[squatters]], with travellers parking up in yards attached to squatted buildings.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Typical traveller sites might have anywhere from 5 to 30 vehicles on them, including trailers and caravans as well as buses, vans, and [[horsebox]]es converted to live in.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Although most travellers in Britain are British, large numbers of Continental Europeans also "travel" in the UK.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

As unauthorised sites are evicted and travellers moved on frequently, accessing basic services such as health and dental care, refuse collection, benefits, and education for children can be problematic. Many traveller families [[home-school]] their children.

Although travellers have only taken to the road since the 1960s, {{As of| 2010 | lc = on}} many traveller families have reached their third or fourth generation. Despite widespread popular assumptions about travellers living on state handouts, many do seasonal or temporary work, on farms and building sites or in factories and pubs for example.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Others work as self-employed mechanics, electricians and plumbers, or make money selling scrap, or running stalls at markets and [[car boot sale]]s. Festivals during the summer also present many opportunities for travellers to make money through offering entertainment, services and goods to festival goers. A high level of mutual aid, the sharing of childcare and vehicle maintenance and "[[dumpster diving|skipping]]" (collecting food from local supermarket [[Skip (container)|skips]]) within communities allow travellers to live on very low incomes.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The traveller and [[free party]] scenes often have close links, and many travellers run or are involved with the sound systems of [[rave]]s and [[squat parties]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Those are the first things to be said about the overwhelming play that opened at the St. James last evening. But they hardly convey the excitement of the first performance of a play that represents experience of life and conviction in thought and a production that represents a dynamic use of the stage. … In staging it Mr. Welles picks up the bravura style of the Mercury Theatre where he left it two or three seasons ago. In ten savory scenes, acted on different levels with a resourceful use of the stage, he runs through the narrative, giving motion to static scenes by flares of light and putting ''Native Son'' into its urban environment by a varied use of sound accompaniment. Mr. Welles is a dramatic showman; he likes big scenes, broad sweeps of color and vigorous contrasts in tempo. He likes theatre that tingles with life."&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;}} {{efn|Cast: Canada Lee (Bigger Thomas), [[Evelyn Ellis]] (Hannah Thomas), [[Helen Martin]] (Vera Thomas), Lloyd Warren (Buddy Thomas), Jacqueline Ghant Andre (A Neighbour), Eileen Burns (Miss Emmett), J.

[[File:Bernard Childs, The Critic (Portrait of Pierre Restany), 1959, Oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|right|The Critic (Portrait of Pierre Restany) by [[Bernard Childs]], Oil on canvas, 1959]]
'''Pierre Restany''' (24 June 1930 &amp;ndash; 29 May 2003), was an internationally known French [[art critic]] and cultural [[philosopher]].

Restany was born in [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda]], [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], and spent his childhood in [[Casablanca]]. On returning to France in 1949 he attended the [[Lycée Henri-IV]] before studying at universities in France, Italy and Ireland. From their first meeting in 1955, Restany maintained a strong tie with [[Yves Klein]] (to whom is attributed [[International Klein Blue|Klein-blue]]).

==Conceptions of New Realism / Nouveau Realisme==
In 1960 Pierre Restany created the idea and coined the term "[[Nouveau réalisme|Nouveau Réalisme]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, pp. 352-353&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Yves Klein]] during a group show in the [[Apollinaire]] gallery in [[Milan]]. It was an idea that united a group of French and Italian artists.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nouveau Realisme was the European answer to the American [[Neo-Dada]] of [[Fluxus]] and [[Pop Art]]. The group included [[Martial Raysse]], [[Arman]], [[Yves Klein]], [[François Dufrene]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Jacques Villeglé]] - and was later joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Christo]].

Restany defined this group of artists as sharing "new perceptual approaches to reality". The first exhibition of the "Nouveaux réalistes" took place in November 1960 at the Paris Festival d'avant-garde. Their work was an attempt at reassessing the concept of art and the artist in the context of 20th-century consumer society by reasserting [[humanistic]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] in the face of [[Industry|industrial]] expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Artopos|date=1996-08-02|title=Pierre Restany|url = http://www.artopos.org/contributors/restany-fr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 he co-founded with Jeannine de Goldschmidt the Galerie J in Paris.

In 1963, Restany edited the art and [[architectural]] magazine [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]] and divided his time between [[Montparnasse]], Paris and [[Milan]], eventually becoming a regular contributor to the magazine until 2003. In 1969 he was one of the curators of the [[São Paulo Biennial]]. In the early 1970s he took interest in the work of the [[Sociological art|Sociological art collective]]. In 1982 he co-founded the [[Domus Academy]], the first postgraduate design school in Milan. From the early 1990s up to his death, Restany took a keen and growing interest in artists working in the areas of [[computer art]], [[new media art]], [[digital art]] and the [[world wide web]]. In 1984 he was appointed the editor of the visual art magazine ''D'Ars''. In 1992, he curated the travelling exhibition ''Art &amp; Tabac'' (Rome, Vienna and Amsterdam). In 1999 he was nominated President of the [[Palais de Tokyo]] in Paris.

Pierre Restany died in Paris in 2003 and is buried in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18661">'''Postpartum confinement''' refers to a system for recovery following [[childbirth]]. This [[postpartum period]] (less commonly, puerperium or puerperal period) begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=/PHN/PHN12_03/S1368980008002152a.pdf&amp;code=3ba0290fddc1bb0d50aadfcbedad50cd |title=Effect of Alcohol consumption on Maternal lactation characteristics during ‘doing-the-month’ ritual |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, up to 40 days, two months or 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1021145/confinement-practices-an-overview|title=Confinement practices: an overview|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postnatal recuperation can include "traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tung|first1=Wei-Chen|title=Doing the Month and Asian Cultures: Implications for Health Care|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=22 June 2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=369–371|doi=10.1177/1084822310367473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice used to be known as "[[lying-in]]", which, as the term suggests, centres around [[bed rest]].

The custom is well-documented in China, where it is known as "Sitting the month". Japanese women know it as "''Sango no hidachi''" and Koreans as "''Samchilil''", which means "thirty-one". In Latin American countries it is called ''la cuarentena'', i.e. "forty days" (the source of the English word "[[quarantine]]"). In India it is called ''jaappa'' (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''japa'').

==Commonalities and benefits==
[[File:Breastfeeding-7.jpg|thumb|A mother breastfeeds her infant while another woman gives support.]]
Postpartum confinement refers both to the mother and the baby. Human [[newborn]]s are so underdeveloped that pediatricians such as [[Harvey Karp]] refer to the first three months as the "fourth trimester"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/24/155426534/dr-karp-on-parenting-and-the-science-of-sleep|title=Dr. Karp On Parenting And The Science Of Sleep|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=National Public Radio|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|department=All Things Considered|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The weeks of rest while the mother heals also protect the infant as [[Adaptation to extrauterine life|it adjusts to the world]], and both learn the skills of [[breastfeeding]].

A 2016 American book describes the difficulties of documenting these "global grandmotherly customs" but asserts that "like a golden rope connecting women from one generation to the next, the protocol of caring for the new mother by unburdening her of responsibilities and ensuring she rests and eats shows up in wildly diverse places"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ou|first1=Heng|last2=Amely|first2=Greeven|last3=Belger|first3=Marisa|title=The First Forty Days: The Essential Art of Nourishing the New Mother|date=2016|isbn=9781617691836}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One meta-review of studies concluded, "There is little consistent evidence that confinement practices reduce postpartum depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Josephine|last2=Fisher|first2=Jane|title=The role of traditional confinement practices in determining postpartum depression in women in Chinese cultures: A systematic review of the English language evidence|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=August 2009|volume=116|issue=3|pages=161–169|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2008.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all countries have some form of [[maternity leave]]. Many countries encourage men to take some [[paternity leave]], but even those that mandate that some of the shared [[parental leave]] must be used by the father ("[[father's quota]]") acknowledge that the mother needs time off work to recover from the childbirth and deal with the [[postpartum physiological changes]].

==China==
[[File:Chinese painting of woman breastfeeding her child. Wellcome L0006337.jpg|thumb|Chinese painting of a woman breastfeeding her baby, surrounded by supporters]]
"Sitting the month": 坐月子 "''Zuò yuè zi''" in Mandarin or 坐月 "Co5 Jyut2" in Cantonese.  The custom, going back to the year 960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/i-tried-the-chinese-practice-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth/2017/01/06/54517ee0-ad0b-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html|title=I tried the Chinese practice of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|last=Hsu Oh|first=Leslie|date=8 January 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is referred to as 'confinement' as women are advised to stay indoors for recovery from the trauma of birth and feed the newborn baby. Aspects of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are included, with a special focus on eating foods considered to be nourishing for the body and help with the production of [[breastmilk]]. In [[Guangdong]] and neighboring regions, new mothers are barred from visitors until the baby is 12 days old, marked by a celebration called 'Twelve mornings' (known as 十二朝). From this day onwards, Cantonese families with a new baby usually share their joy through giving away food gifts, while some families mark the occasion by [[Ancestor veneration in China|paying tribute to their ancestors]]. 

In [[ancient China]], women of certain ethnic groups in the South would resume work right after birth, and allow the men to practice postpartum confinement instead.&lt;ref&gt;《[[太平廣記]]》卷四八三引[[尉遲樞]]的《[[南楚新聞]]》記載："南方有[[仡佬族|獠婦]]，生子便起。其夫臥床褥，飲食皆如乳婦。"《[[马可·波罗游记]]》："[[傣族]]妇女产子，洗后裹以襁褓，产妇立起工作，产妇之夫则抱子卧床四十日"；《黔记》卷二：郎慈苗在咸宁州，其俗更异，妇人产子，必夫守房，不逾门户，弥月乃出。产妇则出入耕作，措饭食，以供夫乳儿，日无暇刻。"&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Couvade]].)

=== Everyday habits and personal hygiene practices ===
During confinement, mothers are told not to expose their body to physical agents such cold weather or wind, as these are claimed to be detrimental to their recovery. Specifically, mothers were traditionally not allowed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgmmbb.com/chanhou/zyz/092M0T2010.html 坐月子能洗头吗?坐月子洗头对身体有什么影响？]&lt;/ref&gt; to have any contact with water (e.g. bathing or washing hair), to exert themselves by climbing stairs, to read books or cry, to sew, or to have sex. 

Nowadays, however, new mothers may wash their hair or take a bath or shower infrequently during the postpartum period, but it is claimed to be important to dry their body immediately afterwards with a clean towel and their hair properly using a hair dryer. It is also claimed to be important for women to wrap up warm and minimize the amount of skin exposed, as it was believed that they may catch a cold during this vulnerable time.

=== Special foods ===
[[File:Pig_feet_ginger.jpg|thumb|Pork knuckle with ginger and black vinegar]]
The custom of confinement advises new mothers to choose energy and protein-rich foods to recover energy levels, help shrink the [[uterus]] and for the [[perineum]] to heal. This is also important for the production of [[Breast milk|breastmilk]]. Sometimes, new mothers only begin to consume special herbal foods after all the [[lochia]] is discharged.

A common dish is [[Pork Knuckles and Ginger Stew|pork knuckles with ginger and black vinegar]] as pork knuckles are believed to help replenish calcium levels in the women. Ginger is featured in many dishes, as it is believed that it can remove the 'wind' accumulated in the body during pregnancy. Meat-based soup broths are also commonly consumed to provide hydration and added nutrients. Although not entirely backed by scientific evidence, for example, fish and papaya soup is considered to help produce breastmilk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1023191/milk-booster-fish-and-papaya-soup|title=Milk booster: fish and papaya soup|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other East Asian countries==
Other [[East Asian]] cultures, such as [[South Korean culture|South Korean]] and [[Vietnamese culture|Vietnamese]], have their own versions of "sitting the month", combining prescribed foods with proscribed activities. Similar practices are popular among Japanese women called 産後の肥立ち "''Sango no hidachi''" and Korean women called 삼칠일 "''Samchilil''" for at least 21 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/korean-postpartum-rituals-21-days.html|title=Little Seouls Blog: Korean Postpartum Rituals 삼칠일 (21 days)|website=littleseouls.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new mother is given special postnatal foods, such as [[Miyeokguk|seaweed soup]] in Korea. ''Samchilil'' is practiced in addition to other traditions encompassed in [[sanhujori]], which is Korea's version of postnatal care. During this period of time that could extend beyond the 21 days, women followed principles that emphasize activities and foods that keep the body warm, rest and relaxation to maximize the body’s return to its normal state, maintaining cleanliness, eating nutritious foods, and peace of mind and heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jeongeun|date=March 2003|title=Survey on the Programs ofSanhujoriCenters in Korea as the Traditional Postpartum Care Facilities|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1300%2FJ013v38n02_08|journal=Women &amp; Health|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=107–117|doi=10.1300/j013v38n02_08|issn=0363-0242}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Thailand ''yu-fai'' ("lie down by a fire") treatment is traditional postpartum healing. Performed in an open area, it involves using smokeless tamarind wood, local herbs and massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Lie down by a fire |url=http://bangkokpost.com/multimedia/vdo/thailand/427374/lie-down-by-a-fire  |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]]|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Most traditional Indians follow the 40-day confinement and recuperation period also known as the ''jaappa'' (in Hindi). A special diet to facilitate milk production and increase hemoglobin levels is followed. Sex is not allowed during this time. In Hindu culture, this time after childbirth was traditionally considered a period of relative impurity (''asaucham''), and a period of confinement of 10–40 days (known as ''purudu'') was recommended for the mother and the baby. During this period, she was exempted from usual household chores and religious rites. The father was [[ritual purification|purified by a ritual bath]] before visiting the mother in confinement. 

In the event of a stillbirth, the period of impurity for both parents was 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Marshall / Jaya Tirtha Charan Dasa |url=http://www.hknet.org.nz/asaucham-info.htm |title=GUIDE TO RITUAL IMPURITY - What to do at the junctions of birth and death |publisher=Hknet.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many Indian subcultures have their own traditions after birth. This birth period is called Virdi (Marathi), which lasts for 10 days after birth and includes complete abstinence from ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' or temple visits.

The ''cuarantena'' (literally, forty days, also meaning [[quarantine]]) is practised in parts of Latin America, and amongst immigrant communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/04/why_wont_this_new_mom_wash_her_hair.html|title=Why Won't This New Mom Wash Her Hair?|last=Tuhus-Dubrow|first=Rebecca|date=11 April 2011|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as "intergenerational family ritual that facilitated adaptation to parenthood", including some paternal [[role reversal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niska|first1=Kathleen|last2=Snyder|first2=Mariah|last3=Lia-Hoagberg|first3=Betty|title=Family Ritual Facilitates Adaptation to Parenthood|journal=Public Health Nursing|date=October 1998|volume=15|issue=5|pages=329–337|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1446.1998.tb00357.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Lying-in}}
[[File:4 Master of Charles of Durazzo (Francesco di Michele) A Birth Scene (Desco da Parte), c. 1410 Harvard Art museum (2).jpg|thumb|A mother in [[Florence]] lying-in, from a painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' or birth tray of c. 1410. As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving.]]
The term used in English, now old-fashioned or [[archaism|archaic]], was once used to name [[maternity hospital]]s, for example the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] in London. A 1932 Canadian publication refers to lying-in as ranging from two weeks to two months.&lt;ref name="Nusche"&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/675 Lying in by Jan Nusche] quoting ''The Bride's Book — A Perpetual Guide for the Montreal Bride'', published in 1932&lt;/ref&gt; These weeks ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. 

Lying-in features in [[Christian art]], notably ''[[Nativity of Christ in art|Birth of Jesus]]'' paintings. One of the gifts presented to the new mother in Renaisssance Florence was a ''[[desco da parto]]'', a special form of painted tray.

== Modern commercial versions ==
Traditionally, women were taken care of by their elders: their mother, mother-in-law, sister, or aunt. The lying-in hospitals provided an institutional variation which gave women weeks of bedrest and a respite from household chores.

Increasingly, these older women are unavailable or unwilling to take on this role; given the lingering effects of the [[one-child policy]], many older Chinese women had limited experience of newborn babies, having only had one themselves. Replacements for this familial help are commercial services, both in the home and at residential centres. 

Agencies provide specialist carers that come to the new parents' home. This job used to be known as the [[monthly nurse]], as she came and lived with the family for a month. Now more common terms are maternity nurse, newborn care specialist, or [[Nanny#maternity_nurse.2FNewborn_Care_Specialists.2FConfinement_Nanny|confinement nanny]]; the worker is not a registered health care professional such as the word "[[nurse]]" usually implies in current English. In [[Indian English]] the role is called a "''japa'' maid". A [[doula]] is best known as a birth companion, but some provide practical and emotional post-birth support. A [[lactation consultant]] and a [[health visitor]] are trained health professionals who may assist the new mother at this time. In the Netherlands, the in-home support is known as ''[[kraamzorg]]''.

The use of ''yue sao'', a specialist carer translated in Canada as "postpartum doula",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quan|first1=Douglas|title=Underground industry serves moms who follow Chinese custom of 'sitting the month' after childbirth|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/buyer-beware-underground-industry-serves-moms-who-follow-chinese-custom-of-sitting-the-month-after-childbirth|accessdate=28 October 2017|publisher=National Post|date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also very common in China. ''Yue Sao'' typically are live-in domestic helpers who care for both the new mother and baby for the first month after birth. Salaries as at 2017 vary from RMB8000 to RMB20000 per month depending on city and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://www.ayicheng.com/yue-sao-baby-china-blog/?lang=en|title= Yue Sao|website= Ayicheng|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as "mothering the mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ownyourbirth|url=https://www.ownyourbirth.ca/single-post/2017/11/07/Zuo-Yue-Zi-%E5%9D%90%E6%9C%88-Sitting-the-Month|website=ownyourbirth|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Australian documentary-maker [[Aela Callan]] called them "Chinese supermums" but says they are colloquially known as "confinement ladies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Supermums|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/chinas-supermums|website=News|publisher=[[SBS (Australian TV channel)]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg|thumb|300px|Various recorders (second from the bottom disassembled into its three parts)]]
The '''recorder''' is a [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] [[musical instrument]] of the family which includes the [[tin whistle]]. The recorder is end-blown and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug, known as a ''block'' or ''fipple''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove Music Online recommends that use of the word ''fipple'' should be abandoned because its meaning is confused, however, other sources (e.g. the Oxford Dictionary of Music) continue to use it.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from other members of the family by having holes for seven fingers (the lower one or two often doubled to facilitate the production of [[semitone]]s) and one for the thumb of the uppermost hand.  Recorders can be made out of wood, plastic or ivory.&lt;ref name="Profile of the recorder"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://musiced.about.com/od/windinstruments/p/recorder.htm|title=Profile of the recorder|publisher=About.com Music Education|accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recorder was popular in [[Medieval music|medieval times]] through the [[Baroque music|baroque]] era, but declined in the 18th century in favour of orchestral woodwind instruments, such as the [[flute]], [[oboe]], and [[clarinet]].

The recorder was revived in the 20th century, partly in the pursuit of [[historically informed performance]] of early music, but also because of its suitability as a simple instrument for teaching music. Today, it is sometimes thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many professional players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range. See [[Recorder (musical instrument)]] for further information on advanced usage.

==Name of the instrument==
The instrument has been known by its modern name at least since the 14th century. ''Grove's Dictionary'' reports the earliest use of the word ''recorder'' was in the household of the [[Earl of Derby]] (later to become [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]) in 1388: ''{{Lang|la|fistula nomine Recordour}}''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Grove's Dictionary of Music''(online Edition): "Recorder" article, part 1: Nomenclature&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from "to learn by heart", as birds do; the recorder is thought to emulate bird song.

==History==
{{details|Recorder (musical instrument)#History}}
Internal duct-flutes have a long history: an example of an [[Iron Age]] specimen, made from a sheep bone, exists in [[Leeds]] City Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. See section 1 of "Recorder Family" article&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|Renaissance recorders]]
The recorder achieved great popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries. This development was linked to the fact that [[art music]] (as opposed to [[folk music]]) was no longer the exclusive domain of nobility and clergy. The advent of the printing press made it available to the more affluent commoners as well. The popularity of the instrument also reached the courts however. For example, at [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s death in 1547, an [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of his possessions]] included 76 recorders.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on "Recorder Family"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous references to the instrument in contemporary literature (e.g. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hamlet]]'', [[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 3#Scene 2. A hall in the castle.|Act 3, scene 2]], Hamlet: "Ah, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milton|Milton]]&lt;ref&gt;''Paradise Lost, Book I'': "Anon they move/ in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood/ flutes and soft recorders"&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive database of literary references to the recorder see here [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/quotes.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several changes in the construction of recorders took place in the 17th century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as ''Baroque'' recorders, as opposed to the earlier ''Renaissance'' recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone which was regarded as "sweeter" than that of the earlier instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7546-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes, and a slightly reduced range.

The instrument went into decline after the 18th century, being used for about the last time as an otherworldly sound by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] in his opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]].''  By the Romantic era, the recorder had been almost entirely superseded by the flute and clarinet. One variant of the recorder survived into the 19th-century concert halls, however: the keyed recorder known as the [[czakan]] or ''{{lang|de|Stockflöte}}''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Modern revival===
The recorder was revived around the turn of the 20th century by [[early music]] enthusiasts, but used almost exclusively for this purpose. It was considered a mainly historical instrument. Even in the early 20th century it was uncommon enough that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] thought it to be a kind of [[clarinet]], as he told one day to [[Frans Brüggen]], when asked to write a new piece for recorder. This reaction is not surprising since the early clarinet was, in a sense, derived from the recorder, at least in its outward appearance.

The eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in the UK and various German scholar/performers. While he was responsible for broadening interest beyond that of the early music specialist in the UK, Dolmetsch was far from being solely responsible for the recorder's revival. On the Continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the performances of the [[Bogenhauser Künstlerkapelle]] (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) based in Germany. Over the period from 1890-1939 the Bogenhausers played music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.&lt;ref&gt;Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. Chapter 1: The Revival&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the revival, far from being the work of one man, was the result of several strands coming and working together.

Carl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe, and consequently modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Jürg Baur]], [[Josef Tal]], [[John Tavener]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Steven Stucky]] and [[Edmund Rubbra]].

The recorder is often used in popular music, including that of groups such as [[The Beatles]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Fool on the Hill'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095832/http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Rolling Stones]] (see, for example, "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]"); [[Yes (band)|Yes]], for example, in the song "[[I've Seen All Good People]]"; [[Jefferson Airplane]] (see [[Jefferson Airplane#Personnel|Personnel]] as well as [[Grace Slick]]); [[Led Zeppelin]] ([[Stairway to Heaven]]); [[Jimi Hendrix]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the song ''[[If 6 Was 9]]'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095832/http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]];&lt;ref&gt;For example in the song ''Green Fingers'', according to [http://www.discogs.com/release/386971 Discogs.com's page on the album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Dyble]] of [[Fairport Convention]]; [[Dido (singer)|Dido]];&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Grafton Street''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mannheim Steamroller]].

Some modern music calls for the recorder to produce unusual noises, [[rhythm]]s and [[Extended technique|effect]]s, by such techniques as [[flutter-tonguing]] and [[overblowing]] to produce [[multiphonics]]. [[David Murphy (composer)|David Murphy]]'s 2002 composition ''Bavardage'' is an example, as is Hans Martin Linde's ''Music for a Bird''.

Among late 20th-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio [[Sour Cream Trio|Sour Cream]] (led by [[Frans Brüggen]]), [[Flautando Köln]], the [[Flanders Recorder Quartet]], [[Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet]] and [[Quartet New Generation]] have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. [[Piers Adams]] is a recorder player who has toured and recorded widely, as well as being involved in education.

[[File:Furulya 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Recorder with German fingering. Note that the 4th finger-hole is larger than the 5th.]]

Recorders are named according to the size of the instrument.  There are two schemes of naming, one linked to the historical use of the instrument, the other to the human voice it most closely resembles.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--"Descant", "treble", "soprano", "alto", "tenor", and "bass" all refer to singing ranges of the human voice. How can this be different from historical usage?--&gt; 

=== Descant or soprano ===
‘Descant’ is the usual term in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], while ‘soprano’ is the term used in [[US English]].

This is the most common instrument today and is tuned to C, meaning that the lowest note possible is a [[C (musical note)|C]].  It can be a little shrill, so in advanced playing is often restricted to a descant or extra line above the main melody.  Although actually sounding an octave higher because of the timbre it feels as though it is pitched similarly to a human soprano.  The relatively short spacing between holes and the cheapness of the instrument have made it an ideal first instrument in schools.

=== Treble or alto ===
The treble recorder is the main melody instrument in advanced work, just as the trebles are in church choral music.  When reading accounts of recorders in the past, this is usually the instrument meant unless otherwise stated.  It sounds closest to a human alto voice.  The instrument is tuned to [[F (musical note)|F]].  Many school bands consist of descant/soprano and treble/alto instruments only.  The reach on treble recorders is longer than the descant and this, together with the higher price, make it an instrument for those starting to progress.

=== Tenor ===
The tenor recorder is occasionally found in schools.  It is twice the size of the descant/soprano and so may be too large for children's fingers to reach.  The lowest hole is controlled by one or two keys because of the stretch.  It is also tuned to C, but is an octave below the smaller instrument.

=== Bass ===
The bass is the largest recorder commonly met with.  It is an F instrument, about three times the length of the descant/soprano.  Like the tenor the lowest hole is controlled by keys.

=== Other sizes ===
Specialist players may also employ smaller instruments: garklein (C) and sopranino (F).  There are larger instruments: great bass (C), contrabass (F), subcontrabass (C) and octobass (F).  Intermediate instruments in D, B-flat, G and E-flat exist but will not be found in elementary music.

==Construction and operation==
[[File:Recorder300.svg|left|thumb|Cross-section of the head of a recorder]]
Today, high-quality recorders are made from a range of hardwoods.  Plastic recorders are produced in large quantities. Plastics are cheaper and require less maintenance and quality plastic recorders can be as good as lower-end wooden instruments.  Plastic recorders can be sterilised by soaking in a mild disinfectant, which may be desirable if they are shared between classes.  Beginners' instruments, the sort usually found in children's ensembles, are plastic and can be purchased quite cheaply.

The recorder is held outwards from the player's lips (rather than to the side, like the "transverse" flute). The player's breath is compressed into a linear airstream by a channel cut into the wooden "block" or [[fipple]] (A), in the mouthpiece of the instrument, so as to travel along this channeled duct (B) called the "windway".&lt;ref name=bolton&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flute-a-bec.com/acoustiquegb.html |first= Philippe |last = Bolton |title= How Recorders Work |accessdate= 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exiting from the windway, the breath is directed against a hard edge (C), called the "labium" or "ramp", which causes the column of air within the resonator tube to oscillate with [[standing wave]]s. Unlike simple whistles where holes are progressively unstopped, the recorder uses half-holing and forking (see below) to modify the position of the nodes.&lt;ref name=bolton /&gt;

==Notation and pitch==
School recorders are [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] at [[concert pitch]] (A=440&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The recorder family is non-transposing, which means that sheet music for recorder is nearly always written in the key in which it is played. A written C in the score actually sounds as a C.  Recorders are referred to as "C-fingered" or  "F-fingered", depending on the lowest note. This implies that the player must learn two different sets of similar fingerings, one for the C recorders and another for the F recorders. A player may go from one C-fingered instrument to another easily, and from one F-fingered instrument to another easily, but switching between the two requires knowing both sets of fingerings, or the ability to transpose the music at sight.

Descant/soprano recorders transpose at the octave, as does the bass.  In modern scores, octave transpositions may be indicated by adding a small figure "8" above the treble or bass clef on descant/soprano or bass recorder parts, but in the past and still commonly today, the transpositions are not indicated and instead are assumed from context.  Bass instruments use the bass clef but may occasionally use the treble clef and transpose down an octave.  The other three common instruments all use the treble clef.

To make the transition to playing a treble/alto recorder easier, some educational music is written C-fingered, in which case the instrument transposes up a fourth.

As a rule of thumb, recorders sound one octave above the human voice after which they are named (soprano recorder is an octave above soprano voice, alto an octave above alto voice, etc.) The recorder's mellow tone and limited harmonics allows for the seemingly deeper sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapiasgold.com/crb/instruments.html www.tapiasgold.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of a modern recorder is usually taken to be about two [[octave]]s except in virtuoso pieces. See the table above for fingerings of notes in the nominal recorder range of 2 octaves and 1 whole tone. Notes above this range are more difficult to play, and the exact fingerings vary from instrument to instrument, so it is impractical to put them into the table here.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Wollitz, ''The Recorder Book'', Knopf, 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-47973-4}}. See Chapter 1, "Technique"&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder, according to the pictures.

===Half-holing, forking, and shading===
The lowest chromatic scale degrees – a semitone and a minor third above the lowest note – are played by covering only a part of a hole, a technique known as "half-holing." Most modern instruments are constructed with double holes or keys to facilitate the playing of these notes; such double holes are occasionally found on baroque instruments, where even the hole for the third finger of the left hand can be doubled. Other chromatic scale degrees are played by so-called "fork" fingerings, uncovering one hole and covering one or more of the ones below it. Fork fingerings have a different tonal character from the diatonic notes, giving the recorder a somewhat uneven sound. Budget tenor/bass recorders might have a single key for low C/F but not low C{{music|#}}/F{{music|#}}, making this note virtually impossible to play. Double low keys allowing both C/F and C{{Music|#}}/F{{Music|#}} are more or less standard today.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;

===Pinching===
Most of the notes in the second octave and above are produced by partially opening the thumbhole on the back of the recorder, a technique known as "pinching". There are two basic methods for achieving this: a) drawing the thumb away from the hole, and b) bending the thumb.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"&gt;Walter van Hauwe, ''The Modern Recorder Player'', Volume I, Schott, 1984. ISMN 979-0-2201-1382-6. See Part II, Chapter 5, "The Left Thumb"&lt;/ref&gt; The first method uses only the skin of the thumb to define the opening, while the second method uses also the nail edge. The latter technique enables better feel and thus control of the size of the opening.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"/&gt; The placement of the thumb is crucial to the tone, intonation and stability of these notes, and varies as the notes increase in pitch, making the boring of a double hole for the thumb unviable. To play the notes in the second register and above, the player must generally blow more air into the instrument and/or tongue somewhat harder to excite the second or upper harmonics of the instrument.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt; This is, however, not universally true; it is possible for example to slur ''piano'' between and in the second and third registers.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heyens, ''Advanced Recorder Technique'', Volume I, Schott, 2005. {{ISBN|3-7957-0516-9}}. See Chapter 3, "Scales/Arpeggios/Chromatic Scales", p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===German fingering===
In the early part of the 20th century, [[Peter Harlan]] developed a recorder that allowed for apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five which is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four which is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F and B{{Music|b}} which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4–67. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 – – –. Unfortunately, however, this causes many other chromatic notes to be too badly out of tune to be usable.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' {{ISBN|0-907908-75-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as the recorder began to be treated more seriously and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Hunt, ''The Recorder And Its Music''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many recorder makers continue to produce German fingered instruments today, essentially for beginner use only.

==Dynamics==
Changes in dynamics are not easy to achieve on the recorder if the player is accustomed to other wind instruments. The general belief is that if the player blows harder to play louder, or more softly to play softer, the pitch changes and the note goes out of tune, and unlike the transverse flute, the player cannot change the position of the mouth in relation to the labium in order to compensate, and that therefore the recorder is not capable of dynamic changes. This is misleading.  Subtle changes in wind pressure are possible if the player has a good ear for tuning and knows how hard the instrument can be pushed before pitch changes become noticeable. But this is not the correct approach to recorder dynamics.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Playing Recorder Sonatas'' Clarendon Press {{ISBN|0-19-879001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recorder it is better to think of the breath controlling pitch, and the fingers controlling dynamics; for example by resting the fingers lightly on the holes breath leaks around them, lifting the pitch; and the resulting instinctive change in breath pressure to bring the pitch back also drops the volume.  The recorder is notable for its sensitivity to articulation; in addition to its obvious use for artistic effect skilled players can also use this sensitivity to suggest changes in volume.&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas /&gt;

==Use in schools==
[[File:Japanese YAMAHA Instruments Recorders 1.JPG|thumb|Plastic recorder ([[Yamaha]])]]
In the mid-20th century, German composer and music educator [[Carl Orff]] popularized the recorder for use in schools as part of [[Orff-Schulwerk]] programs in German schools. Orff's five-volume opus of educational music ''Music for Children'' contains many pieces for recorders, usually scored for other instruments as well.&lt;ref&gt;Regner, Hermann. Orff-Schulwerk Floetenbuch, Preface. Translated by I.M. Rushworth. http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers have made recorders out of [[bakelite]] and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-36743-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is basically determined by fingering. It is, however, incorrect to assume that mastery is similarly easy—like any other instrument, the recorder requires study to play well and in tune, and significant study to play at an advanced or professional level.

==Unconventional uses==
[[File:Blockflötenkopf.ogg|thumb|Playing on a Soprano recorder head joint]]
[[File:StrikingBell.jpg|left|thumb|An elementary recorder class striking the bell of the recorder during a concert.]]
The head of recorders is sometimes used as a [[noisemaker|noise]], [[rhythm]] and [[sound effect|effect]] instrument, and as a toy musical instrument with children (e. g. in a [[rhythm band]]), since the recorder head works like a [[whistle]]. With a bit of practice, it is easy to play all kind of rhythms. Effects are made by opening and covering the lower end of the head joint with the hand while blowing. Agnes Dorwarth of the [[Hochschule für Musik Freiburg]] argues this is an attractive way to get children to play with part of the instrument, which can make playing the entire instrument more inviting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikschulen.de/projekte/musikschulkongress/musikschulkongress13/ag7/index.html|title=AG 7 - Musikschulkongress '13|last=Dorwarth|first=Agnes|publisher=[[:de:Verband deutscher Musikschulen|Verband deutscher Musikschulen]]|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many players blow harder than "normal" recorder playing (like with a [[pea whistle]]) to achieve a very loud, shrill and penetrating sound.

The recorder can also give an effect by striking the bell with the palm of the hand.  The note varies according to the type of instrument.  Although unfingered the note will be a soft version of the lowest note of the recorder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--Not my experience, but if a reliable source says so . . .--&gt;

Additional effects can be obtained by blowing across the window, somewhat after the manner of a flute.  Fingering can be used; the effect is like a soft, breathy, baroque flute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Recorder ensembles==
The recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Recorder+flute |title=Recorder flute definition of Recorder flute in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Remember Me''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Dontnod Entertainment]] and published by [[Capcom]]. It was released worldwide in June 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The game's plot focuses on [[Nilin (Remember Me)|Nilin]], a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by [[megacorporation]] Memorize. With the help of a mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people's recollections. The combat consists of a modified [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] system called Pressen.

''Remember Me'' was developed as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, with one of the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled ''Adrift'', it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, [[Olivier Deriviere]]'s soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Remember Me gameplay.png|thumb|right|[[Nilin (Remember Me)|Nilin]] engages in combat, using the Spammer against her enemies]]

''Remember Me'' features [[Platform game|platforming]], exploration and melee combat.&lt;ref name="GSreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriasang" /&gt; The game is played as [[Nilin (Remember Me)|Nilin]] from a [[third-person view]] and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome.&lt;ref name="Andriasang" /&gt; Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player.&lt;ref name="MemoryTrailer" /&gt; When the player is low on health, the screen will [[glitch]] until a sufficient amount of health is regained.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles in the form of [[riddle]]s she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.&lt;ref name="cite video game" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c1t3 v1d30 g4m3" /&gt;

In terms of combat, the game allows players to create and customise their own [[Combo (video gaming)|move combos]] in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will be made available to the player over the course of the game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C1T3 V1D30 G4M3" /&gt; Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.&lt;ref name="junk spam" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
The game is set in the year [[2080s#2084 2|2084]], in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris, where the Memorize corporation has invented a new [[brain implant]] called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories.&lt;ref name="MemoryTrailer" /&gt; This establishes Memorize as a [[surveillance state]],&lt;ref name="Andriasang" /&gt; which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down the corporation. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.&lt;ref name="MemoryTrailer" /&gt;

=== Plot ===
The game begins as Nilin ([[Kezia Burrows]]),&lt;ref name="burrow" /&gt; an Errorist imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] Fortress, is having almost all her [[Memory erasure|memory wiped]] by Memorize. As she is taken to have the last of her memories wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed [[Bad Request]], is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.

Nilin reluctantly goes along with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's technology is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing the memory of a car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.

With all of Memorize's secret operations taken down, Edge presses Nilin to find the Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, the creator of the Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once in the presence of the Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly [[Memory erasure|removed]]. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.

== Development ==
Development of the game began in 2008 when [[Dontnod Entertainment]] was formed.&lt;ref name="MorisInterview" /&gt; Initially called ''Adrift'',&lt;ref name="joystiq1" /&gt; the original concept of the game was a world flooded from [[global warming]], with a key gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team became interested in the concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there.&lt;ref name="AdriftRename" /&gt; It was originally developed as a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] publishing it exclusively for the [[PlayStation 3]], starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 [[Gamescom]] trade fair in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal.&lt;ref name="RememPS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdriftCancelled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="m4k1ng0f" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3dg3" /&gt; [[Capcom]] purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an [[action-adventure game]] for release on multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="m4k1ng0f" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPpurchase" /&gt;

The game's theme was inspired by the social network sites that abound in the modern world, with Facebook, [[Tumblr]] and Twitter cited as examples.&lt;ref name="MorisInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RememberInspiration" /&gt; Moris explained that while some elements looked fantastical, the game was grounded in the real world in terms of how social networking might evolve over the coming decades.&lt;ref name="RememberInspiration" /&gt; ''Remember Me'' was considered to be the [[Digital media|digital]] view of human identity compared to Dontnod's ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', its [[Analog device|analogue]] counterpart.&lt;ref name="analogue" /&gt; The game was influenced by classic cyberpunk [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'',&lt;ref name="Ming-Jan2015" /&gt; and one of the literary works referenced in the game is [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name="orwell" /&gt; When asked in an interview why he made the protagonist a woman, Moris replied that he wanted a game in the [[cyberpunk]] genre that was more about "emotion, intimacy, identity, and the way technology would intersect those", so it made more sense for the player character to be a woman. However, when the game was shown to potential publishers, many were discouraged from backing the project, saying that a male character would be more successful.&lt;ref name="RememberInspiration" /&gt;

One of the challenges with designing Nilin was also creating a protagonist that was not over-sexualised or ineffective.&lt;ref name="NilinConcept" /&gt; The music was composed by [[Olivier Deriviere]], who recorded the score with a 70-piece orchestra,&lt;ref name="70-piece" /&gt; then modified and changed it using electronic equipment. In an interview with ''[[Game Informer]]'', Deriviere said: "During my first contact [with the game], I was quite confused by so much information and I felt the music should reflect this confusion".&lt;ref name="RememberMusic" /&gt; Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme until the end of the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin.&lt;ref name="MainTheme" /&gt; For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 [[International Film Music Critics Association|IFMCA]] award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media.&lt;ref name="ifmca" /&gt; ''Remember Me'' was created with [[Unreal Engine 3]] to lessen the workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees. To evaluate the engine, Dontnod collaborated with [[Epic Games]]' engineering team at various stages during production.&lt;ref name="unrealengine3" /&gt;

''Remember Me'' received "mixed or average" reviews, according to [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; In 2017, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' named ''Remember Me'' one of the best cyberpunk video games.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph-2017" /&gt; The world design, soundtrack and plot were praised, while aspects of the story, design choices and combat were criticised.

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' staff lauded Nilin as "a powerhouse of a protagonist" for possessing a blend of character traits that made her instantly likeable, and the story of reclaiming her lost memories was praised as well. The puzzles were said to be fresh and thought provoking.&lt;ref name="EdgeReview" /&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Tom Bramwell appreciated Dontnod's work on the "refreshing" combat system. He felt the Memory Remix sequences were absorbing and said the portrayal of technology being abused was handled well.&lt;ref name="EuGreview" /&gt; According to Ben Reeves of ''[[Game Informer]]'', ''Remember Me''{{'}}s Memory Remixes constituted the highlight of the game, and the soundtrack was also subject to enjoyment.&lt;ref name="GIreview" /&gt; Kevin VanOrd at [[GameSpot]] was satisfied with the main character, calling her "a great heroine who is both powerful and vulnerable". The premise and general setting were commended, with the musical soundtrack appraised as "superb".&lt;ref name="GSreview" /&gt; Ryan Taljonick at [[GamesRadar]] wrote favourably of the city setting and noted that it was rich in detail. Taljonick agreed that the Memory Remix held the most excitement of all the features in the game.&lt;ref name="GRadReview" /&gt; Justin Speer of [[GameTrailers]] thought ''Remember Me'' presented its concept with "fascinating" and "ridiculous" elements, while the manipulation of minds with the Memory Remix was described as rewarding.&lt;ref name="GTreview" /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Daniel Krupa admired the ambition of the game. Neo-Paris was considered vibrant and distinctive, and as with the rest of reviewers, he praised the ability to remix memories.&lt;ref name="IGNreview" /&gt; Ludwig Kietzmann at ''[[Joystiq]]'' approved of Nilin's power to manipulate memories, wishing that there were more opportunities to use it.&lt;ref name="JoystiqReview" /&gt; Staff writing for ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK|OPM (UK)]]'' opined that the futuristic setting was "astonishing" and "visually arresting".&lt;ref name="OMPreview" /&gt; Arthur Gies of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' endorsed the game world, story and protagonist as its most positive aspects. He argued that the combo modification system set apart an otherwise predictable combat system. Gies felt the soundtrack deserved recognition for its well-written and unique style, which he thought excellently complemented the central theme.&lt;ref name="Polygonreview" /&gt;

Conversely, ''Edge'' staff complained that characters other than Nilin were weaker overall. The design of the Pressens combos was thought to be flawed, as the rate at which one unlocks them was too slow to use them until the final hours of the game.&lt;ref name="EdgeReview" /&gt; Though Bramwell found engagement in the first few hours, he said that the later parts of the story suffered from too many science fiction elements. The absence of external motivation for the main character was also disparaged.&lt;ref name="EuGreview" /&gt; Reeves was dissatisfied with the characters, whose world he said was more interesting than they were, and the story was berated for being "uninspired".&lt;ref name="GIreview" /&gt; VanOrd observed that the game was held back by an unfulfilling story and sub-par level design. The dialogue and metaphors were criticised for dimming the story's potential.&lt;ref name="GSreview" /&gt; Taljonick also disliked the dialogue, with overwhelming [[jargon]] noted as one of its chief offences. The exploration was deemed restrictive, the level design claustrophobic, and the combat system "stiff".&lt;ref name="GRadReview" /&gt; Krupa was unimpressed with the action, which he felt lacked variation and was not well executed. His delight in the setting led to disappointment with the limited exploration of it. The lack of Memory Remixes received reproval as well.&lt;ref name="IGNreview" /&gt; Kietzmann declared ''Remember Me'' as "a listless and mediocre action game" whose appearance held more value than its performance, and objected to the combat for being "stilted" and void of excitement.&lt;ref name="JoystiqReview" /&gt; ''PlayStation Official Magazine – UK'' staff became quickly disenchanted with the game as it delved into "generic fighting".&lt;ref name="OMPreview" /&gt;

===Sales===
The game became a Capcom "Platinum Title", with more than 1 million copies sold.&lt;ref name="CapcomPlatinum" /&gt; Its inclusion on [[PlayStation Plus]] accumulated more than two million players,&lt;ref name="two million plus" /&gt; causing it to become the second most downloaded PlayStation Plus title in Europe.&lt;ref name="nods ew" /&gt;

== Other media ==
Prior to the game's release, an official prelude story was published by way of a multimedia web site. The interactive site was depicted as the diary of Antoine Cartier-Wells, founder of the Memorize corporation and creator of the Sensen brain implant, and it tells the story of Memorize during the 100 years preceding the start of the game.&lt;ref name="capcom unity" /&gt; At the time of the game's release, a 24-page print comic book written by [[Matt Kindt]] and illustrated by [[Matthew Southworth]] was released by [[Dark Horse Comics]], as an exclusive bonus item for those who pre-ordered the game from [[GameStop]].&lt;ref name="dark horse" /&gt; Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary.&lt;ref name="darker horse" /&gt; On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months before the start of the game, and centring on the character of Nilin. Titled ''The Pandora Archive'', it was written by British novelist [[Scott Harrison (writer)|Scott Harrison]] and published by Capcom as an [[e-book]].&lt;ref name="pandora archive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rmnovel" /&gt;

== Sequel ==
On 10 March 2015, Dontnod announced they had already completed the story for a possible sequel, ''Remember Me 2''.&lt;ref name="resequel me" /&gt; Dontnod creative director Jean-Maxime Moris said "We know what we would do for ''Remember Me 2''. The main story has been written we know what we would add to the recipe. We know what we would fix. It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of ''Life Is Strange'' before proceeding with the sequel to ''Remember Me''.&lt;ref name="however" /&gt; A sequel is reportedly no longer viable with Capcom;&lt;ref name="viable" /&gt; Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert admitted that while "[''Remember Me''] did OK", only ''Life Is Strange''{{'}}s unexpected success saved the company from "a very difficult" financial situation.&lt;ref name="two million plus" /&gt;

[[File:May Irwin Kiss.ogv|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896) contained what was regarded as the very first sex scene on film, drawing the general outrage of movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, [[obscenity|obscene]] and completely immoral.]]

'''Sex in film''' is the inclusion of a presentation in a film of sexuality. 

Since the development of the medium, inclusion in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial. Some films containing sex scenes have been criticized by religious groups or have been banned or the subject of censorship by governments, or both. In countries with a [[film rating system]], films containing sex scenes typically receive a restricted classification. [[Nudity in film]] may be regarded as sexual or as non-sexual.

An '''erotic film''' is usually a film that has an [[eroticism|erotic]] [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] that causes the creation of [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]]. 

Love scenes, erotic or not, have been presented in films since the [[silent era]] of [[cinematography]]. A [[pornographic film]], on the other hand, is a sex film which does not usually claim any artistic merit. Sex scenes have been presented in many genres of film, although there are some in which is rare. Many actors and actresses have performed nude/partial nude scenes, as well as dress and behave in ways considered sexually provocative by [[Modesty#Modesty in dress|contemporary standards]] at some point in their careers.

==Terminology==
Sex in film can be distinguished from a sex film, which usually refers to a pornographic film and sometimes to a [[sex education]] film. It should also be distinguished from nudity in film, though nudity can be presented in a sexualized context. For example, [[nudity]] in the context of [[naturism]] would normally be regarded as non-sexual. Some people distinguish between "gratuitous sex" and sex scenes which are presented as integral to a film's plot or as part of the character development.

Sex scenes are the main feature of pornographic films. In [[softcore pornography|softcore]] films, sexuality is less explicit. [[Erotic]] films are suggestive of sexuality, but need not contain nudity.

==Production==
Since the 2010s, film and TV productions increasingly employ [[intimacy coordinator]]s to ensure the wellbeing of actors who participate in sex scenes, and to help prevent harassment and violations of consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinelli |first1=Marissa |title=HBO Will Use “Intimacy Coordinators” for All of Its Sex Scenes |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/hbo-sex-scenes-the-deuce-watchman-intimacy-coordinators.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Slate Magazine |date=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Almodóvar]] of Spain is a prolific director who has included eroticism in many of his movies. [[Tinto Brass]] of Italy has dedicated his career to bringing explicit sexuality into [[mainstream]] cinema. His films are also notable for [[feminist]]-friendly eroticism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} French filmmaker [[Catherine Breillat]] caused controversy with [[unsimulated sex]] in her films ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999) and ''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'' (2004). In Italy, nudity and strong sexual themes go back to the silent era with films such as ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1926 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1926). [[Lars von Trier]] of Denmark has included explicit/unsimulated sex scenes in some of his films, such as ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), ''[[Manderley Castle|Manderlay]]'' (2005), ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'' (2009), and ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' (2013). He is also a co-founder of film company [[Puzzy Power]], a subsidiary of his [[Zentropa]], with the goal of producing [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]]s for women. ''[[Blue is the Warmest Colour]]'' (2013) sparked an international firestorm over its frank depiction of sexuality between two young women, yet managed to win the [[Palme d'Or]], the highest prize awarded at the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2013. ''[[Love (2015 film)|Love]]'' (2015) contains many explicit unsimulated sex scenes.

==United States==
[[File:Lorna Poster.jpg|thumb|''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of [[Russ Meyer]]'s films where the main female part, played in this film by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of her large [[breast]] size]]

The inclusion in film of any form of sexuality has been controversial since the development of the medium. [[Kiss#Kissing in films|Kissing in films]], for example, was initially considered by some to be scandalous. ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896) contained a kiss, which was regarded as a sex scene and drew general outrage from movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, [[obscenity|obscene]] and completely immoral. One contemporary critic wrote, "The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other's lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xq5FAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 The Chap-book, Volume 5, Number 5, July 15, 1896 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church called for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps in defiance of the righteous indignation and "to spice up a film", the film was followed by many kiss imitators, including ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899) and ''The Kiss'' (1900). Other producers would take the criticism on board, or in mock of the standard, and use an implicit kiss, which would be obstructed from view just as the lips would touch, such as shielding a possible kiss by placing say a hat in front of the actors' faces, or fading to grey just as a kiss is to take place, etc.

The display of cleavage created controversy. For example, producer [[Howard Hughes]] displayed [[Jane Russell]]'s cleavage in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) and in ''[[The French Line]]'' (1953), which was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of Russell's "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her [[decollete]] gowns were regarded to be "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Doherty, Thomas  |author2=Doherty, Thomas Patrick  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Hollywood's censor: Joseph I. Breen &amp; the Production Code Administration |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=310 |isbn=0-231-14358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both films were condemned by the [[National Legion of Decency]] and were released only in cut versions.

The selection of actresses for a role on the basis of their breast size is controversial and has been described as contributing to [[breast fetishism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latteier|1998|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has proved to be a draw card. Producers such as [[Russ Meyer]] produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of breast size. The producers and exhibitors of the film were prosecuted for obscenity in several US states. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Erica Gavin]], [[Tura Satana]], and [[Uschi Digard]] among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further.&lt;ref name=russmeyer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Russ |others=(Under the pseudonym "Adolph Albion Schwartz") |year=2000 | title=''A Clean Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer'' (3 volume set) |publisher=Hauck Pub Co |location=El Rio, TX |isbn=0-9621797-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and director [[William Rotsler]] said: "with ''Lorna'' Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= McDonough, Jimmy|year=2005| title=''Big bosoms and square jaws : the biography of Russ Meyer, king of the sex film'' | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-224-07250-1}}, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

===By genre===
In North America, erotic films may be primarily [[plot (narrative)|character driven]] or [[plot (narrative)|plot driven]], with considerable overlap. Most dramas center around character development, such as [[Steven Shainberg]]'s ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002). Comedy films, especially romantic comedies and romantic dramas, tend toward character interaction.

Mystery films, thrillers, drama and horror films tend toward strong plots and premises, such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), ''[[Nine 1/2 Weeks]]'' (1986), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'' (1995), ''[[Different Strokes (film)|Different Strokes]]'' (1997), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999) and ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name="CB1" /&gt; Others, like ''[[About Last Night...]]'' (1986), ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' (2001), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Love &amp; Other Drugs]]'' (2010), ''[[Blue Valentine (film)|Blue Valentine]]'' (2010), ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' (2011), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Sessions (film)|The Sessions]]'' (2012) combine both strong plots and characters.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundin |first=Leigh |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=13152 |title=Erotic Mystery Thrillers |work=Sex-n-violence |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100324/REVIEWS/100329990/1023 |title=Chloe|publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thrillers====
[[Erotic thriller]]s are a popular American erotic subgenre, with films such as ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[The Maddening]]'' (1995), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999), ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Boy Next Door (film)|The Boy Next Door]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name="CB1"/&gt; In some films, the development of a sexual relationship (or even a [[one-night stand]]) is often used to create tension in the storyline, especially if the people involved should not be sleeping together, such as in ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), where a [[U.S. Marshal]] has sex with the criminal she is pursuing.

====Horror====
In [[horror film]]s, sex is often used to ''mark'' characters that are doomed to die. Characters that engage in sex acts are often the first to be claimed by the antagonist(s), or will die shortly after their sex scene or (sometimes) in the middle of it. This convention of it being bad luck to have sex in a horror film is notably illustrated in the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' film series, where supernatural villain [[Jason Voorhees]] takes a special dislike to teenagers and young adults having sex because, as a young boy, he drowned in a lake while the camp counselors who should have been supervising him were having sex.

In some interpretations of this "rule", the sex acts themselves directly cause the character's demise. In ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'', a man catches the deadly illness because a woman who was infected (but not yet symptomatic) seduces and has impulsive sex with him. They don't use a [[condom]] because the careless woman believes she is healthy. Ironically, the woman (and the audience) only realize that she is infected because of red welts that are brought out by their rough lovemaking. ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995) and its sequels also feature many sexual deaths as virtually every human who mates with an alien in the franchise subsequently dies - female aliens kill human suitors regardless of whether they have poor genes, resist the alien's advances, or mate successfully. Human women who mate with alien men die shortly after sex as their abdomens burst during the unnaturally rapid pregnancy that always follows.

Most times in horror movies the [[final girl|typical survivor]] is a young girl who is still a virgin. In the film ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', which satirizes horror movies, this rule is somewhat broken as the character [[List of Scream characters|Randy Meeks]] points out that one of the rules of horrors is to not have sex. In an intersecting scene, the film's main [[protagonist]] [[Sidney Prescott]] loses her virginity to Billy Loomis. After they finish, Billy is stabbed by [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] and Sidney is then chased. Randy himself survives a gunshot wound at the end of the film because, as he explains, he is a virgin. However, he dies in the sequel, ''[[Scream 2]]'', after which it is revealed that he lost his virginity sometime prior to his death.

==Mexico==
In Mexico, many comedy films are based on sex, typically portraying men as unstoppable sex-seeking creatures and women as willing targets. Although the number of such comedies waned during the 1990s, domestic servants, bar workers, dancers and neighbors' wives continue to be depicted as potentially willing sexual partners.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The films ''[[La Tarea]]'' (1991), ''[[Miracle Alley]]'' (1995) and ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' (2001) are some of the most important examples of this.{{According to whom|date=May 2017}}

==India==
The [[Cinema of India|entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of [[India#Society|Indian society]] in general. Historically, [[Indian television]] and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex. Kissing scenes, for example, were banned by Indian film censors until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Arnab (February 25, 2013). [http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/kissing-is-on-the-rise-in-india-but-not-because-of-bollywood-author-say/?_r=0 "On Kissing, Bollywood and Rebellion"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the entertainment industry has liberalized but the taboo against them continues well into the 2010s, with many of [[Bollywood]] stars refusing to do them, and controversy and debate sparked when actors choose to do them.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Prashant (August 25, 2014). [http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/what-s-the-big-deal-about-a-kiss-asks-bollywood/article1-1256221.aspx "What’s the big deal about a kiss, asks Bollywood"]. ''[[Hindustan Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing [[sexual assault]] were common until approximately the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Muditha (May 15, 2013). [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/bollywood-women/4692082 "Bollywood's culture of rape"]. ABC&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream films are still largely catered for the masses of India, however, [[art film]]s and foreign films containing sexuality are watched by Indians. Because of the same process of glamorization of film entertainment that occurs in [[Hollywood]], Indian cinema, mainly the Hindi-speaking Bollywood industry, is also beginning to add sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/indians-mature-enough-to-handle-sex-in-films-konkona-sen/|title=Indians mature enough to handle sex in films: Konkona Sen|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
{{Update|section|date=October 2015}}
{{Globalise/US|section|date=October 2015}}
Many [[dramatic programming|drama series]], and daytime [[soap opera]]s are based around sex. This commonly revolves around the development of personal relationships of the main characters, with a view of creating [[sexual tension]] in the series.

Partial nudity was considered acceptable on daytime television in the 1970s but disappeared after 2000, partly due to more conservative morals,&lt;ref name="HR1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002276018 |title=Erotic thrillers lose steam on big screen|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|location=Hollywood |date=2006-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722010019/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002276018 |archivedate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to the prevalence of cable and satellite subscriptions. Only [[PBS]] occasionally features nudity.

In 2008 and 2009, the French TV channel [[Canal+]] featured a series titled ''[[X Femmes]]'' (English: ''X Women''), which consisted of ten short films shot by female directors with the goal of producing erotica from a female point of view.

A '''sound film''' is a motion picture with [[synchronization|synchronized]] sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a [[silent film]]. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early [[sound-on-disc]] systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in [[sound-on-film]] led to the first commercial screening of [[Short film|short motion pictures]] using the technology, which took place in 1923.

The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid- to late 1920s. At first, the sound films which included synchronized dialogue, known as "talking pictures", or "'''talkies'''", were exclusively shorts. The earliest [[feature film|feature-length]] movies with recorded sound included only music and effects. The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', released in October 1927. A major hit, it was made with [[Vitaphone]], which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology. Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures.

By the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's position as one of the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see [[Cinema of the United States]]). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root.  Conversely, in India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of [[Cinema of India|the nation's film industry]].

To the right, two men dance together.|Image from [[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film]] (1894 or 1895), produced by [[William Kennedy Dickson|W.K.L. Dickson]] as a test of the early version of the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope#Kinetophone|Kinetophone]], combining the [[Kinetoscope]] and [[phonograph]].]]
The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, a couple of days after photographic pioneer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of [[Thomas Edison]], the two inventors privately met. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting [[zoopraxiscope]] with Edison's recorded-sound technology.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the [[Kinetoscope]], essentially a "peep-show" system, as a visual complement to his [[phonograph cylinder|cylinder]] [[phonograph]]. The two devices were brought together as the [[kinetoscope#Kinetophone|Kinetophone]] in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001) claims that German inventor and filmmaker [[Oskar Messter]] began projecting sound motion pictures at 21 Unter den Linden in September 1896 (p. 168), but this seems to be an error. Koerber (1996) notes that after Messter acquired the Cinema Unter den Linden (located in the back room of a restaurant), it reopened under his management on September 21, 1896 (p. 53), but no source beside Robertson describes Messter as screening sound films before 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones.&lt;ref&gt;Altman (2005), p. 158; Cosandey (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition]] in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd and Robinson (1986), p. 91; Barnier (2002), pp. 25, 29; Robertson (2001), p. 168. Gratioulet went by his given name, Clément-Maurice, and is referred to thus in many sources, including Robertson and Barnier. Robertson incorrectly states that the Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre was a presentation of the Gaumont Co.; in fact, it was presented under the aegis of Paul Decauville (Barnier, ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major problems persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which were difficult to start and maintain in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;Sound engineer Mark Ulano, in [http://www.filmsound.org/ulano/talkies2.htm "The Movies Are Born a Child of the Phonograph"] (part 2 of his essay "Moving Pictures That Talk"), describes the Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre version of synchronized sound cinema:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This system used an operator adjusted non-linkage form of primitive synchronization. The scenes to be shown were first filmed, and then the performers recorded their dialogue or songs on the Lioretograph (usually a Le Éclat concert cylinder format phonograph) trying to match tempo with the projected filmed performance. In showing the films, synchronization of sorts was achieved by adjusting the hand cranked film projector's speed to match the phonograph. the projectionist was equipped with a telephone through which he listened to the phonograph which was located in the orchestra pit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed directly in front of the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Expo1900SoundFilm.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|alt=Illustration of a red-haired woman wearing a large hat, an ankle-length yellow dress, and high heels. She is holding a long baton or swagger stick and leaning against a film projector. A gramophone sits at her feet. The top of the illustration reads "Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre". Text to the left of the woman reads "Visions Animées des Artistes Celèbres", followed by a list of performers.|Poster featuring [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and giving the names of eighteen other "famous artists" shown in "living visions" at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exposition]] using the Gratioulet-Lioret system.]]
Cinematic innovators attempted to cope with the fundamental synchronization problem in a variety of ways. An increasing number of motion picture systems relied on [[gramophone records]]—known as [[sound-on-disc]] technology; the records themselves were often referred to as "Berliner discs", after one of the primary inventors in the field, German-American [[Emile Berliner]]. In 1902, [[Léon Gaumont]] demonstrated his sound-on-disc Chronophone, involving an electrical connection he had recently patented, to the [[Société française de photographie|French Photographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnier (2002), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Gaumont introduced the Elgéphone, a compressed-air amplification system based on the Auxetophone, developed by British inventors Horace Short and Charles Parsons.&lt;ref&gt;Altman (2005), p. 158. If there was a drawback to the Elgéphone, it was apparently not a lack of volume. Dan Gilmore describes its predecessor technology in his 2004 essay [http://www.angelfire.com/nc3/talkingmachines/auxetophone.html "What's Louder than Loud? The Auxetophone"]: "Was the Auxetophone loud? It was painfully loud." For a more detailed report of Auxetophone-induced discomfort, see [http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/auxetophone/auxetoph.htm The Auxetophone and Other Compressed-Air Gramophones].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite
high expectations, Gaumont's sound innovations had only limited commercial success—though improvements, they still did not satisfactorily address the three basic issues with sound film and were expensive as well. For some years, American inventor E. E. Norton's Cameraphone was the primary competitor to the Gaumont system (sources differ on whether the Cameraphone was disc- or cylinder-based); it ultimately failed for many of the same reasons that held back the Chronophone.&lt;ref name=Alt&gt;Altman (2005), pp. 158–65; Altman (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Edison introduced a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after little more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (1985), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided.&lt;ref name=Alt/&gt; Beginning in 1914, ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'', promoting [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.&lt;ref&gt;Lindvall (2007), pp. 118–25; Carey (1999), pp. 322–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, innovations continued on another significant front. In 1900, as part of the research he was conducting on the [[photophone]], the German physicist [[Ernst Ruhmer]] recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change to the selenium's resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He called this invention the [[photographophone]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1901), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; which he summarized as: "It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound."&lt;ref&gt;Ruhmer (1908), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhmer began a correspondence with the French-born, London-based [[Eugene Augustin Lauste|Eugene Lauste]],&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (1931), p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; who had worked at Edison's lab between 1886 and 1892. In 1907, Lauste was awarded the first patent for [[sound-on-film]] technology, involving the transformation of sound into light waves that are photographically recorded direct onto [[celluloid]]. As described by historian Scott Eyman,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was a double system, that is, the sound was on a different piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, where it would be photographed on the side of the film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.&lt;ref&gt;Eyman (1997), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1908, Lauste purchased a photographophone from Ruhmer, with the intention of perfecting the device into a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (1931), p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; Though sound-on-film would eventually become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, which came to an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process to an audience of scientists in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sipilä, Kari |url=http://www.finland.cn/Public/default.aspx?contentid=99637 |title=A Country That Innovates |publisher=Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland |date=April 2004 |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707031053/http://www.finland.cn/Public/default.aspx?contentid=99637 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df= }} {{cite web|author= |url=http://www.filmsoundsweden.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html |title=Eric Tigerstedt |publisher=Film Sound Sweden |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2009 }} See also A.

Pertti Kuusela, ''E.M.C Tigerstedt "Suomen Edison"'' (Insinööritieto Oy: 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian engineer [[Denes Mihaly]] submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Bognár (2000), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the [[major film studio#The majors before the Golden Age|major Hollywood film studios]] saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (1985), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crucial innovations ==
A number of technological developments contributed to making sound cinema commercially viable by the late 1920s. Two involved contrasting approaches to synchronized sound reproduction, or playback:

=== Advanced sound-on-film ===
In 1919, American inventor [[Lee De Forest]] was awarded several patents that would lead to the first [[optical sound]]-on-film technology with commercial application. In De Forest's system, the sound track was photographically recorded onto the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite, or "married", print. If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording, it could be absolutely counted on in playback. Over the next four years, he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field, [[Theodore Case]].&lt;ref&gt;Sponable (1947), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], Polish-born research engineer [[Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner]] was working independently on a similar process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture to members of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 51–52; Moone (2004); Łotysz (2006). Note that Crafton and Łotysz describe the demonstration as taking place at an AIEE conference. Moone, writing for the journal of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, says the audience was "members of the Urbana chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers."&lt;/ref&gt; As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.

Unbelievable".|Newspaper ad for a 1925 presentation of [[Phonofilm|De Forest Phonofilms]] shorts, touting their technological distinction: no phonograph.]]
On April 15, 1923, at New York City's Rivoli Theater, came the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film, the future standard: a set of shorts under the banner of [[Phonofilm|De Forest Phonofilms]], accompanying a silent feature.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (2005), p. 30; Eyman (1997), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hall, Brenda J.|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=66|title=Freeman Harrison Owens (1890–1979)|work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture|date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, De Forest's studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture—the two-reeler ''Love's Old Sweet Song'', directed by [[J. Searle Dawley]] and featuring [[Una Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;A few sources indicate that the film was released in 1923, but the two most recent authoritative histories that discuss the film—Crafton (1997), p. 66; Hijiya (1992), p. 103—both give 1924. There are claims that De Forest recorded a synchronized musical score for director [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Die Nibelungen: Siegfried|Siegfried]]'' (1924) when it arrived in the United States the year after its German debut—Geduld (1975), p. 100; Crafton (1997), pp. 66, 564—which would make it the first feature film with synchronized sound throughout. There is no consensus, however, concerning when this recording took place or if the film was ever actually presented with synch-sound. For a possible occasion for such a recording, see the August 24, 1925, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Siegfried&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=MORDAUNT%20HALL.&amp;pdate=19250824&amp;v_id= ''New York Times'' review of ''Siegfried''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405194333/http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Siegfried&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=MORDAUNT%20HALL.&amp;pdate=19250824&amp;v_id= |date=April 5, 2016 }}, following its American premiere at New York City's Century Theater the night before, which describes the score's performance by a live orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; However, phonofilm's stock in trade was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President [[Calvin Coolidge]], opera singer [[Abbie Mitchell]], and vaudeville stars such as [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]], [[Ben Bernie]], [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Oscar Levant]] appeared in the firm's pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As ''[[Photoplay]]'' editor [[James R. Quirk|James Quirk]] put it in March 1924, "Talking pictures are perfected, says Dr. Lee De Forest. ''So'' is castor oil."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; De Forest's process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;Low (1997a), p. 203; Low (1997b), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, others were also working on the development of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, [[Josef Engl]] (1893–1942), [[Hans Vogt (engineer)|Hans Vogt]] (1890–1979), and [[Joseph Massolle]] (1889–1957), patented the [[Tri-Ergon]] sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, ''Der Brandstifter'' (''The Arsonist'') —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1997), pp. 97–98; Crafton (1997), pp. 419–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic competition, however, eclipsed Phonofilm. By September 1925, De Forest and Case's working arrangement had fallen through. The following July, Case joined [[Fox Film]], Hollywood's third largest [[studio system|studio]], to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], thus became the first viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Sponable (1947), part 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=66 Freeman Harrison Owens (1890–1979)], op. cit. A number of sources erroneously state that Owens's and/or the Tri-Ergon patents were essential to the creation of the Fox-Case Movietone system.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced sound-on-disc ===
Parallel with improvements in sound-on-film technology, a number of companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical [[interlock]] to a specially modified [[movie projector|film projector]], allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the [[Photokinema]] sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s failed silent film ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]''. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, ''Dream Street'' was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 4; Gomery (2005), p. 29. Crafton (1997) misleadingly implies that Griffith's film had not previously been exhibited commercially before its sound-enhanced premiere. He also misidentifies Ralph Graves as Richard Grace (p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; There would be no others for more than six years.

Accompanying text provides film credits, dominated by the name of star John Barrymore.|Poster for [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' (1926), the first major motion picture to premiere with a full-length synchronized [[soundtrack]]. Audio recording engineer [[George Groves (sound engineer)|George Groves]], the first in Hollywood to hold the job, would supervise sound on ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', 44 years later.]]
In 1925, [[Sam Warner]] of [[Warner Bros.]], then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions, saw a demonstration of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's [[Vitagraph Studios]], which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.&lt;ref name="Crafton 1997, pp. 71–72"&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historical Development of Sound Films, E.I.Sponable, Journal of the SMPTE Vol. 48 April 1947&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Vitaphone]], as this system was now called, was publicly introduced on August 6, 1926, with the premiere of ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]''; the first feature-length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout, its [[soundtrack]] contained a musical [[film score|score]] and added [[sound effects]], but no recorded dialogue—in other words, it had been staged and shot as a silent film. Accompanying ''Don Juan'', however, were eight shorts of musical performances, mostly classical, as well as a four-minute filmed introduction by [[Will H. Hays]], president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], all with live-recorded sound. These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio.&lt;ref&gt;The eight musical shorts were ''Caro Nome'', ''An Evening on the Don'', ''La Fiesta'', ''His Pastimes'', ''The Kreutzer Sonata'', ''Mischa Elman'', ''Overture "Tannhäuser"'' and ''Vesti La Giubba''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros.' ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]'', technically similar to ''Don Juan'', followed in October.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 76–87; Gomery (2005), pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound-on-film would ultimately win out over sound-on-disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages:
* Synchronization: no interlock system was completely reliable, and a projectionist's error, or an inexactly repaired film break, or a defect in the soundtrack disc could result in the sound becoming seriously and irrecoverably out of sync with the picture
* Editing: discs could not be directly edited, severely limiting the ability to make alterations in their accompanying films after the original release cut
* Distribution: phonograph discs added expense and complication to film distribution
* Wear and tear: the physical process of playing the discs degraded them, requiring their replacement after approximately twenty screenings&lt;ref&gt;Liebman (2003), p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in the early years, sound-on-disc had the edge over sound-on-film in two substantial ways:
* Production and capital cost: it was generally less expensive to record sound onto disc than onto film and the exhibition systems—turntable/interlock/projector—were cheaper to manufacture than the complex image-and-audio-pattern-reading projectors required by sound-on-film
* Audio quality: phonograph discs, Vitaphone's in particular, had superior [[dynamic range]] to most sound-on-film processes of the day, at least during the first few playings; while sound-on-film tended to have better [[frequency response]], this was outweighed by greater [[distortion]] and [[signal noise|noise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schoenherr, Steven E.|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/dynamic.html|title=Dynamic Range|work=Recording Technology History|publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego|date=March 24, 2002|accessdate=December 11, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060905003034/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/dynamic.html |archivedate = September 5, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MPS&gt;{{cite web|author=Schoenherr, Steven E.|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html|title=Motion Picture Sound 1910–1929|work=Recording Technology History|publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego|date=October 6, 1999|accessdate=December 11, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070429191100/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html |archivedate = April 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sound-on-film technology improved, both of these disadvantages were overcome.

The third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback:
[[File:VitaphoneDemo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Two suited men stand in a studio with a large film projector and other electrical equipment. The man on the left is holding a large phonograph record.|[[Western Electric]] engineer E. B. Craft, at left, demonstrating the [[Vitaphone]] projection system. A Vitaphone disc had a running time of about 11 minutes, enough to match that of a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} reel of 35 mm film.]]

=== Fidelity electronic recording and amplification ===
In 1913, [[Western Electric]], the manufacturing division of AT&amp;T, acquired the rights to the [[Lee de Forest|de Forest]] [[audion]], the forerunner of the triode [[vacuum tube]]. Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.

The engineers working on the sound-on-disc system were able to draw on expertise that Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress. The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc so that it could match that of a standard {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} reel of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. The chosen design used a disc nearly 16 inches (about 40&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter rotating at 33&amp;nbsp;1/3 rpm. This could play for 11 minutes, the running time of 1000&amp;nbsp;ft of film at 90&amp;nbsp;ft/min (24 frames/s).&lt;ref&gt;History of Sound Motion Pictures by Edward W. Kellogg, Journal of the SMPTE Vol. 64 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70&amp;nbsp;ft/min (14 inches or 356&amp;nbsp;mm/s) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10-inch 78 rpm commercial disc.
In 1925, the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive [[Microphone#Condenser microphone|condenser microphones]] and rubber-line recorders (named after the use of a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc&lt;ref&gt;The Bell [http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm "Rubber Line" Recorder].&lt;/ref&gt;). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT&amp;T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of ''Don Juan'' and its accompanying shorts over the following months.&lt;ref name="Crafton 1997, pp. 71–72"/&gt; During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, [[Bell Labs]]—the new name for the AT&amp;T research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over [[loudspeaker]]s at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of ''Don Juan''.&lt;ref name=MPS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schoenherr, Steven E.|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/bell-labs.html|title=Sound Recording Research at Bell Labs|work=Recording Technology History|publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego|date=January 9, 2000|accessdate=December 7, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522014549/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/bell-labs.html |archivedate = May 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the year, AT&amp;T/Western Electric created a licensing division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle rights to the company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (2005), pp. 42, 50. See also [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html Motion Picture Sound 1910–1929] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513192557/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}, perhaps the best online source for details on these developments, though here it fails to note that Fox's original deal for the Western Electric technology involved a sublicensing arrangement.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.

== Triumph of the "talkies" ==
In February 1927, an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies:  [[Famous Players-Lasky]] (soon to be part of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[First National Pictures|First National]], and [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s small but prestigious [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then sat back and waited to see what sort of results the frontrunners came up with.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology. Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema, moving in different directions both technologically and commercially:  Fox moved into newsreels and then scored dramas, while Warners concentrated on talking features.  Meanwhile, ERPI sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JazzSingerAndFox.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=Advertisement from the Blue Mouse Theater announcing the Pacific Coast premiere of ''The Jazz Singer'', billed as "The greatest story ever told".

At the bottom is an announcement of an accompanying newsreel.|Newspaper ad from a fully equipped theater in Tacoma, Washington, showing ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', on Vitaphone, and a Fox newsreel, on [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], together on the same bill.]]
The big sound film sensations of the year all took advantage of preexisting celebrity. On May 20, 1927, at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theater]], [[Fox Movietone]] presented a sound film of the takeoff of [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s celebrated flight to Paris, recorded earlier that day. In June, a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York and Washington, D.C., was shown. These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (2005), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, as well, Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue: the short ''They're Coming to Get Me'', starring comedian [[Chic Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; After rereleasing a few silent feature hits, such as ''[[Seventh Heaven (1927 film)|Seventh Heaven]]'', with recorded music, Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23: ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'', by acclaimed German director [[F. W. Murnau]]. As with ''Don Juan'', the film's soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects (including, in a couple of crowd scenes, "wild", nonspecific vocals).&lt;ref&gt;Eyman (1997), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on October 6, 1927, Warner Bros.' ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' premiered. It was a smash box office success for the mid-level studio, earning a total of $2.625 million in the United States and abroad, almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warners film.&lt;ref&gt;Glancy (1995), p. 4 [online]. The previous highest-grossing Warner Bros. film was ''Don Juan'', which Glancy notes earned $1.693 million, foreign and domestic. Historian Douglas Crafton (1997) seeks to downplay the "total domestic gross income" of ''The Jazz Singer'', $1.97 million (p. 528), but that figure alone would have constituted a record for the studio. Crafton's claim that ''The Jazz Singer'' "was in a distinct second or third tier of attractions compared to the most popular films of the day and even other Vitaphone talkies" (p. 529) offers a skewed perspective. Although the movie was no match for the half-dozen biggest hits of the decade, the available evidence suggests that it was one of the three highest-earning films released in 1927 and that overall its performance was comparable to the other two, ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' and ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]''. It is undisputed that its total earnings were more than double those of the next four Vitaphone talkies; the first three of which, according to Glancy's analysis of in-house Warner Bros. figures, "earned just under $1,000,000 each", and the fourth, ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', a quarter-million more.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying, like ''Sunrise'' and ''Don Juan'', on a score and effects. When the movie's star, [[Al Jolson]], sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson's character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between him and his mother. The "natural" sounds of the settings were also audible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Allen, Bob|url=http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue23/23_jazz.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022042212/http://www.amps.net/newsletters/Issue23/23_jazz.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1999-10-22|title=Why ''The Jazz Singer''?|work=AMPS Newsletter|publisher=Association of Motion Picture Sound|date=Autumn 1997|accessdate=December 12, 2009}} Note that Allen, like many, exaggerates ''The Jazz Singer''{{'}}s commercial success; it was a big hit, but not "one of the big box office hits of all time".&lt;/ref&gt; Though the success of ''The Jazz Singer'' was due largely to Jolson, already established as one of U.S. biggest music stars, and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film (let alone the "first"), the movie's profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in.&lt;ref&gt;Geduld (1975), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before ''The Jazz Singer'', and the film's success did not change things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with [[United Artists]] and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a [[part-talkie|part-talking]] feature until the low-budget-oriented [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) premiered ''The Perfect Crime'' on June 17, 1928, eight months after ''The Jazz Singer''.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, [[General Electric]]'s [[RCA]] division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, [[RCA Photophone|Photophone]]. Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines.

By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, [[RKO Pictures]].

The film was released in December 1928, two months after Warner Bros. acquired a controlling interest in the studio.]]
Meanwhile, Warner Bros. had released three more talkies, all profitable, if not at the level of ''The Jazz Singer'': In March, ''[[Tenderloin (film)|Tenderloin]]'' appeared; it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts, though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue. ''Glorious Betsy'' followed in April, and ''The Lion and the Mouse'' (31 minutes of dialogue) in May.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1979), pp. 59, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 1928, the first all-talking feature, ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', premiered. The film cost Warner Bros. only $23,000 to produce, but grossed $1.252 million, a record rate of return surpassing 5,000%. In September, the studio released another Al Jolson part-talking picture, ''[[The Singing Fool]]'', which more than doubled ''The Jazz Singer'''s earnings record for a Warners movie.&lt;ref&gt;Glancy (1995), pp. 4–5. Schatz (1998) says the production cost of ''Lights of New York'' totaled $75,000 (p. 64). Even if this number is accurate, the rate of return was still over 1,600%.&lt;/ref&gt; This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical's ability to turn a song into a national hit: inside of nine months, the Jolson number "[[Sonny Boy (song)|Sonny Boy]]" had racked up 2 million record and 1.25 million sheet music sales.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; September 1928 also saw the release of [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]'s ''[[Dinner Time (cartoon)|Dinner Time]]'', among the first [[animated cartoon]]s produced with synchronized sound. Soon after he saw it, [[Walt Disney]] released his first sound picture, the [[Mickey Mouse]] [[short subject|short]] ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of 1928, as Warner Bros. began to rake in huge profits due to the [[List of early Warner Bros. talking features|popularity of its sound films]], the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology. Paramount, the industry leader, put out its first talkie in late September, ''Beggars of Life''; though it had just a few lines of dialogue, it demonstrated the studio's recognition of the new medium's power. ''Interference'', Paramount's first all-talker, debuted in November.&lt;ref&gt;Eames (1985), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The process known as "goat glanding" briefly became widespread: soundtracks, sometimes including a smatter of post-dubbed dialogue or song, were added to movies that had been shot, and in some cases released, as silents.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997) describes the term's derivation: "The skeptical press disparagingly referred to these [retrofitted films] as 'goat glands'&amp;nbsp;... from outrageous cures for impotency practiced in the 1920s, including restorative elixers, tonics, and surgical procedures. It implied that producers were trying to put some new life into their old films" (pp. 168–69).&lt;/ref&gt; A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a "musical." (Griffith's ''Dream Street'' had essentially been a "goat gland.") Expectations swiftly changed, and the sound "fad" of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929. In February 1929, sixteen months after ''The Jazz Singer'''s debut, [[Columbia Pictures]] became the last of the eight studios that would be known as "[[Major film studio#The majors during the Golden Age|majors]]" during Hollywood's Golden Age to release its first part-talking feature, ''Lone Wolf's Daughter''.&lt;ref&gt;The first official releases from RKO (which produced only all-talking pictures) appeared still later in the year, but after the October 1928 merger that created it, the company put out a number of talkies produced by its FBO constituent.&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, the first all-color, all-talking feature, Warner Bros.' ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show!]]'', premiered.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet most American movie theaters, especially outside of urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544.&lt;ref&gt;Block and Wilson (2010), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—until mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 169–71, 253–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. ''Points West'', a [[Hoot Gibson]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.&lt;ref&gt;In 1931, two Hollywood studios would release special projects without spoken dialogue (now customarily classified as "silents"): [[Charles Chaplin]]'s ''[[City Lights]]'' (United Artists) and [[F. W. Murnau]] and [[Robert Flaherty]]'s ''[[Tabu (1931 film)|Tabu]]'' (Paramount). The last totally silent feature produced in the United States for general distribution was ''The Poor Millionaire'', released by Biltmore Pictures in April 1930. Four other silent features, all low-budget Westerns, were also released in early 1930 (Robertson [2001], p. 173).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition: Europe ===

''The Jazz Singer'' had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;As Thomas J. Saunders (1994) reports, it premiered the same month in Berlin, but as a silent. "Not until June 1929 did Berlin experience the sensation of sound as New York had in 1927—a premiere boasting dialogue and song": ''The Singing Fool'' (p. 224). In Paris, ''The Jazz Singer'' had its sound premiere in January 1929 (Crisp [1997], p. 101).&lt;/ref&gt; According to film historian [[Rachael Low]], "Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;Low (1997a), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production ''Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame'' ([[I Kiss Your Hand, Madame]]). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by [[Richard Tauber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.filmportal.de/df/93/Artikel,,,,,,,,EF9714737BF39C19E03053D50B373807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.html|title=How the Pictures Learned to Talk: The Emergence of German Sound Film|work=Weimar Cinema|publisher=filmportal.de|date=|accessdate=December 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109101325/http://www.filmportal.de/df/93/Artikel%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2CEF9714737BF39C19E03053D50B373807%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C.html|archivedate=January 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (1980), pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Crisp (1997), pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1929, most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: ''The Crimson Circle'' was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent ''Der Rote Kreis'' in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: ''The Clue of the New Pin'', a [[British Lion Film Corporation|British Lion]] production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, ''Black Waters'', a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.&lt;ref&gt;Low (1997a), pp. 178, 203–5; Low (1997b), p. 183; Crafton (1997), pp. 432; {{cite web|author=|url=http://www.deutsches-filminstitut.de/f_films/film/f018529.htm|title=''Der Rote Kreis''|publisher=Deutsches Filminstitut|date=|accessdate=December 8, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624004618/http://www.deutsches-filminstitut.de/f_films/film/f018529.htm|archivedate=June 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}} Note also that [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020345/ IMDb.com] incorrectly refers to ''Der Rote Kreis/The Crimson Circle'' as a [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] (BIP) coproduction (it also spells Zelnik's first name "Frederic"). The authentic BIP production ''Kitty'' is sometimes included among the candidates for "first British talkie." In fact, the film was produced and premiered as a silent for its original 1928 release. The stars later came to New York to record dialogue, with which the film was rereleased in June 1929, after much better credentialed candidates. See sources cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounding text describes the film as "A Romance of Scotland Yard" and "The Powerful Talking Picture" |The Prague-raised star of ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929), [[Anny Ondra]], was an industry favorite, but her thick accent became an issue when the film was reshot with sound.

Ondra's British film career was over.&lt;ref&gt;Spoto (1984), pp. 131–32, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first successful European dramatic talkie was the all-British ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]''. Directed by twenty-nine-year-old [[Alfred Hitchcock]], the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, ''Blackmail'' was restaged to include dialogue sequences, along with a score and sound effects, before its premiere. A [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA Photophone, General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. ''Blackmail'' was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive—notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it "perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Spoto (1984), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie: ''G'schichten aus der Steiermark'' (''Stories from Styria''), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenleitner (1994), p. 253; Robertson (2001), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, ''Das Land ohne Frauen'' (''Land Without Women''), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich (2006), pp. 215–16; Crafton (1997), p. 595, n. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's first talkie, ''Konstgjorda Svensson'' (''Artificial Svensson''), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with ''Le Collier de la reine'' (''The Queen's Necklace''), shot at the [[Épinay-sur-Seine|Épinay]] studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, ''Les Trois masques'' debuted; a [[Pathé]]-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like ''Blackmail'', at the [[Elstree Studios|Elstree studio]], just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie ''La Route est belle'', also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1997), p. 103; {{cite web|author=|url=http://www.epinay-sur-seine.fr/epinay/rb010102.asp|title=Epinay ville du cinéma|work=|publisher=Epinay-sur-Seine.fr|date=|accessdate=December 8, 2009}} {{cite web|author=Erickson, Hal|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/164397/Le-Collier-De-La-Reine/overview|title=''Le Collier de la reine'' (1929)|work=Allmovie|publisher=NYTimes.com|date=|accessdate=December 8, 2009}} {{cite web|author=Chiffaut-Moliard, Philippe|url=http://www.cine-studies.net/r5a0_1930.html|title=Le cinéma français en 1930|work=Chronologie du cinéma français (1930–1939)|publisher=Cine-studies|year=2005|accessdate=December 8, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316092417/http://cine-studies.net/r5a0_1930.html|archivedate=March 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}} In his 2002 book ''Genre, Myth, and Convention in the French Cinema, 1929–1939'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), Crisp says that ''Le Collier de la reine'' was "'merely' sonorized, not dialogued" (p. 381), but all other available detailed descriptions (including his own from 1997) mention a dialogue sequence. Note also that Crisp gives October 31 as the debut date of ''Les Trois masques'' and ''Cine-studies'' gives its release ("sortie") date as November 2. Note finally, where Crisp defines in ''Genre, Myth, and Convention'' a "feature" as being a minimum of sixty minutes long, this article follows the equally common, and Wikipedia-prevalent, standard of forty minutes or longer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Paris studios were fully sound-equipped—a process that stretched well into 1930—a number of other early French talkies were shot in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1997), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The first all-talking German feature, ''Atlantik'', had premiered in Berlin on October 28. Yet another Elstree-made movie, it was rather less German at heart than ''Les Trois masques'' and ''La Route est belle'' were French; a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director, it was also shot in English as ''Atlantic''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), p. 82; {{cite web|author=Fisher, David|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1929.htm|title=Chronomedia: 1929|work=Chronomedia|publisher=Terra Media|date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entirely German [[Aafa-Film]] production ''[[It's You I Have Loved]]'' (''Dich hab ich geliebt'') opened three-and-a-half weeks later.

In 1930, the first Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: ''Moralność pani Dulskiej'' (''The Morality of Mrs. Dulska'') in March and the all-talking ''Niebezpieczny romans'' (''Dangerous Love Affair'') in October.&lt;ref&gt;Haltof (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, whose once vibrant film industry had become moribund by the late 1920s, the first talkie, ''La Canzone dell'amore'' (''The Song of Love''), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival.&lt;ref&gt;See Nichols and Bazzoni (1995), p. 98, for a description of ''La Canzone dell'amore'' and its premiere.&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, ''Tonka Šibenice'' (''Tonka of the Gallows'').&lt;ref&gt;Stojanova (2006), p. 97. According to [[Il Cinema Ritrovato]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061013044431/http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/programmi/05cinema/archivio/fcr1992.pdf program for XXI Mostra Internazionale del Cinema Libero] (Bologna; November 22–29, 1992), the film was shot in Paris. According to the [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021484/ IMDb entry on the film], it was a Czech-German coproduction. The two claims are not necessarily contradictory. According to the [http://www.csfd.cz/film/209-tonka-sibenice/ Czech-Slovak Film Database], it was shot as a silent film in Germany; soundtracks for Czech, German, and French versions were then recorded at the Gaumont studio in the Paris suburb of [[Joinville-le-Pont|Joinville]].&lt;/ref&gt; Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;See Robertson (2001), pp. 10–14. Robertson claims Switzerland produced its first talkie in 1930, but it has not been possible to independently confirm this. The first talkies from Finland, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, and Turkey appeared in 1931, the first talkies from Ireland (English-language) and Spain and the first in Slovak in 1932, the first Dutch talkie in 1933, and the first Bulgarian talkie in 1934. In the Americas, the first Canadian talkie came out in 1929—''North of '49'' was a remake of the previous year's silent ''His Destiny''. The first Brazilian talkie, ''Acabaram-se os otários'' (''The End of the Simpletons''), also appeared in 1929. That year, as well, the first Yiddish talkies were produced in New York: ''East Side Sadie'' (originally a silent), followed by ''Ad Mosay'' (''The Eternal Prayer'') (Crafton [1997], p. 414). Sources differ on whether ''Más fuerte que el deber'', the first Mexican (and Spanish-language) talkie, came out in 1930 or 1931. The first Argentine talkie appeared in 1931 and the first Chilean talkie in 1934. Robertson asserts that the first Cuban feature talkie was a 1930 production called ''El Caballero de Max''; every other published source surveyed cites ''La Serpiente roja'' (1937). Nineteen-thirty-one saw the first talkie produced on the African continent: South Africa's ''Mocdetjie'', in Afrikaans. Egypt's Arabic ''Onchoudet el Fouad'' (1932) and Morocco's French-language ''Itto'' (1934) followed.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union's robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: [[Dziga Vertov]]'s nonfiction ''Entuziazm'' had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; [[Abram Room]]'s documentary ''Plan velikikh rabot'' (''The Plan of the Great Works'') had music and spoken voiceovers.&lt;ref&gt;Rollberg (2008), pp. xxvii, 9, 174, 585, 669–70, 679, 733. Several sources name ''Zemlya zhazhdet'' (''The Earth Is Thirsty''), directed by Yuli Raizman, as the first Soviet sound feature. Originally produced and premiered as a silent in 1930, it was rereleased with a non-talking, music-and-effects soundtrack the following year (Rollberg [2008], p. 562).&lt;/ref&gt; Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Morton (2006), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1931, the [[Nikolai Ekk]] drama ''[[Road to Life (1931 film)|Putevka v zhizn]]'' (''The Road to Life'' or ''A Start in Life''), premiered as the Soviet Union's first true talking picture.&lt;ref&gt;Rollberg (2008), pp. xxvii, 210–11, 450, 665–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout much of Europe, conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity, requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places. While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain—with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930, similar to the U.S. figure—in France, by contrast, more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1997), p. 101; Crafton (1997), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Colin G. Crisp, "Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the [French] industrial press, and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935."&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1997), pp. 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union; as of May 1933, fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound.&lt;ref&gt;Kenez (2001), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan was one of the world's two largest producers of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, ''Reimai'' (''Dawn''), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system.&lt;ref&gt;Burch (1979), pp. 145–46. Note that Burch misdates ''Madamu to nyobo'' as 1932 (p. 146; see above for sources for correct 1931 date). He also incorrectly claims that [[Mikio Naruse]] made no sound films before 1936 (p. 146; see below for Naruse's 1935 sound films).&lt;/ref&gt; Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading [[Nikkatsu]] studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: ''Taii no musume'' (''The Captain's Daughter'') and ''Furusato'' (''Hometown''), the latter directed by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]. The rival [[Shochiku]] studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Richie (1982), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents.&lt;ref name=F87&gt;Freiberg (1987), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the country's leading directors, [[Mikio Naruse]] and [[Yasujirō Ozu]], did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Naruse's first talking picture, ''Otome-gokoro sannin shimai'' (''Three Sisters with Maiden Hearts''), as well as his widely acclaimed ''Tsuma yo bara no yo ni'' (''Wife!

The enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the ''[[benshi]]'', a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening. As director [[Akira Kurosawa]] later described, the benshi "not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen.... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Freiberg (1987), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite web|author=Sharp, Jasper|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/silentfilm_pt1.shtml|title=''A Page of Madness'' (1927)|publisher=Midnight Eye|date=March 7, 2002|accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the same token, the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound—allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.&lt;ref&gt;See Freiberg (2000), "The Film Industry."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandarin-language ''Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān'' ({{linktext|歌|女|紅|牡|丹}}, ''Singsong Girl Red Peony''), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China's first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of ''The Devil's Playground'', arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner ''Fellers'' is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie.&lt;ref&gt;Reade (1981), pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star [[Ruby Myers|Sulochana]], excerpted from the silent feature ''Madhuri'' (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country's first.&lt;ref&gt;Ranade (2006), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Ardeshir Irani]] directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu ''[[Alam Ara]]'', and produced ''[[Kalidas (1931 Film)|Kalidas]]'', primarily in Tamil with some Telugu.

The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, ''Dukhtar-e-loor''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), p. 328; Rajadhyaksha and Willemen (2002), p. 255; Chatterji (1999), "The First Sound Films"; Bhuyan (2006), "''Alam Ara'': Platinum Jubilee of Sound in Indian Cinema." In March 1934 came the release of the first Kannada talking picture, ''Sathi Sulochana'' (Guy [2004]); ''Bhakta Dhruva'' (aka ''Dhruva Kumar'') was released soon after, though it was actually completed first (Rajadhyaksha and Willemen [2002], pp. 258, 260). A few websites refer to the 1932 version of ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' as the first Punjabi talkie; the most reliable sources all agree, however, that it is performed in Hindustani. The first Punjabi-language film is ''Pind di Kuri'' (aka ''Sheila''; 1935). The first Assamese-language film, ''Joymati'', also came out in 1935. Many websites echo each other in dating the first Oriya talkie, ''Sita Bibaha'', as 1934, but the most authoritative source to definitively date it—Chapman (2003)—gives 1936 (p. 328).

Her head is surrounded by shooting stars and sparkles. At her feet, much smaller-scaled, are two men—one is shouting through a megaphone, the other is operating a movie camera. The accompanying text is dominated by the name of star [[Alice White]].|''Show Girl in Hollywood'' (1930), one of the first sound films about sound filmmaking, depicts microphones dangling from the rafters and multiple cameras shooting simultaneously from soundproofed booths. The poster shows a camera unboothed and unblimped, as it might be when shooting a musical number with a prerecorded soundtrack.]]
In the short term, the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. ''Show Girl in Hollywood'' (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as "blimps", designed to suppress noise and [[Boom operator (media)|boom microphones]] that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass "woofer", a midrange driver, and a treble "tweeter."&lt;ref&gt;Millard (2005), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were consequences, as well, for other technological aspects of the cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often [[Time-lapse|undercranked]] or [[Slow motion|overcranked]] to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established.&lt;ref name=Allen15&gt;{{cite web|author=Allen, Bob|url=http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue15/15_lets_.htm|title=Let's Hear It For Sound|work=AMPS Newsletter|publisher=Association of Motion Picture Sound|date=Autumn 1995|accessdate=December 13, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000108115255/http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue15/15_lets_.htm|archivedate=January 8, 2000|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet [[Incandescence|incandescent]] illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new [[panchromatic film]] delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.&lt;ref name=Allen15/&gt;

As [[David Bordwell]] describes, technological improvements continued at a swift pace: "Between 1932 and 1935, [Western Electric and RCA] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise&amp;nbsp;... and extended the volume range." These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: "Increasing the fidelity of recording&amp;nbsp;... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness."&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell (1985), pp. 300–1, 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''—was that some silent-era actors simply did not have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, a process known as "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell and Thompson (1995), p. 124; Bordwell (1985), pp. 301, 302. Note that Bordwell's assertion in the earlier text, "Until the late 1930s, the post-dubbing of voices gave poor fidelity, so most dialogue was recorded direct" (p. 302), refers to a 1932 source. His later (coauthored) description, which refers to the viability of looping in 1935, appears to replace the earlier one, as it should: in fact, then and now, most movie dialogue is recorded direct.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the frames runs a continuous vertical white band of continuously fluctuating width.|Example of a variable-area sound track—the width of the white area is proportional to the [[Sound#Perception of sound|amplitude]] of the audio signal at each instant.]]
With Hollywood's wholesale adoption of the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930–31, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone's dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA Photophone and Western Electric's own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernds (1999), part 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under RCA's instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other.&lt;ref&gt;See Crafton (1997), pp. 142–45.&lt;/ref&gt; This left one big issue—the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment. As a contemporary report describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tobis-Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for: Germany, Danzig, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, the Dutch Indies, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Finland. The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Russia. All other countries, among them Italy, France, and England, are open to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;"Outcome of Paris" (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes, and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s. During these years, as well, the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone's variable-area approach—by the end of 1936, only Paramount, MGM, and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry, it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time. Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios; as suggested above, those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk. The career of major silent star [[Norma Talmadge]] effectively came to an end in this way. The celebrated German actor [[Emil Jannings]] returned to Europe. Moviegoers found [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]'s voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona, and his star also faded.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 480, 498, 501–9; Thomson (1998), pp. 732–33, 285–87; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 34, 22, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent-era stars as old-fashioned, even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era. The career of [[Harold Lloyd]], one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s, declined precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 480; Wlaschin (1979), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lillian Gish]] departed, back to the stage, and other leading figures soon left acting entirely: [[Colleen Moore]], [[Gloria Swanson]], and Hollywood's most famous performing couple, [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 288–89, 526–27, 728–29, 229, 585–86: Wlaschin (1979), pp. 20–21, 28–29, 33–34, 18–19, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As actress [[Louise Brooks]] suggested, there were other issues as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Studio heads, now forced into unprecedented decisions, decided to begin with the actors, the least palatable, the most vulnerable part of movie production. It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars.... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [Paramount studio chief B. P.] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I'd be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Buster Keaton]] was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton's early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal.&lt;ref&gt;See Dardis (1980), pp. 190–91, for an analysis of the profitability of Keaton's early sound films.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the new medium's biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater, where performers such as Jolson, [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 376–77, 463–64, 487–89; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 57, 103, 118, 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Cagney]] and [[Joan Blondell]], who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 69, 103–5, 487–89; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 50–51, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: [[John Barrymore]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Myrna Loy]], [[William Powell]], [[Norma Shearer]], the comedy team of [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and the incomparable [[Charlie Chaplin]], whose ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 45–46, 90, 167, 689–90, 425–26, 122–24; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 45–46, 54, 67, 148, 113, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Gaynor]] became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless ''Seventh Heaven'' and ''Sunrise'', as did [[Joan Crawford]] with the technologically similar ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 281, 154–56; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 87, 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greta Garbo]] was the one non–native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom on both sides of the great sound divide.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1998), pp. 274–76; Wlaschin (1979), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Silent film [[Extra (acting)|extra]] [[Clark Gable]], who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades. The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were [[Nathanael West]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Dorothy Parker]].&lt;ref name="friedrich1997"&gt;{{cite book | title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in 1940s | publisher=University of California Press | author=Friedrich, Otto | year=1997|edition=reprint | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles | pages=9 | isbn=0520209494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFM had its first encounter with wholesale unemployment brought about by technology. Within three years, 22,000 theater jobs for musicians who accompanied silent movies were lost, while only a few hundred jobs for musicians performing on soundtracks were created by the new technology. 1928 – While continuing to protest the loss of jobs due to the use of 'canned music' with motion pictures, the AFM set minimum wage scales for Vitaphone, Movietone and phonograph record work. Because synchronizing music with pictures for the movies was particularly difficult, the AFM was able to set high prices for this work."&lt;/ref&gt; More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard, "During the 1920s live musical performances at first-run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talkies, those featured performances—usually staged as preludes—were largely eliminated as well. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever" and reads in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Canned Music on Trial'''&lt;br /&gt;
This is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanization. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/pg.1/|title=Canned Music on Trial|work=Ad*Access|publisher=Duke University Libraries|date=|accessdate=December 9, 2009}} The text of the ad continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Is Music Worth Saving?'''&lt;br /&gt; No great volume of evidence is required to answer this question. Music is a well-nigh universally beloved art. From the beginning of history, men have turned to musical expression to lighten the burdens of life, to make them happier. Aborigines, lowest in the scale of savagery, chant their song to tribal gods and play upon pipes and shark-skin drums. Musical development has kept pace with good taste and ethics throughout the ages, and has influenced the gentler nature of man more powerfully perhaps than any other factor. '''Has it remained for the Great Age of Science to snub the Art by setting up in its place a pale and feeble shadow of itself?'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the following year, a reported 22,000 U.S. moviehouse musicians had lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Oderman (2000), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other fourteen hold up the individual letters that spell out "Broadway Melody". Accompanying text reads, "All Talking, All Dancing, All Singing! Dramatic Sensation."|Premiering February 1, 1929, [[MGM]]'s ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' was the first smash-hit talkie from a studio other than Warner Bros. and the first sound film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].]]
In September 1926, [[Jack L. Warner]], head of Warner Bros., was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable: "They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself."&lt;ref&gt;"Talking Movies" (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; Much to his company's benefit, he would be proven very wrong—between the 1927–28 and 1928–29 fiscal years, Warners' profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount's profits rose by $7 million, Fox's by $3.5 million, and Loew's/MGM's by $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery (1985), pp. 66–67. Gomery describes the difference in profits simply between 1928 and 1929, but it seems clear from the figures cited that he is referring to the fiscal years that ended September 30. The fiscal year roughly paralleled (but was still almost a month off from) the traditional Hollywood programming year—the prime exhibition season began the first week of September with Labor Day and ran through Memorial Day at the end of May; this was followed by a fourteen-week "open season", when films with minimal expectations were released and many theaters shut down for the hot summer months. See Crafton (1997), pp. 183, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; RKO, which did not even exist in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America's leading entertainment businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as the [[Wall Street crash of 1929|Wall Street crash]] of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into [[Great Depression|depression]], the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929–30 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood's position as one of the most important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry—already the world's most powerful—set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film, was 27 percent higher than the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Segrave (1997) gives the figures as 282 million feet in 1929 compared to 222 million feet the year before (p. 79). Crafton (1997) reports the new mark in this peculiar way: "Exports in 1929 set a new record: 282,215,480 feet (against the old record of {{convert|9000000|ft|m}} in 1919)" (p. 418). But in 1913, for instance, the U.S. exported 32 million feet of exposed film (Segrave [1997], p. 65). Note also that Crafton says of the 1929 exports, "Of course, most of this footage was silent", though he provides no figures (p. 418). In contrast, if not necessarily contradiction, Segrave points to the following: "At the very end of 1929 the ''New York Times'' reported that most U.S. talkies went abroad as originally created for domestic screening" (p. 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as "[[Foreign Language Version]]"), as well as the production of the cheaper "[[International Sound Version]]", a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and [[subtitling]]. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Eckes and Zeiler (2003), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Brazilian talkie was also the first anywhere in an [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian language]].]]
Just as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors, they did the same at home. As historian Richard B. Jewell describes, "The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion."&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale [[shakeout]] in the business, resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies (MGM, Paramount, Fox, Warners, RKO) and the three smaller studios also called "majors" (Columbia, Universal, United Artists) that would predominate through the 1950s. Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus. Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the [[studio system]] finally coalesce, with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was [[India]]. As one distributor of the period said, "With the coming of the talkies, the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation. This was achieved by music."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ganti (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; From its earliest days, Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical—''[[Alam Ara]]'' featured seven songs; a year later, ''[[Indrasabha]]'' would feature seventy. While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood, ten years after the debut of ''Alam Ara'', over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ganti (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of India's early talkies were shot in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], which remains the leading production center, but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation. Within just a few weeks of ''Alam Ara'''s March 1931 premiere, the [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi ''Shirin Farhad'' and the Bengali ''Jamai Sasthi''.&lt;ref&gt;Rajadhyaksha and Willemen (2002), p. 254; Joshi (2003), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindustani ''Heer Ranjha'' was produced in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], the following year. In 1934, ''[[Sati Sulochana]]'', the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in [[Kolhapur]], [[Maharashtra]]; ''Srinivasa Kalyanam'' became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=Tamil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Rajadhyaksha and Willemen (2002), pp. 30, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), pp. 16–17; {{cite web|author=|url=http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/analysis-of-the-uis-international-survey-on-feature-film-statistics-en_0.pdf|title=Analysis of the ''UIS International Survey on Feature Film Statistics''|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aesthetic quality ===
In the first, 1930 edition of his global survey ''The Film Till Now'', British cinema pundit [[Paul Rotha]] declared, "A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Agate (1972), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that "the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema" and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside "photographs of people talking".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chapman (2003), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, [[Max Reinhardt]], stage producer and movie director, expressed the belief that the talkies, "bringing to the screen stage plays&amp;nbsp;... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself&amp;nbsp;... like reproductions of paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Crafton (1997), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of many film historians and aficionados, both at the time and subsequently, silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Crafton (1997), pp. 448–49; Brownlow (1968), p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed, silent cinema is represented by eleven films in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'''s Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll, held in 1995. The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film—not only in the United States, but also in the West as a whole—was 1929; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures (''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' [1929], ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Zemlya]]'' [1930], ''[[City Lights]]'' [1931]) and zero talkies in the ''Time Out'' poll. (''City Lights'', like ''Sunrise'', was released with a recorded score and sound effects, but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a "silent"—spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema.) The earliest sound film to place is the French ''[[L'Atalante]]'' (1934), directed by [[Jean Vigo]]; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), directed by [[Howard Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Time Out Film Guide'' (2000), pp. x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound feature film to receive near-universal critical approbation was ''[[Der Blaue Engel]]'' (''The Blue Angel''); premiering on April 1, 1930, it was directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] in both German and English versions for Berlin's [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (1987), pp. 1045–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The first American talkie to be widely honored was ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], which premiered April 21. The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was ''[[Westfront 1918]]'', directed by [[G. W. Pabst]] for [[Nero-Film]] of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arnold, Jeremy|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=93569&amp;mainArticleId=176230|title=''Westfront 1918''|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|date=|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of "the new verisimilitude [that] rendered silent cinema's former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow, as well as its preference for allegorical characters, anachronistic."&lt;ref name=Kaes&gt;Kaes (2009), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural historians consider the French ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'', directed by [[Luis Buñuel]], which appeared late in 1930, to be of great aesthetic import; at the time, its erotic, blasphemous, anti-bourgeois content caused a scandal. Swiftly banned by Paris police chief [[Jean Chiappe]], it was unavailable for fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen (1987), pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero-Film's ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]], which premiered May 11, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''M'', for instance, is the earliest sound film to appear in the 2001 [http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html ''Village Voice'': 100 Best Films of the 20th Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331174817/http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html |date=March 31, 2014 }} poll and the 2002 ''Sight and Sound Top Ten'' (among the 60 films receiving five or more votes). See also, e.g., Ebert (2002), pp. 274–78.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by [[Roger Ebert]], "Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time, but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives, providing a rat's-eye view."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert (2002), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinematic form ===
"Talking film is as little needed as a singing book."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kenez (2001), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the blunt proclamation of critic [[Viktor Shklovsky]], one of the leaders of the [[Russian formalism|Russian formalist]] movement, in 1927. While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity. The following year, a group of Soviet filmmakers, including [[Sergei Eisenstein]], proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition, the so-called contrapuntal method, would raise the cinema to "...unprecedented power and cultural height. Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a national market, as must happen with the photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein (1928), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, "Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2004), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

"It flung the whole earth onto the screen in a jigsaw of visual images and sounds."&lt;ref&gt;Bazin (1967), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On March 12, 1929, the first feature-length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere. The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, it was not a drama, but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line: ''Melodie der Welt'' (''Melody of the World''), directed by [[Walter Ruttmann]].&lt;ref&gt;There is disagreement on the running time of the film. The Deutsches Filminstitut's [http://www.deutsches-filminstitut.de/caligari/dt2fcf0429.htm webpage on the film]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045904/http://www.deutsches-filminstitut.de/caligari/dt2fcf0429.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }} gives 48 minutes; the ''35 Millimeter'' website's [http://www.35millimeter.de/filmgeschichte/deutschland/1920/filme/melodie-der-welt.355.htm entry] gives 40 minutes. According to [http://www.filmportal.de/df/93/Artikel,,,,,,,,EF9714737BF39C19E03053D50B373807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.html filmportal.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109101325/http://www.filmportal.de/df/93/Artikel%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2CEF9714737BF39C19E03053D50B373807%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C.html |date=January 9, 2010 }}, it is "some 40 minutes".&lt;/ref&gt; This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is "intricate, dynamic, fast-paced&amp;nbsp;... juxtapos[ing] similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score&amp;nbsp;... and many synchronized sound effects."&lt;ref&gt;Moritz (2003), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Lou Lichtveld]] was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: "''Melodie der Welt'' became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dibbets (1999), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Melodie der Welt'' was a direct influence on the [[sponsored film|industrial film]] ''Philips Radio'' (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker [[Joris Ivens]] and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To render the half-musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature. In this film every intermediate stage can be found: such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music, the noises of the machine dominating the musical background, the music itself is the documentary, and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dibbets (1999), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 ''Entuziazm'' and by Chaplin in ''Modern Times'', a half-decade later.

A few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In ''Blackmail'', Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word "knife" would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;See Spoto (1984), pp. 132–33; Truffaut (1984), pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first film, the Paramount ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'' (1929), [[Rouben Mamoulian]] created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'"&lt;ref&gt;Milne (1980), p. 659. See also Crafton (1997), pp. 334–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.

One of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was ''[[Le Million]]'', directed by [[René Clair]] and produced by Tobis's French division. Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later, the picture was both a critical and popular success. A musical comedy with a barebones plot, it is memorable for its formal accomplishments, in particular, its emphatically artificial treatment of sound. As described by scholar Donald Crafton,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le Million'' never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets. [It] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets. Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off-screen sound. He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks, as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football (or rugby) crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and "color", not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive, non-[[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by ''Melodie der Welt'' and ''Le Million'' would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of [[genre]]-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling. As accurately predicted in 1928 by [[Frank E. Woods|Frank Woods]], secretary of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], "The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama.... The talking scenes will require different handling, but the general construction of the story will be much the same."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bordwell (1985), p. 298. See also Bordwell and Thompson (1995), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[writing]], a '''space''' ('''&amp;#32;''') is a blank area that [[word divider|separates words]], [[Sentence spacing|sentences]], [[syllable]]s (in [[syllabification]]) and other written or printed [[glyph]]s (characters). Conventions for spacing vary among languages, and in some languages the spacing rules are complex.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Typesetting]] uses spaces of varying length for specific purposes. The [[typewriter]], on the other hand, can accommodate only a limited number of keys. Most typewriters have only one width of space, obtained by pressing the [[space bar]]. Following widespread acceptance of the typewriter, some spacing and other typewriter conventions, which were based on the typewriter's mechanical limitations, have influenced professional [[typography]] other designers of printed works.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Computer]] representation of text eliminates all mechanical and physical limitations in any sufficiently advanced [[character encoding]] environment (such as [[Unicode]]), where spaces of various widths, styles, or language characteristics (different ''space characters'') are indicated with unique [[code point]]s. [[Whitespace character]]s include spaces of various width, including all those that professional typesetters employ.

==Use in natural languages==

===Between words===
{{Main article|Word divider}}

Modern English uses a space to separate words, but not all languages follow this practice. Spaces were not used to separate words in [[Latin]] until roughly 600–800 CE. [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], while they didn't use spacing, used word-dividers partly to compensate in clarity for the [[Abjad|lack of vowels]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w3vZaFoaa3EC&amp;pg=PA10 Saenger 2000, p. 10]: [...] the Semitic languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Syriac), when written without vowels, were virtually always written with word separation in antiquity and continued to be so transcribed into modern times, [...]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek script also used interpuncts to divide words, rather than spacing, although this practice was soon displaced by the ''scriptura continua''. The earliest signs of spacing between words appears in the Latin alphabet, where it was used extremely rarely in some manuscripts and then altogether forgotten. However, spacing was then reinvented into language through Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, and then with the creation of the [[Carolingian minuscule]] by [[Alcuin of York]], where it originated and then spread to the rest of world, including modern Arabic and Hebrew. Indeed, the actions of these Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes marked the dramatic shift for reading between antiquity and the modern period. Spacing would become standard in [[Renaissance]] Italy and France, and then Byzantium by the end of the 16th century; then entering into the Slavic languages in [[Cyrillic]] in the 17th century, and only in modern times entering modern [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul. Space between words: The origins of silent reading. Stanford University Press, 1997, 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, all [[CJK]] languages have no spaces: modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (except when written with little or no [[kanji]]) do not; on the other hand, modern [[Korean language|Korean]] uses spaces.

[[Runic]] texts use either an [[interpunct]]-like or a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]]-like punctuation mark to separate words. There are two [[Unicode]] characters dedicated for this: {{unichar|16EB|Runic single punctuation}} and {{unichar|16EC|Runic multiple punctuation}}.

===Between sentences===

{{Main article|Sentence spacing}}

Languages with a Latin-derived alphabet have used various methods of sentence spacing since the advent of movable type in the 15th century.

* One space (some times called ''[[French spacing]]'', ''q.v.''). This is a common convention in most countries that use the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] for published and final written work, as well as digital (World Wide Web) media.&lt;ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, which was a dark and inflationary age in typography and type design, many compositors were encouraged to stuff extra space between sentences.

Your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint Victorian habit.

 | quote= The view at CMOS is that there is no reason for two spaces after a period in published work. Some people, however—my colleagues included—prefer it, relegating this preference to their personal correspondence and notes. I’ve noticed in old American books printed in the few decades before and after the turn of the twentieth century (ca. 1870–1930 at least) that there seemed to be a trend in publishing to use extra space (sometimes quite a bit of it) after periods. And many people were taught to use that extra space in typing class (I was). But introducing two spaces after the period causes problems: (1) it is inefficient, requiring an extra keystroke for every sentence; (2) even if a program is set to automatically put an extra space after a period, such automation is never foolproof; (3) there is no proof that an extra space actually improves readability—as your comment suggests, it’s probably just a matter of familiarity (Who knows? perhaps it’s actually more efficient to read with less regard for sentences as individual units of thought—many centuries ago, for example in ancient Greece, there were no spaces even between words, and no punctuation); (4) two spaces are harder to control for than one in electronic documents (I find that the earmark of a document that imposes a two-space rule is a smattering of instances of both three spaces and one space after a period, and two spaces in the middle of sentences); and (5) two spaces can cause problems with line breaks in certain programs. So, in our efficient, modern world, I think there is no room for two spaces after a period. In the opinion of this particular copyeditor, this is a good thing.

'''''Telos''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] established in May 1968 to provide the [[New Left]] with a coherent theoretical perspective. It sought to expand the [[Husserl]]ian diagnosis of "the crisis of European sciences" to prefigure a particular program of social reconstruction relevant for the United States. In order to avoid the high level of abstraction typical of Husserlian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the journal began introducing the ideas of [[Western Marxism]] and of the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Genosko, "The Arrival of Jean Baudrillard in English Translation: Mark Poster and Telos Press (Part I)," ''International Journal of Baudrillard Studies'', vol. 1, no. 2 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Luke, "The Trek with ''Telos'': A Remembrance of Paul Piccone (January 19, 1940—July 12, 2004)", ''Fast Capitalism'', vol. 1, no. 2 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Anderson, [http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/2007/11/telos-critical-theory-journal-and-its.html "''Telos'', the critical theory journal and its blog,"] November 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the disintegration of the New Left and the gradual integration of what remained of the [[American Left]] within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], ''Telos'' became increasingly critical of the Left in general. It subsequently undertook a reevaluation of 20th century [[intellectual history]], focusing primarily on forgotten and repressed authors and ideas, beginning with [[Carl Schmitt]] and American [[populism]]. Eventually the journal rejected the traditional divisions between [[left–right politics|Left and Right]] as a legitimating mechanism for [[new class]] domination and an occlusion of new, [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]] political conflicts. This led to a reevaluation of the primacy of culture and to efforts to understand the dynamics of cultural disintegration and reintegration as a precondition for the constitution of that [[autonomy|autonomous individuality]] critical theory had always identified as the [[telos (philosophy)|telos]] of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/node/3049 Danny Postel, "The metamorphosis of ''Telos''," ''In These Times'', April 21-30, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell Jacoby, ''The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe'' (New York: Basic Books, 1987): 151-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer M. Lehmann, ''Social Theory as Politics in Knowledge'' (New York: Emerald Group Publishing, 2005): 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Compound''''' is a 2008 fictional young adult novel by [[S. A. Bodeen]]. The book was first released on April 29, 2008 through  [[Feiwel &amp; Friends]] and centers upon a young man named Eli who has been living in a [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] for six years. Bodeen came up with the idea of including [[cannibalism]] in the novel after watching a television show where "a dinosaur fed a favorite offspring the bodies of its less fortunate brothers and sisters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavao|first=Kate|title=Spring 2008 Flying Starts: Stephanie Bodeen|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/53311-spring-2008-flying-starts-stephanie-bodeen.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Eli is a teenage boy who has been living in an underground compound for the past 6 years, since he was 9. His father, the exceedingly wealthy Rex Yanakakis, built it in anticipation of a world shattering [[nuclear attack]]. The facility is fully furnished and contains everything from a movie theater to an extensive library. It even has the capability to raise livestock, enabling the Yanakakis family to maintain a stable food supply for at least fifteen years, the time it would take for conditions outside the compound to return to habitable levels. Yet Eli is desperately unhappy, as his twin brother Eddy and his grandmother aren't there with him, as they were left outside the compound when his family fled.

As time passes in the compound, Eli's mother, Clea gives birth to three children and is ready to give birth to another. The children are kept in a separate room and Eli avoids ever meeting them, knowing that his father plans on using them as "supplements" for the family's diet. Despite this, he's still horrified when he discovers that his father plans on cloning a human being in order to provide meat for the family. Eli eventually gives in to his mother and meets the supplements. He grows to care for them, even trying to persuade one of his other siblings to help save the supplements from their seemingly inevitable death.

Eli eventually stumbles outside his father's office and discovers an active internet connection. Through this he discovers that his brother Eddy is not only still alive, but that there was no nuclear attack and that everyone believed the Yanakakises died in a fire. Eddy also informs Eli that insanity runs in their family and that their father will likely harm them all. Angry, Eli confronts his father, who admits that he created the entire scenario as an experiment to test how far everyone would go to survive and to what lengths. Eli manages to knock his father unconscious and brings him to the infirmary, where Eli's mother is beginning to [[Antepartum haemorrhage|bleed profusely]] from her pregnancy. Knowing that he must get them out before his father wakes, Eli tries to use a series of clues to discover the combination to the compound's door. He fails to discover and memorize the code before his father reawakens and his father ends up threatening to kill one of his siblings if Eli doesn't hand over the code. Eli does, but manages to figure out the code with the help of his sisters. He's successful in opening the door and escaping, but is locked out of the compound by his father without his other family members.

Once outside, Eli is horrified to discover his father has made plans to have an associate help move the family to another compound and destroy the previous one. He tackles his father's associate, but in the process activates the bomb that will destroy the compound. Eli manages to help his mother and siblings escape, but his father runs into the compound in order to save his research. Scared, abandoned, and uncertain if his father has managed to escape or not, Eli and his remaining family wait in the woods, not knowing what will happen next. They're surprised when a helicopter arrives, containing Eli's brother Eddy and a search party. The book concludes with Eli's mother giving birth and the [[FBI]] continuing their search for the whereabouts of Rex Yanakakis. Despite this, Eli remains hopeful about what the future might bring for him...&lt;ref name="TF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: The Compound|url=http://www.thrivingfamily.com/Family/Media/book-reviews/c/compound.aspx|publisher=Thriving Family|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Perfect Day'''''  is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Ira Levin]], about a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[dystopia]].&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;David Pringle,''The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction''. New York: Pharos Books: St. Martins Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0886875374}} (p.318).&lt;/ref&gt; Levin won a [[Prometheus Award]] in 1992 for this novel.  ''This Perfect Day'' is one of two Levin novels yet to be adapted to film (the other being ''[[Son of Rosemary]]'', the sequel to ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'').

==Plot backstory==
The world is managed by a central [[computer]] called UniComp which has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of monthly treatments (delivered via [[Metered dose transdermal spray|transdermal spray]] or [[jet injector]]) so that they will remain satisfied and cooperative "Family members". They are told where to live, when to eat, whom to marry, when to reproduce, and for which job they will be trained. Everyone is assigned a counselor who acts somewhat like a mentor, confessor, and parole agent; violations against 'brothers' and 'sisters' by themselves and others are expected to be reported at a weekly [[Confession (religion)|confession]].

Everyone wears a permanent identifying bracelet which interfaces with access points that act as scanners which tell the "Family members" where they are allowed to go and what they are allowed to do. Around the age of 62, every person dies, presumably from an overdose of the treatment liquids; almost anything in them is poisonous if an excess dose is given.  Now and then, someone dies at 61 or 63, so no one is too suspicious of the regularity.
Even opposition against such a life by those few who happen to be resistant to the drugs, or those who purposely change their behavior to avoid strong doses of some of the drugs in the monthly treatment, and who consequently wake up to a day which for them turns out to be anything but perfect, is dealt with by the [[programmer]]s of UniComp. These long-lived men and women, in their underground hideaway, constitute the real, albeit invisible, world government. They live in absolute luxury and choose their own members through a form of [[meritocracy]]. In part, people who choose, through evasion and modifying their own behavior, to leave the main Family are subtly re-directed to "nature preserves" of imperfect life on islands. These, however, have been put in place by the programmers as a place to isolate trouble-making Family members. The top minds among the outcasts are further manipulated into joining the programmers to help them maintain the equilibrium in the "perfect" world of UniComp and The Family.

Even the basic facts of nature are subject to the programmers' will – men do not grow facial hair, and it rains only at night. Dampers even control the movement of tectonic plates. Reference is made in the story to permanent settlements on [[Mars]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]], outposts on Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and even to interstellar space exploration; these outposts have their own equivalents of UniComp.

The full rhyme, sung by children bouncing a ball (similar to a [[clapping game]]):
:''Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei,''
:''Led us to this perfect day.''
:''Marx, Wood, Wei and Christ,''
:''All but Wei were sacrificed.''
:''Wood, Wei, Christ and Marx,''
:''Gave us lovely schools and parks.''
:''Wei, Christ, Marx and Wood,''
:''Made us humble, made us good.''

Wei Li Chun is the person who started the Unification, and, unbeknownst to all but the programmers and their attendants, remains alive as the head of the programmers, extending his lifespan by having his head transplanted onto successive youthful bodies. Bob Wood is mentioned throughout the novel, but never discussed in detail.  A painting is mentioned depicting Wood presenting the Unification Treaty.  In one conversation in which the protagonist discusses his discovery that people once had varying lifespans, one character comments that controlling people's lifespans is the ultimate realization of the thinking of Wei and Wood. The poem also mentions [[Jesus Christ]], a central figure of [[Christianity]], and presents the historical [[Karl Marx]] as a [[martyr]], although ''sacrificed'' may simply be a [[Artistic license|poetic synonym]] for ''dead''.

Uniformity is the defining feature; there is only one [[language]] and all ethnic groups have been [[eugenic]]ally merged into one race called "The Family". There are only four personal names for men (''Bob'', ''Jesus'', ''Karl'' and ''Li'') and four for women (''Anna'', ''Mary'', ''Peace'' and ''Yin''). Instead of [[surname]]s, individuals are distinguished by a nine-character alphanumeric code, their ''"nameber"'' (a [[neologism]] from "name" and "number"), e.g. ''WL35S7497''. Everyone eats "totalcakes", drinks "cokes", wears exactly the same thing and is satisfied – every day.

==Plot summary==
Li RM35M4419, nicknamed "Chip" (as in "chip off the old block") by his nonconformist grandfather Jan, is a typical child Member who, through a mistake in genetic programming, has one green eye.  Through his grandfather's encouragement, he learns how to play a game of "wanting things", including imagining what career he might pick if he had the choice.  Chip is told by his adviser that "deciding" and "picking" are manifestations of selfishness, and he tries to forget his dreams.

As Chip grows up and begins his career, he is mostly a good citizen, but commits minor subversive acts, such as procuring art materials for another "nonconformist" member who was denied them.  His occasional oddities attract the attention of a secret group of Members who, like Chip, are also nonconformists.  There he meets King, a Medicenter chief who obtains members records for potential future recruitment to the group, King's beautiful girlfriend Lilac, a strong-willed and inquisitive woman with unusually dark skin, and Snowflake, a rare [[albino]] member.  These members teach Chip how to get his treatments reduced so that he can feel more and stronger emotions.  Chip begins an affair with Snowflake, but is really attracted to Lilac.

Chip and Lilac begin to search through old museum maps and soon discover islands around the world that have disappeared from their modern map.  They begin to wonder if perhaps other "incurable" members like themselves have escaped to these islands.  King tells them that the idea is nonsense, but Chip soon learns that King has already interacted with some "incurables" and that they are indeed real.  Before he can tell Lilac, Chip's ruse is discovered by his adviser.  He and all the other members of the group are captured and treated back into docility (except King, who takes his own life before he can be captured).

Some years later, Chip's regular treatment is delayed by an earthquake.  In the meanwhile, he begins to "wake up" again and remembers Lilac and the islands.  He is able to shield his arm from the treatment nozzle and becomes fully awake for the first time.  He locates Lilac again and kidnaps her.  At first she fights him, but as she too becomes more "awake," she remembers the islands and comes willingly. In process she is raped by Chip. Finding a convenient abandoned boat on the beach, they head for the nearest island of incurables, [[Majorca]].  There they learn that UniComp, as a last resort, has planted failsafes that eventually lead all incurables to these islands, where they will be trapped forever away from the treated population. After living "free" on Majorca, Chip and Lilac eventually marry and have a child together.

Chip conceives of a plan—destroy the computer, UniComp, by blowing up its refrigeration system.  He recruits other incurables to join him, and they make their way to the mainland.  Just as they reach UniComp, one of the incurables—an agent of the programmers—betrays his partners and leads the rest of group at gunpoint to a secret luxurious underground city beneath UniComp, where they are met by Wei, one of the original planners of the Unification.  Wei and the other "programmers" who live in UniComp have arranged this test so that the most daring and resourceful incurables will make their way to UniComp, where they, too, will live in luxury as programmers.

After joining the programmers, and after a few tentative attempts to confide in someone, Chip shares his misgivings with no one, lies low, and dedicates himself to the task of gaining Wei’s confidence.  For example, to deceive Wei, Chip consents to the replacement of his green eye with a brown one—even though this involves giving up a cherished part of his identity.

But when, nine months later, a new group of incurables arrives, Chip leaves the welcome party with the intention of using the newcomers' explosives to blow up the master computer. There follows a physical struggle with Wei (who has the body of a young athlete), and Wei is shot.  Just before he is killed, Wei reveals his true motive in creating this dystopia: “there’s ''joy'' in having it, in controlling, in being the only one.” Chip knew all along that it was power hunger—not altruism—that drove Wei to chicanery and murder.  On his way up from the underground city towards sunlight, Chip tells an angry programmer:  “’There’s joy in having it’: those were [Wei’s] last words. Everything else was rationalization. And self-deception.”

The book ends with Chip riding a helicopter toward Majorca where his wife, son, financial sponsors, and friends are hopefully waiting for him.  For the first time in his life, he sees raindrops in daytime—nature’s affirmation that the era of slavery and total control is finally over.

==Reception==
[[Cherry Wilder]], discussing ''This Perfect Day'', stated "The ideology of the "utopia" is weak, but the quality of the writing and the level of invention are high".&lt;ref&gt;Cherry Wilder, "Levin, Ira" in ''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]'' by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-912289-27-9}} (p.443-4).&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Pringle]] gave ''This Perfect Day'' two stars out of four, and described the book as "a slickly-written update of Huxley's ''Brave New World'', lacking in originality but very professionally put together".&lt;ref name="dp" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15418">'''Viable system theory''' ('''VST''') concerns [[cybernetic]] processes in relation to the development/evolution of [[dynamical systems]]. They are considered to be living systems in the sense that they are complex and [[adaption|adaptive]], can learn, and are capable of maintaining an autonomous existence, at least within the confines of their constraints. These attributes involve the maintenance of [[Stability theory|internal stability]] through [[adaptation]] to changing [[environment (systems)|environment]]s. One can distinguish between two strands such theory: [[formal systems]] and principally non-formal system. Formal viable system theory is normally referred to as [[viability theory]], and provides a mathematical approach to explore the dynamics of [[complex system]]s set within the context of [[control theory]]. In contrast, principally non-formal viable system theory is concerned with descriptive approaches to the study of viability through the processes of [[Cybernetics|control and communication]], though these theories may have mathematical descriptions associated with them.

== History ==
The concept of viability arose with [[Stafford Beer]] in the 1950s through his [[paradigm]] of management systems.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to management cybernetics. Cwarel Isaf Institute. http://www.kybernetik.ch/en/fs_intromankyb.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Beer, 1959, Cybernetics and Management, English University Press http://www.toolshero.com/change-management/management-cybernetics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Beer, (1966), Decision and Control: The Meaning of Operational Research and Management Cybernetics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, UK&lt;/ref&gt; Its formal relative, [[viability theory]] began its life in 1976 with the mathematical interpretation of a book by [[Jacques Monod]] published in 1971 and entitled ''[[Chance and Necessity]]'', and which concerned processes of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, J. P., Bayen, A. M., &amp; Saint-Pierre, P. (2011). Viability theory: new directions. Springer Science &amp; Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; Viability theory is concerned with dynamic adaptation of uncertain evolutionary systems to environments defined by constraints, the values of which determine the viability of the system. Both formal and non-formal approaches ultimately concern the structure and evolutionary dynamics of viability in [[complex systems]]. 

An alternative non-formal paradigm arose in the late 1980s through the work of Eric Schwarz.,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, E., Aragno, M., Beck, H., Matthey, W., Remane, J., Chiffelle, F., Gern, J.P., Dubied, P.L., Bühle, P. (1988). La révolution des systems: une introduction à l'approche systémique: conférences interfacultaires données à l'Université de Neuchâtel, Neuchâtel, Cousset: Secrétariat de l'Université, DelVal&lt;/ref&gt; which increases the dimensionality of Beer's paradigm &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, E. (1992) A Generic Model for the Emergence and Evolution of Natural Systems toward Complexity and Autonomy.Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Systems Science,Denver, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, E. (1997). Toward a holistic cybernetics: from science through epistemology to being. Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 4, 17-50&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beer viable system theory==
The viable system theory of Beer is most well known through his [[viable system model]] &lt;ref&gt;The Basis for the Viable System Model, The Intellingence Organization Conference, Monterrey, Mexico 1990. Chapter 3 video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaLHocBdG3A&lt;/ref&gt; and is concerned with viable organisations capable of evolving.&lt;ref&gt;The theory of practice Cwarel Isaf Institute. http://www.kybernetik.ch/en/fs_methmod3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through both internal and external analysis it is possible to identify the relationships and modes of behaviour that constitute viability. The model is underpinned by the realisation that organisations are complex, and recognising the existence of complexity is inherent to processes of analysis. Beer's management systems paradigm is underpinned by a set of proposition, sometimes referred to as cybernetic laws. Siting within this is his viable systems model (VSM) and one of its laws is a principle of [[recursion]], so that just as the model can be applied to divisions in a department, it can also be applied to the departments themselves. This is permitted through Beer's viability law which states that ''every viable system contains and is contained in a viable system''.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, S. (1959) Cybernetics and Management. English U. Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The cybernetic laws are applied to all types of human activity systems&lt;ref&gt;Banathy, B. (2016) A Taste of systemics 29/09/2016 www.isss.org/primer/bela6.html&lt;/ref&gt; like organisations and institutions.

Now, paradigms are concerned with not only theory but also modes of behaviour within inquiry. One significant part of Beer's paradigm is the development of his Viable Systems Model (VSM) that addresses problem situations in terms of control and communication processes, seeking to ensure system viability within the object of attention. Another is Beer's [[Syntegrity]] protocol which centres on the means by which effective [[communications]] in complex situations can occur. VSM has been used successfully to diagnose organisational pathologies (conditions of social ill-health). The model involves not only an operative system that has both structure (e.g., divisions in an organisation or departments in a division) from which [[behaviour]] emanates that is directed towards an environment, but also a meta-system, which some have called the observer of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Von Foerster, H. (2003). Cybernetics of cybernetics. In Understanding understanding (pp. 283-286). Springer New York&lt;/ref&gt; The system and meta-system are [[ontologically]] different, so that for instance where in a production company the system is concerned with production processes and their immediate management, the meta-system is more concerned with the management of the production system as a whole.  The connection between the system and meta-system is explained through Beer's Cybernetic map.&lt;ref&gt;Livas, J. The Cybernetic State. The Unity of Economics, Law and Politics. http://www.ototsky.mgn.ru/it/papers/JavierLivas_The-Cybernetic-State.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Beer considered that viable social systems should be seen as living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, S. (1980), Preface to Autopoiesis: The Organization of the Living, by Maturana, H., Varela, F.J., Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humberto Maturana]] used the term or [[autopoiesis]] (self-production) to explain biological living systems, but was reluctant to accept that social systems were living.

== Schwarz viable system theory==
The viable system theory of Schwarz is more directed towards the explicit examination of issues of complexity than is that of Beer. The theory begins with the idea of [[dissipative system]]s. While all isolated [[systems]] conserve [[energy]], in non-isolated systems, one can distinguish between conservative systems (in which the [[kinetic energy]] is conserved) and dissipative systems (where the total kinetic and [[potential energy]] is conserved, but where part of the energy is changed in form and lost). If dissipated systems are far from equilibrium they "try" to recover [[Equilibrium constant|equilibrium]] so quickly that they form dissipative structures to accelerate the process. Dissipative systems can create structured spots where [[entropy]] locally decreases and so [[negentropy]] locally increases to generate order and organisation. Dissipative systems involve far-from-equilibrium process that are inherently dynamically unstable, though they survive through the creation of order that is beyond the thresholds of instability.

Schwarz explicitly defined the living system in terms of its metastructure&lt;ref&gt;St. Lawrence University Global Glossary: Metastructure http://it.stlawu.edu/~global/glossary/metastructure.html&lt;/ref&gt; involving a system, a metasystem and a meta-meta-system, this latter being an essential attribute. As with Beer, the system is concerned with operative attributes. Schwarz's meta-system is essentially concerned with relationships, and the meta-meta system is concerned with all forms of [[knowledge]] and its acquisition. Thus, where in Beer's theory [[learning]] processes can only be discussed in terms of implicit processes, in Schwarz's theory they can be discussed in explicit terms.

Schwarz's living system model is a summary of much of the knowledge of complex adaptive systems, but succinctly compressed as a graphical generic [[metamodel]]. It is this capacity of compression that establishes it as a new theoretical structure that is beyond the concept of autopoiesis/self-production proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]], through the concept of autogenesis. While the concept of autogenesis has not had the collective coherence that autopoiesis has,&lt;ref&gt;Csányi, V. and Kampis, G. (1985), Autogenesis: the evolution of replicative systems, J. Theor. Biol., Vol. 114, pp. 303-323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drazin and Sandlelands, (1992) Autogenesis. Organization Science http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Autogenesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarz clearly defined it as a network of self-creation processes and firmly integrated it with relevant theory in complexity in a way not previously done. The outcome illustrates how a complex and adaptive viable system is able to survive - maintaining an autonomous durable existence within the confines of its own constraints. The nature of viable systems is that they should have at least potential independence in their processes of regulation, organisation, production, and cognition. The generic model provides a holistic relationship between the attributes that explains the nature of viable systems and how they survive. It addresses the emergence and possible evolution of organisations towards complexity and autonomy intended to refer to any domain of system (e.g., biological, social, or cognitive).

Systems in general, but also human activity systems, are able to survive (in other words they become viable) when they develop:

(a) patterns of self-organisation that lead to self-organisation through morphogenesis and complexity;

(b) patterns for long term evolution towards autonomy;

(c) patterns that lead to the functioning of viable systems.

This theory was intended to embrace the dynamics of dissipative systems using three planes.
* Plane of energy.
* Plane of information.
* Plane of totality.
Each of the three planes (illustrated in Figure 1 below) is an independent ontological domain, interactively connected through networks of processes, and it shows the basic ontological structure of the viable system.

[[File:Explanation-of-the-nature.png|Thumb|Figure 1: Explanation of the nature of a Viable Living System, adapted from Schwarz (1994)]]

Connected with this is an evolutionary spiral of self-organisation (adapted from Schwarz's 1997 paper), shown in Figure 2 below.

[[File:Figure 2, The Dynamics of systems as they move from stability to instability and back.png|Figure 2, The Dynamics of systems as they move from stability to instability and back]]

Here, there are 4 phases or modes that a viable system can pass through. Mode 3 occurs with one of three possible outcomes ([[trifurcation]]): system death when viability is lost; more of the same; and metamorphosis when the viable system survives because it changes form.

The dynamic process that viable living systems have, as they move from stability to instability and back again, is explained in Table 1, referring to aspects of both Figures 1 and 2.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Metamodel for the dynamics of self-organisation
|-
! Step !! Movement toward evolution
|-
| 1. Stability || The system starts in a non-isolated condition, with some degree of stability.
|-
| 2. Tropic drift || Dissipative processes increase and the system is in danger of losing any robustness that it has. In complex systems the tropic drift enables potentials to be actualised. The drift takes the system away from its stable position and gives rise to tensions between the system and its parts and/or between the system and its environment.
|-
| 3. ALEA (crisis) || The tensions, following the tropic drift that moved the system away from its stable domain, lead the system to a non-linear condition of structural criticality. If the system loses robustness, fluctuations are amplified.
|-
| 4. Metamorphosis || Morphogenic change is induced through amplification. This occurs through differentiation. While the steps 103 above occur in the event plane, here more relational processes appear in the system through positive and negative feedback, and integration. 
|-
| 5. Omeostasis || This slows down the morphogenesis of step 4, through the appearance of new integrative functional negative feedback loops. However, an unsuccessful result may produce regression, chaos, or destruction.
|-
| 6. Information drift and complexification || The above steps can be iterated increasing the complexity of the system. This is represented in the logical plane. 
|-
| 7. Appearance of self-production cycles || When complexity reaches a very high level, a new kind of super-circularity can emerge: autopoiesis.  This operates at the logical level of the system reinforcing the network of production.
|-
| 8. Autopoiesis || Complexification can continue in a safer way than in step 6. This is because there is an additional super-logical relation between the events that represent the system and its logical organisation. When this has happened, the system has increased its autonomy from the homeostatic steps of 5 and 6, to self-production.
|-
| 9. Self-reference || Increase in autonomy and development of individual identity occurs with self-reference in the logical plane. In stapes 5 and 6, the system could compensate for the unexpected variations in the environment through multiple homeostatic loops (steps 5 and 6). In steps 7 and 8 it developed the ability to increase its autonomy and complexification. Here it develops the ability to self-identify and dialogue with itself about matters that include its environment.
|-
| 10. Self-referential drift || This represents an intensification of self-reference. This is accompanied by an increase in the qualitative and quantitative dialogue between the system and its image within the system. This increases autonomy, and elevates the level of consciousness in a living system. It therefore solidifies individual identity.
|-
| 11. Autogenesis || This represents the self-production of the rules of production. It occurs in the existential plane. It defines the state of full autonomy, and is closed operationally. It defines being.

Schwarz's VST has been further developed, set within a social knowledge context, and formulated as [[autonomous agency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yolles|first1=M.|title=Organizations as Complex Systems: an introduction to knowledge cybernetics|date=2006|publisher=Information Age Publishing, Inc|location=Greenwich, CT, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=K,J.,|last2=Yolles|first2=M.I.|last3=Fink|first3=G.|last4=Iles|first4=P.|title=The Changing Organisation: an Agency Approach|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge &amp; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wiradjuri Elder, Aunty Isobel Reid, giving the Welcome to Country at the Centenary of the Kangaroo March launch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wiradjuri]] Elder, Aunty Isobel Reid, giving the Welcome to Country.]]A '''welcome to country''' is a ritual performed at many events held in [[Australia]], intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] clan or language group. The welcome must be performed by a recognised [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] of the group. Welcomes to country are sometimes accompanied by traditional [[smoking ceremony|smoking ceremonies]], music or dance.

Some jurisdictions, such as [[New South Wales]], make a welcome (or, failing that, acknowledgement) mandatory at all government-run events, although such rules have proved controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arp.nsw.gov.au/c2004-39-recognising-aboriginal-cultural-protocols-and-practices|accessdate=2 August 2018|publisher=NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet|date=1 November 2004|title=C2004-39 Recognising Aboriginal Cultural Protocols and Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-05-19/victoria-dumps-nod-to-traditional-owners/2719734|title=Victoria dumps nod to traditional owners|author=Doman, Mark|date= 29 June 2011|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where an elder is not available to perform the welcome, a simpler acknowledgement of country may be offered instead.

Fees for delivering a welcome to country vary. In [[Sydney]], the [[Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council]] charges between $400 and $600 for the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metrolalc.org.au/services-resources/welcome-to-country/|title=Welcome to Country|publisher=Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Matilda House (activist)|Matilda Williams House]] was paid $10,500 to perform a welcome at the opening of the [[44th Parliament of Australia|44th Parliament]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="quadrant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2016/04/brand-new-timeless-traditions/|title=Brand new timeless traditions|author=Thomas, Tony|date=22 April 2016|accessdate=2 August 2018|publisher=Quadrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first recorded welcome to country occurred in 1976, when entertainers [[Ernie Dingo]] and [[Richard Walley]] developed a ceremony to welcome a group of [[Māori people|Māori]] artists who were participating in the [[Perth International Arts Festival]]. The welcome, extended on behalf of the [[Noongar]] people, was intended to mirror the visitors' own traditions, while incorporating elements of Aboriginal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth International Arts Festival gives welcome to west country|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/stage/perth-international-arts-festival-gives-welcome-to-west-country/news-story/18eda9115f366089fb6cc86e366ef36c|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=2 August 2018|author=Westwood, Matthew|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walley recalled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40 years of the 'modern' Welcome to Country|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/history-culture/2016/03/richard-walleys-welcome-to-country|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=2 August 2018|author=Penberthy, Natsumi|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I asked the good spirits of my ancestors and the good spirits of the ancestors of the land to watch over us and keep our guests safe while they’re in our Country. And then I talked to the spirits of their ancestors, saying that we’re looking after them here and we will send them back to their Country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arts administrator Rhoda Roberts says that the [[Aboriginal National Theatre Trust]] was instrumental in developing the welcome to country during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=lacksheart&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to country ceremony 'lacks heart'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/welcome-to-country-ceremony-lacks-heart-20121014-27kv2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=16 March 2013|author=Taylor, Andrew|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, a welcome to country has been incorporated into the ceremonial opening of the [[Parliament of Australia]], an event which occurs after each federal election. The welcome includes a speech as well as traditional music and dance. Given that Parliament sits in [[Canberra]], traditionally part of [[Ngambri]] country, a Ngambri elder officiates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A historic first: traditional Indigenous welcome begins Parliament|url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/02/12/2160380.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 August 2018|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although welcomes to country have become commonplace across the country, they have attracted criticism from politicians, historians and commentators including [[Bess Price]], [[Tony Abbott]], [[Keith Windschuttle]] and [[Andrew Bolt]]. Critics consider such ceremonies to be a form of [[tokenism]], and note that they do not reflect any element of traditional Aboriginal culture. Price, a [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] woman and former parliamentarian, characterises welcomes as "not particularly meaningful to traditional people." Windschuttle calls them "an invented tradition" and Roberts considers them "part and parcel of being [[Political correctness|PC]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Abbott reopens culture wars over nods to Aborigines|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/tony-abbott-reopens-culture-wars-over-nods-to-aborigines/story-e6frgczf-1225840660428|work=The Australian|accessdate=16 March 2013|author=Maiden, Samantha|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Welcomes to country are being foisted on us in error|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/welcomes-to-country-are-being-foisted-on-us-in-error/news-story/82b9749840792d606ba703a4115c9772|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|accessdate= 26 October 2018|last=Windschuttle | first= Keith|date=1 December 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lacksheart /&gt;

== In Aboriginal culture ==

Prior to European settlement, each clan's survival was dependent upon its understanding of food, water and other resources within its own 'Country' – a discrete area of land to which it had more or less exclusive claim. For this reason, traditional Aboriginal culture was highly territorial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The original Australians: story of the Aboriginal people|author=Flood, Josephine|date=2006|publisher=Allen and Unwin|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; visitors risked violent reprisal for crossing a tribal or clan boundary without permission.{{fact|date=November 2018}} Although there is no record of a welcome to country ceremony having existed in any traditional Aboriginal society, each group had mandatory protocols for seeking and granting permission to enter land.&lt;ref name="quadrant" /&gt;

== Acknowledgement of Country ==

If a local elder is not available, the host of an event can offer an acknowledgement of country in place of a welcome (though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably). The following form of words, published by the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]], is typical:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Traditional Owners|url=https://www.vic.gov.au/aboriginalvictoria/heritage/welcome-to-country-and-acknowledgement-of-traditional-owners.html|publisher=Victorian Government|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land [or country] on which we are meeting. I pay my respects to their Elders, past and present, and the Elders from other communities who may be here today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar acknowledgements have become common at public events in [[Canada]] and have begun to be adopted by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shazad"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shazad|first1=Ramna|title=What is the significance of acknowledging the Indigenous land we stand on?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/territorial-acknowledgements-indigenous-1.4175136|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=CBC News|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marche_NYer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=Canada's Impossible Acknowledgement|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/canadas-impossible-acknowledgment|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Hannah Graf|title=We Begin with Acknowledgement|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/we-begin-with-acknowledgement-197|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=Friends Committee on National Legislation|date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
