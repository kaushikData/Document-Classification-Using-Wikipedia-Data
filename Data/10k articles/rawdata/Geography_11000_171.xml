==Formation theories==

Research on the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] analysis of the Martian circumpolar deposits is ongoing because it provides information on the ancient climate and geological formation processes of the planet.&lt;ref name="Geophys"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. C. Brothers, J. W. Holt, A. Spiga|title=Orbital radar, imagery, and atmospheric modeling reveal an aeolian origin for Abalos Mensa, Mars|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50293/full|date=16 April 2013|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1334–1339|doi=10.1002/grl.50293|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40.1334B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumpolar deposit of Abalos Mensa has been described as an "enigmatic wedge of material",&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt; which has been studied by scientists due to its uncommon location and shape characteristics.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt; Formation theories for Abalos Mensa primarily propose erosional processes based either on fluid action or wind action; the latter are known as [[Aeolian processes]], named after [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], the ancient Greek God of the wind.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt;

The fluid flow theories propose fluid action which would erode the surrounding area and produce the channels that separate Abalos Mensa from the main ice cap.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt; The fluid flow theories require volcanic action which would provide the thermal energy to melt the polar materials which would then flow and cause erosion of the area.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt; There have been a number of questions raised about the fluid flow theories, including the uncertainty of volcanic activity in the Planum Boreum region.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt;

Impact-shielding-based Aeolian theories propose that ancient material from the base of Planum Boreum was protected by [[ejecta]] from an impact crater, and when the old base material of the surrounding area disappeared, the protected mound acted like a source for further accumulation of new deposits, which, with time, produced the mound of Abalos Mensa.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt;

A modified, numerical, Aeolian-based approach uses the data provided by the [[SHARAD]], [[HiRISE]], and [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter|MOLA]] instruments on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], to produce a topographic simulation of the area of Abalos Mensa, which is then combined with weather modeling to produce a simulation of the weather conditions and morphological evolution of the area. This approach has determined that the form of Abalos Mensa can be derived using the computer simulation without the need for assumptions such as polar volcanic activity, or impact-shielding of the old polar basal unit.&lt;ref name="Geophys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="43rd Lunar"/&gt;

The '''Agbon Kingdom''' (also Agbon ẹkpotọ, Agbon clan)&lt;ref name="matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waado.org/organizations/UPU/president_general_reception_abuja/lectures/clans_kingdoms_ekeh.htm |title=On the Matter of Clans and Kingdoms in Urhobo History and Culture |author=Peter P. Ekeh |pages= |date=April 26, 2008 |accessdate=2014-08-17 |quote= |publisher=Urhobo Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of twenty-two subunits of [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] culture that have been in existence since before the rise of the [[Benin Empire]] in the 1440s and before the arrival of the Portuguese in the Western Niger Delta in the 1480s.&lt;ref name="matter"/&gt; It is located in the [[Delta State]] of [[Nigeria]] which occupies a large space of about 375 square kilometres. This kingdom is surrounded by other [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] communities in the locality. The traditional seat of government in this kingdom is at [[Isiokolo]].

==History==
[[Oral tradition]] speaks of migrations from the ancient [[Bini kingdom]] by the Urhobos that gave rise to this area.&lt;ref name="matter"/&gt;

The founders of Agbon migrated through [[Kwale]], probably from [[Erhowa]], settled at [[Ehwen]] and [[Erhivwi]] or Irri in present [[Isoko division]] of Delta State. From there they moved down to [[Utokori]], close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found Otorho r' Agbon now known as Isiokolo. Isiokolo is now the recognised ancestral place of leadership by the members of this kingdom. The current king of Agbon Kingdom is His Majesty, Michael G. Omeru, (JP) Ukori I, 
The Ovie of Agbon.

==Natural resources==
This kingdom produces a variety of food crops, mostly yam, plantain and cassava. Cash crops as palm produce and rubber plantations also flourish here. Agbon holds a large reservoir of crude oil which is a major source of income to Nigeria; the [[Erhorike]] oil wells are considered to be among the shallowest in the world and are found here.

==Population==
The kingdom is highly populated as it has an extensive range of towns and villages under its territorial domain. It has been ranked the second most populous cultural unit in [[Urhoboland]], coming only after Okpe. The population of this kingdom alone amounts for more than 40% of the Delta state population.

==Language==
The people of Agbon speak [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]] as their mother tongue with little or no dialectical forms. The [[Nigerian pidgin]] is also widespread in this kingdom as well as English, the lingua franca of Nigeria.

==Composition==
This kingdom is made up of a wide array of sub-kingdoms and villages or towns. These sub-kingdoms are the consequences of migrations from one terrain to another.

===Sub-kingdoms===
* Okpara  (first son)
* [[Kokori]] (second son)
* Eku (third son)

Both above has contributed much to the educational development of Urhoboland and boasts of having one of the heaviest concentrations of graduates, medical doctors, and professors  and lawyers including the present Otota of Agbon Kingdom, Barrister Efe Akpofure (SAN), Hon. Akpodiogaga Sunny Emeyese ( the incumbent member representing Ethiope Federal Constituency at the National Assembly).

Agbon also produced the first Chief of Staff of the Nigeria Army, Major General [[David A. Ejoor]], as well as the first Urhobo Chief Justice of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Justice [[Ayo Irikefe]]. It is from this portion of Urhoboland that Nigeria had its first Commissioner for Labor, Chief T.E.A. Salubi, during the colonial administration. --&gt;

'''Bennachie''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|x|iː}} {{respell|ben-ə|HEE|'}}; [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Beinn na Cìche'')&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Miller, ''BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names'' (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; is a range of hills in [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=whitely&gt;Whiteley, A.W.M. (Ed.) (1976). ''The Book of Bennachie''. The Bailies of Bennachie. {{ISBN|0-900323-21-3}}. Mostly anecdotes and verse about the mountain and its surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has several tops, the highest of which, '''Oxen Craig''', has a height of {{convert|528|m|ft|0}}. Though not particularly high, compared to other peaks within Scotland, the mountain is very prominent, owing to its isolation and the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain, and dominates the skyline from several viewpoints.

The peak that stands out the most visually is '''Mither Tap''' (518&amp;nbsp;m, 1699&amp;nbsp;feet) and from its top there are good views of the county to the north and east. Most of the tops lie along an east / west [[ridge]], with the exception of '''Millstone Hill''' (409 m) an outlier or spur which is separated from and to the south of the main ridge. Mither Tap has an [[Iron Age]] [[fort]] on its summit. Unlike with many other hilltop forts in the area, there are no signs of [[Glass transition|vitrification]] in the stone.&lt;ref name=whitely /&gt; Bennachie is visible from a number of distant points; to the north it is visible from [[Longman Hill]], a point considerably to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, C. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11228/longman_hill.html#fieldnotes "Longman Hill"], ''Longman Hill'', 2008, Modern Antiquarian&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Some believe that the peak had [[religion|religious]] significance to the [[Bronze Age]] people who inhabited this area. This theory is supported by the large number of [[standing stone]]s in the surrounding area. The significance is believed  to be connected to the profile of the hill, which is shaped like a female [[breast]], which is reflected in the name "Mither Tap" (Mother Top) and "Bennachie" (''Beinn na Ciche'': 'hill of the breast').  It has been suggested as a possible site of the battle of [[Mons Graupius]].  An alternative Gaelic etymology from *''Beinn a' Chath'', i.e. 'hill of the battle', is perhaps a possibility.

From 1800 to 1859 common land on the east side of Bennachie was home to a community of squatters known locally as the [[The Colony (Bennachie)|Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagen, J. [http://www.leopardmag.co.uk/feats/251/echoes-of-the-bennachie-colonists "Echoes of the Bennachie Colonists"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925025629/http://www.leopardmag.co.uk/feats/251/echoes-of-the-bennachie-colonists |date=2010-09-25 }}, ''Leopard Magazine'', Retrieved on 2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of families led a [[crofting]] life often doing skilled work, such as dyking and quarrying, for local landowners. After 1859 the Colony dwindled as the common land was broken up and divided amongst the local estates. However, the last of the original colonists, George Esson, lived on the hill until his death in the 1930s. Visitors to Bennachie can explore the remains of the Colony and extensive work is being done on site and amongst local parish records to determine the history of the Colonists.

Mither Tap has an astronomical alignment with the nearby Pictish Fortalice of Caskieben (currently located within Keith Hall). [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Dr. Arthur Johnston]] said&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers, Thomas Thomson [https://books.google.com/books?id=3D8DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA404&amp;dq=Caskieben&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6mzyVJmgOIWzyASqi4DgBQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Caskieben&amp;f=false "A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, Volume 2"],"Arthur Johnston", published 1870&lt;/ref&gt; "the hill of Benochie, a conical elevation about eight miles distant, casts its shadow over Caskieben at the periods of the equinox."

== Paths and environment ==

The range of hills is a popular destination for walkers since it is relatively close to [[Aberdeen]]. The [[Gordon Way]] is a waymarked trail that traverses the Southern flank of Bennachie between the Visitors Centre in the East and Suie Car Park to the West. Most of the  Bennachie range is owned by the [[Forestry Commission]], which maintains a network of paths on and around the hills, several car parks and a [[visitor centre]] located at the eastern foot of the range. A volunteer group, the [http://www.bailiesofbennachie.co.uk/ Bailies of Bennachie], founded in 1973, helps with this work and with other environmental and archaeological activities on the hill.&lt;ref name=bbn2013&gt;{{cite news|title=2013 Newsletter|newspaper=Bailies of Bennachie Newsletter|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several marked paths, including fairly easy ascents of Oxen Craig and Mither Tap that start from the centre.

Blockfields differ from [[scree]]s and [[talus slope]] in that blockfields do not apparently originate from [[mass wasting]]s. They are believed to be formed by [[frost weathering]] below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David S.G. and [[Andrew Goudie (geographer)|Andrew Goudie]] (eds.), ''The Dictionary of Physical Geography'', 3rd edn., Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, p. 215. {{ISBN|0-631-20473-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodnot/&gt; An alternative theory suggests that modern blockfields may have originated from [[chemical weathering]] that occurred in the [[Neogene]] when the climate was relatively warmer. Following this thought the blockfields would then have been reworked by periglacial action.&lt;ref name=Goodnot&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodfellow |first=B.W. |last2=Stroeven |first2=A.P. |last3=Fabel |first3=D. |last4=Fredin |first4=O. |last5=M.-H. |first5=Derron |last6=Bintnja |first6=R. |last7=Caffee |first7=M.W. |date=2014 |title=Arctic–alpine blockfields in the northern Swedish Scandes: late Quaternary – not Neogene |url=http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/2/383/2014/ |journal=Earth Surface Dynamics |publisher= |volume=2 |issue= |pages=383–401 |doi= |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boelhouwers |first=Jan |date=2004 |title=New Perspectives on Autochthonous Blockfield Development |journal=[[Polar Geography]] |publisher= |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=133–146 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most known blockfields are located in the northern hemisphere. Examples can be found in [[Abisko National Park]] in Sweden, [[Snowdonia National Park]] in Wales, the [[Great End]]-[[Scafell Pike]] ridge in [[England]] and [[Hickory Run State Park|Hickory Run Boulder Field]] and [[Hawk Mountain|River of Rocks]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the [[United States]]. All examples except the first one are outside present day subpolar climate areas, and have thus traditionally been seen as relict [[landform]]s from past times when these areas were under periglaciation.

The term "felsenmeer" comes from the German meaning 'sea of rock'. In a felsenmeer or blockfield, [[freeze-thaw]] weathering has broken up the top layer of the rock, covering the underlying rock formation with jagged, angular boulders. Freeze-thaw or frost weathering occurs when water that is trapped along microcracks in rock expands and contracts due to fluctuations in temperature above and below the freezing point. Felsenmeers are formed ''in situ'', meaning that they are not transported during or after their creation.

==Characteristics==
===Surface===
Felsenmeers only form on slopes of 25° or lower. A steeper angle results in transport of the blocks due to gravity. This creates a [[Scree|talus]] slope, rather than a felsenmeer.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, R. (1966) Block fields, weathering pits and tor-like forms in the Narvik Mountains, Nordland, Norway. ''[[Geografiska Annaler]]'' A 48, 55-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Crude sorting with boulder [[imbrication (sedimentology)|imbrication]] can occasionally be seen on the surface of felsenmeers.

===Profile===
The depth of the boulder field depends on the slope angle, rock types, age, and erosional history. However, a reasonable average for felsenmeer depth is approximately 1m. Ballantyne (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, C.K. (1998). Age and significance of mountain-top detritus. ''[[Permafrost and Periglacial Processes]]'' 9, 327-345&lt;/ref&gt; defines three types of felsenmeer profiles:
Type 1 consists of boulders overlying a matrix of fines at some depth below the surface.
Type 2 consists of boulders supported by a cohesionless sandy matrix that continues from the surface down through the profile.
Type 3 also consists of boulders supported by a matrix, but differs from Type 2 in that the matrix consists of silt and/or clay rather than sand.

== Occurrence ==
Due to the slope requirements they are most commonly found on [[plateaus]].&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, John Richard. ''Fundamentals of Geomorphology'', 3rd edn., Routledge, 2011, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basalt]] and [[sedimentary rock]]s often produce larger, more numerous felsenmeers than other types of rock.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', Volume 8; Volume 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Blockfields are most often found in high mountain [[periglacial]] regions near the Arctic Circle, especially in [[Iceland]], the [[Canada|Canadian]] arctic and [[Norway]] and are still active in parts of Central Europe that were not covered by ice sheets.&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt; In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] [[relict (geology)|inactive]] blockfields can be found in the [[Lesotho Highlands]],&lt;ref name=Sumner2004&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Sumner |author-first=P.D. |date=2004 |title=Geomorphic and  climatic  implications of  relict openwork block  accumulations  near Thabana-Ntlenyana, Lesotho |journal=[[Geografiska Annaler|Geografiska Annaler Series A: Physical Geography]] |volume=86|issue=3 |pages= 289–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Prince Edward Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boelhouwers |first1=Jan |last2=Holness |first2=Steve |last3=Sumner |first3=Paul |date=2003 |title=The maritime Subantarctic: a distinct periglacial environment |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue= |pages=39–55 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age ==
Felsenmeers are, typically, relatively young geomorphological features. Most felsenmeers formed during or since the last [[ice age]] (approximately 20,000 years ago). Others may be pre-glacial features that survived glaciation beneath cold-based glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, John A. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Environmental Change'', 3-volume set,
Swansea: Sage, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Their specific age can be determined using [[surface exposure dating]], a technique that works best on materials which have been exposed to cosmic rays with little interference from trees or soils.

'''Buada Lagoon''' is a landlocked, slightly [[brackish water|brackish]], [[freshwater]] [[lake]] of [[Buada District]] in the [[island nation]] of [[Nauru]]. It occupies about {{convert|0.05|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}.

The lagoon is classified as an [[endorheic]] lake, meaning there is no outflow to other bodies of water such as oceans or rivers.

==Vegetation==
Unlike in many areas of [[Nauru]], trees are in relative abundance in the vicinity of Buada Lagoon.

The '''Catholic Diocese of Helsinki''' is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic]] church based in [[Helsinki]], which comprises the whole of [[Finland]].  The diocese is divided into eight parishes.

The current Catholic Bishop of Helsinki is [[Teemu Sippo]], [[Priests of the Sacred Heart|S.C.I.]], the first ethnic [[Finnish people|Finn]] to hold the office since its reestablishment after the Reformation (previous bishops included three [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and a [[Polish people|Pole]]). As of 2018 there are 15,000 registered catholic people living in Finland and around 10,000 unregistered members are there in the country. More than 6000 Catholic families are there in the total country where 50 percentage is Finns and rest is International community.

There is a high demand for starting a new parish at Northern Finland at [[Rovaniemi]] as it is the major tourist destination for [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] and [[Santa Claus]].

==History==
In 1550 the episcopate of the last [[List of bishops of Turku#Catholic bishops of Turku (Åbo, Aboa)|Roman Catholic bishop of Åbo]] ended. Thereafter Lutheranism prevailed in Finland. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the sixteenth century caused the loss of almost all of Northern Europe to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1582 the stray Catholics in Finland and elsewhere in Northern Europe were placed under the jurisdiction of a [[papal nuncio]] in [[Cologne]]. The [[Congregation de propaganda fide]], on its establishment in 1622, took charge of the vast missionary field, which - at its third session - it divided among the nuncio of [[Brussels]] (for the Catholics in Denmark and Norway), the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne|nuncio at Cologne]] (much of Northern Germany) and the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Poland|nuncio to Poland]] (Finland, Mecklenburg, and Sweden).

In 1688 Finland became part of the [[Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions|Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions]]. In 1783 the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden]] was created out of parts of the Nordic Missions comprising then Finland and Sweden. In 1809, when Finland came under Russian rule, the Roman Catholic jurisdiction passed on to the [[Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mohilev]] (then seated in St. Petersburg). In 1920 the Vatican established the Apostolic Vicariate of Finland which was upgraded to the Diocese of Helsinki in 1955.

Jack Maher, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in Asia fellow, wrote in the ''[[Asian Review of Books]]'' that ''China's Super Consumers'' did not factor into account the anti-corruption drives of [[Xi Jinping]] and the increase of Chinese domestic brands, and both aspects would require Western companies to take additional cautions.&lt;ref name=Maher/&gt;

The '''districts of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands''' were the primary subdivisions of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

==History==
[[File:MapofTTPI.gif|thumb|600px]]
In 1962{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} there existed six districts with the following population:
* [[Chuuk District]] - 22564
* [[Mariana Islands District]] - 9586
* [[Marshall Islands District]] - 15710
* [[Palau District]] - 9965
* [[Pohnpei District]] - 17224
* [[Yap District]] - 5931

"In a 1975 plebiscite the Northern Marianas group voted to become a commonwealth of the United States and, from 1976, was administered separately from the rest of the territory. The remaining island groups were reorganized again into six districts..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Trust-Territory-of-the-Pacific-Islands "Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands", Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Kosrae District]] was created out of the Pohnpei District, keeping six disctricts.

'''Doyle's Delight''' is the highest peak in [[Belize]] at {{convert|1124|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It lies in the [[Cockscomb Range]], a spur of the [[Maya Mountains]] in Western Belize.

The name Doyle's Delight was first coined by Sharon Matola in a 1989 report.&lt;ref&gt;Matola, Sharon (1989). ''The Doyle’s Delight Expedition, Maya Mountains, Southern Belize''. Unpublished report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MeermanMatola"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meerman|first1=Jan|last2=Matola|first2=Sharon|title=Doyle’s Delight: The August 2004 Expedition|url=http://library.bfreebz.org/Protected%20Areas/Chiquibul%20National%20Park/Jan%20C.%20Meerman%20%26%20Sharon%20Matola,%20Doyle's%20Delight%20The%20August%202004%20Expedition,%202007.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2016|date=June 2007|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201032324/http://library.bfreebz.org/Protected%20Areas/Chiquibul%20National%20Park/Jan%20C.%20Meerman%20%26%20Sharon%20Matola%2C%20Doyle%27s%20Delight%20The%20August%202004%20Expedition%2C%202007.pdf|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is based on [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s book ''The Lost World'' (1912), which contains the quote "there must be something wild and wonderful in a country such as this, and we're the men to find it out!".

This name has meanwhile achieved widespread acceptance. The official Government of Belize Website lists Doyle's Delight as the highest point in Belize. The capital of Belize, Belmopan, has a "Doyle's Delight Street". Recently there has been an attempt to rename the peak to "Kaan Witz" which is Maya for "Sky Mountain", but the new name has not gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="MeermanMatola"/&gt;

Although [[Victoria Peak (Belize)|Victoria Peak]] was for many years touted as the highest point in Belize, recent assessments determined that it is apparently slightly lower at {{convert|1120|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  Victoria Peak is located east of the Maya Mountain Divide in the Stann Creek District, and in clear weather its dramatic peak is visible from the coast.  Doyle’s Delight is located in the heart of the Maya Mountains and is part of a more gently sloping range, with no dramatic peak.

==Expeditions==
There is a clearing on the peak that is maintained by the [[Belize Defence Force]] and the British Military as a helicopter landing.  In 1970, a survey marker was placed at the high point of the ridge.&lt;ref name="MeermanMatola"/&gt;

In 2004 and 2007 ecologists reached the summit by using a helicopter and surveyed Doyle’s Delight and adjacent ridges to better understand the ecology and biodiversity of the region.  These efforts focused on plants, fungi, insects, amphibians, birds, and small mammals, and produced preliminary inventory data for the area.&lt;ref name="MeermanMatola"/&gt;

Two notable expeditions by mountaineers, in 2007 and 2008, reached the summit by hiking and climbing for eight days through the virgin jungle. The second expedition members included: Bruno Kuppinger (Germany), Christian Rodriguez&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianrodriguezm.com Guatemalan mountainner]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203013515/http://www.christianrodriguezm.com/ |date=February 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Guatemala), Douglas Leonardo (Guatemala), Emilino Sho (Belize), Alfredo, and Erick Cho (Belize).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/doyle-s-delight-summit-from-belize/446324 Expedition 2008 report.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Earth inductor compass''' (or simply '''induction compass'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&amp;pg=PA370|quote=induction compass|title=Modern dictionary of electronics|isbn=978-0-7506-9866-5|author1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[compass]] that determines directions using the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]], with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] acting as the [[Electromagnetic induction|induction field]] for an [[electric generator]].&lt;ref name="aero-digest"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsborough|first=Brice|date=June 1927|title=The Earth inductor compass|url=http://eaavintage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2005-Vol.-33-No.-04-The-Earth-Inductor-Compass.pdf|journal=Aero Digest|publisher=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electrical output of the generator will vary depending on its orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. This variation in the generated voltage is measured, allowing the Earth inductor compass to determine direction.

==History==
The earth inductor compass was first patented by Donald M. Bliss in 1912 and further refined in the 1920s by [[Paul R. Heyl]] and [[Lyman James Briggs]] of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|United States National Bureau of Standards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyl, P. R.|author2=Briggs, L. J.|title=The earth inductor compass|journal=Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.|volume=61|pages=15–32|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1924 by [[Morris Titterington]] at the [[Pioneer Instrument Company]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Heyl and Briggs were awarded the [[Magellanic Premium|Magellan Medal]] of the [[American Philosophical Society]] for this work in 1922. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the [[magnetic compass]], the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earth Inductor Compass|publisher=Wings Publishing|url=http://www.oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110083240/http://oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm|archivedate=2011-01-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in the [[Douglas World Cruiser]]s in 1924 during the [[First aerial circumnavigation|Around-the-World flight]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; [[Charles Lindbergh]] used the compass on his [[transatlantic flight]] in the [[Spirit of St. Louis]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=Charles A|title=The Spirit of St Louis|year=1953|publisher=Poolbeg Press|isbn=1-85371-912-9|pages=153, 194}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the transatlantic leg of his voyage - a distance of about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} - he was able to navigate with a cumulative error of about {{convert|10|mi|km}} in landfall, or less than one percent of the distance travelled, by computing his position at hourly intervals by dead reckoning with the induction compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=Charles A|title=The Spirit of St Louis|year=1953|publisher=Poolbeg Press|isbn=1-85371-912-9|pages=153, 194}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Bliss' original design consisted of two [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]s spinning on a single vertical axle.  One armature was connected to [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]s that were 90 degrees offset from the commutators connected to the other armature.  When one set of commutators is aligned with the earth's magnetic field no current is produced, but an offset angle creates a positive or negative current in proportion to the sine of the offset angle.  Since the sine of the angle peaks at 90 degrees, a reading could indicate either a certain direction or the exact opposite direction.  The solution to this was a second armature with commutators offset by 90 degrees to help distinguish the two opposite directions.

The direction of travel was read by comparing the indications on two independent [[galvanometer]]s, one for each armature.  The galvanometers had to be calibrated with the correct headings, since the voltage was proportional to the sine of the angle.  Readings could be impacted by the armature's speed of rotation and by stray magnetic fields.

Later versions simplified readings to show the offset from the intended heading, rather than the full range of compass directions.  The revised design allowed the user to rotate the commutators in such a way that zero current would be produced when the craft was traveling in the intended direction.  A single galvanometer was then used to show if the pilot was steering too far to the left or to the right.

Lindberg's compass used an [[anemometer]] to spin the armature through a [[universal joint]].  The armature was mounted on gimbals to prevent it from tilting with the airplane's pitch and roll.  Tilting the armature could have changed the angle of the Earth's flux to the armature, resulting in erroneous readings.  The [[gyroscopic effect]] of the spinning armature also helped to keep it properly aligned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10848">'''Ecological civilization''' is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society. It implies that the changes required in response to global [[climate change|climate disruption]] and social injustices are so extensive as to represent another form of human civilization, one based on [[ecological]] principles. Broadly construed, ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic, educational, political, agricultural, and other societal reforms toward [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"&gt;Zhihe Wang, Huili He, and Meijun Fan, [http://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ "The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation"], last modified 2014, ''[[Monthly Review]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although the term was first coined in the 1980s, it did not see widespread use until 2007, when “ecological civilization” became an explicit goal of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).&lt;ref name="newblueprint"&gt;Zhang Chun, [http://thediplomat.com/2015/09/chinas-new-blueprint-for-an-ecological-civilization/ "China's New Blueprint for an 'Ecological Civilization'"], last modified September 30, 2015, ''[[The Diplomat]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"&gt;James Oswald, [http://asaa.asn.au/china-turns-to-ecology-in-search-of-civilisation/ "China turns to ecology in search of ‘civilisation’"], last modified August 3, 2016, ''Asian Studies Association of Australia'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]] and the [[International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization]] founded a sub-committee on ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="unep"&gt;Zhu Guangyao, [http://web.unep.org/ourplanet/march-2016/articles/ecological-civilization/ "Ecological Civilization: A national strategy for innovative, concerted, green, open and inclusive development"], last modified March 2016, ''[[United Nations Environment Programme]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes, "We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Francis |first1=Pope |title=Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home |page=Ch 4, #139}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long-term and systemic in orientation.&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

==History==

In 1984, former [[Soviet Union]] environment experts proposed the term “Ecological Culture” (экологической культуры) in an article entitled “Ways of Fostering Ecological Culture in Individuals under the Conditions of Mature Socialism" which was published in ''Scientific Communism'', Moscow, vol. 2.&lt;ref name="ecoculture"&gt;Липицкий, В. С., "Пути формирования экологической культуры личности в условиях зрелого социализма," Вестн. Моск. ун-та. Сер. 12, ''Теория научного коммунизма'' 2 1984: p43.&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of this article was published in the Chinese newspaper the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]], where the notion of ecological culture was translated into Chinese as 生态文明 (shēngtài wénmíng), or ecological civilization.&lt;ref name="ecocivguang"&gt;张擅, [http://www.cqvip.com/read/read.aspx?id=49988300 “在成熟社会主义条件下培养个人生态文明的途径,”] ''光明日报'', 18th February 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China, and was first used by [[Ye Qianji]] (1909–2017), an [[agricultural economist]], in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/2017-03/01/c_1120547146.htm 中国生态农业奠基人108岁叶谦吉教授在重庆仙逝]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barbarity"&gt;Arran Gare, [https://philpapers.org/archive/GARBCA.pdf], in ''Chromatikon V: Yearbook of Philosophy in Process'', ed. [[Michel Weber]] and Ronny Desmet (Louvain-la-Neuve: [[Presses universitaires de Louvain]], 2009): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the [[ecology|ecological sciences]] and [[environmental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="chinagoverning"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the phrase “ecological civilization” was used as a technical term in an English-language book was in 1995.&lt;ref name="chinagoverning2"&gt;Jiahua Pan, ''China's Environmental Governing and Ecological Civilization'' (Heidelberg: [[Springer-Verlag]] GmbH, 2016), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Morrison, an environmentalist, coined the phrase in his book ''Ecological Democracy'', writing that “An ecological civilization is based on diverse lifeways sustaining linked natural and social ecologies.”&lt;ref name="ecologicaldemocracy"&gt;Roy Morrison, ''Ecological Democracy'' (Boston: [[South End Press]], 1995), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in 2007.&lt;ref name="newblueprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinaturnstoecology"/&gt; In 2012, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution, and it also featured in its [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plan]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;[[John B. Fullerton]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fullerton/china-ecological-civiliza_b_6786892.html "China: Ecological Civilization Rising?"], last modified May 2, 2015, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese context, the term generally presupposes the framework of a “constructive postmodernism,” as opposed to an extension of [[modernist]] practices or a “[[Postmodernism#Deconstruction|deconstructive postmodernism]],” which stems from the deconstruction of [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt;

Both “ecological civilization” and “constructive postmodernism” have been associated with the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], a process philosopher and professor at [[Claremont School of Theology]], first used the term “constructive postmodernism” in his 1989 book, ''Varieties of Postmodern Theology''.&lt;ref name="cobb"&gt;[[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2220 "Constructive Postmodernism"], 2002, ''Religion Online'', accessed November 1, 2016. See [[David Ray Griffin]], William A. Beardslee, and Joe Holland, ''Varieties of Postmodern Theology'' (Albany, [[State University of New York Press]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest international conference held on the theme “ecological civilization” (''[https://www.ctr4process.org/whitehead2015/ Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization]'') took place at [[Pomona College]] in June 2015, bringing together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an “organic” form of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="ecocivdebate"/&gt; “Organic Marxism” was first used by [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr in their 2014 book, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe''.&lt;ref name="organicmarxism"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/01/c_135326965.htm "Spotlight: Organic Marxism, China's ecological civilization drive in spotlight at int'l conference"], last modified May 1, 2016, ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', accessed November 1, 2016. See [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'' (Claremont: Process Century Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which was translated into Chinese and published by the People’s Press in 2015, describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global [[ecological movement]].&lt;ref name="chineseorganicmarxism"&gt;[[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and Justin Heinzekehr, ''Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe'', trans. Xian Meng, Guifeng Yu, and Lixia Zhang (Beijing: The People's Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

A defence of ecological civilization as the ultimate goal of humanity, has been mounted by Arran Gare in
''The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future'', &lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/The-Philosophical-Foundations-of-Ecological-Civilization-A-manifesto-for/Gare/p/book/9781138685765&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 2016.

'''Galveston''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|l|v|ᵻ|s|t|ən}} {{respell|GAL|vis|tən}}) is a [[Gulf Coast of the United States|coastal]] [[resort town|resort city]] and [[port]] off the southeast coast on [[Galveston Island]] and [[Pelican Island (Texas)|Pelican Island]] in the [[U.S. state|American State]] of [[Texas]]. The community of {{convert|209.3|sqmi}}, with an estimated population of 50,180 in 2015, is the [[county seat]] of surrounding [[Galveston County]] and second-largest municipality in the county. It is also within the [[Greater Houston|Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land]] metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Galveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the [[18th century]]: [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez]] (1746-1786), who was born in [[Macharaviaya]], [[Málaga]], in the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Galveston's first [[Europe|European]] settlements on the [[Galveston Island]] were built around 1816 by [[Kingdom of France|French]] pirate [[Louis-Michel Aury]] to help the fledgling [[Republic of Mexico]] fight for independence from Spain, along with other colonies in the  [[Western Hemisphere]] of the [[Americas]] in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in the 1810s and 1820s. The [[Port of Galveston]] was established in 1825 by the [[Congress of Mexico]] following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledging [[Texas Navy]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the now independent  [[Republic of Texas]].

During the [[19th century]], Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest [[port]]s in the [[United States]]. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the "Queen City of the Gulf". It was devastated by the unexpected surprising [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which almost completely destroyed and wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed [[barrier island]] is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] of 1919-1933 as a leading tourist hub and a [[Free State of Galveston|center of illegal gambling]] nicknamed the [[Free State of Galveston]] until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.

Much of Galveston's economy is centered in the [[tourism]], [[health care]], [[shipping]], and [[finance|financial]] industries. The {{convert|84|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six [[historic districts]] containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of [[19th-century]] buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], maintained by the [[National Park Service]] in the [[United States Department of the Interior]].

In 1839, the City of Galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the Congress of the [[Republic of Texas]].&lt;ref name="ISSTORM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HTOGAL"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Galveston Island | work = Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | accessdate = October 3, 2009 | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rrg02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was by then a burgeoning [[port of entry]] and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of German immigrants to Texas, including Jewish merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/galveston.html "Galveston, Texas"], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities''&lt;/ref&gt; Together with ethnic Mexican residents, these groups tended to oppose slavery, support the Union during the Civil War, and join the Republican Party after the war.

During this expansion, the city had many "firsts" in the state, with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions: post office (1836), naval base (1836), Texas chapter of a [[Freemasons|Masonic]] order (1840); cotton compress (1842), Catholic [[parochial school]] (Ursuline Academy) (1847), insurance company (1854), and gas lights (1856).&lt;ref name="ISSTORM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrington, Carol; Kearney, Sydney 2006 241"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Day Trips from Houston: Getaway Ideas for the Local Traveler | page=241 |author1=Barrington, Carol |author2=Kearney, Sydney | year=2006 | publisher=Globe Pequot | url=https://books.google.com/?id=euz4fbCDlLYC | isbn=0-7627-3867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces under [[Major General]] [[John B.

[[File:Beach hotel galveston.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beach Hotel (Galveston)|The Beach Hotel]] catered to vacationers until a fire in 1898.]]

The city's progress continued through the [[Reconstruction era]] with numerous "firsts": construction of the opera house (1870), and orphanage (1876), and installation of telephone lines (1878) and electric lights (1883).&lt;ref name="ISSTORM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrington, Carol; Kearney, Sydney 2006 241"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=History: Galveston's Colorful Past |work=Galveston Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |url=http://www.galvestonchamber.com/custom2.asp?pageid=198 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608021021/http://www.galvestonchamber.com/custom2.asp?pageid=198 |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The History of Galveston | work = Wyndham Hotels | accessdate = October 3, 2009| url = http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/GLSHG/historyofgalveston/main.wnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having attracted [[freedmen]] from rural areas, in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 3,000,&lt;ref&gt;Hales (2003), ''Southern Family in White and Black'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; made up mostly of former slaves but also by persons who were [[free people of color|free men of color]] and educated before the war.

During the post-Civil-War period, leaders such as George T. Ruby and [[Norris Wright Cuney]], who headed the [[Texas Republican Party]] and promoted [[civil rights]] for [[freedmen]], helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pitre, Merline | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fcu20 | title=Cuney, Norris Wright |work= Handbook of Texas |publisher= Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Black Unionism in the Industrial South | author=Obadele-Starks, Ernest |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press | year=2001 | pages=39–44 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=4BvbD7rusAAC | isbn=0-89096-912-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during Reconstruction; the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A Southern Family in White &amp; Black: The Cuneys of Texas | author=Hales, Douglas | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press | year=2003 | pages= 15–16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtaZVBagK7sC | isbn= 1-58544-200-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the city of Galveston had a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of [[Galveston Bay]] along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas. It was one of the nation's largest cotton ports, in competition with [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Galveston Wharves

For a time, the Strand was known as the "Wall Street of the [[American South|South]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durangotexas.com/eyesontexas/TexasRegions/GulfCoast/galveston.htm|title=GULF COAST REGION:  GALVESTON TEXAS|work=durangotexas.com|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s, the government constructed [[Fort Crockett]] defenses and coastal artillery batteries in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads. In February 1897, the [[USS Texas (1892)|''USS Texas'']] (nicknamed Old Hoodoo), the first commissioned [[battleship]] of the United States Navy, visited Galveston. During the festivities, the ship's officers were presented with a $5,000 silver service, adorned with various Texas motifs, as a gift from the state's citizens.

===Hurricane of 1900 and recovery===
{{Further|Great Galveston hurricane|Open Era of Galveston}}
[[File:Galveston 1900 Storm Marker.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Memorial marker along the [[Strand Historic District]] indicating a building that survived the 1900 hurricane. ]]
On September 8, 1900, the island was struck by a devastating [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]].&lt;ref name="HTOSTORM"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Galveston Hurricane of 1900 | work = Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | author = John Edward Weems | accessdate = October 4, 2009 | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ydg02

A team of engineers including [[Henry Martyn Robert]] ([[Robert's Rules of Order]]) designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained. [[File:Sunset Route, Sea Wall, Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset Route, Seawall, Galveston, Texas (postcard, c. 1907)]]

The city developed the city commission form of [[Municipal government|city government]], known as the "[[City commission government|Galveston Plan]]", to help expedite recovery.&lt;ref name="texashandbook"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/moc01|title=''Handbook of Texas Online'', s.v. "Commission Form of City Government,"|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attempts to draw investment to the city after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by the construction of the [[Houston Ship Channel]], which brought the [[Port of Houston]] into competition with the natural harbor of the [[Port of Galveston]] for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of [[Henry Cohen (rabbi)|Rabbi Henry Cohen]] and [[Congregation B'nai Israel (Galveston, Texas)|Congregation B'nai Israel]], Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the [[Galveston Movement]] that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the [[Northeastern United States]].&lt;ref name="tshaonline.org"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Galveston Movement

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Italy|Italians]] and [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]], came to the city during this period.&lt;ref name="Hardwick, p. 13"&gt;Hardwick (2002), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.

Though the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston developed as the region's principal metropolis, Galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries. In 1905 [[William Lewis Moody, Jr.]] and [[Isaac H. Kempner]], members of two of Galveston's leading families founded the [[American National Insurance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Galveston: A History of the Island| author=Gary Cartwright|publisher=TCU Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RFRu8kYThEcC&amp;lpg=PA196|year=1998 | isbn= 0-689-11991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Moody established the City National Bank, which would become the [[Moody National Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Annual Financials report, 2004-2005 | work = The Moody Foundation | accessdate = October 3, 2009 | url = http://www.moodyf.org/downloads/annual-financials-2004-5.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090529203656/http://www.moodyf.org/downloads/annual-financials-2004-5.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = May 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anico.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title=American National Announces Fourth Quarter 2007 Results |work=American National Insurance Company |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |url=http://www.anico.com/Investor%20Relations/pdfs/ANICO4Q2007Earnings.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001040955/http://www.anico.com/Investor%20Relations/pdfs/ANICO4Q2007Earnings.pdf |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Galveston Hotel - Hotel Galvez to Reopen October 15 | work = Bloomberg.com | accessdate = September 26, 2009 | date = October 8, 2008 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;refer=conews&amp;tkr=WYN%3AUS&amp;sid=aH1GgvGGU1vs | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025225909/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;refer=conews&amp;tkr=WYN:US&amp;sid=aH1GgvGGU1vs | archivedate = October 25, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Preserve America Community: Galveston, Texas| accessdate = September 26, 2009| url = http://www.preserveamerica.gov/PAcommunity-GalvestonTX.html

Combined with prostitution, which had existed in the city since the Civil War, Galveston became known as the "sin city" of the Gulf.&lt;ref name="hotgalv"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Galveston, TX

The 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the Island City. During World War II, the Galveston Municipal Airport, predecessor to [[Scholes International Airport]], was re-designated a U.S. [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] base and named "Galveston Army Air Field". In January 1943, Galveston Army Air Field was officially activated with the [[46th Test Wing|46th Bombardment Group]] serving an [[anti-submarine]] role in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1942, William Lewis Moody, Jr., along with his wife Libbie Shearn Rice Moody, established the [[Moody Foundation]], to benefit "present and future generations of Texans." The foundation, one of the largest in the United States, would play a prominent role in Galveston during later decades, helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas, Moody Foundation"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Moody Foundation | work = Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | author = Robert E.

===Post–World War II===
The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Lone Star Lawmen | author=Utley Robert Marshall | publisher=Oxford | year=2007 | page=218 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=G4hjclRksjQC | isbn=978-0-19-515444-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 1957, Texas [[Attorney General]] [[Will Wilson]] and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Attorney General |work=Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association |author=James G.

[[File:Galveston (Texas).jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Galveston as viewed from the air]]

The island's economy began a long stagnation. Many businesses relocated off the island during this period; however, health care, insurance and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy. By 1959, the city of Houston had long out-paced Galveston in population and economic growth. Beginning in 1957, the Galveston Historical Foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Energy metropolis: an environmental history of Houston and the Gulf Coast |author1=Melosi, Martin V. |author2=Pratt, Joseph A. | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press | year=2007 | page=202 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KtpwM38sPj0C | isbn=0-8229-4335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 book ''The Galveston That Was'' helped encourage the preservation movement. Restoration efforts financed by motivated investors, notably Houston businessman [[George P. Mitchell]], gradually developed the [[Strand Historic District]] and reinvented other areas. A new, family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years.

With the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in Galveston. Already home to the University of Texas Medical Branch, the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the Texas Maritime Academy, predecessor of [[Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston]]; and by 1967 a [[community college]], [[Galveston College]], had been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The History of Galveston College |work=Galveston College |accessdate=October 4, 2009 |url=http://www.gc.edu/gc/GC_History.asp?SnID=1413310913 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921222800/http://www.gc.edu/gc/GC_History.asp?SnID=1413310913 |archivedate=September 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite web |title=Students brave the simulated seas |work=The Galveston County Daily News |author=Rhiannon Myers |date=November 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=9751907adb742ca7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928061037/http://galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=9751907adb742ca7 |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricane Ike]] made landfall on Galveston Island in the early morning of September 13, 2008 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110&amp;nbsp;miles per hour.

After the storm, the island was rebuilt with investments in tourism, shipping, and continued emphasis on higher education and health care. Notably the addition of the [[Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier]] and the replacement of the [[Bascule bridge|bascule]]-type [[Drawbridge (American English)|drawbridge]] on the railroad causeway with a [[Vertical-lift bridge|vertical-lift]]-type drawbridge to allow heavier freight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2013/04/26/galveston-still-healing-5-years-after-hurricane-ik/|title=Galveston Still Healing 5 Years After Hurricane Ike|work=The Texas Tribune|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Jervis | first=Rick | title=After rebuilding from Hurricane Ike, Galveston deals with oil spill | website=USA TODAY | date=March 25, 2014 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/25/galveston-oil-spill-ike/6884693/ | accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Galveston is situated on Galveston Island, a [[barrier island]] off the [[Texas]] Gulf coast near the mainland coast. Made up of mostly sand-sized particles and smaller amounts of finer mud sediments and larger gravel-sized sediments, the island is unstable, affected by water and weather, and can shift its boundaries through erosion.

The city is about {{convert|45|mi}} southeast of downtown Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Rock Sediment and Soil Facts, Galveston Island | work = Geologic Wonders of Texas, University of Texas | accessdate = October 3, 2009 | url = http://www.beg.utexas.edu/UTopia/coastal/coastal_rock.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is oriented generally northeast-southwest, with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the east and south, West Bay on the west, and [[Galveston Bay]] on the north. The island's main access point from the mainland is the [[Interstate 45|Interstate Highway 45]] causeway that crosses West Bay on the island's northeast side.

A deepwater channel connects Galveston's harbor with the Gulf and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

In 2011 [[Rice University]] released a study, ''"Atlas of Sustainable Strategies for Galveston Island,"'' which argued the West End of Galveston was quickly eroding and the City should reduce construction and/or population in that area. It recommended against any rebuilding of the West End in the event of damage from another hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Harvey.

===Historic districts===
[[File:Trube Castle, Galveston.jpg|thumb|right|Galveston contains many restored Victorian homes]]
Galveston is home to six historic districts with over 60 structures listed representing architectural significance in the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="NATLREG"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Texas (TX), Galveston County | work = National Register of Historical Places | accessdate = October 3, 2009 | url = http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/TX/Galveston/districts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Stocking National Historic District, between Broadway and [[Seawall Boulevard]] and bounded by Ave. K, 23rd St., Ave. P, and 26th St., contains a collection of historic homes constructed from the Civil War through World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Silk Stocking National Historic District |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |url=http://silkstockinggalveston.org/aboutsshd.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230140541/http://silkstockinggalveston.org/aboutsshd.html |archivedate=December 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East End Historic District (Galveston, Texas)|East End Historic District]] on both sides of Broadway and Market Streets, contains 463 buildings.

The [[Strand National Historic Landmark District]] is a [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark District]] of mainly [[Victorian era]] buildings that have been adapted for use as restaurants, antique stores, historical exhibits, museums and art galleries. The area is a major [[tourist attraction]] for the island city. It is the center for two very popular seasonal [[festival]]s. It is widely considered the island's shopping and entertainment center. Today, "the Strand" is generally used to refer to the five-block business district between 20th and 25th streets in downtown Galveston, near the city's wharf.

===Oleander City===
[[File:FirstoleanderPlantinggALV.jpg|thumb|The first Oleander in Galveston, planted in 1841]]
Since the early 20th century, Galveston has been popularly known as the 'Oleander City'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.guidrynews.com/story.aspx?id=1000034503 | title=Oleanders...a must in Brenda's Garden!| publisher=guidrynews.com | date=2011-05-01 | access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of a long history of cultivating [[Nerium oleander]], a [[subtropical]] evergreen shrub which thrives on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wintertexansonline.com/galveston_s_oleander_festival.htm | title=Galveston's Oleander Festival | publisher=WinterTexans Online | access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oleanders are a defining feature of the city; when flowering (between April and October) they add masses of color to local gardens, parks, and streets. Thousands were planted in the recovery following the Hurricane of 1900 and Galvestonians continue to treasure the plant for its' low water needs, tolerance of heat, salt spray and sandy soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://oleander.org/oleander-history/ | title=Handbook on Oleanders| author=Richard &amp; Mary Ellen Eggenberger | year=1996 | access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them especially resistant to the after-effects of hurricanes and tropical storms. Galveston is reputed to have the most diverse range of Oleander cultivars in the world, numbering over 100, with many varieties developed in the city and named after prominent Galvestonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://theislandermagazine.com/?p=2611 | title=International Oleander Society | author=Shannon Rowan | publisher=The Islander Magazine | access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the month of May was declared "Oleander Month" by the City of Galveston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.texashighways.com/the-magazine/item/1614-oleander-festival | title=Oleander Festival | publisher=Texas Highways Magazine | date=2012-07-13| access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also Oleander-themed tours of the city exploring the history of the plant on the island. Since 1967 the International Oleander Society has operated in Galveston, which promotes the cultivation of the plant, organizes an Oleander festival every spring and maintains a commemorative Oleander garden in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://oleander.org/ | title=International Oleander Society | publisher=International Oleander Society | access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oleander-garden-park | title=Oleander Garden Park| publisher=Atlasobscura.com | access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricane]]s are an ever-present threat during the summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area.

The port is located on the Gulf [[Intracoastal Waterway]], on the north side of Galveston Island, with some facilities on [[Pelican Island (Texas)|Pelican Island]]. The port has facilities to handle all types of cargo including [[containerization|containers]], dry and liquid bulk, [[Break bulk cargo|breakbulk]], [[Roll-on/roll-off]], refrigerated cargo and project cargoes.

The port also serves as a passenger cruise ship terminal for cruise ships operating in the Caribbean. The terminal was [[home port]] to two [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] vessels, the ''[[Carnival Conquest]]'' and the ''[[Carnival Ecstasy]]''. In November 2011 the company made Galveston [[home port]] to its 3,960-passenger mega-ships ''[[Carnival Magic]]'' and ''[[Carnival Triumph]],'' as well. In 2015, ''[[Carnival Freedom]]'' relocated to Galveston, sailing seven-day cruises. Carnival replaced ''Carnival Magic'' and ''Carnival Triumph'' in the first half of 2016 with ''[[Carnival Breeze]]'' and ''[[Carnival Liberty]]'', respectively, but replaced ''Liberty'' with ''[[Carnival Valor]]'' later in the year due to mechanical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/cruiselog/2015/02/16/carnival-cruise-texas-breeze/23488831/|title=Carnival's newest ship to be based in Texas|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/florida-cruise-guide/os-carnival-magic-port-canaveral-april-2016-20150616-story.html|title=Carnival Magic coming to Port Canaveral sooner than expected|last=Tribou|first=Richard|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.galvnews.com/news/free/article_bcb61fba-8168-5044-9330-44e0a4a6099c.html|title=Carnival to shorten Liberty cruises, replace ship with Valor|last=News|first=LAURA ELDER The Daily|work=The Daily News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carnival Breeze'' and ''Carnival Freedom'' sail seven-day Caribbean cruises, and ''Carnival Valor'' sails four- and five-day Caribbean cruises from Galveston.

Galveston is a popular tourist destination which in 2007 brought $808 million to the local economy and attracted 5.4 million visitors. The city features an array of lodging options, including hotels such as the historic [[Hotel Galvez]] and Tremont House, vintage bed and breakfast inns, beachfront condominiums, and resort rentals. The city's tourist attractions include the [[Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier]], Galveston [[Schlitterbahn]] waterpark, [[Moody Gardens]] botanical park, the [[Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig &amp; Museum]], the [[Lone Star Flight Museum]], [[Galveston Railroad Museum]], a downtown neighborhood of historic buildings known as [[Strand National Historic Landmark District|The Strand]], many historical museums and mansions, and miles of beach front from the East End's Porretto Beach, Stewart Beach to the West End pocket parks. Previously Galveston had a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} aquarium theme park called [[Sea-Arama Marineworld]], which opened in 1965, closed in January 1990, and was demolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hlavaty, Craig|url=https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/galveston/article/Sea-Arama-in-Galveston-was-an-island-attraction-13063170.php|title=Sea-Arama in Galveston was an island attraction for decades|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date=2018-07-10|accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts and culture ==
=== Galveston Arts Center ===
Incorporated in 1986, Galveston Arts Center (GAC) is a non-profit, non-collecting arts organization. The center exhibits contemporary art, often by Texas-based artists, and offers educational and outreach programs. Notably, GAC organizes and produces Galveston ArtWalk. Museum entry is free to the public, although cash donations are welcomed. Tiered membership options and a range of volunteer opportunities are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galvestonartscenter.org|title=Galveston Art Center|work=galvestonartscenter.org|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Galveston Arts Center will celebrate relocation to its original home, the historic 1878 First National Bank Building on the Strand. This Italianate-style 1900 Storm survivor was extensively damaged during Hurricane Ike in 2008. Fortunately, just weeks before Ike made landfall, scaffolding was installed to support the entire structural load of the building for repairs, likely preventing collapse under heavy winds and storm surge. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, restoration is nearing completion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidrynews.com/08November/31908GAC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galveston ArtWalk ===
ArtWalk takes place approximately every six weeks on Saturday evenings throughout the year. ArtWalk is organized by [[Galveston Arts Center]], which releases an ArtWalk brochure featuring a map of participating venues as well as descriptions of shows and exhibits. Venues include GAC, [[Galveston Artist Residency]] and artist’s studios and galleries. Additionally, art is shown in “other walls”—for example [[MOD Coffeehouse]] or Mosquito Cafe—or outdoors at Art Market on Market Street. Musicians perform outdoors and at venues such as the Proletariat Gallery &amp; Public House or [[Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe]]. While most ArtWalk events are concentrated downtown, there are a number or participants elsewhere on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galvestonartscenter.org/artwalk.php|title=Galveston Art Center|work=galvestonartscenter.org|accessdate=September 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926120239/http://www.galvestonartscenter.org/artwalk.php|archive-date=September 26, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artist Residency &amp; Artist Housing ===

==== Galveston Artist Residency ====

Galveston Artist Residency (GAR) grants studio space, living space and a stipend to three visual artists each year. Resident artists work in a variety of mediums and exhibit their work in the GAR Gallery and Courtyards. Located in renovated industrial structures on the west side of downtown, GAR also hosts performances and other public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galvestonartistresidency.org/about#|title=Galveston Artist Residency|work=galvestonartistresidency.org|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Hotel Artist Lofts (NHAL) is an Artspace-developed property featuring twenty-seven live/work units designated as affordable housing for artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artspace.org/our-places/national-hotel-artist-lofts|title=National Hotel Artist Lofts|work=Artspace|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project brought new life to the historic E.S. Levy Building, which was left abandoned for twenty years. Originally built as the Tremont Opera House in 1870, the structure was extensively renovated to serve various functions, from offices and stores to the National Hotel. The building also housed the U.S. National Weather Bureau's Galveston office under Isaac Cline during the 1900 Storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgaia.com/images/Artspace/|title=ES LEvy Home pg|work=mgaia.com|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Property Manager/Creative Director Becky Major, the unused retail space in the front of the building found a new purpose as a DIY art and music venue, despite its gutted and undeveloped state. In May 2015, the newly renovated space reopened as the Proletariat Gallery &amp; Public House. This bar and gallery provides a common area for NHAL and neighborhood residents and a cultural hub for the broader community.  Visual art, events and live music are regularly hosted in the space.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Galveston's city council serves as the city's legislative branch, while the city manager works as the chief executive officer, and the municipal court system serves as the city's judicial branch. The city council and mayor promote ordinances to establish municipal policies. The Galveston City Council consists of six elected positions, each derived from a specified [[electoral district]]. Each city council member is elected to a two-year term, while the mayor is elected to a two-year term. The city council appoints the city manager, the city secretary, the city auditor, the city attorney, and the municipal judge. The city's Tax Collector is determined by the city council and is outsourced to Galveston County. The city manager hires employees, promotes development, presents and administers the budget, and implements city council policies. [[Joe Jaworski]] is mayor, having replaced term-limited [[Lyda Ann Thomas]] May 2010. Jaworski is also the grandson of [[Leon Jaworski]], United States [[Special Prosecutor]] during the [[Watergate Scandal]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=MAYOR10&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/156595/ |work=Galveston Daily News |title=Jaworski replaces a tearful Thomas as mayor |author=Meyers, Rhiannon |accessdate=May 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517034013/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/156595 |archivedate=May 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare===
Galveston is the home of several of the largest [[teaching hospitals]] in the state, located on the campus of the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] at Galveston. Prior to Hurricane Ike, the University employed more than 12,000 people. Its significant growth in the 1970s and 1980s was attributable to a uniquely qualified management and medical faculty including: Mr. John Thompson; Dr. William James McGanity, Dr. William Levin, Dr. David Daeschner and many more.

Ike severely damaged the 550-bed [[John Sealy Hospital]] causing the [[University of Texas System]] [[Board of Regents]] to cut nearly one-third of the hospital staff. Since the storm, the regents have committed to spending $713 million to restore the campus, construct new medical towers, and return John Sealy Hospital to its 550-bed pre-storm capacity.&lt;ref name="UTMB coming back stronger than ever"&gt;{{Cite web| title = UTMB coming back stronger from Ike | work = Houston Chronicle | author = Harvey Rice | date = September 16, 2009 | accessdate = October 4, 2009| url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/news/specials/hurricane/6622630.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the UT Board of Regents approved the construction of a new 13 story hospital that will be located next to John Sealy Hospital. Construction will begin in the fall of 2011, with the demolition of the old Jennie Sealy and Shriners hospitals, and continue until completion in 2016. The facility will have 250 room, 20 operating suites and 54 intensive care beds. When the new hospital is complete, along with the renovations at John Sealy, both complexes will have around 600 beds.&lt;ref name="UTMB gets OK to build new island hospital"&gt;{{Cite web| title = UTMB gets OK to build new island hospital| work = The Daily News| author = John DeLapp| date = August 26, 2011| accessdate = September 18, 2011| url = http://galvestondailynews.com/story/253098| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829163529/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/253098| archivedate = August 29, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scholes International Airport at Galveston]] {{airport codes|GLS|KGLS}} is a two-runway airport in Galveston; the airport is primarily used for general aviation, offshore energy transportation, and some limited military operations. The nearest commercial airline service for the city is operated out of Houston through [[William P. Hobby Airport]] and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]]. The [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] has two heliports, one for Ewing Hall and one for its emergency room.

====Railroad====
The [[Galveston Railroad|Galveston Railway]], originally established and named in 1854 as the Galveston Wharf and Cotton Press Company, is a [[Class III railroad|Class III]] terminal switching railroad that primarily serves the transportation of cargo to and from the Port of Galveston.

The Galveston Railroad today owned Rail Link Inc. interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad Company and BNSF Railway Company on Galveston Island. The two class one Railroads reach Galveston by way of a new vertical lift railroad causeway bridge that crosses Galveston Bay next to the Interstate-45 bridge.

====Roads====
John D. Groesbeck surveyed and mapped the town in 1837 and 1838 on behalf of the Galveston City Company. A new Galveston resident most recently from New York City, he laid out the streets based on a gridiron, and named the east–west avenues according to letters of the alphabet, with Avenue A running along the back bay on the north side of the island. He assigned numbers to names of north–south streets, with First Street on the far eastern side of the grid, and the numbered street names increased as they progressed westward. The names of some of the avenues changed over the years. Most notably, Avenue B became known as The Strand, and Avenue J became known as Broadway, a major thoroughfare which runs from the Interstate-45 viaduct to Seawall Boulevard.&lt;ref name=mccomb&gt;{{cite book|title=Galveston: A History|author=David G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9873">The '''geology of [[Morocco]]''' formed beginning up to two billion years ago, in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] and potentially even earlier. It was affected by the [[Pan-African orogeny]], although the later [[Hercynian orogeny]] produced fewer changes and left the Maseta Domain, a large area of remnant [[Paleozoic]] massifs. During the Paleozoic, extensive sedimentary deposits preserved marine fossils. Throughout the [[Mesozoic]], the rifting apart of [[Pangaea]] to form the Atlantic Ocean created basins and fault blocks, which were blanketed in terrestrial and marine sediments—particularly as a major [[marine transgression]] flooded much of the region. In the [[Cenozoic]], a microcontinent covered in sedimentary rocks from the [[Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] collided with northern Morocco, forming the Rif region. Morocco has extensive phosphate and salt reserves, as well as resources such as lead, zinc, copper and silver. 

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest rocks in Morocco are the Jbel Ouiharem [[augen]] [[gneiss]] and Oued Assemlil gneiss. The augen gneisses and metadolerite of the [[Zenaga Series]] experienced composite foliation, likely related to an ancient orogeny. The Zenaga Series is intruded by [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[granitoids]], giving a young age constraint within the [[Precambrian]]. Granites from the [[Anti-Atlas Mountains]] yielded similar ages. 

North of Kerdous, the [[Quartzite Series]] formed thick [[quartzite]] layers, along with [[siltstone]],  [[pelite]] [[sandstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] in the [[Neoproterozoic]], with intercalated [[stromatolite]] [[limestones]]. Sills and [[laccoliths]] of [[dolerite]] and a [[gabbro]] [[tholeiitic magma series]] intruded the Quartzite Series along sedimentary bedding. 

Morocco was affected by the [[Pan-African orogeny]], which produced the [[Ouarzazate Series]] [[molasse]] deposit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
The [[Adoudounian Series]] overlies the Ouarzazate and marks the start of the [[Cambrian]], formed in parallel with the rapid expansion of multicellular life. The base of series is [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], followed by [[marl]], sandstones and additional carbonate sequences. The Amouslek Formation, within the Adounian Series is made up of [[shale]] and limestone and is laden with [[trilobite]] and [[archaeocyathid]] fossils, from an [[Early Cambrian]] shallow marine environment. The Goulimine Quartzitic Series from the [[Middle Cambrian]] also contains trilobites, although the [[Late Cambrian]] is not exposed. 

Sandstones, micaceous clays and some limestones form [[Ordovician]] strata overly the Cambrian, containing trilobite and [[graptolite]] fossils. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=175}} The [[Late Ordovician]] and the start of the [[Silurian]] is marked by a glaciation, recorded in [[tillite]]. Silurian strata is common in the central Anti-Atlas, represented by sandstones, shales and dark mudstones that sometimes contain carbonate nodules. Black shales in the eastern Anti-Atlas host some graptolites, [[lamellibranch]] and [[nautiloid]] fossils. 
[[Devonian]] mudstones with limestone beds unconformably overly the [[Late Silurian]] in the western Anti-Atlas, with brachiopod, [[conodont]] and [[tentaculite]] fossils, while [[basalts]] are found in the east. [[Carboniferous]] form the northern edge of the Tindouf Basin and [[cuesta]] hills in the Draa plains. Condensed limestone, with [[cephalopod]] fossils from the period, was uplifted as platforms in the central and eastern Anti-Atlas. 

The Anti-Atlas did not experience significant tectonic changes during the [[Hercynian orogeny]], as [[Euramerica]] and [[Gondwana]] collided to form the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. The mountains have very little, if any metamorphism, from the time and no Hercynian granites. 

The [[Meseta Domain]], taking its name from Spain's Meseta Central inner plateau is an area of stable [[Paleozoic]] rock that was never affected by the Hercynian orogeny and was later covered by [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] sedimentary rocks. Forming Morocco's Central Massif, the Meseta Domain completely conceals Precambrian rocks, although boreholes have found Neoproterozoic rocks in a Meseta [[anticline]]. The domain is split in two by the Middle Atlas fold belt. The Western Meseta has relatively little sedimentary cover and well-developed massifs, while the Eastern Meseta spanning the border with Algeria has numerous, small Paleozoic massifs. 
Continuing from the Neoproterozoic until the [[Middle Devonian]], western Morocco and the Anti-Atlas had the same depositional environment—molasse [[redbed]] deposition and post-orogeny volcanism. Southern Morocco was flooded by a massive shallow marine shelf, building up significant carbonates, mixed with continental sediments pouring in from inland areas now in the Sahara. In the [[Late Devonian]], western Morocco and the Anti-Atlas split up into fault-bounded basins, which deformed during the Hercynian orogeny. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=176-177}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
The Western High Atlas preserves evidence of the formation of the Atlantic margin in North Africa. In the [[Late Triassic]], rifting in central Pangaea began to form the Atlantic Ocean. Large alluvial fans began to fill the down-dropped [[grabens]] with fluvial sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates, intercalated with evaporite sequences of [[dolomite]], [[halite]] and [[gypsum]]. A [[tholeiitic magma series]] formed [[dolerite]], capping off the Triassic sequence. Clastic sediments continued to deposit into the [[Jurassic]]. Simultaneously, in the [[Middle Jurassic]], limestone shoals formed on fault blocks and chaotic [[olistostrome]] slump deposits accumulated limestone fragments in nearby deep water.

The Rifo-Tellian Domain (also known as the Rif Domain) today extends the entire length of the [[Maghreb]] and is closely related to the [[Baetic System]] mountains in southern Spain. The sediments in the Rif Mountains deposited in the present location of Tunisia in the Triassic, as part of a microcontinent.

A large scale [[marine transgression]] in the [[Cretaceous]], timed with subsidence in the region led to the maximum extent of seas in Morocco. By the end of the Cretaceous,  a marine regression dropped sea levels in the area as the Atlas Mountains began to rise. River delta fans prograded filled in the Atlas gulf from east to west. Border faults formed, thrusting pieces of Mesozoic rock onto neighboring platforms. The uplifted sedimentary rocks in the trough began to erode into new alluvial fans, filling in marginal [[foredeep]] areas. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=177}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
The Rif microcontinent shifted westward and collided with the [[African Plate]] in the [[Oligocene]] and the [[Miocene]], generated the complex Rift overthrust. Seismic studies have found that [[Carnian]] sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates from the Triassic, lie unconformably atop the microcontinent's crystalline basement rock in north Morocco. The [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] marls and carbonates of the Doukkala sub-basin are overlain by [[Quaternary]] rocks. Further west, Quaternary rocks cover [[Middle Cretaceous]] sedimentary rocks, which lie unconformably atop Triassic and Paleozoic units. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=178}}

==Hydrogeology==
[[Quaternary]] alluvial aquifers form in river basins throughout the country. Low permeability clay and silt divided these deposits into multilayer aquifers and they typically range between five and 150 meters deep, with recharge from rainwater and Atlas Mountains runoff. The Meseta region has small, unconfined fractured igneous rock aquifers, with low permeability and low productivity. 

Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sandstone aquifers in the northern plains and around Tadla, Saïsis and Tensift range between 10 and 200 meters thick. In some places, groundwater from these sandstones is very high salinity, due to dissolved Triassic and Jurassic evaporites. A few deep karst aquifers are found beneath  the Tadla, Fes-Sais and Essaouira plains, along with the Atlas Mountains and the Anti-Atlas Mountains. These karst aquifers are almost universally high quality and produce some important springs. 

The Anti-Atlas Mountains also have high productivity fractured Cambrian karst, together with low-productivity, crystalline Precambrian basement rock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Morocco &amp; Western Sahara|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Morocco_%26_Western_Sahara_(Moroccan_Sahara)#Unconsolidated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Mining is an important part of the [[economy of Morocco]]. The country is a major exporter of phosphates and remains well positioned for [[peak phosphorus]] shortages through its occupation of [[Western Sahara]], which holds much of the world's supply. In fact, the two open pit mines at Khouribga, in Morocco itself, forms the largest phosphate mine in the world. Metal mining for lead, copper, silver and zinc resurged in the 1990s, at the Douar Hajar mine 30 kilometers south of [[Marrakech]]. El Heimer, 20 kilometers southeast of [[Oujda]] in the northeast, is the only active lead smelter in North Africa. 

A large salt deposit, related to a [[marine transgression]] in the [[Triassic]], is mined 10 kilometers east of [[Mohammedia]]. The folded and recrystallized salt is more than 98 percent pure and reaches a thickness of 80 meters. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=178}}

The '''Guiana Space Centre''' or, more commonly, '''Centre Spatial Guyanais''' ('''CSG''') is a [[France|French]] and [[European Union|European]] [[spaceport]] to the northwest of [[Kourou]] in [[French Guiana]], [[France]]. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport as it fulfills the two major geographical requirements of such a site: 
*it is near the [[equator]], so that less energy is required to maneuver a spacecraft into an equatorial, geostationary orbit, and 
*it has open sea to the east, so that lower stages of rockets and debris from launch failures are unlikely to fall on human habitations. Rockets launch to the east to take advantage of the angular momentum provided by Earth's rotation.

The [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the French space agency [[CNES]] (National Centre for Space Studies), and the commercial companies [[Arianespace]] and [[Azercosmos]] conduct launches from Kourou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/CNES_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=CNES at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/ESA_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=ESA at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/Arianespace_at_Europe_s_Spaceport |title=Arianespace at Europe's Spaceport |work=European Space Agency |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the spaceport used by the ESA to send supplies to the [[International Space Station]] using the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].

[[File:Detail site Kourou-en.svg|thumb|ELA-3 map]]
Kourou is located approximately {{convert|500|km}} north of the equator, at a latitude of 5°. It is a common misconception{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} that the main advantage of launching a rocket from the equator is the extra boost provided by the speed of the Earth's rotation. For example, the eastward boost provided by the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|1035|mph|m/s||abbr=in|order=flip}} at the Guiana Space Centre, as compared to about {{convert|908|mph|m/s||abbr=in|order=flip}} at the [[United States]] east coast [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]] spaceports which are at 28°27′N latitude in [[Florida]]. This means that rockets need around 60&amp;nbsp;m/s more [[delta-v]] to reach Low Earth Orbit (LEO) from Cape Canaveral, which is an insignificant disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/SatelliteProgrammesOverview/SP_20100427133512861?l=en|title=Satellite Programmes Overview - Launching Satellites|publisher=EUMETSAT|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="as20110801"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/34/space2.html|title=Up, Up, and Away|work=The Universe: In the Classroom|publisher=Astro Society|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, the main benefit of Kourou is that the near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]]) Earth [[Geocentric orbit|orbit]]s compared to launches from [[spaceport]]s at higher latitude. This is because rockets can be launched into orbits with an inclination of as low as ~6°.  The lowest inclination a rocket from Cape Canaveral could be launched to is 28.5° (the latitude of Cape Canaveral).  Inclination change burns already require significant amounts of delta-v, so needing to change inclination by 28.5° seriously affects a rocket's capability to send satellites into a [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO).  As a result of these phenomena, similarly sized [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]] and [[Ariane 5]] rockets can send similar payloads to LEO. However, the Proton, launched from high latitudes in Russia, can only send 6,270&amp;nbsp;kg to GTO while a Kourou-launched Ariane 5 can send more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg to GTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-5/|title=Ariane 5 - Arianespace|work=Arianespace|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilslaunch.com/launch-services/ils-proton-breeze-m-launch-vehicle|title=Commercial Launch Vehicle {{!}} ILS Proton Breeze M {{!}} International Launch Services|website=www.ilslaunch.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELV / ELA-1 / BEC===
{{Main article|ELA-1}}
Originally built in the 1960s under the name of Base Équatoriale du CECLES ({{lang-fr|Conférence Européenne de Construction de Lanceurs et d'Engins Spatiaux}}, {{lang-en|European conference on construction of launchers and spacecraft}}), the pad located at {{coord|5.236|N|52.775|W}} was designed for the [[Europa (rocket)|Europa-II rocket]]. One Europa-II was launched from the site, before the programme was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The pad was demolished, and subsequently rebuilt as the first launch complex for Ariane rockets. Renamed ''ELA'' (later redesignated ''ELA-1''), it was used for [[Ariane 1]] and [[Ariane 2 and 3]] launches until being retired in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/launchreport/padsites.html|title=Pad List - World Launch Sites|publisher=Space Launch Report|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/launchreport/padsites.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:41:21|archivedate=2009-10-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In november 2001 it was renamed ELV pad ({{lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Vega}}) and refurbished again for the [[Vega rocket]]. The first launch was performed on 13 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Vega3/Vega_liftoff |title=Vega liftoff / Vega / Launch vehicles / Launchers / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELA-2===
{{Main article|ELA-2}}
The ELA-2 pad ({{lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 2}}), located at {{coord|5.232|N|52.776|W}} had been used for [[Ariane 4]] launches until 2003.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===ELA-3===
{{Main article|ELA-3}}
ELA-3 ({{lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3}}) has been active for [[Ariane 5]] launches since 1996 (Ariane 501). This facility is located at {{coord|5.239|N|52.768|W}} and covers an area of {{convert|21|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe's spaceport|url= http://www.esa.int/esaCP/GGGMGNF3KCC_Expanding_0.html|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELA-4===
ELA-4 ({{lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 4}}) is presently under construction, intended for future [[Ariane 6]] launches. This facility is located at {{coord|5.26258|N|52.79074|W}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction update photographs|url= https://twitter.com/DutchSpace/status/830041608762556417/photo/1|publisher=DutchSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELS / Soyuz at CSG===
{{main article|Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz|Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre}}
ESA has built ELS ({{lang-fr|l'Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz&lt;!--Oui, SoyOuz in French---&gt;}}) at {{coord |5.305|N|52.834|W| }} for launching [[Russia]]n-built [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]] rockets. The first Soyuz launch from ELS was postponed several times, but launched on October 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceflightnow.com/soyuz/vs01/status.html SpaceflightNow's VS01 flight status page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514182216/http://spaceflightnow.com/soyuz/vs01/status.html |date=May 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ELS is located on the territory of [[Sinnamary]] commune, {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} from Kourou harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UKE2fVQV4EC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=luqCQaf6u9&amp;dq=Sinamary%20spaceport&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=Sinamary%20spaceport&amp;f=false |title=Space Exploration 2007 |page=138 |publisher=Springer |author=Harvey, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} north of the site used for the Ariane 5 launches. Under the terms of the Russo-European joint venture, ESA will augment its own launch vehicle fleet with Soyuz rockets—using them to launch ESA or commercial payloads—and the Russians will get access to the Kourou spaceport for launching their own payloads with Soyuz rockets. Russia will use the Guiana Space Centre in addition to [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]. The Guiana location has the significant benefit of greatly increased payload capability, owing to the near [[equator]]ial position. A Soyuz rocket with a 1.7 tonnes to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) performance from Baikonur, will increase its payload potential to 2.8 tonnes from the Guiana launch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.cnes.fr/web/4143-lensemble-de-lancement-soyuz.php Le Port Spatial de l'Europe (CNES)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930070531/http://www.cnes.fr/web/4143-lensemble-de-lancement-soyuz.php |date=September 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ELS project is being co-funded by [[Arianespace]], ESA, and the [[European Union]], with CNES being the prime contractor. The project has a projected cost of approximately €320 million, where €120 million are allocated for modernizing the Soyuz vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Europe_To_Pay_Russia_To_Build_Soyuz_Pad_At_Kourou_Russia.html|title=Europe To Pay Russia To Build Soyuz Pad At Kourou: Russia|publisher=SpaceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official opening of the launch site construction occurred on 27 February 2007. Excavation work however, had previously begun several months beforehand.

On September 13, 2010, Spaceflight Now reported that after several delays in the construction of a mobile gantry the launch pad had been finished, and the first flight of the Soyuz was expected to occur in early 2011.&lt;ref name="SFNOW-2010-09-13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Soyuz, Vega flights from French Guiana set for 2011|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1009/13soyuzvega/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2010, 18 launch contracts had been signed. Arianespace has ordered 24 launchers from Russian industry.&lt;ref name="arianespace-2010-10-11"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Arianespace hosts meeting of launch system manufacturers |url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2010/10-11-2010-launch-system-manufacturers-meeting.asp |date=11 October 2010 |location=Evry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2011, two [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|IOV-1 &amp; IOV-2]] satellites were launched using a [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-ST]] rocket, in the "first Russian Soyuz vehicle ever launched from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana."&lt;ref name=pa20111022&gt;

===Final assembly building===
Astrium assembles each Ariane 5 launcher in the Launcher Integration Building. The vehicle is then delivered to the Final Assembly Building for payload integration by Arianespace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/news/mission-up-524.html|title=Arianespace receives its fifth Ariane 5 of 2008|date=28 July 2008|publisher=Arianespace}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Final Assembly Building is located {{convert|2.8|km}} from the ELA-3 launch zone.

===Launch safety===
[[File:Ariane42P rocket.gif|thumb|[[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane IV]] launched from the Guiana Space Centre on 10 August 1992]]
Fire safety is ensured by a detachment of the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], a branch of the [[French Army]]. Security around the base is ensured by [[French Gendarmerie]] forces, assisted by the [[3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment]] of the [[French Foreign Legion]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Before and during launch windows, CSG facility security is significantly enhanced by anti-personnel and anti-aircraft measures, the exact configurations of which are classified by the French military. All entrants to the launch complex are also subject to checks for proof of permission to enter the facility.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Guiana Space Centre (as per CNES) also contains the ''[[Îles du Salut]]'', a former penal colony including the infamous [[Devil's Island]]. Now a tourist site, the islands are under the launching trajectory for [[geosynchronous orbit]] and have to be evacuated during launches.

'''Gustave Séligmann d'Eichthal''' (March 3, 1804, [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], Meurthe-et-Moselle ; April 9, 1886,&lt;ref name=genealogy&gt;{{cite web |title=Généalogies SÉLIGMANN D'EICHTHAL |url=http://www.genea-bdf.org/BasesDonnees/genealogies/seligmann_deichthal.htm |publisher=Généa |accessdate=2009-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paris)&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' cites his dates of birth and death as March 2, 1804 and April 9, 1882 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; was a French writer, [[publicist]], and [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenist]].

==Life==
At the age of thirteen he became a convert to Roman Catholicism, and when he left the [[Lycée Henri IV]] in 1822, he became a disciple of [[Auguste Comte]], who initiated him into the [[Saint-Simonianism|doctrines]] of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] (and later [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]]),&lt;ref name="genealogy"/&gt; to the propagation of which he devoted a part of his fortune.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Eichthal, Gustave d' |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=E&amp;artid=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 d'Eichthal went to [[Greece]], and on his return to Paris in 1836 published "Les Deux Mondes," containing his reflections on the Orient. He now began to advocate the use of Greek as a [[universal language]], and published many works, among which were: "Les Trois Grands Peuples Méditerranéens et le Christianisme," Paris, 1864; "Origines Bouddhiques de la Civilisation Américaine," in the "Revue Archéologique," Sept., 1864, and April, 1865; and "Texte Primitif du Premier Récit de la Création," Paris, 1875; reprinted after his death under the title "Mélanges de Critique Biblique."&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

D'Eichthal was one of the chief founders (1881) of L'Association pour l'Encouragement des Etudes Grecques. After his death his son published his "La Langue Grecque," Paris, 1887.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

[[Jane Welsh Carlyle]], wife of [[Thomas Carlyle]], described him as "a gentle soul, trustful, and earnest-looking, ready to do and suffer all for his faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Wood, James |title=The Nuttall Encyclopaedia |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Nuttall-Encyclopaedia18.html |accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had two sons, [[Eugène Séligmann d'Eichthal]], born November 3, 1844 in Paris, died February 28, 1936 in Paris; and [[Georges Séligmann d'Eichthal]], as well as a daughter whose married name was Mme. Paul Le Bret. She had been a friend of [[Rosa Bonheur]] when they were both children, as their fathers had both lived briefly at the Saint-Simonian [[monastery]] at [[Ménilmontant]].

'''Hyperspectral imaging''', like other [[spectral imaging]], collects and processes information from across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes.&lt;ref name="Chang2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chein-I Chang|title=Hyperspectral Imaging: Techniques for Spectral Detection and Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhBbXwFaA6sC|date=31 July 2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-47483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrahnGeladi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hans Grahn|author2=Paul Geladi|title=Techniques and Applications of Hyperspectral Image Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqmWQk01mlIC&amp;pg=PR13|date=27 September 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-01087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two general branches of spectral imagers. There are [[push broom scanner]]s and the related [[whisk broom scanner]]s, which read images over time, and [[snapshot hyperspectral imaging]], which uses a [[staring array]] to generate an image in an instant.4

Whereas the [[human eye]] sees color of [[visible light]] in mostly [[trichromatism|three bands]] (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures contiguous spectral bands, as opposed to [[multispectral image|multispectral imaging]] which measures spaced spectral bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=Nathan|last2=Kudenov|first2=Michael W.|title=Review of snapshot spectral imaging technologies|url=http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1743003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920195938/http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1743003|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 September 2015|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=52|issue=9|pages=090901|accessdate=2 February 2017|doi=10.1117/1.OE.52.9.090901|bibcode=2013OptEn..52i0901H|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object. For example, a [[spectral signature]] for oil helps geologists find new [[oil field]]s.&lt;ref name=lu&gt;{{cite journal

== Hyperspectral image sensors ==
Figuratively speaking, hyperspectral sensors collect information as a set of 'images'. Each image represents a narrow wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum, also known as a spectral band. These 'images' are combined to form a three-dimensional (''x'',''y'',''λ'') hyperspectral [[data cube]] for processing and analysis, where ''x'' and ''y'' represent two spatial dimensions of the scene, and ''λ'' represents the spectral dimension (comprising a range of wavelengths).&lt;ref name="microscopyu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microscopyu.com/articles/confocal/spectralimaging.html|title=Nikon MicroscopyU – Confocal Microscopy – Spectral Imaging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, there are four ways for sensors to sample the hyperspectral cube: Spatial scanning, spectral scanning, snapshot imaging,&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.bodkindesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Hyperspectral-1011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and spatio-spectral scanning.&lt;ref name="opticsinfobase.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-53-20-4594|title=OSA – Basic slit spectroscope reveals three-dimensional scenes through diagonal slices of hyperspectral cubes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperspectral cubes are generated from airborne sensors like the NASA's ''[[Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer]]'' (AVIRIS), or from satellites like NASA's [[Earth Observing-1|EO-1]] with its hyperspectral instrument Hyperion.&lt;ref name=Schurmer&gt;Schurmer, J.H., (Dec 2003), Air Force Research Laboratories Technology Horizons&lt;/ref&gt; However, for many development and validation studies, handheld sensors are used.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;Ellis, J., (Jan 2001) ''[http://www.eomonline.com/Common/currentissues/Jan01/ellis.htm Searching for oil seeps and oil-impacted soil with hyperspectral imagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305014626/http://www.eomonline.com/Common/currentissues/Jan01/ellis.htm |date=2008-03-05 }},'' Earth Observation Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision of these sensors is typically measured in spectral resolution, which is the width of each band of the spectrum that is captured. If the scanner detects a large number of fairly narrow frequency bands, it is possible to identify objects even if they are only captured in a handful of pixels. However, [[spatial resolution]] is a factor in addition to spectral resolution. If the pixels are too large, then multiple objects are captured in the same pixel and become difficult to identify. If the pixels are too small, then the energy captured by each sensor cell is low, and the decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] reduces the reliability of measured features.

The acquisition and processing of hyperspectral images is also referred to as [[imaging spectroscopy]] or, with reference to the hyperspectral cube, as 3D spectroscopy.

There are '''four basic techniques''' for acquiring the three-dimensional (''x'',''y'',''λ'') dataset of a hyperspectral cube. The choice of technique depends on the specific application, seeing that each technique has context-dependent advantages and disadvantages.

=== Spatial scanning ===
In spatial scanning, each two-dimensional (2-D) sensor output represents a full slit spectrum (''x'',''λ''). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) devices for spatial scanning obtain slit spectra by projecting a strip of the scene onto a slit and dispersing the slit image with a prism or a grating. These systems have the drawback of having the image analyzed per lines (with a [[push broom scanner]]) and also having some mechanical parts integrated into the optical train. With these '''line-scan systems''', the spatial dimension is collected through platform movement or scanning. This requires stabilized mounts or accurate pointing information to ‘reconstruct’ the image. Nonetheless, line-scan systems are particularly common in remote sensing, where it is sensible to use mobile platforms. Line-scan systems are also used to scan materials moving by on a conveyor belt. A special case of line scanning is '''point scanning''' (with a [[whisk broom scanner]]), where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of 2-D.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1816617#HardwareandSystems|title=SPIE – Journal of Biomedical Optics – Medical hyperspectral imaging: a review|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|volume=19|issue=1|pages=010901|doi=10.1117/1.JBO.19.1.010901|pmid=24441941|pmc=3895860|bibcode=2014JBO....19a0901L|last1=Lu|first1=Guolan|last2=Fei|first2=Baowei|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resonon.com/tutorials.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517013745/http://www.resonon.com/tutorials.html |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectral scanning ===
In spectral scanning, each 2-D sensor output represents a monochromatic ('single-colored'), spatial (''x'',''y'') map of the scene. HSI devices for spectral scanning are typically based on optical band-pass filters (either tuneable or fixed). The scene is spectrally scanned by exchanging one filter after another while the platform must be stationary. In such 'staring', wavelength scanning systems, spectral smearing can occur if there is movement within the scene, invalidating spectral correlation/detection. Nonetheless, there is the advantage of being able to pick and choose spectral bands, and having a direct representation of the two spatial dimensions of the scene.&lt;ref name="microscopyu.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org" /&gt;

=== Non-scanning ===
{{Main|Snapshot hyperspectral imaging}}
In non-scanning, a single 2-D sensor output contains all spatial (''x'',''y'') and spectral (''λ'') data. HSI devices for non-scanning yield the full datacube at once, without any scanning. Figuratively speaking, a single snapshot represents a perspective projection of the datacube, from which its three-dimensional structure can be reconstructed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2011/03/hyperspectral-imaging-one-shot-camera-obtains-simultaneous-hyperspectral-data.html|title=HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING: One-shot camera obtains simultaneous hyperspectral data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent benefits of these [[snapshot hyperspectral imaging]] systems are the ''snapshot advantage'' (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. A number of systems have been designed, including computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS), fiber-reformatting imaging spectrometry (FRIS), integral field spectroscopy with lenslet arrays (IFS-L), multi-aperture integral field spectrometer (Hyperpixel Array), integral field spectroscopy with image slicing mirrors (IFS-S), image-replicating imaging spectrometry (IRIS), filter stack spectral decomposition (FSSD), coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), image mapping spectrometry (IMS), and multispectral Sagnac interferometry (MSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1307622#r20|title=SPIE – Optical Engineering – Snapshot advantage: a review of the light collection improvement for parallel high-dimensional measurement systems|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=51|issue=11|pages=111702|doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.11.111702|pmid=22791926|pmc=3393130|bibcode=2012OptEn..51k1702H|last1=Hagen|first1=Nathan|last2=Kester|first2=Robert T.|last3=Gao|first3=Liang|last4=Tkaczyk|first4=Tomasz S.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, computational effort and manufacturing costs are high. In an effort to reduce the computational demands and potentially the high cost of non-scanning hyperspectral instrumentation, prototype devices based on [[Multivariate optical computing|Multivariate Optical Computing]] have been demonstrated.

In these platforms, chemical information is calculated in the optical domain prior to imaging such that the a chemical image relies on conventional camera systems with no further computing. As a disadvantage of these systems, no spectral information is ever acquired, i.e. only the chemical information, such that post processing or reanalysis is not possible.

=== Spatiospectral scanning ===
{{Main|Spatiospectral scanning}}
In spatiospectral scanning, each 2-D sensor output represents a wavelength-coded ('rainbow-colored', ''λ'' = ''λ''(''y'')), spatial (''x'',''y'') map of the scene. A prototype for this technique, introduced in 2014, consists of a camera at some ''non-zero'' distance behind a basic slit spectroscope (slit + dispersive element).&lt;ref name="opticsinfobase.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rombsgwC52Q&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Hyperspectral imaging with spatiospectral images from a simple spectroscope|date=12 July 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced spatiospectral scanning systems can be obtained by placing a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. Scanning can be achieved by moving the whole system relative to the scene, by moving the camera alone, or by moving the slit alone. Spatiospectral scanning unites some advantages of spatial and spectral scanning, thereby alleviating some of their disadvantages.&lt;ref name="opticsinfobase.org" /&gt;

== Distinguishing hyperspectral from multispectral imaging ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:MultispectralComparedToHyperspectral.jpg|thumb|right|Hyperspectral and Multispectral Differences.]] Hyperspectral imaging is part of a class of techniques commonly referred to as [[spectral imaging]] or [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]]. Hyperspectral imaging is related to [[multispectral imaging]]. The distinction between hyper- and multi-spectral is sometimes based incorrectly on an arbitrary "number of bands" or on the type of measurement. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) uses continuous and contiguous ranges of wavelengths (e.g. 400 - 1100&amp;nbsp;nm in steps of 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm) whilst multispectral imaging (MSI) uses a subset of targeted wavelengths at chosen locations (e.g. 400 - 1100&amp;nbsp;nm in steps of 20&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=CM Veys |display-authors=etal  |title=An Ultra-Low-Cost Active Multispectral Crop Diagnostics Device |journal=IEEE Sensors |volume=113  |pages=1005–1007|date=2017 | url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/60898455/IEEE_SENSORS_2017_Proceedings_p1005_1007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multispectral imaging deals with several images at discrete and somewhat narrow bands. Being "discrete and somewhat narrow" is what distinguishes multispectral imaging in the visible wavelength from [[color photography]]. A multispectral sensor may have many bands covering the spectrum from the visible to the longwave infrared. Multispectral images do not produce the "spectrum" of an object. [[Landsat]] is an excellent example of multispectral imaging.

Hyperspectral deals with imaging narrow spectral bands over a continuous spectral range, producing the spectra of all pixels in the scene. A sensor with only 20 bands can also be hyperspectral when it covers the range from 500 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm with 20 bands each 10&amp;nbsp;nm wide. (While a sensor with 20 discrete bands covering the VIS, NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR would be considered multispectral.)

'Ultraspectral' could be reserved for [[interferometer]] type imaging sensors with a very fine spectral resolution. These sensors often have (but not necessarily) a low [[spatial resolution]] of several [[pixel]]s only, a restriction imposed by the high data rate.

== Applications ==
Hyperspectral remote sensing is used in a wide array of applications. Although originally developed for mining and geology (the ability of hyperspectral imaging to identify various minerals makes it ideal for the mining and oil industries, where it can be used to look for ore and oil),&lt;ref name=Ellis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, R.B. (July 14, 2006), ''[http://www.microimages.com/getstart/pdf/hyprspec.pdf Introduction to hyperspectral imaging with TMIPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184157/http://www.microimages.com/getstart/pdf/hyprspec.pdf |date=2008-05-09 }}'', MicroImages Tutorial Web site&lt;/ref&gt; it has now spread into fields as widespread as ecology and surveillance, as well as historical manuscript research, such as the imaging of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. This technology is continually becoming more available to the public. Organizations such as [[NASA]] and the [[USGS]] have catalogues of various minerals and their spectral signatures, and have posted them online to make them readily available for researchers. On a smaller scale, NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used to rapidly monitor the application of pesticides to individual seeds for quality control of the optimum dose and homogeneous coverage.

=== Agriculture ===

Although the cost of acquiring hyperspectral images is typically high, for specific crops and in specific climates, hyperspectral remote sensing use is increasing for monitoring the development and health of crops. In [[Australia]], work is under way to use [[imaging spectrometer]]s to detect grape variety and develop an early warning system for disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name=Lacar&gt;Lacar, F.M., et al., ''[http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39292 Use of hyperspectral imagery for mapping grape varieties in the Barossa Valley, South Australia]'', Geoscience and remote sensing symposium (IGARSS'01) – IEEE 2001 International, vol.6 2875-2877p. {{DOI|10.1109/IGARSS.2001.978191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, work is underway to use hyperspectral data to detect the chemical composition of plants,&lt;ref name=Ferwerda&gt;Ferwerda, J.G. (2005), ''[http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2005/phd/ferwerda.pdf Charting the quality of forage: measuring and mapping the variation of chemical components in foliage with hyperspectral remote sensing]'', [[Wageningen University]], ITC Dissertation 126, 166p. {{ISBN|90-8504-209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used to detect the nutrient and water status of wheat in irrigated systems.&lt;ref name=Tilling&gt;Tilling, A.K., et al., (2006) ''[http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2006/plenary/technology/4584_tillingak.htm Remote sensing to detect nitrogen and water stress in wheat]'', The Australian Society of Agronomy&lt;/ref&gt; On a smaller scale, NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used to rapidly monitor the application of pesticides to individual seeds for quality control of the optimum dose and homogeneous coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Vermeulen, Ph., et al. | title=Assessment of pesticide coating on cereal seeds by near infrared hyperspectral imaging | journal=Journal of Spectral Imaging | volume=6 | pages=a1 | date=2017 | doi=10.1255/jsi.2017.a1 | url=https://www.impopen.com/jsi-abstract/I06_a1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application in agriculture is the detection of animal proteins in compound feeds to avoid [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)]], also known as mad-cow disease. Different studies have been done to propose alternative tools to the reference method of detection, (classical [[microscopy]]). One of the first alternatives is near [[infrared microscopy]] (NIR), which combines the advantages of microscopy and NIR. In 2004, the first study relating this problem with hyperspectral imaging was published.&lt;ref name="Fernández"&gt;Fernández Pierna, J.A., et al., 'Combination of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Near Infrared (NIR) imaging spectroscopy for the detection of meat and bone meat (MBM) in compound feeds' Journal of Chemometrics 18 (2004) 341-349&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperspectral libraries that are representative of the diversity of ingredients usually present in the preparation of compound feeds were constructed. These libraries can be used together with chemometric tools to investigate the limit of detection, specificity and reproducibility of the NIR hyperspectral imaging method for the detection and quantification of animal ingredients in feed.

=== Eye care ===
Researchers at the [[Université de Montréal]] are working with [[Photon etc.]] and Optina Diagnostics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optinadx.com/|title=HOME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to test the use of hyperspectral photography in the diagnosis of [[retinopathy]] and [[macular edema]] before damage to the eye occurs.  The metabolic hyperspectral camera will detect a drop in oxygen consumption in the retina, which indicates potential disease. An [[ophthalmologist]] will then be able to treat the retina with injections to prevent any potential damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=AM Shahidi  |display-authors=etal  |title=Regional variation in human retinal vessel oxygen saturation |journal= Experimental Eye Research |volume=113  |pages=143–147|date=2013 | doi=10.1016/j.exer.2013.06.001 |pmid=23791637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food processing ===

[[File:Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips shows invisible defects]]  In the [[food processing]] industry, hyperspectral imaging, combined with intelligent software, enables digital sorters (also called [[Optical sorting|optical sorters]]) to identify and remove defects and foreign material (FM) that are invisible to traditional camera and laser sorters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Kevin|title=Five New Technologies for Inspection|url=http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2013/inspection-technologies.html|publisher=Food Processing|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By improving the accuracy of defect and FM removal, the food processor’s objective is to enhance product quality and increase yields.

Adopting hyperspectral imaging on digital sorters achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The sorter’s software compares the hyperspectral images collected to user-defined accept/reject thresholds, and the ejection system automatically removes defects and foreign material.

The recent commercial adoption of hyperspectral sensor-based food sorters is most advanced in the nut industry where installed systems maximize the removal of stones, shells and other foreign material (FM) and extraneous vegetable matter (EVM) from walnuts, pecans, almonds, pistachios, peanuts and other nuts. Here, improved product quality, low false reject rates and the ability to handle high incoming defect loads often justify the cost of the technology.

Commercial adoption of hyperspectral sorters is also advancing at a fast pace in the potato processing industry where the technology promises to solve a number of outstanding product quality problems. Work is underway to use hyperspectral imaging to detect “sugar ends,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgstaller|first=Markus|display-authors=etal|title=Spotlight: Spectral Imaging Sorts 'Sugar-End' Defects|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|publisher=PennWell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “hollow heart”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacal-Nieto|first=Angel|display-authors=etal|title=Non-Destructive Detection of Hollow Heart in Potatoes Using Hyperspectral Imaging|date=2011|isbn=978-3-642-23677-8|pages=180–187|url=http://www.angeldacal.com/files/publications/angeldacal_2011_CAIP.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810180013/http://angeldacal.com/files/publications/angeldacal_2011_CAIP.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and “common scab,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacal-Nieto|first=Angel|display-authors=etal|date=2011|isbn=978-3-642-24087-4|pages=303–312|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24088-1_32|title=Image Analysis and Processing – ICIAP 2011|volume=6979|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|chapter=Common Scab Detection on Potatoes Using an Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging System}}&lt;/ref&gt;  conditions that plague potato processors.

=== Mineralogy ===
[[File:HSI LWIR stones.png|thumb|right|350px| A set of stones is scanned with a [[Specim]]  LWIR-C imager in the thermal infrared range from 7.7 μm to 12.4 μm. The [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]] spectra are clearly recognizable.&lt;ref name=Holma /&gt;]]  Geological samples, such as [[Core sample|drill cores]], can be rapidly mapped for nearly all minerals of commercial interest with hyperspectral imaging.  Fusion of SWIR and LWIR spectral imaging is standard for the detection of minerals in the [[feldspar]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], [[calcite]], [[garnet]], and [[olivine]] groups, as these minerals have their most distinctive and strongest [[spectral signature]] in the LWIR regions.&lt;ref name=Holma&gt;Holma, H., (May 2011), [http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=11&amp;np=5&amp;artid=848&amp;L=1 Thermische Hyperspektralbildgebung im langwelligen Infrarot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171326/http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=11&amp;np=5&amp;artid=848&amp;L=1 |date=July 26, 2011 }}, Photonik&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperspectral [[remote sensing]] of minerals is well developed. Many minerals can be identified from airborne images, and their relation to the presence of valuable minerals, such as gold and diamonds, is well understood. Currently, progress is towards understanding the relationship between oil and gas leakages from pipelines and natural wells, and their effects on the vegetation and the spectral signatures. Recent work includes the PhD dissertations of Werff&lt;ref&gt;Werff H. (2006), ''[http://www.itc.nl/library/papers_2006/phd/vdwerff.pdf Knowledge based remote sensing of complex objects: recognition of spectral and spatial patterns resulting from natural hydrocarbon seepages]'', [[Utrecht University]], ITC Dissertation 131, 138p. {{ISBN|90-6164-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Noomen.&lt;ref&gt;Noomen, M.F.

=== Surveillance ===
[[File:Specim aisaowl outdoor.png|thumb|right|350px| Hyperspectral thermal infrared [[Emission spectrum|emission]] measurement, an outdoor scan in winter conditions, ambient temperature -15°C—relative radiance spectra from various targets in the image are shown with arrows. The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectra]] of the different objects such as the watch glass have clearly distinctive characteristics. The contrast level indicates the temperature of the object. This image was produced with a [[Specim]] LWIR hyperspectral imager.&lt;ref name=Holma /&gt;]] Hyperspectral surveillance is the implementation of hyperspectral scanning technology for [[surveillance]] purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is particularly useful in military surveillance because of [[countermeasure]]s that military entities now take to avoid airborne surveillance. [[Aerial surveillance]] was used by French soldiers using tethered balloons to spy on troop movements during the French Revolutionary Wars,&lt;ref name="Battle of Fleurus"&gt;"Fleurus (Municipality, Province of Hainaut, Belgium)". CRW Flags Inc.. Retrieved 2010-04-21&lt;/ref&gt; and since that time, soldiers have learned not only to hide from the naked eye, but also to mask their [[Infrared signature|heat signatures]] to blend into the surroundings and avoid infrared scanning. The idea that drives hyperspectral surveillance is that hyperspectral scanning draws information from such a large portion of the light spectrum that any given object should have a unique [[spectral signature]] in at least a few of the many bands that are scanned. The [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]] from [[NSWDG]] who killed [[Osama bin Laden]] in May 2011 used this technology while conducting [[Death of Osama bin Laden|the raid]] (Operation Neptune's Spear) on [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Schurmer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marc Ambinder |title=The secret team that killed bin Laden |url=http://nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/the-secret-team-that-killed-bin-laden-20110502 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524000448/http://nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/the-secret-team-that-killed-bin-laden-20110502 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |date=May 3, 2011 |work=[[National Journal]] |accessdate=September 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, commercially available thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging systems have needed [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[helium]] cooling, which has made them impractical for most surveillance applications. In 2010, [[Specim]] introduced a thermal infrared hyperspectral camera that can be used for outdoor surveillance and [[UAV]] applications without an external light source such as the sun or the moon.&lt;ref name="Frost&amp;Sullivan Specim Owl"&gt;Frost&amp;Sullivan, Technical Insights, Aerospace&amp;Defence (Feb 2011): [http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/segment-toc.pag?segid=D870-00-48-00-00&amp;ctxixpLink=FcmCtx3&amp;ctxixpLabel=FcmCtx4 World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kauppalehti Specim Owl"&gt;[http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/yritykset/yritysuutiset/?oid=20110261185 Specim's Owl sees an invisible object and identifies its materials even in a pitch-dark night] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221185929/http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/yritykset/yritysuutiset/?oid=20110261185 |date=2011-02-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomy ===
In astronomy, hyperspectral imaging is used to determine a spatially-resolved spectral image. Since a spectrum is an important diagnostic, having a spectrum for each pixel allows more science cases to be addressed. In astronomy, this technique is commonly referred to as [[Integral field spectrograph|integral field spectroscopy]], and examples of this technique include FLAMES&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FLAMES – Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/flames/|publisher=ESO|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SINFONI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SINFONI – Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/sinfoni/|publisher=ESO|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Very Large Telescope]], but also the [[Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer]] on [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] uses this technique.

Soldiers can be exposed to a wide variety of chemical hazards. These threats are mostly invisible but detectable by hyperspectral imaging technology. The [[Telops]] Hyper-Cam, introduced in 2005, has demonstrated this at distances up to 5&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, V., Chamberland, M., Lagueux, P., et al., [http://link.aip.org/link/?PSISDG/7486/74860C/1 "Chemical agent detection and identification with a hyperspectral imaging infrared sensor,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713215430/http://link.aip.org/link/?PSISDG/7486/74860C/1 |date=2012-07-13 }} Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6661, 66610L (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries require continuous monitoring of emissions produced by coal and oil-fired power plants, municipal and hazardous waste incinerators, cement plants, as well as many other types of industrial sources. This monitoring is usually performed using extractive sampling systems coupled with infrared spectroscopy techniques. Some recent standoff measurements performed allowed the evaluation of the air quality but not many remote independent methods allow for low uncertainty measurements.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The primary advantage to hyperspectral imaging is that, because an entire spectrum is acquired at each point, the operator needs no prior knowledge of the sample, and postprocessing allows all available information from the dataset to be mined. Hyperspectral imaging can also take advantage of the spatial relationships among the different spectra in a neighbourhood, allowing more elaborate spectral-spatial models for a more accurate segmentation and classification of the image.&lt;ref name=Picon&gt;A. Picon, O. Ghita, P.F. Whelan, P. Iriondo (2009), ''[http://doras.dcu.ie/15600/1/whelan8.pdf Spectral and Spatial Feature Integration for Classification of Non-ferrous Materials in Hyper-spectral Data]'', IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. 5, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ran Zhang Wei Zhang 2017 p. "&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ran | first=Lingyan | last2=Zhang | first2=Yanning | last3=Wei | first3=Wei | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | title=A Hyperspectral Image Classification Framework with Spatial Pixel Pair Features | journal=Sensors | volume=17 | issue=10 | pages=2421 | date=2017-10-23 | doi=10.3390/s17102421 | pmid=29065535 | pmc=5677443 | url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/10/2421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity. Fast computers, sensitive detectors, and large data storage capacities are needed for analyzing hyperspectral data. Significant data storage capacity is necessary since hyperspectral cubes are large, multidimensional datasets, potentially exceeding hundreds of [[megabytes]]. All of these factors greatly increase the cost of acquiring and processing hyperspectral data. Also, one of the hurdles researchers have had to face is finding ways to program hyperspectral satellites to sort through data on their own and transmit only the most important images, as both transmission and storage of that much data could prove difficult and costly.&lt;ref name=Schurmer /&gt;  As a relatively new analytical technique, the full potential of hyperspectral imaging has not yet been realized.

The '''International Boundary Marker''', also known as the '''Republic of Texas Granite Marker''', is a [[boundary marker]] located on the [[Louisiana]]-[[Texas]] border near the junction of [[Farm to Market Road 31|Texas FM 31]] and [[Louisiana Highway 765]], southeast of [[Deadwood, Texas]]. The marker was created in 1840 and placed in 1841 to mark the international border between the United States and the [[Republic of Texas]]. The survey which established this border lasted from May 1840 to June 1841; the survey team faced hazardous, swampy conditions in their work and were forced to take several extended breaks due to weather and a lack of funding. The boundary marker is the only marker remaining from the Texas border survey and is one of only two known international boundary markers located entirely within the United States (the other being a much older and humbler stone near Mobile, Alabama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Boundary Marker|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/hp/nhl/attachments/Parish16/Scans/16009001.pdf|publisher=Louisiana Office of Cultural Development, Division of Historic Preservation|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"/&gt;

The property of the {{convert|3|acre|ha}} area is shared between [[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana]] (1 acre) and [[Panola County, Texas]] (2 acres), with the marker itself being a direct property of [[U.S. Government]]&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/NR/pdfs/77001463/77001463.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form: International Boundary Marker|website=Texas Historic Site Atlas|author=|access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marker was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 13, 1977.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

The '''Leichhardt Falls''' is a [[Waterfall#Types|plunge waterfall]] on the [[Leichhardt River]] in the [[Gulf Country]] region of [[North West Queensland|North West]] [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. 

==Location and features==
The falls are located approximately {{convert|50|km}} upstream from the point where the river discharges into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. The falls vary in intensity from a raging torrent of water in the [[wet season]] to a mere trickle towards the end of the [[dry season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australian-4x4.com.au/gulf-track-australia.html|title=The Gulf Track|work=Australian 4x4|publisher=John Cantrell|date=2007|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The falls are not renowned for their height but for their stepped nature and breadth.

The falls and river are named after [[Ludwig Leichhardt]].&lt;ref name=dnrm/&gt;

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Nauru'''. The avifauna of [[Nauru]] include a total of twenty-seven species, of which one is [[Endemism in birds|endemic]].

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account.

The following tag has been used to highlight endemic species. The commonly occurring native species are untagged.

==Shearwaters and petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Procellariidae]]

The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized "true petrels", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

*[[Tropical shearwater]], ''Puffinus bailloni''

==Tropicbirds==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.

*[[Red-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon rubricauda''
*[[White-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon lepturus''

==Boobies and gannets==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Sulidae]]

The sulids comprise the [[gannet]]s and [[Booby|boobies]]. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.

*[[Brown booby]], ''Sula leucogaster''

==Frigatebirds==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Fregatidae]]

[[Frigatebird]]s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.

*[[Great frigatebird]], ''Fregata minor''

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Ardeidae]]

The family Ardeidae contains the [[bittern]]s, [[heron]]s and [[egret]]s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.

*[[Pacific reef heron]], ''Egretta sacra''

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[Pacific golden plover]], ''Pluvialis fulva''
*[[Black-bellied plover]], ''Pluvialis squatarola''
*[[Lesser sandplover]], ''Charadrius mongolus''
*[[Greater sandplover]], ''Charadrius leschenaultii''

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Bar-tailed godwit]], ''Limosa lapponica''
*[[Whimbrel]], ''Numenius phaeopus''
*[[Bristle-thighed curlew]], ''Numenius tahitiensis''
*[[Grey-tailed tattler]], ''Tringa brevipes''
*[[Wandering tattler]], ''Tringa incana''
*[[Ruddy turnstone]], ''Arenaria interpres''
*[[Sharp-tailed sandpiper]], ''Calidris acuminata''

==Gulls, terns, and skimmers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Laridae]]

Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, and [[skimmer]]s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.

*[[Black-naped tern]], ''Sterna sumatrana''
*[[Sooty tern]], ''Onychoprion fuscatus''
*[[Black noddy]], ''Anous minutus''
*[[Brown noddy]], ''Anous stolidus''
*[[White tern]], ''Gygis alba''

==Pigeons and doves==
'''Order''': [[Columbiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Columbidae]]

[[Pigeon]]s and [[dove]]s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy [[cere]].

*[[Micronesian imperial pigeon]], ''Ducula oceanica''

==Cuckoos and anis==
'''Order''': [[Cuculiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Cuculidae]]

The family Cuculidae includes [[cuckoo]]s, [[Geococcyx|roadrunner]]s and [[Ani (bird)|anis]]. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are [[brood parasite]]s.

*[[Long-tailed koel]], ''Eudynamys taitensis''

==Kingfishers==
'''Order''': [[Coraciiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Alcedinidae]]

Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs and stubby tails.

*[[Pacific kingfisher]], ''Todirhamphus sacer''
*[[Sacred kingfisher]], ''Todirhamphus sanctus''

==Acrocephalid warblers==
'''Order''': [[Passeriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Acrocephalidae]]

The family Acrocephalidae is a group of small insectivorous passerine birds. Most are of generally undistinguished appearance, but many have distinctive songs.

*[[Nauru reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus rehsei'' (E)

[[File:PIA21906-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-HighResolution-Dawn-20170920.jpg|thumb|Ceres]]
[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is a [[dwarf planet]] in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] has adopted two themes for naming surface features on Ceres: agricultural deities for craters and agricultural festivals for everything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Andrew R.|last2=Byrd|first2=Deborah|title=Dwarf planet Ceres gets place names|url=http://earthsky.org/space/dwarf-planet-ceres-gets-place-names|website=EarthSky Communications|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2016, the IAU has approved names for 111 geological features on Ceres: craters, montes, catenae, rupēs, plana, tholi, planitiae, fossae and sulci.&lt;ref name="IAU-20160916"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Planetary Surface Feature News |url=http://www.iau.org/news/planetary_surface_features/ |date=16 September 2016 |work=[[IAU]] |accessdate=19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS-20160916"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Names Approved for 14 Features on Ceres |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/news/nomenclature/names-approved-for-14-features-on-ceres |date=16 September 2016 |work=[[USGS]] |accessdate=19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, NASA released a comparison of physical features found on Ceres with similar ones present on Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180724"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=McCartney |first2=Gretchen |title=What Looks Like Ceres on Earth? |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7196 |date=24 July 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Piazzi'', named after [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], the discoverer of Ceres, is a dark region southwest of [[Dantu crater]] in ground-based images that was named before ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' arrived at Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17831&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of features ==
[[File:PIA22090-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-NotableFeatures-20180117.jpg|thumb|center|400px|&lt;center&gt;Notable geological features of Ceres&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Craters ==
Ceres is saturated with [[impact crater]]s. Many have a central pit or bright spot.

In the first batch of 17 names approved by the IAU, craters north of 20° north latitude had names beginning with A&amp;ndash;G (with [[Asari (crater)|Asari]] being the furthest north), those between 20° north and south latitude beginning with H&amp;ndash;R, and those further south beginning with S&amp;ndash;Z (with [[Zadeni (crater)|Zadeni]] being the furthest south).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">The '''mountains of Princess Elizabeth Land''' are located in the region [[Princess Elizabeth Land]], [[East Antarctica]], between 73° E and 87° 55' 20" E. This region is claimed by [[Australia]] as part of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]. The area is highly glaciated. The availability of reliable data for this region is limited, making the list incomplete and inaccurate. The highest peaks, including [[nunatak]]s and [[ice dome]]s, are listed below:

==History==
After he obtained his doctorate at the KU Leuven in 1991, Dr. Lode Missiaen worked as a senior scientist at the NATO C3 Agency in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands | the Netherlands]], where he was responsible for the study, development, and application of modern software technologies in the field of Air Traffic Control and Airspace Management.

Together with his colleague Thierry Salvant, who built a career in France at Matra Aérospatiale in the world of air traffic, Missiaen recognized the lack of commercially available software to combine geographic information efficiently and with high precision with real-time aviation information.

To fill this gap, Missiaen and Salvant founded Luciad on March 22, 1999, together with management company R2I (acted as business angels). Gemma Frisius Fund (GFF), a seed capital fund established in 1997 as a joint venture between the KU Leuven, [[KBC_Bank | KBC]] and [[BNP_Paribas | BNP Paribas]], provided further seed capital in September 2000&lt;ref name="met Luciad de lucht in" /&gt;.

Missiaen served as Group CEO from 1999 to 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luciad.com/team/lode-missiaen-director|title=Lode Missiaen|work=Luciad}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Mickey Mouse film poster.png|thumb|right|Film poster from 1929, the first created for the series]]
'''''Mickey Mouse''''' (originally '''''Mickey Mouse Sound Cartoons''''') is a character-based series of 130 [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[short film]]s produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]. The films, which introduced Disney's [[Mickey Mouse|most famous cartoon character]], were released on a regular basis from 1928 ("Plane Crazy") to 1953 with four additional shorts released between 1983 and 2013. The series is notable for its innovation with [[Sound film|sound synchronization]] and [[character animation]], and also introduced well-known characters such as [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], and [[Goofy]].

The name "Mickey Mouse" was first used in the films' title sequences to refer specifically to the character, but was used from 1935 to 1953 to refer to the series itself as in "Walt Disney presents a Mickey Mouse." In this sense "a Mickey Mouse" was a shortened form of "a Mickey Mouse sound cartoon" which was used in the earliest films. Films from 1929 to 1935 which were re-released during this time also used this naming convention, but it was not used for the three shorts released between 1983 and 1995 (''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and ''[[Runaway Brain]]''). Mickey's name was also used occasionally to market other films which were formally part of other series. Examples of this include several ''[[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]]'', ''[[Don Donald]]'' (1937), and ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' (1939).
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Production==
''Mickey Mouse'' began production in April 1928 after the Disney studio lost the license to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. The first two films, ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', were previewed in theaters but failed to pick up a [[Film distributor|distributor]]. For the third film, Disney added synchronized sound, a technology that was still in its early stages at the time. ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' debuted in New York in November 1928 and was an instant success. The revenues from the film provided the studio with much needed resources, and the studio quickly began to produce new cartoons as well as releasing sound versions of the first two.&lt;ref&gt;Gable 2007, p. 115 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Production slowed towards the end of the 1930s as the studio began to focus on other characters and feature-length films. The series was informally retired in 1953 with the release of ''[[The Simple Things]]'', but was revived in 1983 and 1990 with two [[featurette]]s, or three reel short films. 1995's ''[[Runaway Brain]]'' returned the series to its single reel format, while the most recent installment, 2013's ''[[Get a Horse!]]'', was produced in the black-and-white style of the early films.

The cartoons were directed by 20 different people. Those with the most credits include [[Burt Gillett]] (34), [[Wilfred Jackson]] (18), [[Walt Disney]] (16), [[David Hand (animator)|David Hand]] (15), and [[Ben Sharpsteen]] (14); the director of the most recent installment, [[Lauren MacMullan]], was the first female director. Notable animators who worked on the series include [[Ub Iwerks]], [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], [[Ollie Johnston]], [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], and [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]]. Mickey's voice is mostly provided by Walt Disney, with some additional work by [[Carl Stalling]] and [[Clarence Nash]]. By 1947, [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] had taken over Mickey's voice. [[Wayne Allwine]] voices the mouse in the three most recent films.

==Releases==
Every ''Mickey Mouse'' cartoon was originally released theatrically, typically appearing before feature films. In 1929, some theaters began to host the "Mickey Mouse Club", a children's program which would exclusively show Mickey's cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Tomart's Illustrated Disneyana Catalog and Price Guide&lt;/ref&gt; The series was first [[Film distribution|distributed]] by Celebrity Productions (1928–1929), followed by [[Columbia Pictures]] (1930–1932), [[United Artists]] (1932–1937), and [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] (1937–1953). The four most recent films were released by Disney's own companies Buena Vista and [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

Many of the films were also broadcast on television, beginning in 1936 on [[BBC Television]]. Here the series was shown on a regular basis except during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Holliss 1986, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, selected films were shown on the [[Walt Disney anthology television series]], and later on other series such as ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' (1971–1973), ''[[Mickey's Mouse Tracks]]'' (1992–1999), and ''Ink &amp; Paint Club'' (1997–1998).

The films have also been released in various forms of [[Home video|home entertainment]]. In the 1960s there were several [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] releases, although these were often silent, black-and-white, or condensed versions. In 1978, Disney began to release selected films on VHS, laserdisc, and later DVD. Starting in 2010, some of the cartoons were made available on the [[iTunes Store]] as digital downloads.

Disney has also released films online. At the Disney website, cartoons are shown on a rotating basis under the video page "[http://disney.go.com/videos/#/videos/characters/mickey/&amp;content=163728 Mickey &amp; Friends]". On Walt Disney Animation Studios' official [[YouTube]] channel, three complete cartoons have been released: ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCZPzHg0h80 Plane Crazy]'' (1928), ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4&amp;feature=channel_video_title Steamboat Willie]'' (1928), and ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdIaEQCUVbk Hawaiian Holiday]'' (1937), and most of ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC9wB3zHmWo&amp;feature=related Thru the Mirror]'' (1936) as seen on the ''Disneyland'' episode "[[The Plausible Impossible]]" (1956).

As of 2018, the only complete re-release of the entire series has been in the "[[Walt Disney Treasures]]" DVD sets. The vast majority&lt;ref&gt;''Donald and Pluto'' appears on "The Chronological Donald" and several others which prominently feature Pluto appear on "The Complete Pluto"&lt;/ref&gt; of the series appears between four two-disc sets: "[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Two#Mickey Mouse in Black and White|Mickey Mouse in Black and White]]" (2002), "[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Four#Mickey Mouse in Black and White, Volume Two|Mickey Mouse in Black and White, Volume Two]]" (2004), "[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave One#Mickey Mouse in Living Color|Mickey Mouse in Living Color]]" (2001), and "[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Three#Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two|Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two]]" (2004). Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]], who hosts the collection, implied that there was opposition to releasing the complete series because of some content now considered politically incorrect, such as racial and ethnic stereotypes. Maltin argued that releasing the material uncensored was the only way to "learn from the past". The only film not included in this collection was the subsequently released ''[[Get a Horse!]]'' (2013) which first premiered at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] and was shown ahead of ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26641">The city of [[Istanbul]] has been known by a number of different names. The most notable names besides the modern Turkish name are ''[[Byzantium]]'', ''[[Constantinople]]'', and ''[[Stamboul]]''. Different names are associated with different phases of its history and with different languages.

==Names in historical sequence==

===Lygos===

According to [[Pliny the Elder]] the first name of Byzantium was ''Lygos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20IV Pliny the Elder, book IV, chapter XI:&lt;br /&gt; "''On leaving the Dardanelles we come to the Bay of Casthenes, ... and the promontory of the Golden Horn, on which is the town of Byzantium, a free state, formerly called Lygos; it is 711 miles from Durazzo,'' ..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the name of a Thracian settlement situated on the site of the later city, near the point of the peninsula ([[Sarayburnu]]).&lt;ref name="janin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Constantinople byzantine|last=Janin|first=Raymond |authorlink= Raymond Janin|place=Paris|publisher=Institut Français d'Études Byzantines|year=1964|page=10f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantium===
{{further|Byzantium}}

''Byzantion'' (Βυζάντιον), [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as ''Byzantium'', was founded by Greek colonists from [[Megara]] in 667 BC. The name is believed to be of Thracian or Illyrian origin and thus to predate the Greek settlement.&lt;ref name="janin"/&gt; It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name, ''Byzas''.&lt;ref name=Georgacas1947/&gt;{{rp|352ff}} Ancient Greek legend refers to a [[Byzas|legendary king of that name]] as the leader of the Megarean colonists and eponymous founder of the city.

After its fall, the name "Byzantine Empire" started being used by the West to refer to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] whose capital the city had been. This usage was introduced by the [[Germany|German]] historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] in 1555, a century after the empire had ceased to exist. During the time of the empire, the term ''Byzantium'' was used only for the city, not for the empire that it ruled.

===Augusta Antonina===
The city was called ''Augusta Antonina'' ({{Lang-el|Αυγούστα Αντωνινή}}) for a brief period in the 3rd century AD. The Roman Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193–211) conferred the name in honor of his son Antoninus, the later Emperor [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): "İstanbul'un adları" ["The names of Istanbul"]. In: 'Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Rome===
Before the Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] made the city the new eastern capital of the [[Roman Empire]] on May 11, 330, he undertook a major construction project, essentially rebuilding the city on a monumental scale, partly modeled after Rome. Names of this period included {{lang|grc|ἡ Νέα, δευτέρα Ῥώμη}} "the New, second Rome",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city "New Rome" (''Nova Roma'' or ''Nea Rhome''). Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (see, ''e.g.'', Michael Grant, ''The climax of Rome'' (London 1968), p. 133).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 5th-century church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]] writes in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 1:16 (c. 439) that the emperor named the city "Constantinople" while decreeing that it be designated a "second Rome" (‘Κωνσταντινούπολιν’ μετονομάσας, χρηματίζειν ‘δευτέραν Ῥώμην’ νόμῳ ἐκύρωσεν).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alma Roma''&amp;nbsp; {{lang|grc|Ἄλμα Ῥώμα}}, {{lang|grc|Βυζαντιάς Ῥώμη}}, {{lang|grc|ἑῴα Ῥώμη}} "Eastern Rome", ''Roma Constantinopolitana''.&lt;ref name=Georgacas1947&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Georgacas, Demetrius John |year=1947 |title=The Names of Constantinople |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume=78 |pages=347–67 |doi=10.2307/283503 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=283503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|354}}

The Third Canon of the First Council of Constantinople (360) refers to the city as New Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.viii.iv.html "The Seven Ecumenical Councils | Christian Classics Ethereal Library". Ccel.org. 2005-06-01. Retrieved 2017-05-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "New Rome" lent itself to East–West polemics, especially in the context of the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], when it was used by Greek writers to stress the rivalry with (the original) Rome. ''New Rome'' is also still part of the official title of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec-patr.org/athp/index.php?lang=en Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantinople late 19th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A postcard, c. 1905, refers to the city as Constantinople, and the inner city as Stamboul.]]

===Constantinople===
{{further|Constantinople}}

''Kōnstantinoúpolis'' (Κωνσταντινούπολις), ''Constantinopolis'' in Latin and ''Constantinople'' in English, was the name by which the city became soon more widely known, in honour of Constantine the Great who established it as his capital. It is first attested in official use under Emperor [[Theodosius II]] (408–450).&lt;ref name="IA"/&gt; It remained the principal official name of the city throughout the Byzantine period, and the most common name used for it in the West until the early 20th century. It was also used (including its Kostantiniyye variant) by the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the advent of the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Caroline, ''Osman's Dream'', (Basic Books, 2005), 57; "''Istanbul was only adopted as the city's official name in 1930..''".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Byzantine names===
Besides ''Constantinople'', the Byzantines referred to the city with a large range of honorary appellations, such as the "Queen of Cities" ({{lang|grc|Βασιλὶς τῶν πόλεων}}), also as an adjective, Βασιλεύουσα, the 'Reigning City'. In popular speech, the most common way of referring to it came to be simply ''the City'' (Greek: ''hē Polis'', {{lang|grc|ἡ Πόλις}}, [[Modern Greek]]: ''i Poli'', η Πόλη). This usage, still current today in colloquial Greek and Armenian (Պոլիս, pronounced "Polis" or "Bolis" in the [[Western Armenian dialect]] prevalent in the city), also became the source of the later Turkish name, ''Istanbul'' (see below).

[[File:Istanbul by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|upright|A map by [[Piri Reis]], c. 1525, refers to the city as Kostantiniyye]]

===Kostantiniyye===
{{further|Constantinople during the Ottoman period}}

''Kostantiniyye'' ([[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|قسطنطنية}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Transliteration|translit.]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Qusṭanṭīniyya'', [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] {{lang|fa|قسطنطينيه}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Transliteration|translit.]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Ḳosṭanṭīnīye''){{sfn|İnalcık|1997|p=224}} is the name by which the city came to be known in the [[Islamic world]]. It is an Arabic [[calque]]d form of ''Constantinople'', with an Arabic ending meaning 'place of' instead of the Greek element ''-polis''. After the 
[[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest]] of 1453, it was used as the most formal official name in Ottoman Turkish,&lt;ref&gt;G. Necipoğlu. "From Byzantine Constantinople to Ottoman Kostantiniyye: Creation of a Cosmopolitan Capital and Visual Culture under Sultan Mehmed II" Ex. cat. "From Byzantion to Istanbul: 8000 Years of a Capital", June 5 – September 4, 2010, Sabanci University Sakip Sabanci Museum, Istanbul. Istanbul: Sakip Sabanci Museum, 2010 p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in use throughout most of the time up to the fall of the Empire in 1923. However, during some periods Ottoman authorities favoured other names (see below).

===İstanbul===

The modern Turkish name ''İstanbul'' ({{IPA-tr|isˈtanbuɫ|pron}}) ({{lang-ota|استانبول}}) is attested (in a range of variants) since the 10th century, at first in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (without the initial ''İ-'') and then in Turkish sources. It derives from the [[Medieval Greek#Phonetics and phonology|Greek]] phrase "στην Πόλη" " {{IPA-el|stimˈboli|}}, meaning "in the city" or "to the city", [[Rebracketing#In Greek 2|reinterpreted]] as a single word;&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;Marek Stachowski, Robert Woodhouse, "The Etymology of İstanbul: Making Optimal Use of the Evidence" ''Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia'' '''20''': 221–245 (2015) {{doi|10.4467/20843836SE.15.015.2801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An alternative derivation, directly from ''Constantinople'', was entertained as an hypothesis by some researchers in the 19th century but is today regarded as obsolete; see Sakaoğlu (1993/94a: 254) and Stachowski for references.&lt;/ref&gt; a similar case is [[Argyroupoli, Rethymno|Stimboli]], [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius John Georgacas, "The Names of Constantinople", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''78''':347–367 (1947) {{jstor|283503}}, p. 360, footnote 80&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus based on the common Greek usage of referring to Constantinople simply as ''The City'' (see above).

The incorporation of parts of articles and other particles into Greek placenames was common even before the Ottoman period: Navarino for earlier Avarino,&lt;ref&gt;Detailed history at [[Pylos#The Name of Navarino]]&lt;/ref&gt; Satines for Athines, ''etc.''&lt;ref name=Bourne1887&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar examples of modern Turkish placenames derived from Greek in this fashion are [[İzmit]], earlier ''İznikmit,'' from Greek [[Nicomedia]], [[İznik]] from Greek ''Nicaea'' ([iz nikea]), [[Samsun]] (''s'Amison'' from "se" and "Amisos"), and ''İstanköy'' for the Greek island [[Kos]] (from ''is tin Ko''). The occurrence of the initial ''i-'' in these names, including Istanbul's, is largely secondary [[epenthesis]] to break up syllabic consonant clusters, prohibited by the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] structure of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as seen in Turkish ''istasyon'' from French ''station'' or ''ızgara'' from the Greek ''schára''.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;

[[File:Anavatan 1927.jpg|thumb|A 1927 map of Turkey, where the name İstanbul is used]]

''İstanbul'' was the common name for the city in normal speech in Turkish even before the conquest of 1453,{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} but in official use by the Ottoman authorities other names, such as ''Kostantiniyye'', were preferred in certain contexts. Thus, ''Kostantiniyye'' was used on coinage up to the late 17th and then again in the 19th century. The Ottoman chancelery and courts used ''Kostantiniyye'' as part of intricate formulae in expressing the place of origin of formal documents, such as ''be-Makam-ı Darü's-Saltanat-ı Kostantiniyyetü'l-Mahrusâtü'l-Mahmiyye''.&lt;ref name="Ko"&gt;Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94b): "Kostantiniyye". In: 'Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th century Turkish book-printing it was also used in the impressum of books, in contrast to the foreign use of ''Constantinople''. At the same time, however, ''İstanbul'' too was part of the official language, for instance in the titles of the highest Ottoman military commander ''(İstanbul ağası)'' and the highest civil magistrate ''(İstanbul efendisi)'' of the city,&lt;ref name="Dic"&gt;A.C. Barbier de Meynard (1881): ''Dictionnaire Turc-Français.'' Paris: Ernest Leroux.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] states that "The capital city of the Ottoman State is İstanbul".&lt;ref&gt;Kanun-ı Esasi [https://anayasa.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/1876/1876ilkmetinler/1876-ilkhal-osmanlica.pdf (Ottoman Turkish)] [https://anayasa.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/1876/1876ilkmetinler/1876-ilkhal-turkce.pdf (Modern Turkish transliteration)], Article 2: "''Devleti Osmaniyenin payıtahtı İstanbul şehridir''"&lt;/ref&gt; ''İstanbul'' and several other variant forms of the same name were also widely used in Ottoman literature and poetry.&lt;ref name="IA"/&gt;

Names other than استانبول (''İstanbul'') had become obsolete in the Turkish language during the late Ottoman/early republican periods. However, Constantinople was still used when writing the city's name in Latin script. In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script. After that, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in the Ottoman times.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford and Ezel Shaw (1977): History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Vol II, p. 386; Robinson (1965), The First Turkish Republic, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Letters or packages sent to "Constantinople" instead of "Istanbul" were no longer delivered by Turkey's [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone|PTT]], which contributed to the eventual worldwide adoption of the new name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In English the name is usually written "Istanbul". In modern Turkish the name is written "İstanbul" ([[dotted and dotless I|dotted i/İ]] and dotless ı/I being two distinct letters in the [[Turkish alphabet]]).

===Stamboul===
{{redirect|Stamboul|the 1931 British film|Stamboul (film)|the now-defunct newspaper|Le Stamboul}}
''Stamboul'' or ''Stambul'' is a variant form of ''İstanbul.'' Greek for  'the town'. Like ''Istanbul'' itself, forms without the initial ''i-'' are attested from early on in the Middle Ages, first in Arabic sources of the 10th century&lt;ref&gt;Arab historian [[Al Masudi]] writes that the Greek calls the city ''Stanbulin''. Necipoĝlu (2010) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and Armenian ones of the 12th. Some early sources also attest to an even shorter form ''Bulin'', based on the Greek word ''Poli(n)'' alone without the preceding article.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;"Istanbul", in ''Encyclopedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This latter form lives on in modern Armenian.) The word-initial ''i-'' arose in the Turkish name as an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel to break up the ''St-'' consonant cluster, prohibited in Turkish [[phonotactics]].

''Stamboul'' was used in Western languages as an equivalent of ''İstanbul'', until the time it was replaced by the official new usage of the Turkish form in the 1930s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Western European and American sources often used ''Constantinople'' to refer to the metropolis as a whole, but ''Stamboul'' to refer to the central parts located on the historic peninsula, i.e. Byzantine-era Constantinople inside the [[Theodosian Walls|walls]].&lt;ref name="Dwight"&gt;H. G. Dwight (1915): ''Constantinople Old and New.'' New York: Scribner's. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmondo De Amicis]] (1878) ''Costantinopoli'' Milano, Treves, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cedid Atlas (Middle East) 1803.jpg|thumb|A 1803 map from [[Cedid Atlas]] refers to the city as Islambol (though the Bosphorus is called the Istanbul Strait on the map)]]

===Islambol===
''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| اسلامبول}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in the Turkish language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.&lt;ref name="IA"/&gt; Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century, most notably [[Evliya Çelebi]], describe it as the common Turkish name of the time. Between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also in official use. The first use of the word "Islambol" on coinage took place in 1703 (1115&amp;nbsp;AH) during the reign of Sultan [[Ahmed III]]. The term ''Kostantiniyye'' still appeared, however, into the 20th century.

===Other Ottoman names===
Ottomans and foreign contemporaries, especially in diplomatic correspondence, referred to the Ottoman imperial government with particular honorifics. Among them are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Buğday |first=Korkut |title=The Routledge Introduction to Literary Ottoman |translator=Jerold C. Frakes |date=2009|orig-year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |pages=199–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Bāb-i ʿĀlī'' ({{lang|ota|باب عالی}}, "The [[Sublime Porte]]"); A [[metonym]] referring to the gate of [[Topkapı Palace]].
* ''Der-i Devlet'' ({{lang|ota|در دولت}} "Abode of the State")
* ''Der-i Saʿādet'' ({{lang|ota|در سعادت}} "Abode of Felicity" or "Abode of [[Eudaimonia]]")
* ''Āsitāne'' ({{lang|ota|آستانه}} "Threshold"); Referring to the imperial court.
* ''Pāy-taḫt'' or sometimes ''Pāyitaḫt'' ({{lang|ota|پای تخت}},  "The Seat/[[Base (geometry)|Base]] of the Throne")

The "Gate of Felicity", the "Sublime Gate", and the "Sublime Porte" were literally places within the Ottoman Sultans' [[Topkapı Palace]], and were used [[metonymy|metonymically]] to refer to the authorities located there, and hence for the central Ottoman imperial administration.  Modern historians also refer to government by these terms, similar to popular usage of [[Whitehall]] in Britain.  The sublime Gate is not inside Topkapı palace; the administration building whose gate is named Bâb-ı Âlî is between Agia Sofia and Beyazit mosque, a huge building.&lt;ref&gt;[[:tr:Bâb-ı Âli]] BabiAli {{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical names in other languages==
Many peoples neighboring on the Byzantine Empire used names expressing concepts like "The Great City", "City of the Emperors", "Capital of the Romans" or similar. During the 10th to 12th century [[Constantinople]] was one of the largest two cities in the world, the other being [[Baghdad]].

===Old Norse===
&lt;!-- [[Miklagard]] redirects here --&gt;
The medieval [[Vikings]], who had contacts with the Byzantine empire through their expansion through eastern Europe ([[Varangians]]) used the [[Old Norse]] name ''Miklagarðr'' (from ''mikill'' 'big' and ''garðr'' 'wall' or 'stronghold'), later ''Miklagard''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viking.no/e/turkey/ Miklagard )The Great City)]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Micklegarth''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deremilitari.org/2014/06/english-refugees-in-the-byzantine-armed-forces-the-varangian-guard-and-anglo-saxon-ethnic-consciousness/ English Refugees in the Byzantine Armed Forces: The Varangian Guard and Anglo-Saxon Ethnic Consciousness]&lt;/ref&gt; This name lives on in the modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name ''Mikligarður'' and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Miklagarður''.

===Slavic===
{{further|Tsargrad}}
[[Slavic languages|East and South Slavic]] languages referred to the city as [[Tsarigrad]] or ''Carigrad,'' 'City of the Tsar (King)', from the Slavonic words ''[[tsar]]'' ('[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]' or '[[King (title)|King]]') and ''grad'' ('city'). [[Cyrillic]]: Царьград, Цариград. This was presumably a [[calque]] on a Greek phrase such as Βασιλέως Πόλις ''(Basileos Polis),'' 'the city of the emperor [king]'. The term is still occasionally used in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], whereas it has become archaic in [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], ''{{lang|sl|Carigrad}}'' is a living alternative name for the modern city, as well as being used when referring to the historic capital of the medieval Roman Empire or the Ottoman Empire. In [[Czech language|Czech]] (a [[West Slavic language]]) this Slavic name is used in the form ''Cařihrad'' (used in the 19th century, now only occasionally). It was also borrowed from the Slavic languages into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in the form ''Țarigrad'', though ''Constantinopole'' remained the far more widely preferred term.

===Persian and Arabic===
Besides ''Kustantiniyyah'', [[Persian language|Persian]],  [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languages of the Islamic world used names based on the title ''Cesar'' ('Emperor'), as in Persian and Urdu ''Kayser-i Zemin'',&lt;ref name="IA"/&gt; or on the ethnic name ''Rum'' ('Romans'), as in Arabic ''Rūmiyyat al-kubra'' ('Great City of the Romans') or Persian ''Takht-e Rum'' ('Throne of the Romans').&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;

===Judaeo-Spanish===
The city is referred as ''Kostandina'' or ''Kostantina'' (an alteration of [[Names of Istanbul#Kostantiniyye|Kostantiniyye]]) and more often as its short form ''Kosta'' (קושטה) or ''Kostán'' in most [[Judaeo-Spanish]] publications during the Ottoman period.&lt;ref name=Jerusalmi&gt;{{cite book|last=Jerusalmi|first=Isaac|title=from OTTOMAN TURKISH to LADINO: the case of Mehmet Sadık Rifat Pasha's Risâle-i Ahlâk and Judge Yehezkel Gabbay's Buen Dotrino|year=1990|publisher=Ladino Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nehama&gt;{{cite book|last=Nehama|first=Joseph|title=Dictionnaire du Judéo-Espagnol|year=2003|publisher=La Lettre Sépharade|location=Paris, France|pages=196, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosta was the name for the entire province of Istanbul, while the word ''Estambol'' was used for the area of the old city and Pera. Today the word Kosta is restricted only for historical purposes and is no more in common use.

The word ''Estambol'' has widened in meaning to include exclusively the entire European side of Istanbul. The Asian side is usually not considered as Estambol, however the expression ''la civdad de Estambol'' would encompass the boundaries of the present-day city. There are few expression denoting the Asian side. ''Anatol'', from [[Anatolia]] and ''Asya'', meaning [[Asia]] are common words to denote the Asian side of Istanbul. Moreover, ''el otro lado'' (literally ''the other side'') is a quite simplistic and descriptory expression for the Asian side of Istanbul, especially for those living in the European side. Those living in the Asian side however do not use this expression to denote the European side, but simply call it ''Estambol''. The inhabitants are called ''Estambulí'' or ''Estambullí''.&lt;ref name=Nehama /&gt;

===Hebrew===
In Hebrew, the city was sometimes referred to as "Kushtandina" {{Hebrew|קושטנדינה}}, and sometimes "Kushtandina Rabati" {{Hebrew|קושטנדינה רבתי}}, literally, Great Kushtandina, or shortened to "Kushta" {{Hebrew|קושטא}}, probably due to a distorted pronunciation of the Judaeo-Spanish ''Kostandina''. This usage was common among non-Sephardic Jews until the early 20th century; however, in present-day [[Israel]] it has virtually disappeared, replaced by the Hebrew transliteration of the Turkish "Istanbul" ({{Hebrew|איסטנבול}}).

===Chinese===
* Lumi city 魯迷城 (Lumi 魯迷 is the Chinese pronunciation of [[Rûm]] or Rumi) during the [[Ming dynasty]]
* Wulumu 務魯木 (originates from [[Rûm]] or Rumi), during the [[Qing dynasty]]
* Gongsidangdinebole 拱斯當底訥伯勒 during the [[Qing dynasty]]
* Kangsitanyinuoge'er 康思坦貽諾格爾 during the [[Qing dynasty]]
* Junshitandingbao 君士坦丁堡 modern transcription of Constantinople, used when referring to the city in a historical sense

Present-day Chinese use transcriptions of the name Istanbul (Yisitanbu'er 伊斯坦布尔 or Yisitanbao 伊斯坦堡) when referring to the modern city.

==Modern languages==
{{further|Names of European cities in different languages: I-L#I}}
Most modern Western languages have adopted the name ''Istanbul'' for the modern city during the 20th century, following the current usage in the Turkish Republic. However, many languages also preserve other, traditional names. Greeks continue to call the city Constantinople (Κωνσταντινούπολη ''Konstantinupoli'' in Modern Greek) or simply "The City" (η Πόλη ''i Poli''). Languages that use forms based on ''Stamboul'' include [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] (though the alternative form of ''Istambuł'' is also universally accepted and employed in many translations), [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The Albanian form is ''Stamboll''; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form is ''Estambul''; the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form is ''Istambul'', with an ''m'' instead of an ''n''. [[Armenian language|Armenian]] uses ''Bolis'', based on the Greek ''Poli(s)'' 'City'. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] preserves the old Norse name ''Mikligarður'', though the form ''Istanbúl'' is generally used. In [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ''Carigrad'' is still largely used and often preferred over the official name.&lt;ref&gt;Seznam tujih imen v slovenskem jeziku. Geodetska uprava Republike Slovenije.

'''Nchum''' is one of the major Quarters of the Bafut Fondom in the North West province of [[Cameroon]]. Dr. Simon Awanchiri is vividly remembered for coordinating a series of developmental projects in this area, thanks to his collaborative work with the Canadian High commission in [[Yaoundé]]. Through this intermediary, the Quarter has seen developmental infrastructure like pipe-borne water and electricity.

To keep its youths disciplined and law abiding, Nchum is noted for its use of "keule mbang" or cracked [[Arecaceae|palm nut]] shells, which the suspect is asked to kneel on for as long as it takes him/her to tell the truth. The practice is said to have curb [[crime|crime wave]] in this region down to  as much as 60%.

The '''Nearctic''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s constituting the Earth's land surface.

[[Image:Ecozone Nearctic.svg|thumb|400px|The Nearctic realm]]
The Nearctic realm covers most of [[North America]], including [[Greenland]], [[Central Florida]], and the highlands of [[Mexico]]. The parts of North America that are not in the Nearctic realm are Eastern Mexico, [[Southern Florida]], coastal [[Central Florida]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands which are part of the [[Neotropical realm]], together with [[South America]].

==Major ecological regions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four '''[[bioregions]]''', defined as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)."

===Canadian Shield===
The [[Canadian Shield]] bioregion extends across the northern portion of the continent, from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It includes the Nearctic's [[Arctic Tundra]] and [[Boreal forest]] ecoregions.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Eastern North America===

The Eastern North America bioregion includes the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] of the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the [[Great Plains]] [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands]] of the Central United States and south-central Canada, the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the Southeastern United States, including [[Central Florida]]. In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Western North America===
The Western North America bioregion includes the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the coastal and mountain regions of southern Alaska, western Canada, and the Western United States from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] and [[Northern California]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], as well as the cold-winter intermountain [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] and temperate grasslands and shrublands of the [[Western United States]].

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Rocky Mountain region]].

===Northern Mexico and Southwestern North America===
The Northern Mexico bioregion includes the mild-winter to cold-winter deserts and xeric shrublands of northern Mexico, Southern [[California]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] Deserts. The [[Mediterranean climate]] [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Southern California|Southern]] and [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]] include the [[California chaparral and woodlands]], [[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion|California coastal sage and chaparral]], [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]], and [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]].

The bioregion also includes the warm temperate and subtropical pine and pine-oak forests, including the [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Oriental]], and [[Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests|Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir]] pine-oak forests.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Madrean Region]].

==History==
Although North America and South America are presently joined by the [[Isthmus of Panama]], these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of [[Pangaea]] split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to [[Eurasia]] as part of the supercontinent of [[Laurasia]], while South America was part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both [[Asia]] and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal [[species]] between the continents, the [[Great American Interchange]].

A former land bridge across the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the [[Palearctic]]. The two realms are sometimes included in a single '''[[Holarctic]]''' realm.

Many large animals, or [[megafauna]], including [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodont]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, sabre-tooth cats (''[[Smilodon]]''), the giant short-faced [[bear]] (''[[Arctodus simus]]''), and the [[cheetah]], became extinct in North America at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (ice ages), at the same time the first evidence of humans appeared, in what is called the [[Holocene extinction event]]. Previously, the megafaunal extinctions were believed to have been caused by the changing climate, but many scientists now believe, while the climate change contributed to these extinctions, the primary cause was hunting by newly arrived humans or, in the case of some large predators, extinction resulting from prey becoming scarce. The [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), [[brown bear]] or grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos''), [[moose]] or Eurasian elk (''Alces alces''), and [[elk]] or wapiti (''Cervus canadensis'') entered North America around the same time as the first humans, and expanded rapidly, filling ecological niches left empty by the newly extinct North American megafauna.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic===
Animals originally unique to the Nearctic include:
*Family [[Canidae]], [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[coyote]]s 
*Family [[Camelidae]], [[camel]]s and their South American relatives including the [[llama]]. now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Equidae]], [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and their relatives. now only found in the Nearctic as feral horses
*Family [[Tapiridae]], [[tapir]]s now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Antilocapridae]], last survivor of which is the [[pronghorn]]
*Subfamily [[Tremarctinae]], or short-faced, [[bear]]s, including the giant short-faced bear (''Arctodus simius'')   One other member of the group is the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus'') of South America.  now extinct in the Nearctic
*The [[American cheetah]] (''Miracinonyx'') now extinct worldwide

===Flora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic===
One [[bird]] family, the [[wrentit]]s (Timaliinae), is endemic to the Nearctic region. The Holarctic has four endemic families: [[Loon|divers]] (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and the [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae). The scarab beetle families [[Pleocomidae]] and [[Diphyllostomatidae]] ([[Coleoptera]]) are also endemic to the Nearctic. The fly species ''[[Cynomya cadaverina]]'' is also found in high numbers in this area.

Plants families endemic or nearly endemic to the Nearctic include the  [[Crossosomataceae]], [[Simmondsiaceae]], and [[Limnanthaceae]].

[[File:Phanerozoic Sea Level.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of two [[Sea-level curve|sea level reconstructions]] during the last 500 million years. The scale of change during the last glacial/interglacial transition is indicated with a black bar.&lt;ref&gt;Hallam et al. (1983) and "Exxon",  composite from several reconstructions published by the Exxon corporation (Haq et al. 1987, Ross &amp; Ross 1987, Ross &amp; Ross 1988). Both curves are adjusted to the 2004 ICS geologic timescale. 
Hallam et al. and Exxon use very different techniques to measuring global sea level changes. Hallam's approach is qualitative and relies on regional scale observations from exposed geologic sections and estimates of the areas of flooded continental interiors. Exxon's approach relies on the interpretation of seismic profiles to determine the extent of coastal onlap in subsequently buried sedimentary basins. &lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb|300px|[[Early Holocene sea level rise|Sea level rise]] since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].]]
Global or [[Sea level|eustatic sea level]] has fluctuated significantly over the Earth's history. The main factors affecting sea level are the amount and volume of available water and the shape and volume of the ocean basins. The primary influences on water volume are the temperature of the seawater, which affects [[density]], and the amounts of water retained in other reservoirs like rivers, aquifers, [[lake]]s, glaciers, [[polar ice cap]]s and [[sea ice]]. Over [[geological timescale]]s, changes in the shape of the oceanic basins and in land/sea distribution affect sea level. In addition to eustatic changes, local changes in sea level are caused by tectonic uplift and subsidence.

Over geologic time sea level has fluctuated by more than 300 metres, possibly  more than 400 metres. The main reason for sea level fluctuations 
is the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] and Antarctic [[post-glacial rebound]] during warm periods.

The current sea level is about 130 metres higher than the historical minimum, and more than 200 metres lower than the historical maximum, about 100 million years ago.
Historically low levels were reached during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM),  about 20,000 years ago. 
The last time the sea level was higher than today was during the [[Eemian]], about 130,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Murray-Wallace, C. V., &amp; Woodroffe, C. D. (n.d.). Pleistocene sea-level changes. Quaternary Sea-Level Changes, 256–319. {{doi|10.1017/cbo9781139024440.007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a shorter timescale, the low level reached during the LGM rebounded in the [[Early Holocene sea level rise|early Holocene]], between about 14,000 and 6,000 years ago, and sea levels have been comparably stable over the past 6,000 years. Observational and modeling studies of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|mass loss from glaciers and ice caps]] indicate a contribution to a sea-level rise of 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm over the 20th century. 
Based on [[Milankovitch_cycles|orbital models]], the cooling trend initiated about 6,000 years ago will continue for another 23,000 years. It is possible, however, that a "[[next glacial maximum]]" will be reached only in about 100,000 years, with a possible [[interstadial|warm period]] in 60,000 years.&lt;ref name="Imbriel1980"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J Imbrie |author2=J Z Imbrie |title=Modeling the Climatic Response to Orbital Variations |journal=Science |volume=207 |issue=4434 |year=1980 |pages=943–953 |doi=10.1126/science.207.4434.943 |pmid=17830447 |bibcode=1980Sci...207..943I}}

== Glaciers and ice caps ==
Each year about {{convert|8|mm|1|abbr=in}} of water from the entire surface of the oceans falls onto the [[Antarctica]] and [[Geography of Greenland|Greenland]] ice sheets as [[snowfall]]. If no ice returned to the oceans, sea level would drop {{convert|8|mm|1|abbr=on}} every year. To a first approximation, the same amount of water appeared to return to the ocean in [[iceberg]]s and from ice melting at the edges. Scientists previously had estimated which is greater, ice going in or coming out, called the [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]], important because it causes changes in global sea level. High-precision [[gravimetry]] from [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|satellites]] in low-noise flight has since determined that in 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss from 1988–2006 was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr² for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr² for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr². This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rignot|first=Eric |author2=I. Velicogna |author3=M.

[[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] float on the surface of the sea and, if they melt, to first order they do not change sea level. Likewise, the melting of the [[North pole|northern polar]] [[ice cap]] which is composed of floating [[pack ice]] would not significantly contribute to rising sea levels. However, because floating ice pack is lower in salinity than seawater, their melting would cause a very small increase in sea levels, so small that it is generally neglected.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* Scientists previously lacked knowledge of changes in terrestrial storage of water. Surveying of water retention by [[soil]] absorption and by artificial reservoirs ("impoundment") show that a total of about {{convert|10800|km3|0|abbr=off}} of water (just under the size of Lake Huron) has been impounded on land to date. Such impoundment masked about {{convert|30|mm|1|abbr=on}} of sea level rise in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=B. F.|author2=Y. H. Wu |author3=Y. S.

* Conversely estimates of excess global groundwater extraction during 1900–2008 totals ∼4,500 km3, equivalent to a sea-level rise of {{convert|12.6|mm|2|abbr=on}} (&gt;6% of the total).

* As most of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lie above the snowline and/or base of the permafrost zone, they cannot melt in a timeframe much less than several [[millennia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}; therefore it is likely that they will not, through melting, contribute significantly to sea level rise in the coming century.{{dubious|date=September 2017}} They can, however, do so through acceleration in flow and enhanced [[Ice calving|iceberg calving]].

* Estimates suggest that Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0.0 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm/yr over the 20th century as a result of long-term adjustment to the end of the last ice age.

The terrestrial storage term, thought to be highly uncertain, is no longer positive, and shown to be quite large.

== Geological influences ==

At times during [[History of earth|Earth's long history]], the configuration of the continents and sea floor has changed due to [[plate tectonics]]. This affects global sea level by altering the depths of various ocean basins and also by altering glacier distribution with resulting changes in glacial-interglacial cycles.  Changes in glacial-interglacial cycles are at least partially affected by changes in glacier distributions across the  a Earth.

The depth of the ocean basins is a function of the age of [[oceanic lithosphere]] (the tectonic plates beneath the floors of the world's oceans).  As older plates age, they become denser and sink, allowing newer plates to rise and take their place. Therefore, a configuration with many small [[oceanic plate]]s that rapidly recycle the oceanic lithosphere would produce shallower ocean basins and (all other things being equal) higher sea levels. A configuration with fewer plates and more cold, dense oceanic lithosphere, on the other hand, would result in deeper ocean basins and lower sea levels.

When there was much [[continental crust]] near the poles, the rock record shows unusually low sea levels during ice ages, because there was much polar land mass on which snow and ice could accumulate. During times when the land masses clustered around the equator, ice ages had much less effect on sea level.

Over most of geologic time, the long-term mean sea level has been higher than today (see graph above). Only at the [[Permian]]-[[Triassic]] boundary ~250 million years ago was the long-term mean sea level lower than today. Long term changes in the mean sea level are the result of changes in the [[oceanic crust]], with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=R. Dietmar |date=2008-03-07 |title=Long-Term Sea-Level Fluctuations Driven by Ocean Basin Dynamics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=319 |issue=5868 |pages=1357–1362 |doi=10.1126/science.1151540 |pmid=18323446|bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1357M |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the glacial-interglacial cycles over the past few million years, the mean sea level has varied by somewhat more than a hundred [[metre]]s. This is primarily due to the growth and decay of ice sheets (mostly in the northern hemisphere) with water evaporated from the sea.

The [[Mediterranean Basin]]'s gradual growth as the Neotethys basin, begun in the [[Jurassic]], did not suddenly affect ocean levels. While the Mediterranean was forming during the past 100 million years, the average ocean level was generally 200 [[metre]]s above current levels. However, the largest known example of marine flooding was when the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] breached the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] at the end of the [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]] about 5.2 million years ago. This restored Mediterranean sea levels at the sudden end of the period when that basin had dried up, apparently due to [[geology|geologic]] forces in the area of the Strait.

=== Changes through geologic time {{anchor|changes in geological time}} ===

Sea level has changed over [[geologic time]]. As the graph shows, sea level today is very near the lowest level ever attained (the lowest level occurred at the [[Permian]]-[[Triassic]] boundary about 250 million years ago).

During the most recent ice age (at its maximum about 20,000 years ago) the world's sea level was about 130&amp;nbsp;m lower than today, due to the large amount of [[sea water]] that had evaporated and been deposited as [[snow]] and [[ice]], mostly in the [[Laurentide ice sheet]]. Most of this had melted by about 10,000 years ago.

Hundreds of similar [[Glacial period|glacial cycles]] have occurred throughout the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. [[Geologists]] who study the positions of coastal sediment deposits through time have noted dozens of similar basinward shifts of shorelines associated with a later recovery. This results in [[sediment]]ary cycles which in some cases can be correlated around the world with great confidence. This relatively new branch of geological science linking eustatic sea level to sedimentary deposits is called [[sequence stratigraphy]].

The most up-to-date chronology of sea level change through the Phanerozoic shows the following long-term trends:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*Relative stability at the lower level during the [[Silurian]]
*A gradual fall through the [[Devonian]], continuing through the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] to long-term low at the Mississippian/[[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] boundary
*A gradual rise until the start of the [[Permian]], followed by a gentle decrease lasting until the [[Mesozoic]].

==== Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum ====
{{see|Early Holocene sea level rise}}
During deglaciation between about 19&amp;ndash;8 ka, sea level rose at extremely high rates as the result of the rapid melting of the British-Irish Sea, Fennoscandian, [[Laurentide ice sheet|Laurentide]], [[Barents–Kara Ice Sheet|Barents-Kara]], [[Patagonian Ice Sheet|Patagonian]], Innuitian [[Ice sheet|ice sheets]] and parts of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. At the onset of deglaciation about 19,000 calendar years ago, a brief, at most 500-year long, glacio-eustatic event may have contributed as much as 10 m to sea level with an average rate of about 20&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. During the rest of the early Holocene, the rate of sea level rise varied from a low of about 6.0–9.9 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr to as high as 30–60 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr during brief periods of accelerated sea level rise.&lt;ref name="Cronin2012a"&gt;Cronin, T. M. (2012) ''Invited review: Rapid sea-level rise.'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 56:11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011a"&gt;Blanchon, P. (2011a) ''Meltwater Pulses.'' In: Hopley, D.

Solid geological evidence, based largely upon analysis of deep cores of [[Coral reef|coral reefs]], exists only for 3 major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called ''meltwater pulses'', during the last deglaciation. They are [[Meltwater pulse 1A]] between circa 14,600 and 14,300 calendar years ago; [[Meltwater pulse 1B]] between circa 11,400 and 11,100 calendar years ago; and Meltwater pulse 1C between 8,200 and 7,600 calendar years ago. Meltwater pulse 1A was a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years centered at 14,200 calendar years ago and Meltwater pulse 1B was a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years centered at 11,000 years calendar years ago. In sharp contrast, the period between 14,300 and 11,100 calendar years ago, which includes the [[Younger Dryas]] interval, was an interval of reduced sea level rise at about 6.0–9.9 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr. Meltwater pulse 1C was centered at 8,000 calendar years and produced a rise of 6.5 m in less than 140 years.&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011b"&gt;Blanchon, P.

(1995) ''Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and icesheet collapse.'' Geology, 23:4–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Such rapid rates of sea level rising during [[meltwater]] events clearly implicate major ice-loss events related to ice sheet collapse. The primary source may have been meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet. Other studies suggest a Northern Hemisphere source for the meltwater in the Laurentide ice sheet.&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995a" /&gt;

Recently, it has become widely accepted that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of rate of rise that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological sites and late Holocene tidal marsh sediments, combined with tide gauge and satellite records and geophysical modeling. For example, this research included studies of Roman wells in [[Caesarea]] and of Roman ''[[Piscina|piscinae]]'' in Italy. These methods in combination suggest a mean eustatic component of 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm/yr for the last 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Cronin2012a" /&gt;

Since 1880, the ocean began to rise briskly, climbing a total of {{convert|210|mm|in|abbr=on}} through 2009 causing extensive erosion worldwide and costing billions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=John A.|last2=White|first2=Neil J.|title=Sea-Level Rise from the Late 19th to the Early 21st Century|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712%20%20-011-9119-1|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|language=en|volume=32|issue=4-5|doi=10.1007/s10712%20%20-011-9119-1|issn=0169-3298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html|title=Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries|last=GILLIS|first=JUSTIN|date=22 February 2016|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">In [[Cartography|mapmaking]], a '''quadrilateralized spherical cube''', or '''quad sphere''' for short, is an equal-area mapping and [[Data binning|binning]] scheme for data collected on a [[Sphere|spherical]] surface (either that of the Earth or the [[celestial sphere]]). It was first proposed in 1975 by Chan and O'Neill for the [[Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Environmental Prediction Research Facility]].&lt;ref name="Quad Feasibility Study"&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://ntrl.ntis.gov/NTRL/dashboard/searchResults/titleDetail/ADA010232.xhtml |title = Feasibility Study of a Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube Earth Data Base, Computer Sciences Corporation, EPRF Technical Report 2-75 (CSC) |last = Chan |first = F.K. |publisher = Environmental Prediction Research Facility |year = 1975 |isbn =  |location = Monterey, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scheme is also often called the '''COBE sky cube''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/skymap_info_new.cfm |title = COBE Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube }}&lt;/ref&gt;
because it was designed to hold data from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/icosahedron.html |title = What is the best way to pixelize a sphere? |author = [[Max Tegmark]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The quad sphere has two principal characteristic features. The first is that the mapping consists of projecting the sphere onto the faces of an inscribed cube using a [[Curvilinear perspective|curvilinear projection]] that preserves area. The sphere is divided into six equal regions, which correspond to the faces of the [[cube]]. The [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the cube correspond to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] coordinates defined by |''x''|=|''y''|=|''z''| on a sphere centred at the origin.  For an Earth projection, the cube is usually oriented with one face normal to the [[North Pole]] and one face centered on the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]] (although any definition of pole and meridian could be used). The faces of the cube are divided into a [[geodesic grid]] of square [[Bin (computational geometry)|bins]], where the number of bins along each edge is a [[Power of two|power of 2]], selected to produce the desired [[Histogram|bin size]]. Thus the number of bins on each face is 2&lt;sup&gt;2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''N'' is the binning depth, for a total of 6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, a binning depth of 10 gives 1024&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1024 bins on each face or 6291456 (6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) in all, each bin covering an area of 23.6&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] (2.00&amp;nbsp;micro[[steradian]]s).

The second key feature is that the bins are numbered serially, rather than being [[rasterisation|rastered]] as for an image. The total number of [[bit]]s required for the bin numbers at level ''N'' is 2''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3, where the three most significant bits are used for the face numbers and the remaining bits are used to number the bins within each face. The faces are numbered from 0 to 5: 0 for the north face, 1 through 4 for the equatorial faces (1 being on the meridian), and 5 for the south. Thus at a binning depth of 10, face 0 has bin numbers 0–1,048,575, face 1 has numbers 1,048,576–2,097,151, and so on. Within each face the bins are numbered serially from one corner (the convention is to start at the "lower left") to the opposite corner, ordered in such a way that each pair of bits corresponds to a level of bin resolution. This ordering is in effect a two-dimensional [[binary tree]], which is referred to as the ''[[quad-tree]]''.  The conversion between bin numbers and coordinates is straightforward.  If four-byte integers are used for the bin numbers the maximum practical depth, which uses 31 of the 32 bits, results in a bin size of 0.0922&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;arcminutes (7.80&amp;nbsp;nanosteradians).

In principle, the mapping and [[numbering scheme]]s are separable: the [[map projection]] onto the cube could be used with another bin-numbering scheme, and the numbering scheme itself could be used with any arrangement of bins susceptible to [[Partition of a set|partitioning]] into a set of square arrays.  Used together, they make a flexible and efficient system for storing map data.

==Advantages==
The quad sphere projection does not produce [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] at the poles or elsewhere, as do some other equal-area mapping schemes. Distortion is moderate over the entire sphere, so that at no point are shapes altered beyond recognition.

A '''sandplain''' is an area where the soil is sand deposited from elsewhere by processes such as wind or ocean, rather than direct weathering of [[bedrock]].

Sandplains are quite flat. There may be [[dune]] systems, and given time and the right conditions these may form [[eolianite]] ridges, but other than that there is little to give a sandplain any [[topography|topographical]] character.

Inland sandplains are often extremely infertile, because the sand is often low in nutrients when deposited, plus the good drainage means any nutrients are rapidly [[leaching (pedology)|leached]] away.

Coastal sandplains in [[intertidal zone]]s like those seen in the [[Wadden Sea]] in western Europe for example, are wet with nutrients added continuously, so they can often support a very rich and important fauna of birds, worms, [[mussel]]s, etc..

In North America, sandplains are often vegetated by [[pine barrens]]. In Western Australia, [[kwongan]] is the dominant vegetation.

== Terminology ==
Like the [[Slovaks#Name|Slovaks]], the [[Slovenes]] preserve the self-designation of the [[early Slavs]] as their ethnonym. The term  ''Slovenia'' ("Slovenija") was not in use prior to the early 19th century, when it was coined for political purposes by the Slovene [[Romantic nationalism|romantic nationalists]], most probably by some pupils of the linguist [[Jernej Kopitar]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Merchiers, ''Cultural Nationalism in the South Slav Habsburg Lands in the Early Nineteenth Century: the Scholarly Network of Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844)'' (Munich: O. Sagner, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It started to be used only from the 1840s on, when the quest for a politically autonomous [[United Slovenia]] within the [[Austrian Empire]] was first advanced during the [[Spring of Nations]]. "Slovenia" became a  ''de facto''     distinctive administrative and political entity for the first time in 1918, with the unilateral declaration of the  [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], that Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jurij Perovšek]], ''Slovenska osamosvojitev v letu 1918'' (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Slovenia did not exist as an autonomous administrative unit between 1921 and 1941, the [[Drava Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was frequently called simply "Slovenia", even in some official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Selan, ''Slovenija [Kartografsko gradivo]: Dravska banovina'' (Ljubljana: Kmetijska zbornica Dravske banovine, 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vinko Vrhunec, ''Slovenija v šestletki cestnih del'' (Ljubljana: Banovinska uprava Dravske banovine, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrej Gosar]], ''Banovina Slovenija: politična, finančna in gospodarska vprašanja'' (Ljubljana: [[Dejanje]], 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, most Slovene scholars prefer to refer to the "Slovene Lands" in English rather than "Slovenia" to describe the territory of modern Slovenia and neighbouring areas in earlier times. The use of the English term "Slovenia" is generally considered by Slovene scholars to be anachronistic due to its modern origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Štih]], [[Vasko Simoniti]], [[Peter Vodopivec]], ''Slowenische Geschichte: Gesellschaft - Politik - Kultur'' (Graz: Leykam, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical extension ==

In the 19th century, the territories regarded as part of the Slovene Lands were:&lt;ref&gt;Branko Božič, ''Zgodovina slovenskega naroda'' (Ljubljana: Prešernova družba, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Jennersdorf]] in the Kingdom of Hungary (now in [[Burgenland]], [[Austria]]);
* most of the [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca]], except for the lowlands south-west of [[Gradisca]] and [[Cormons]], which were already part of historical [[Friuli]]

* northern [[Istria]], in the modern municipalities of [[Koper]], [[Izola]], [[Piran]], [[Hrpelje-Kozina]], [[Muggia]] and [[San Dorligo della Valle|Dolina]]
* [[Venetian Slovenia]] (Italian: ''Slavia Vèneta''), until 1797 part of the [[Republic of Venice]], later [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]

The [[Žumberak]] and the area around [[Čabar]], which today belong to [[Croatia]], were long part of the [[Duchy of Carniola]], and thus generally regarded as part of the Slovene Lands,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} especially prior to the emergence of [[Romantic nationalism]] in the 19th century, when the exact ethnic border between [[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]] had not yet been specified.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Not all of the territories referred to as "Slovene Lands" have always had a Slovene-speaking majority. Several towns, especially in Lower Styria, maintained a [[German language|German-speaking]] majority until the late 1910s, most notably [[Maribor]], [[Celje]] and [[Ptuj]].&lt;ref&gt;Janez Cvirn: ''Trdnjavski trikotnik'' (Maribor: Obzorja, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The area around [[Kočevje]] in [[Lower Carniola]], known as the [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]], had a predominantly [[Gottscheers|German-speaking population]] between the 14th century and 1941 when they were resettled in an agreement between [[Nazi German]] and [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italian]] occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mitja Ferenc]], ''Kočevska: izgubljena kulturna dediščina kočevskih Nemcev'' (Ljubljana: [[National Museum of Contemporary History|Muzej novejše zgodovine]], 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar German "linguistic island" within an ethnically Slovene territory existed in what is now the Italian ''[[comune]]'' of [[Tarvisio]], but used to belong to the Duchy of Carinthia until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Bahovec, Das österreichisch-italienisch-slovenische Dreiländereck: Ursachen und Folgen der nationalstaatlichen Dreiteilung einer Region (Klagenfurt - Ljubljana: [[Hermagoras Society|Hermagoras/Mohorjeva]], 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Trieste]], whose municipal territory has been regarded by Slovenes to be an integral part of the Slovene Lands, has always had a [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking majority (first [[Friulian]], then [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jože Pirjevec]], ''"Trst je naš!" Boj Slovencev za morje (1848-1954)'' (Ljubljana: [[Nova revija (publishing company)|Nova revija]], 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case is that of the town of [[Gorizia]], which served as a major religious center of the Slovene Lands for centuries, but was inhabited by a mixed Italian-Slovene-Friulian-German population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aldo Rupel]] et al., ''Krajevni leksikon Slovencev v Italiji'' (Trieste - Duino: SLORI, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The towns of [[Koper]], [[Izola]] and [[Piran]], surrounded by an ethnically Slovene population, were inhabited almost exclusively by Venetian-speaking [[Italians]] until the [[Istrian exodus]] in the late 1940s and 1950s, as were large areas of the ''comune'' of [[Muggia]]. In southern Carinthia, a process of [[Germanization]] started by the end of the 1840s, creating several German-speaking areas within what had previously been a compact Slovene territory. Since the late 1950s, most of southern Carinthia has had a German-speaking majority, with the local [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene minority]] living in a scattered pattern throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Moritsch &amp; Thomas M. Barker, ''The Slovene Minority of Carinthia'' (New York: [[Columbia University Press]], 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, other areas with historically important Slovene communities, such as the [[Croatia]]n cities of [[Rijeka]] and [[Zagreb]], as well as the Slovene villages in the [[Somogy County|Somogy]] county of [[Hungary]] (the [[Slovenes in Somogy|Somogy Slovenes]]), were never regarded to be part of the Slovene Lands.&lt;ref&gt;''Etnologija Slovencev na Madžarskem = A
Magyarországi szlovének néprajza'' (Budapest: A Magyar Néprajzi Társaság, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the Slovene communities in south-west [[Friuli]] (in the villages of Gradisca, Gradiscutta, Gorizzo, Goricizza, [[Lestizza]], and Belgrado in the lower [[Tagliamento]] area) which extinguished themselves by the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdo Gestrin]], ''Slovanske migracije v Italijo'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovenska matica]], 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vinex''' (''"'''Vi'''erde '''N'''ota Ruimtelijke Ordening '''Ex'''tra"'', translates as Fourth Memorandum Spatial Planning Extra), is a [[memorandum#Policy briefing note|policy briefing note]] of the Dutch [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] (''Ministry of VROM'') released in 1988.&lt;ref name="Vinex atlas"&gt;Jelte Boeijenga, Jeroen Mensink: ''Vinex Atlas'', 010 Publishers, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Large outer city areas were pointed out by the policy for massive new housing development.

==Main points of the VINEX policy==
To accommodate the increasing population in the [[Netherlands]] the Ministry of VROM determined a number of main points in the Vinex-document for the construction of new housing districts starting in 1993. New districts had to be placed near existing town centers and had to contribute to the following aims:

* Endorsement of existing [[malls]] (Increasing the potential number of customers)
* Limit the removals of unsatisfied inhabitants in medium-large cities
* Protection of open areas by concentrating the agglomerations around existing medium-large cities
* Limit traffic between residencies, work and stores (short distances offer more possibilities for [[public transport]], bicycles and walking)

The Vinex-locations also had to diminish the unfair pricing of housing. This means that certain households live in housing that is too affordable when compared to their income, as a result of which these houses no longer become available to households with a lower income. So they tried to solve the shortage of [[affordable housing]] by luring wealthier households to the more expensive Vinex-locations. Nevertheless, the Vinex-locations had a determined share of affordable rentable houses.
