      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="706">In [[philosophy]], '''absolute theory''' (or '''absolutism''')&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; usually refers to a theory based on concepts (such as the concept of space) that exist independently of other concepts and objects. The absolute point of view was advocated in physics by [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/ "Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An absolute theory is the opposite of a [[relational theory]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

==Biography==

Hopkins earned his BA in Philosophy from [[Allegheny College]] in Pennsylvania under the direction of James F. Sheridan, his MA in Philosophy at [[Ohio University]] under the direction of Algis Mickunas, and his Ph.D. in Philosophy from [[DePaul University]] in Chicago under the direction of [[Parvis Emad]]. He is founding co-editor (with [[Steven Crowell]]) of ''The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maney Publishing|url=http://www.maneypublishing.com/index.php/journals/nyppp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic work==

Hopkins is best known for his work on [[Husserl]] and [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], although he has also published on Plato,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/epoche/content/epoche_2010_0015_0002_0279_0298|title=The Unwritten Teachings in Plato’s Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=16173473&amp;AN=91978097&amp;h=nS%2fp%2bZu1E4X83uASWRj2%2bxdhWDEAOWwBoaucLOnZaU2Lv82EHyxobdkEFEPmJOhQDDjbxMWrdCKiGyHapn437g%3d%3d&amp;crl=f|title=Manifold, Intuition, and Synthesis in Kant and Husserl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intentionality in Husserl and Heidegger : an interpretative appraisal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Burt_Hopkins/publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Derrida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Derrida and Husserl: The end of a controversy|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/HOPDAH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1993 book '' Intentionality in Husserl and Heidegger: The Problem of the Original Method and Phenomenon of Phenomenology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Springer Publishing|url=https://www.springer.com/philosophy/philosophical+traditions/book/978-0-7923-2074-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; defends the philosophical superiority of Husserl’s transcendental phenomenological method over Heidegger’s hermeneutical refashioning of phenomenology’s method. Hopkins’s general argument is that Heidegger’s hermeneutical critique of Husserl’s reflective phenomenology of consciousness presupposes the structures of Husserl’s phenomenology that are the targets of that critique. According to [[WorldCat]], the book is held in 147 libraries.&lt;ref name=wca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n92103122|title=Hopkins, Burt C.  [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2010 book ''The Philosophy of Husserl'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Philosophy-of-Husserl/Hopkins/p/book/9781844650118|publisher=McGill-Queens University Press|title=The Philosophy of Husserl}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents a defense of Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology from the critiques of Heidegger and Derrida. It does so by challenging their common claim that Husserl’s thought is historically determined by the limits of Greek ontology and metaphysics. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 232 libraries.&lt;ref name=wca /&gt;

His 2011 book, ''The Origin of the Logic of Symbolic Mathematics: Edmund Husserl and Jacob Klein'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=700863|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares Klein’s largely overlooked ''Greek Mathematics and the Origin of Algebra (1934 and 1936)'' with Husserl’s  concern to provide a philosophical foundation for the formalization of logic and mathematics. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 232 libraries.&lt;ref name =wca /&gt;

'''Buta Kola''' is a ritual folk dance from the coastal districts ([[Tulu Nadu]]) of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. The dance is highly stylized and held in honor of the local deities worshiped by the [[Tulu people|Tulu]] speaking population. It bears resemblance to the [[Theyyam]] of [[Kerala]] and has influenced [[Yakshagana]] folk theatre. Buta Kola could be categorized as a form of [[Shamanism]] as the dancer performing it goes into a trance and acts as an [[oracle]] for the deity being impersonated.

The Word is derived from ''būta'' ([[Tulu language|Tulu]] for ‘spirit’, ‘deity’; in turn derived from Sanskrit भूत for ‘free elements’,'which is purified','fit','proper', ‘true’,'past','creatures'; Anglicized: ''‘bhuta’, ‘bhoota’, ‘bootha’'') and ''kōla'' ([[Tulu language|Tulu]] for ‘play, performance, festival’).

A ''būta kōla'' or ''nema'' is typically an annual ritual performance where local spirits or deities (''būtas, daivas'') are being impersonated by ritual specialists from certain scheduled castes such as the Nalike, Pambada, or Parawa communities. The ''būta'' cult is prevalent among the non-Brahmin
[[Tuluvas]] of [[Tulu Nadu]] region .&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brückner|first=Heidrun|date=1987|title=Bhuta Worship in Coastal Karnataka: An Oral Tulu Myth and Festival Ritual of Jumadi|url=|journal=Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik |volume=13/14|pages=17–37|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brückner|first=Heidrun|date=1992|title="Dhumavati-Bhuta" An Oral Tulu-Text Collected in the 19th Century.

== Performance ==

The ritual performance at a ''būta kōla'' or ''daiva nēma'' involves music, dance, recital, and elaborate costumes. Recitals in Old Tulu recount the origins of the deity and tell the story of how it came to the present location. These epics are known as ''pāḍdanas.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claus|first=Peter J.|date=1978|title=Heroes and Heroines in the Conceptual Framework of Tulu Culture|url=|journal=Journal of Indian Folkloristics |volume=1 |issue=2|pages=28–42|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claus|first=Peter J.|date=1978|title=Oral Traditions, Royal Cults and Material for the Reconsideration of the Caste System in South India|url=|journal=Journal of Indian Folkloristics |volume=1 |issue=1|pages=1–39|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claus|first=Peter J.|date=1979|title=Spirit Possession and Spirit Mediumship from the Perspective of Tulu Oral Traditions|url=|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry |volume=3|pages=29–52|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tübingen Tulu Manuscript – Two South Indian Oral Epics Collected in the 19th Century.|last=Brückner|first=Heidrun|last2=Rai|first2=Vivek|publisher=Harrassowitz|year=2015|isbn=|location=Wiesbaden|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Kannālaye: The place of a Tuḷu Pāḍdana among Interrelated Oral Traditions."

== Types of Būtas ==

Thurston counts among the best known deities "Brahmeru, Kodamanitaya, Kukkintaya, [[Jumadi]], Sarala Jumadi, Pancha Jumadi, [[Rakteswari]], Panjurli, Kuppe Panjurli, Rakta Panjurli, Jarandaya, Urundarayya, Hosadēvata (or Hosa Bhūta), Dēvanajiri, Kalkuḍa, Tukkateri, Gulige, Bobbariya, Nicha, Duggalaya, Mahisandaya, Varte, Chāmundi, Baiderukulu, Ukkatiri, Kallurti, Shiraadi, Ullalthi, Okkuballala, and Odityay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Vol. V.|last=Thurston|first=Edgar|last2=Rangachari|first2=K.|publisher=Government Press|year=1909|isbn=|location=Madras|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, [[Jumadi]] is the small-pox goddess Māri. The Bhūtas are supposed to belong to different castes. For example Okkuballala and Dēvanajiri are [[Jain Bunt |Jains]], Kodamanitaya and Kukkinataya are [[Bunt_(community)|Bunts]], Kalkuḍa is a smith, Bobbariya is a Māppilla, and Nicha a [[Koraga people|Koraga]]." Some of them are ancestral spirits such as ''Bobbariya'', ''Kalkuḍa'', ''Kallurti'', ''[[Epic of Siri|Siri]]'', ''Kumār'' [[Koti and Chennayya]]. Some are deified wild animals such as the boar - ''Paňjurli'' (the female counterpart is ''Varte Paňjurli'') or the tiger - ''Pilichāmuṇḍi.''

Some ''būtas'' are [[Androgynous]] such as some instances of [[Jumadi]] who is represented as female below the neck (breasts), but with a male head sporting a mustache.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are anthropomorphic ''būtas'', zoomorphic ones, and mixed forms (such as the Malarāya of Kodlamogaru, Kasargod, who has the head of a wild boar and the body of a woman).

Depending on the significance of the people who worship them, ''būtas'' or ''daivas'' can be family deities (''kuṭuṃbada būta''), local or village deities (''jāgeda būta'', ''ūrada būta''), or deities associated with administrative units such as manorial estates (''guțțus''), groups of estates (''māgane''), districts (''sīme'') or even small kingdoms (royal ''būtas'' or ''rajandaivas'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Cosmology ==
According to the ethnographer Peter Claus, the Tulu ''pāḍdanas'' reveal a cosmology which is distinctly Dravidian and thus different from the Puranic Hindu cosmology.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Importantly, priesthood is not the preserve of a caste learned in scriptures but is shared between the ruling aristocracy on one hand and ritual specialists from the lower strata of society on the other hand. The world is divided in two three realms: firstly, the realm of cultivated lands (grāmya), secondly the realm of wastelands and forests (jāṅgala/āraṇya), and thirdly the realm of spirits (būta-loka). Grāmya and jāṅgala/āraṇya form part of the tangible world, whereas būta-loka is their intangible counterpart. As grāmya is constantly threatened by encroachment, disease, hunger and death form jāṅgala and āraṇya, so is the tangible world under constant threat from the intangible world of the spirits. The world of the forest is the "world of the wild, unordered, uncontrolled, hungry beings of destruction".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The world of the forest and the world of the spirits are therefore seen as mirror images of each other. The wild animals threatening the human cultivator and his fields such as the tiger, the snake, the wild-boar, and the bison, find their mirror images in their corresponding būtas ''Pilli, Naga, Paňjurli'' and ''Maisandaya''.

The relationship between these three worlds is one of balance and moral order. If this order is upset by the humans, it is believed that the spirits become vicious. If the order is maintained, the spirits are believed to be supportive and benevolent. Thus, the spirits of [[Tulu people|Tulu]] culture are neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ as such; they are "neither cruel nor capricious. They methodically and persistently remind a lax humanity of the need for morality and the value of solidarity".&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claus|first=Peter J.|date=1973|title=Possession, Protection and Punishment as Attributes of the Deities in a South Indian Village.|url=|journal=Man in India |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages= 231–242.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody is believed to be above the moral and cosmological norms of this threefold universe, not even the spirits or the gods. Thus the ''būta''s are not whimsical or arbitrary in their judgement. The ''būta''s are their patron’s protectors with regard to a system of moral norms, not despite them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Feudal relations of tribute and fealty mark the relations among the humans in the tangible world, among spirits in the intangible world and between humans and spirits across tangible and intangible worlds. While the world of humans is ruled by a mortal king, the world of the spirits is ruled by Bermeru, the lord of the forest and of the būtas. And just as the landed aristocracy depended on protection and support from their king, the world of humans depends on protection and support from the spirits. Thus once in a year at the time of ''kōla'' or ''nēma'', the lord of the human world (patriarch, landlord, king) has to be reconfirmed in his authority by reporting to the spirit to which he is accountable. While the temporal lord’s authority is dependent on the spirit'';'' the authority of the spirit is guaranteed by the active participation of the villagers in the ritual. Thereby a certain degree of political legitimacy is upheld by the active participation of the villagers. Their withdrawal from the ritual can seriously affect the authority of the landlord.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrin|first=Marine|last2=Tambs-Lyche|first2=Harald|date=2003|title=‘You don’t joke with these fellows.’ Power and Ritual in South Canara, India.|url=|journal=Social Anthropology |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages= 23–42.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Claus observes, the principal mediators in this network of feudal transactions are communities who once upon a time may have led a liminal life between grāmya and jāṅgala/āraṇya.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Tribal communities living in and off the forest and trading in forest products were predestined to serve as spirit impersonators as their life world, the forest, is only the tangible side of the world of the spirits. In pursuit of their livelihood they regularly transgress structural boundaries between village and forest. They live on the margins of the village, in the wasteland between forest and field, thus they are themselves, in a sense, liminal. That such liminal people should be mediums for the spirits seems entirely apt. Today communities like Nalike, Parava or Pambada who impersonate different kinds of ''būtas'' and ''daivas'' can no longer be characterised as tribal. They are mostly landless agricultural labourers in the wet season and spirit impersonators in the dry season.

== Worship ==
[[File:Kantheri Dhumavathi 01.jpg|thumb|The temple of the deity Jumadi in Mangalore, India]]
Today feudal relations no longer obtain and thus former ruling families no longer hold any political or judicial office. But still the village demands that they sponsor their annual ''kōla'' or ''nēma'' to honour the village deity. The people believe that the neglect of the spirits will make their life miserable.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Even though they may have changed, ''būta kōla'' and ''daiva'' ''nēma'' still serve secular as well as religious purposes. In fact the two cannot be separated in a world where the tangible is suffused with the intangible. As the cosmology underlying the ''pāḍdanas'' suggests, the very order of the human world and the order of the spirit world are interdependent.

''Būtas'' and ''daivas'' are not worshipped on a daily basis like mainstream Hindu gods. Their worship is restricted to annual ritual festivals, though daily ''pūjās'' may be conducted for the ritual objects, ornaments, and other paraphernalia of the būta.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unlike with the better-known [[Hinduism|Hindu]] gods of the ''purāṇic'' variety, ''būta'' worship is congregational.
== Secular Function ==
The secular function of the ''kōla'' or ''nēma'' has been described as a "sacred court of justice" where traditional (feudal) moral ideals are brought to bear on difficult real-life situations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; ''Būta kōlas'' and ''daiva'' ''nēmas'' are assemblies of the entire village. Thus they become an occasion to resolve conflicts in the village.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The royal ''daiva'' (''rājan-daiva)'' rules over a former small kingdom or large feudal estate. He or she is mostly the family deity of rich land-owning patrons of the ''[[Bunt_(community)|Baṇṭ]]'' caste whose position and power they reflect, confirm and renew.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The relationship between the ''būtas'', manor heads, and the villagers forms a transactional network which reaffirms the caste hierarchy and power relations in a village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The duty assigned to every category is differential but based on mutuality. The manor head by staging the ''nēma'' seeks to symbolically proclaim himself to be the natural leader of the community.

The villagers offer ''sēva'' during the ''nēma'' in the form of service and prostrations and in doing so also offer their support to the ''nēma'' and their recognition of the leader’s status. In return, the villagers expect justice and resolution of disputes by the ''daiva'' during the ''nēma.'' In the ''nēma'', the leading manors offer a part of their farm products to the ''daiva'', which are then redistributed to the villagers. The ''nēma'' thereby underlines the mutuality on which feudal relations used to be based and, in a limited way, takes care of the problem of social (distributive) justice. The ''būta''s receive these offerings and in return give oracles and blessings to ensure the future prosperity of the village (humans, animals, fields). Finally, a part of these offerings will be distributed as ''prasāda'' among the heads of the ''guṭṭus'' and other villagers according to their ranks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The system of entitlements is constituted in, or embodied by, the mutual gifting activity between the ''būta''s, as the ultimate owner of the land, and people in rituals, creating a transactional network among them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ritual Script ==
The script of the ritual changes from one n''ēmā'' to another, thus the following description is somewhat ideal-typical. The ritual begins with the paraphernalia of the ''būta'' being brought to the shrine which serves as a venue for the festival. They are placed on an altar or on a swinging cot, which is the insignium of a royal būta (''rajan-daiva''). The Nalike, Parava or Pambada medium prepares for the impersonation of the spirit with a recital of from the ''pāḍdana'' of the ''būta'' or ''daiva''. After this, the medium starts putting on make-up and dressing up in his costume which may include an elaborate ''ani'' (a giant halo stringed to the back of the dancer). Finally, the medium is given the ornaments from the hoard of the shrine. As he enters the arena, the attendant of the spirit (''pātri'') gives him his sword, his bell and other paraphernalia and the patron (''jajmān'') gives him one or several burning torches. As the medium begins to dance, the spirit enters his body. Two people hold the torches along with the medium at all times. Thus, the entrance of spirit into this world is restrained. The medium’s dance gains more force as the possession continues. He brings the torches dangerously close to his body. The ''jajmān'' now stands in a ritualistic circle on the ground with his assistants and offerings are made to the ''būta''. These offerings often include the sacrifice of a chicken whose blood is sprinkled on the ground to enhance the fertility of the land.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These sacrificial acts are followed by offerings of puffed rice, beaten rice, coconut pieces, bananas, ghee, betel leaf, and areca nut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Gods Going Wild?

Complaints and judgements are made orally. The ''būta'' issues the judgement after hearing the sides of the plaintiff as well as the defendant, if both are present. The ''būta’s'' justice must be referrable to general principles. "''He may take a stand, he cannot take sides”''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While the ''būta'' may take the opinions of the village headman and other eminent persons into consideration, the ultimate judgement rests with the ''būta''. Sometimes judgements are also issued by the tossing of betel leaves and the counting of flower petals (usually areca flower). Particularly difficult cases may also be adjourned to the next year by the ''būta''. Some common disputes that come up are related to land issues, family feuds, questions of honour, robbery, debt, mortgage, breach of contract etc. In cases of theft where the offender is unknown, the ''būta'' may ask for a certain offering before finding the thief. At times the victim offers the entire value of the stolen goods to the ''būta''. If the thief is found and penalised, the person is made to pay to the plaintiff a sum that is more than the value of the goods stolen. If the ''būta'' feels that the thief shows repentance, the gravity of the penalty could be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Judicial Aspects of Bhuta Cult." In Coastal Karnataka.

== Possession ==
[[File:Castes and tribes of southern India. Assisted by K. Rangachari (1909) (14587481627).jpg|thumb|Buta Kola dancer from the Parava caste. circa 1909 ]]
The art of being an impersonator is learned. Young boys belonging to the ''Pambada, Parava,'' ''Nalike'' castes attend rituals where their kin is performing; and they help out with shredding the coconut leaves for the garment of the impersonator, holding the mirror while the impersonator is putting on the makeup etc. They learn the art of the performance by observing the performance of their kin and trying to mimic it.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishii|first=Miho|date=2013|title=Playing with Perspectives: Spirit Possession, Mimesis, and Permeability in the Buuta Ritual in South India.|url=|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=19 |issue= |pages= 795–812|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being able to mimic the way their kin performed, what is essential to be a successful impersonator is also the aptitude of being possessed by the deity. There are certain rules the impersonator needs to follow to prepare his body for the possession. This may include being a vegetarian and not drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The impersonator feels the sudden spirit possession only for a few seconds but after that he is filled with the deity’s energy that lets him behave as the deity for the entire ritual.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

There are two types of mediators between the spirits and the humans. The first type of mediator is known as the ''pātri.'' These are members of middle castes such as ''[[Bunt_(community)|Bunt]]'' (land-owners) and ''[[Billava]]'' (toddy tappers, formerly also bow-men).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second type of mediator ("impersonators") typically belongs to scheduled castes such as ''Pambada, Parava or Nalike.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ''pātri'' has only a sword and a bell as ritual tools, the impersonator uses makeup, ornaments, masks etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both mediums are believed to impersonate from an altered state of consciousness. But while the impersonator may speak as the ''būta'' (in the first person) and about the ''būta'' (in the third person, i.e. when he recounts his/her ''pāḍdana''), the pātri only speaks as the būta in the first person.

== Pāḍdana ==
''Pāḍdanas'' are major part of [[Tuluvas|Tuluva]] oral literature.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Much of the body of this literature has been built on the legends of the ''būtas'' and ''daivas''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Pāḍdanas'' have numerous variations for the same narrative. As in other epic traditions, there is no single author. ''Pāḍdanas'' are orally transmitted and recited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The language of the ''pāḍdanas'' is old [[Tulu language|Tulu]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some famous examples are the ''Siri-Kumar Pāḍdanas'' and the [[Koti and Chennayya]] ''Pāḍdanas.'' The ''pāḍdanas'' sung by women while planting paddy are referred to as ‘field songs’.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The ''pāḍdanas'' recite the origins of the spirits and deities. This is one way for the rituals to reconstruct the past and render a legitimization to it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The singers act as the indigenous narrators of the history of the native land. The ''pāḍdanas'' also stand in opposition to the ''puranic,'' male based principles as they highlight the feminine principles of mother earth. The ''pāḍdanas'' also reflect multi-socio-cultural background shifts (for example, the move from [[Matrilineality|Matrilineal]] system to [[Patrilineality|Patrilineal]] system). The older sense of cosmology is retained through the ''pāḍdanas''. The ''pāḍdanas'' also reflect processes of Hinduisation and Sanskritization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Canadian Society for Continental Philosophy (CSCP)''' is an organization whose purpose is to pursue and exchange philosophical ideas inspired by [[Continental European tradition]]s. It was established in 1984 under the name '''Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmodern Thought''' and its name changed in 2004. CSCP also publishes ''[[Symposium: Canadian Journal of Continental Philosophy]]'' and holds an annual meeting in Canada each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFP: Canadian Society for Continental Philosophy {{!}}|url=http://www.spep.org/papers/cfp-canadian-society-for-continental-philosophy/|website=[[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]]|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Conference of the Canadian Society for Continental Philosophy|url=https://www.concordia.ca/cuevents/main/2015/10/29/conference-of-the-canadian-society-of-continental-philosophy.html|website=www.concordia.ca|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Society for Continental Philosophy: All Thoughts are Equal — University of Minnesota Press|url=https://www.upress.umn.edu/press/press-clips/canadian-society-for-continental-philosophy-all-thoughts-are-equal|website=www.upress.umn.edu|accessdate=3 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He received his BA and PhD in Philosophy from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], the University of Sani Tomas in Rome, and the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), while also studying Economics in the Complutense University.

==Career==

In 1958, Llano launched ISTMO magazine, which publishes articles about humanist thought and ideas about society. In 1967, he founded the IPADE Business School, which has been ranked among the top 10 Business Schools in the world by [[Forbes|''Forbes'' magazine]] and the ''[[Financial Times]]''. He also founded the [[Universidad Panamericana]] in 1967, which now has three campuses in Mexico — [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara]], and [[Aguascalientes]] — and is ranked as a top-tier Mexican university.

Llano wrote many books and papers on the topic of philosophy and business, especially on the anthropology of management action.&lt;ref name="Mele2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tv4JAQAAMAAJ|title=Business Ethics in Action: Seeking Human Excellence in Organizations|author=Mele|first=Domenec|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=978-0-230-57310-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNulty(USA)1969"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUosAAAAMAAJ|title=Training managers: the international guide|author1=McNulty|first=Nancy G.|author2=Council for International Progress in Management (USA)|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?|Plato|Euthyphro&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;}}
The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18956">{{Distinguish|Donatism}}

In [[Christianity]], '''docetism''' (from the {{lang-grc-koi|δοκεῖν/δόκησις}} ''dokeĩn'' "to seem", ''dókēsis'' "apparition, phantom",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|González|2005|pp=46–47}}: "A term derived from the Greek ''dokein'', to seem, or to appear."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strecker|2000|p=438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the doctrine that the phenomenon of [[Jesus]], his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brox|1984|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneemelcher|Maurer|1994|p=220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion.

The word {{lang|grc|Δοκηταί}} ''Dokētaí'' ("Illusionists") referring to early groups who denied Jesus's humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop [[Serapion of Antioch]] (197–203),{{sfn|Breidenbaugh|2008|p=179–81}} who discovered the doctrine in the [[Gospel of Peter]], during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in [[Arsuz|Rhosus]], and later condemned it as a forgery.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=16}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|2009|p=79}}. Serapion first approved its use, and only reversed his opinion on returning to his bishopric in Antioch, after being informed of its contents. He wrote a "Concerning the So-Called Gospel of St&amp;nbsp;Peter", which is alluded to in [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' VI&amp;nbsp;12.3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the [[Gospel of John]]: "the Word was made Flesh".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Wace|1877|pp=867–870}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Docetism was unequivocally rejected at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325&lt;ref name="Ridgeon 2001 xv"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgeon|2001|p=xv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]] by the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Orthodox Tewahedo]],{{sfn|Arendzen|2012}} and many other Christian denominations that accept and hold to the statements of these early church councils.

==Definitions==
Docetism is broadly defined as any teaching that claims that Jesus' body was either absent or illusory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonzalez|first=Justo|title=Essential Theologial Terms|year=2005|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-664-22810-0|pages=46–47|quote=Docetism is the claim that Jesus did not have a physical human body, but only the appearance of such.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'docetic' is rather nebulous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brox|1984|pp=301–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneemelcher|Maurer|1994|p=220}}: "N Brox has expressed himself emphatically against a widespread nebulous use of the term, and has sought an exact definition which links up with the original usage (e.g. in Clement of Alexandria). Docetism is 'the doctrine according to which the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Two varieties were widely known. In one version, as in [[Marcionism]], Christ was so divine that he could not have been human, since God lacked a material body, which therefore could not physically suffer. Jesus only ''appeared'' to be a flesh-and-blood man; his body was a phantasm. Other groups who were accused of docetism held that Jesus was a man in the flesh, but Christ was a separate entity who entered Jesus's body in the form of a dove at his baptism, empowered him to perform miracles, and abandoned him upon his death on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ehrman|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christology and theological implications==
Docetism's origin within Christianity is obscure. [[Ernst Käsemann]] controversially defined the Christology of St John’s Gospel as "naïve docetism" in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ehrman|1996|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing debate reached an impasse as awareness grew that the very term "docetism", like "gnosticism", was difficult to define within the religio-historical framework of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2008|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has occasionally been argued that its origins were in heterodox [[Judaism]] or Oriental and Grecian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gavrilyuk|2004|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged connection with [[Jewish Christian]]ity would have reflected Jewish Christian concerns with the inviolability of (Jewish) [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneemelcher|Maurer|1994|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brox|1984|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Docetic opinions seem to have circulated from very early times, [[Epistles of John#First Epistle of John|1 John 4:2]] appearing explicitly to reject them.&lt;ref name="González2005"&gt;{{harvnb|González|2005|pp=46–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1st{{nbhyph}}century Christian groups developed docetic interpretations partly as a way to make Christian teachings more acceptable to pagan ways of thinking about divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gavrilyuk|2004 |p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his critique of the theology of [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] in his [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Myriobiblon]] held that Clement's views reflected a quasi-docetic view of the nature of Christ, writing that "[Clement] hallucinates that the Word was not incarnate but ''only seems to be''." (ὀνειροπολεῖ καὶ μὴ σαρκωθῆναι τὸν λόγον ἀλλὰ ''δόξαι''.)  In Clement's time, some disputes contended over whether Christ assumed the "psychic" flesh of mankind as heirs to [[Adam]], or the "spiritual" flesh of the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashwin-Siejkowski|2010|p=95, n.2}} citing {{harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Docetism largely died out during the first millennium AD.

The opponents against whom [[Ignatius of Antioch]] inveighs are often taken to be [[Monophysite]] docetists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Streett|2011|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[letter to the Smyrnaeans|letter to the Smyrnaeans, 7:1]], written around 110{{nbsp}}AD, he writes:
{{quote|They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes.}} 
While these characteristics fit a Monophysite framework, a slight majority of scholars consider that Ignatius was waging a polemic on two distinct fronts, one Jewish, the other docetic; a minority holds that he was concerned with a group that commingled Judaism and docetism. Others, however, doubt that there was actual docetism threatening the churches, arguing that he was merely criticizing Christians who lived Jewishly or that his critical remarks were directed at an [[Ebionism|Ebionite]] or [[Cerinthus|Cerinthian]] possessionist Christology, according to which Christ was a heavenly spirit that temporarily possessed Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Streett|2011|pp=42–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam and docetism==
{{main|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}

Some commentators have attempted to make a connection between Islam and Docetism using the following Quranic verse:&lt;ref name=parrinder&gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus in the Qur'an|author=Geoffrey Parrinder|publisher=Oneworld Publications|year=2013|pages=112,118-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger &amp;mdash; they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. But Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise.{{Cite Quran|4|157|e=58|tn=p}}}}

The Quran does not state that Jesus suffered in a false body or more generally support "discarnate principles of Docetism". Christian commentators have often argued that in its denial of killing or crucifixion of Jesus the Quran was influenced by Docetic ideas, but this is a hypothesis that has no real proof.&lt;ref name=parrinder/&gt;

==Docetism and christ myth theory==
Since [[Arthur Drews]] published his ''The Christ Myth'' (Die Christusmythe) in 1909, occasional connections have been drawn between docetist theories and the modern idea that Christ was a myth. [[Shailer Mathews]] called Drews' theory a "modern docetism".{{Sfn |Mathews|2006 |p= 37}} [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]] thought any connection to be based on a misunderstanding of docetism.{{Sfn |Conybeare|1914|p= 104}} The idea recurred in [[classicist]] [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]]'s 1977 review of the evidence for Jesus, who compared modern scepticism about a historical Jesus to the ancient docetic idea that Jesus only ''seemed'' to come into the world "in the flesh". Modern theories did away with "seeming".{{Sfn |Grant |2004 |pp= 199–200 | ps =: "This skeptical way of thinking reached its culmination in the argument that Jesus as a human being never existed at all and is a myth. In ancient times, this extreme view was named the heresy of docetism (seeming) because it maintained that Jesus never came into the world "in the flesh", but only seemed to; (I John 4:2) and it was given some encouragement by Paul's lack of interest in his fleshly existence. Subsequently, from the eighteenth century onwards, there have been attempts to insist that Jesus did not even "seem" to exist, and that all tales of his appearance upon the earth were pure fiction. In particular, his story was compared to the pagan mythologies inventing fictitious dying and rising gods."}}

The '''Dongpo Academy''' or '''Dongpo Shuyuan''' ({{zh|c=东坡书院|p= Dōngpō Shūyuàn}}), was an [[academies (China)|academy]] located in [[Hainan]], [[China]]. It was originally built in 1098 in memory of the [[Song]] dynasty literary figure, [[Su Dongpo]], who was exiled here. 

The ''Zaijiutang'' (载酒堂 Zài jiǔ táng) is the building where Su Dongpo lived and gave lectures during exile. The Dongpo Academy is located near the town of [[Zhonghe, Danzhou|Zhonghe]], 40 km from [[Danzhou]] (Nada) city. It is now a tourist attraction.

The "Friendship Bench" is a tool for positive mental and emotional health used in various settings.

In Zimbabwe, the Friendship Bench approach to therapy uses listening and "problem-solving therapy" by trained lay-counselor grandmothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-friendship-bench-mental-health-treatment/3661639.html|title=Zimbabwe Tackles Mental Health With 'Friendship Benches'|last=Ridgwell|first=Henry|work=VOA|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When seeking mental health care is stigmatized or resources are not available—Zimbabwe has just 12 psychiatrists for 14 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-friendship-bench-mental-health-treatment/3661639.html|title=Zimbabwe Tackles Mental Health With 'Friendship Benches'|last=Ridgwell|first=Henry|work=VOA|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the Friendship Bench offers what so far seems to be an effective and simple option.  Depression is referred to as  ''kufungisisa,'' “thinking too much," in the Shona language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/14/harare-friendship-bench-grandmothers-mental-health-zimbabwe|title=Harare's park bench grandmas: 'I speak to them and feel a load is lifted off my heart'|last=Harare|first=Ranga Mberi in|date=2017-04-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a school setting a '''friendship bench''' may also be known as a '''buddy bench''', and is a special place in a [[school]] [[playground]] where a child can go when they want someone to talk to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/buddy-bench-willowgrove-school-1.3505066 Buddy Bench, CBC Saskatoon, March 24, 2016].  Retrieved 2016-04-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendship benches may be distinctively different from other seating in the [[school]] and may be specially designed by an artist or with the help of the children themselves. They are rainbow colored and were originally created by C.R Plastics, a Canadian company that creates recycled plastic outdoor furniture. Such benches are situated in open and well-travelled areas of the school so that any child using the bench will be noticed quickly.

When a [[child]] feels the need for a friend to talk to, he or she can show this by using the friendship bench. Other children and staff will recognise this as a sign that some help, support or comfort is needed and will come to talk with the child.

The friendship bench is a means by which a child can seek support without the need to rationalise their feelings or to seek-out a particular member of staff or special friend. Because the bench is in the day-to-day environment of the school it can be used at any time and for any reason—from seemingly trivial matters to more serious concerns—and encourages children to ask for help when they are troubled.

The Friendship Benches were originally created in 2012 by a fifth grader, at the time, Acacia Woodley. Acacia now speaks at schools across North America and is very happily the founder and CEO of company, Tiny Girl, Big Dream.

'''Guanyin''' or '''Guan Yin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|g|w|ɑː|n|ˈ|j|ɪ|n}}) is the most commonly used Chinese translation of the [[bodhisattva]] known today as '[[Avalokitesvara]]'.&lt;ref&gt;For Details, see [[#Etymology]] below.&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage, Guanyin refers to the Buddhist bodhisattva associated with [[compassion]] and [[veneration|venerated]] chiefly by followers of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] schools as practiced in the [[sinosphere]].  Guanyin also refers to the bodhisattva as adopted by non-Buddhist religions such as Daoism, Chinese folk religions and other (mainly East Asian) religions, where she is often known as the "'''Goddess of Mercy'''" in English. The Chinese name Guanyin, is short for '''Guanshiyin''', which means "[The One Who] Perceives the Sounds of the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/P/39 |title=Perceiver of the World's Sounds |access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists believe that when one of their adherents departs from this world, they are placed by Guanyin in the [[Lotus (plant)|heart of a lotus]], and then sent to the western [[Pure Land]] of [[Sukhāvatī]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Reginald |title=Buddhist China |year=2008 |origyear=1913 |publisher=Soul Care Publishing |isbn=978-0-9680459-3-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guanyin is often referred to as the "most widely beloved Buddhist Divinity"&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/Avalokiteshvara|title=Avalokiteshvara – bodhisattva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with miraculous powers to assist all those who pray to her, as is said in the [[Lotus Sutra]] and [[Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra|Karandavyuha Sutra]].

Several large temples in East Asia are dedicated to Guanyin including [[Shitennō-ji]], [[Sensō-ji]], [[Kiyomizu-dera]], [[Sanjūsangen-dō]], [[Shaolin Temple|Shaolin]], and [[Dharma Drum Mountain]]. Guanyin is beloved by all Buddhist traditions in a non-denominational way and found in most [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan temples]] under the name [[Chenrezig]], and found in some influential [[Theravada]] temples such as [[Gangaramaya Temple|Gangaramaya]] and [[Kelaniya]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Statues are a widely depicted subject of [[Asian art]] and found in the Asian art sections of most museums in the world.

Generally accepted among East Asian adherents, Guanyin originated as the Bodhisattva [[Avalokiteśvara]], but in [[Chinese folk religion]], the [[Chinese mythology|mythical accounts]] about Guanyin's origins do not associate with the Avalokiteśvara described in Buddhist sutras.{{Citation needed|reason=This is patently untrue for the majority of East Asian worshippers of Guanyin or Avalokitesvara.  In Chinese temples such as Putuo Shan, pilgrims would offer incense before the Chinese form Guanyin and go to next shrine where there may be Thousand hand, Thousand eye form of Avalokitesvara.  In fact I personally have seen Tibetan Vajrayana lamas worshipping at these shrine. |date=April 2018}} Commonly known in English as the '''Mercy Goddess''' or Goddess of Mercy,  often depicted as both male and female to show this figure's limitless transcendence beyond gender,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fathom.lse.ac.uk/seminars/21701773/21701773_session4.html Fathom.lse.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083837/http://fathom.lse.ac.uk/seminars/21701773/21701773_session4.html |date=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and revered by [[Taoism|Taoists]] as an [[xian (Taoism)|immortal]].

==Etymology==

===Avalokitasvara===
''Guānyīn'' is a translation from the Sanskrit ''Avalokitasvara'' or ''[[Avalokiteśvara]]'', referring to the Mahāyāna bodhisattva of the same name. Another later name for this bodhisattva is ''Guānzìzài'' ({{zh|s=观自在|t=觀自在|p=Guānzìzài}}). It was initially thought that the Chinese mis-transliterated the word ''Avalokiteśvara'' as ''Avalokitasvara'' which explained why [[Xuanzang]] translated it as ''Guānzìzài'' instead of ''Guānyīn''. However, the original form was indeed ''Avalokitasvara'' with the ending ''svara'' ("sound, noise"), which means "sound perceiver", literally "he who looks down upon sound" (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need his help).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lokesh Chandra |authorlink=Lokesh Chandra |date=1984 |title=The Origin of Avalokitesvara |url=http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol13/vol13_art13_CHANDRA.pdf |journal=Indologica Taurinenaia |volume=XIII (1985–1986) |pages=189–190 |location= |publisher=International Association of Sanskrit Studies |accessdate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205922/http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol13/vol13_art13_CHANDRA.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mironov&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mironov |first1=N.

''The Heart Sutra: The Womb of the Buddhas'' (2004) Shoemaker 7 Hoard. {{ISBN|1-59376-009-4}} pg 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; This is the exact equivalent of the Chinese translation ''Guānyīn''. This etymology was furthered in the Chinese by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably [[Kumarajiva]], to use the variant ''Guānshìyīn'', literally "he who perceives the world's lamentations"—wherein ''lok'' was read as simultaneously meaning both "to look" and "world" (Skt. ''loka''; Ch. 世, ''shì'').&lt;ref name="Red Pine 2004 pg 44-45"/&gt;

The name ''Avalokitasvara'' was later supplanted by the ''Avalokiteśvara'' form containing the ending ''-īśvara'', which does not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century. The original form ''Avalokitasvara'' appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century.{{sfn|Studholme|2002|p=52–57}} The original meaning of the name "Avalokitasvara" fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an ''īśvara'' shows a strong influence of [[Shaivism|Śaivism]], as the term ''īśvara'' was usually connected to the Hindu notion of [[Shiva|Śiva]] as a creator god and ruler of the world.

While some of those who revered ''Avalokiteśvara'' upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god,{{sfn|Studholme|2002|p=30-31, 37–52}} [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] does cite ''Avalokiteśvara'' as the creator god of the world. This position is taken in the widely used [[Karandavyuha Sutra]] with its well-known mantra [[Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ]].&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"/&gt; In addition, the Lotus Sutra is the first time the ''Avalokiteśvara'' is mentioned. Chapter 25 refers to him as ''Lokeśvara'' (Lord God of all beings) and ''Lokanātha'' (Lord and Protector of all beings) and ascribes extreme attributes of divinity to him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===''Lotus Sūtra''===
The ''Lotus Sūtra'' (Sanskrit ''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'') is generally accepted to be the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, John (2003). ''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art'': p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; These are found in the twenty fifth chapter of the Lotus Sūtra. This chapter is devoted to Avalokitesvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name.&lt;ref name="Baroni" /&gt; This Chapter also places Avalokiteshwara as Higher than any other being in the Buddhist Cosmology{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} stating that "if one were to pray with true devotion to Avalokiteshwara for one second, they would generate more blessings than if one worshiped with all types of offerings as many Gods as there are in the grains of sand of 62 Ganges Rivers for an entire lifetime". As a result, Avalokiteshwara is often considered the most beloved Buddhist Divinity and is venerated in many important temples including [[Shitennoji]], the first official temple of Japan, [[Sensoji]], the oldest temple of Tokyo, [[Kiyomizu-dera]] and [[Sanjusangendo]] which are the two most visited temples in Kyoto.

The ''Lotus Sutra'' describes Avalokiteśvara as a bodhisattva who can take the form of any type of God including [[Indra]] or [[Brahma]]; any type of [[Buddha]], any type of King or Chakravartin or even any kind of Heavenly Guardian including [[Vajrapani]] and [[Vaisravana]] as well as any gender male or female, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Kubo Tsugunari, Yuyama Akira (tr.). [https://web.archive.org/web/20150521183528/http://www.bdkamerica.org/digital/dBET_T0262_LotusSutra_2007.pdf The Lotus Sutra]. Revised 2nd ed. Berkeley, Calif.: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-886439-39-9}}, pp. 311–312&lt;/ref&gt; Folk traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokiteśvara. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is [[androgyny|androgynous]] or perhaps without gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mythic and Comic Aspects of the Quest: Hsi-yu Chi as Seen Through Don Quixote and Huckleberry Finn |last=Fu |first=James S. |isbn=9780821404713 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WDekApY7Y94C |year=1977 |publisher=Singapore University Press}} P. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokitasvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. Chapter 25 consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sūtra, called the ''Avalokitasvara Sūtra'' (Ch. 觀世音經), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia.&lt;ref name="Baroni"&gt;Baroni, Helen (2002). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism'': p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lotus Sutra'' and its thirty-three manifestations of Guanyin, of which seven are female manifestations, is known to have been very popular in Chinese Buddhism as early as in the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Tan Chung 1998. p. 222"&gt;Tan Chung. ''Across the Himalayan Gap: An Indian Quest for Understanding China.'' 1998. p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Tan Chung]] notes that according to the doctrines of the [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] themselves, it does not matter whether Guanyin is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (Skt. ''[[śūnyatā]]'').&lt;ref name="Tan Chung 1998. p. 222"/&gt;

===Iconography===
[[File:Eleven-faced Goddess of Mercy edit.jpg|thumb|150px|Guanyin as a male [[bodhisattva]]. Eleven faced ''Ekādaśamukha'' form. Japan, 12th century]]

Representations of the bodhisattva in China prior to the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) were masculine in appearance. Images which later displayed attributes of both genders are believed to be in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, where Avalokitesvara has the supernatural power of assuming any form required to relieve suffering, and also has the power to grant children. Because this bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion and kindness, a mother goddess and patron of mothers and seamen, the representation in China was further interpreted in an all-female form around the 12th century. On occasion, Guanyin is also depicted holding an infant in order to further stress the relationship between the bodhisattva, maternity, and birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.artstor.org/#/asset/SS36617_36617_32424610;prevRouteTS=1543257931615|title=Artstor|last=Artstor|website=library.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern period, Guanyin is most often represented as a beautiful, white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier ''Pandaravasini'' form.

In some Buddhist temples and monasteries, Guanyin's image is occasionally that of a young man dressed in Northern Song [[Kasaya (clothing)#Jiāshā in Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist robes]] and seated gracefully. He is usually depicted looking or glancing down, symbolising that Guanyin continues to watch over the world.

In China, Guanyin is generally portrayed as a young woman donned in a flowing white robe and usually wearing necklaces symbolic of Indian or Chinese royalty. In her left hand is a jar containing pure water, and the right holds a [[willow]] branch. The crown usually depicts the image of [[Amitābha]].

There are also regional variations of Guanyin depictions. In [[Fujian]], for example, a popular depiction of Guanyin is as a maiden dressed in Tang [[hanfu]] carrying a fish basket. A popular image of Guanyin as both Guanyin of the South Sea and Guanyin with a Fish Basket can be seen in late 16th-century Chinese encyclopedias and in prints that accompany the novel ''Golden Lotus''.

In Chinese art, Guanyin is often depicted either alone, standing atop a dragon, accompanied by a [[white cockatoo]] and flanked by two children or two warriors. The two children are her acolytes who came to her when she was meditating at [[Mount Putuo]]. The girl is called [[Longnü]] and the boy [[Sudhana|Shancai]]. The two warriors are the historical general [[Guan Yu]] from the late [[Han dynasty]] and the bodhisattva [[Skanda (Buddhism)|Skanda]], who appears in the Chinese classical novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. The Buddhist tradition also displays Guanyin, or other buddhas and bodhisattvas, flanked with the above-mentioned warriors, but as bodhisattvas who protect the temple and the faith itself.

==Legends==
[[Image:Quan Am 1656.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This wooden statue of Quan Âm Nghìn Mắt Nghìn Tay (Quan Am with 1000 eyes and 1000 hands) was fashioned in 1656 in [[Bắc Ninh Province]], northern [[Vietnam]].  It is now located in the History Museum in [[Hanoi]].]]

===Guanyin and the Thousand Arms===
In the [[Karandavyuha Sutra]], Avalokiteshwara is called "The One With A Thousand Arms and Thousand eyes" and is described as superior to all Gods and Buddhas of the Indian pantheon. The Sutra also states that "it is easier to count all the leaves of every tree of every forest and all the grains of sand in the universe than to count the blessings and power of Avalokiteshwara". This version of Avalokiteshwara with a thousand arms depicting the power of all Gods also shows various Buddhas in the crown depicting the wisdom of all Buddhas. It is called [[Senju Kannon]] in Japan and 1000 statues of this nature can be found at the popular [[Sanjusangendo]] temple of Kyoto.

One Buddhist legend from the ''Complete Tale of Guanyin and the Southern Seas'' ({{zh|c=南海觀音全撰|p=Nánhǎi Guānyīn Quánzhuàn}}) presents Guanyin as vowing to never rest until she had freed all sentient beings from [[saṃsāra]] or cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ziliaoku.jxwmw.cn/system/2009/03/31/010121519.shtml|title=【明代小说】《南海观音菩萨出身修行传》全集--资料库|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strenuous effort, she realised that there were still many unhappy beings yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, her head split into eleven pieces. The buddha Amitābha, upon seeing her plight, gave her eleven heads to help her hear the cries of those who are suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that her two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha came to her aid and appointed her a thousand arms to let her reach out to those in need.

Many Himalayan versions of the tale include eight arms with which Avalokitesvara skillfully upholds the [[dharma]], each possessing its own particular implement, while more Chinese-specific versions give varying accounts of this number.

In China, it is said that fishermen used to pray to her to ensure safe voyages. The titles ''Guanyin of the Southern Ocean'' (南海觀音) and "Guanyin (of/on) the Island" stem from this tradition.

===Legend of Miaoshan===

Another story from the ''Precious Scroll of Fragrant Mountain'' (香山寶卷) describes an incarnation of Guanyin as the daughter of a cruel king who wanted her to marry a wealthy but uncaring man. The story is usually ascribed to the research of the Buddhist monk Jiang Zhiqi during the 11th century. The story is likely to have its origin in Taoism. When Chiang penned the work, he believed that the Guanyin we know today was actually a princess called Miaoshan (妙善), who had a religious following on Fragrant Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese Cultural Studies:The Legend of Miao-shan |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/miao-sha.html |accessdate=11 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113032056/http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/miao-sha.html |archive-date=13 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this there are many variants of the story in [[Chinese mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6d02fe8d0101b2xr.html# |title=香山寶卷（1）_蒋建达_新浪博客 |access-date=1 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729153214/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6d02fe8d0101b2xr.html# |archive-date=29 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the story, after the king asked his daughter Miaoshan to marry the wealthy man, she told him that she would obey his command, so long as the marriage eased three misfortunes.

The king asked his daughter what were the three misfortunes that the marriage should ease. Miaoshan explained that the first misfortune the marriage should ease was the suffering people endure as they age. The second misfortune it should ease was the suffering people endure when they fall ill. The third misfortune it should ease was the suffering caused by death. If the marriage could not ease any of the above, then she would rather retire to a life of religion forever.

When her father asked who could ease all the above, Miaoshan pointed out that a doctor was able to do all of these. Her father grew angry as he wanted her to marry a person of power and wealth, not a healer. He forced her into hard labour and reduced her food and drink but this did not cause her to yield.

Every day she begged to be able to enter a temple and become a [[bhikkhuni|nun]] instead of marrying. Her father eventually allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the [[bhikkhu|monks]] to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.

In one version of this legend, when Guanyin was executed, a supernatural tiger took her to one of the more hell-like realms of the dead.  However, instead of being punished like the other spirits of the dead, Guanyin played music, and flowers blossomed around her. This completely surprised the hell guardian. The story says that Guanyin, by merely being in that [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] (hell), turned it into a paradise.

A variant of the legend says that Miaoshan allowed herself to die at the hand of the executioner. According to this legend, as the executioner tried to carry out her father's orders, his axe shattered into a thousand pieces. He then tried a sword which likewise shattered. He tried to shoot Miaoshan down with arrows but they all veered off.

Finally in desperation he used his hands. Miaoshan, realising the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.

Another tale says that Miaoshan never died, but was in fact transported by a supernatural tiger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legend of Miao Shan |url=http://www.purifymind.com/MiaoShan.htm |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the Deity of the Place,{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} to Fragrant Mountain.

The legend of Miaoshan usually ends with Miaozhuangyan, Miaoshan's father, falling ill with [[jaundice]]. No physician was able to cure him. Then a monk appeared saying that the jaundice could be cured by making a medicine out of the arm and eye of one without anger. The monk further suggested that such a person could be found on Fragrant Mountain. When asked, Miaoshan willingly offered up her eyes and arms. Miaozhuangyan was cured of his illness and went to the Fragrant Mountain to give thanks to the person. When he discovered that his own daughter had made the sacrifice, he begged for forgiveness. The story concludes with Miaoshan being transformed into the Thousand Armed Guanyin, and the king, queen and her two sisters building a temple on the mountain for her.  She began her journey to a [[pure land]] and was about to cross over into heaven when she heard a cry of suffering from the world below.  She turned around and saw the massive suffering endured by the people of the world. Filled with compassion, she returned to Earth, vowing never to leave till such time as all suffering has ended.

After her return to Earth, Guanyin was said to have stayed for a few years on the island of [[Mount Putuo]] where she practised meditation and helped the sailors and fishermen who got stranded. Guanyin is frequently worshipped as patron of sailors and fishermen due to this. She is said to frequently becalm the sea when boats are threatened with rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Charles Alfred Speed |title=Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |year=2006 |location= |pages=234–235 |isbn=0-8048-3704-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades Guanyin returned to Fragrant Mountain to continue her meditation.

===Guanyin and Shancai===
{{Main|Sudhana}}
[[File:An Altar of Guanyin Worship.jpg|300px|thumb|An Altar of Guanyin Worship.]]

Legend has it that Shancai (also called [[Sudhana]] in [[Sanskrit]]) was a disabled boy from India who was very interested in studying the [[dharma]]. When he heard that there was a Buddhist teacher on the rocky island of Putuo he quickly journeyed there to learn. Upon arriving at the island, he managed to find Guanyin despite his severe disability.

Guanyin, after having a discussion with Shancai, decided to test the boy's resolve to fully study the Buddhist teachings. She conjured the illusion of three sword-wielding pirates running up the hill to attack her. Guanyin took off and dashed to the edge of a cliff, the three illusions still chasing her.

Shancai, seeing that his teacher was in danger, hobbled uphill. Guanyin then jumped over the edge of the cliff, and soon after this the three bandits followed. Shancai, still wanting to save his teacher, managed to crawl his way over the cliff edge.

Shancai fell down the cliff but was halted in midair by Guanyin, who now asked him to walk. Shancai found that he could walk normally and that he was no longer crippled. When he looked into a pool of water he also discovered that he now had a very handsome face. From that day forth, Guanyin taught Shancai the entire dharma.

===Guanyin and Longnü===
{{Main|Longnü}}
[[File:Guan She Yin statue of Sanggar Agung Temple, Surabaya-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|250px|20-meter-high Guanyin statue at [[Sanggar Agung]], [[Surabaya]], [[Indonesia]]]]

Many years after Shancai became a disciple of Guanyin, a distressing event happened in the [[South China Sea]]. The third son of one of the [[Dragon King]]s was caught by a fisherman while swimming in the form of a fish. Being stuck on land, he was unable to transform back into his dragon form. His father, despite being a mighty Dragon King, was unable to do anything while his son was on land. Distressed, the son called out to all of Heaven and Earth.

Hearing this cry, Guanyin quickly sent Shancai to recover the fish and gave him all the money she had. The fish at this point was about to be sold in the market. It was causing quite a stir as it was alive hours after being caught. This drew a much larger crowd than usual at the market. Many people decided that this prodigious situation meant that eating the fish would grant them immortality, and so all present wanted to buy the fish. Soon a bidding war started, and Shancai was easily outbid.

[[Image:Guan Yin in white robe, by Mu-ch'i.jpg|right|thumb|160px|14th Century Mu Qi Recreation, Chinese, [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Shancai begged the fish seller to spare the life of the fish. The crowd, now angry at someone so daring, was about to pry him away from the fish when Guanyin projected her voice from far away, saying "A life should definitely belong to one who tries to save it, not one who tries to take it."

The crowd, realising their shameful actions and desire, dispersed. Shancai brought the fish back to Guanyin, who promptly returned it to the sea. There the fish transformed back to a dragon and returned home. Paintings of Guanyin today sometimes portray her holding a fish basket, which represents the aforementioned tale.

But the story does not end there.  As a reward for Guanyin saving his son, the Dragon King sent his granddaughter, a girl called [[Longnü]] ("dragon girl"), to present Guanyin with the Pearl of Light. The Pearl of Light was a precious jewel owned by the Dragon King that constantly shone. Longnü, overwhelmed by the presence of Guanyin, asked to be her disciple so that she might study the dharma. Guanyin accepted her offer with just one request: that Longnü be the new owner of the Pearl of Light.

In popular iconography, Longnü and Shancai are often seen alongside Guanyin as two children. Longnü is seen either holding a bowl or an [[ingot]], which represents the Pearl of Light, whereas Shancai is seen with palms joined and knees slightly bent to show that he was once crippled.

===Guanyin and the Filial Parrot===
The ''Precious Scroll of the Parrot'' ({{zh|c=鸚鴿寶撰|p=Yīnggē Bǎozhuàn}}) tells the story of a parrot who becomes a disciple of Guanyin.  During the Tang Dynasty a small parrot ventures out to search for its mother's favourite food upon which it is captured by a poacher (parrots were quite popular during the Tang Dynasty).  When it managed to escape it found out that its mother had already died.  The parrot grieved for its mother and provides her with a proper funeral.  It then sets out to become a disciple of Guanyin.

In popular iconography, the parrot is coloured white and usually seen hovering to the right side of Guanyin with either a pearl or a prayer bead clasped in its beak.  The parrot becomes a symbol of [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name="parrot"&gt;{{cite book |title=Personal salvation and filial piety: two precious scroll narratives of Guanyin and her acolytes |author=[[Wilt L.

===Guanyin and Chen Jinggu===
[[Image:Chinese - Seated Guanyin (Kuan-yin) Bodhisattva - Walters 25256 (2).jpg|180px|thumb|Dry-lacquer sculpture of the "Water-moon Guanyin" theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/4483 |title=Seated Guanyin (Kuan-yin) Bodhisattva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Walters Art Museum]].]]

When the people of [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]] could not raise enough money to build a bridge, Guanyin changed into a beautiful maiden. Getting on a boat, she offered to marry any man who could hit her with a piece of silver from the edge of the water. Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, [[Lü Dongbin]], one of the [[Eight Immortals]], helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water. Guanyin bit her finger and a drop of blood fell into the water, but she vanished. This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women. The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).

Chen was a beautiful and talented girl, but did not wish to marry Liu Qi. Instead, she fled to [[Mount Lu]] in [[Jiangxi]], where she learned many [[Taoist]] skills. Destiny eventually caused her to marry Liu and she became pregnant. A drought in Fujian caused many people to ask her to call for rain, which was a ritual that could not be performed while pregnant. She temporarily aborted her child, which was killed by the white snake. Chen managed to kill the snake with a sword, but died either of a miscarriage or hemorrhage; she was able to complete the ritual, and ended drought.

This story is popular in [[Zhejiang]], [[Taiwan]], and especially [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pregadio|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&amp;pg=PA682 682]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quan Am Thi Kinh===
''Quan Am Thi Kinh'' (觀音氏敬) is a Vietnamese verse recounting the life of a woman, Thi Kinh. She was accused falsely of having intended to kill her husband, and when she disguised herself as a man to lead a religious life in a Buddhist temple, she was again falsely blamed for having committed sexual intercourse with a girl named Thi Mau. She was accused of impregnating her, which was strictly forbidden by Buddhist law. However, thanks to her endurance of all indignities and her spirit of self-sacrifice, she could enter into Nirvana and became Goddess of Mercy (Phat Ba Quan Am)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truyenviet.com/component/content/article/133-co-tich-viet-nam/9205-quan-am-thi-kinh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326164544/http://www.truyenviet.com/component/content/article/133-co-tich-viet-nam/9205-quan-am-thi-kinh|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 March 2014|title=Truyện Việt|date=26 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.

===Journey To The West===

Next to Sun Wu Kong, the monkey king himself, there is no supernatural entity more important to the famous myths from China about a strange mystical monkey, a couple of exiled gods, a dragon, and a priest trying to bring sacred scrolls back to China than her. She delivered the ring that let the priest control the monkey king. She informed all those involved of their great place in the quest which allowed most of them to reach enlightenment. When a demon was too powerful or tricky even for the monkey king she came to their rescue. And when the monkey king was feeling like abandoning the quest she managed to talk him into returning.

==Association with vegetarianism==
Due to her symbolization of compassion, in [[East Asia]], Guanyin is associated with [[vegetarianism]]. [[Buddhist cuisine]] is generally decorated with her image and she appears in most Buddhist vegetarian pamphlets and magazines.

==Role in East Asian Buddhism==
[[Image:Dongguan Guanyinshan.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Guanyin Shan (Guanyin Mountain) temple in [[Dongguan]], [[China]].]]

In [[East Asian Buddhism]], Guanyin is the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. Among the Chinese, Avalokiteśvara is almost exclusively called ''Guanshiyin Pusa'' (觀世音菩薩). The Chinese translation of many Buddhist sutras has in fact replaced the Chinese transliteration of Avalokitesvara with ''Guanshiyin'' (觀世音). Some Taoist scriptures give her the title of ''Guanyin Dashi'', sometimes informally ''Guanyin Fozu''.

[[Image:Guanyin and child.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Guanyin and child, modern Chinese painting theme, similar to the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]] theme.]]
In Chinese culture, the popular belief and worship of Guanyin as a goddess by the populace is generally not viewed to be in conflict with the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's nature. In fact the widespread worship of Guanyin as a "Goddess of Mercy and Compassion" is seen by Buddhists as the boundless salvific nature of bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara at work (in Buddhism, this is referred to as Guanyin's "skillful means", or [[upaya]]). The Buddhist canon states that bodhisattvas can assume whatsoever gender and form is needed to liberate beings from ignorance and [[dukkha]]. With specific reference to Avalokitesvara, he is stated both in the ''Lotus Sutra'' (Chapter 25 "Perceiver of the World's Sounds" or "Universal Gateway"),  and the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' to have appeared before as a woman or a goddess to save beings from suffering and ignorance. Some Buddhist schools refer to Guanyin both as male and female interchangeably.

In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], gender is no obstacle to attaining enlightenment (or [[nirvana]]). The Buddhist concept of non-duality applies here. The ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]''{{'}}s "Goddess" chapter clearly illustrates an enlightened being who is also a female and deity. In the ''Lotus Sutra'', a maiden became enlightened in a very short time span. The view that Avalokiteśvara is also the goddess Guanyin does not seem contradictory to Buddhist beliefs. Guanyin has been a buddha called the "[[Tathāgata]] of Brightness of Correct [[Dharma]]" (正法明如來).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T20/1060_001.htm 《千手千眼觀世音菩薩廣大圓滿無礙大悲心陀羅尼經》 卷1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731011706/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T20/1060_001.htm |date=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that bodhisattvas are known to incarnate at will as living people according to the sutras, the princess Miaoshan is generally viewed by Buddhists as an incarnation of Guanyin.

[[Image:Status of Kuan Yin.jpg|thumb|150px|A Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] porcelain figure of Guanyin.]]
Guanyin is immensely popular among Chinese Buddhists, especially those from devotional schools. She is generally seen as a source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her [[bodhisattva vow]], Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who have no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.

In [[Pure Land Buddhism]], Guanyin is described as the "Barque of Salvation". Along with Amitābha and the bodhisattva [[Mahasthamaprapta]], she temporarily liberates beings out of the Wheel of Samsara into the Pure Land, where they will have the chance to accrue the necessary merit so as to be a Buddha in one lifetime. In Chinese Buddhist iconography, Guanyin is often depicted as meditating or sitting alongside one of the Buddhas and usually accompanied by another bodhisattva. The buddha and bodhisattva that are portrayed together with Guanyin usually follow whichever school of Buddhism they represent. In [[Pure Land Buddhism]], for example, Guanyin is frequently depicted on the left of Amitābha, while on the buddha's right is [[Mahasthamaprapta]]. Temples that revere the bodhisattva [[Ksitigarbha]] usually depict him meditating beside Amitābha and Guanyin.

Even among Chinese Buddhist schools that are non-devotional, Guanyin is still highly venerated. Instead of being seen as an active external force of unconditional love and salvation, the personage of Guanyin is highly revered as the principle of compassion, mercy and love. The act, thought and feeling of compassion and love is viewed as Guanyin. A merciful, compassionate, loving individual is said to be Guanyin. A meditative or contemplative state of being at peace with oneself and others is seen as Guanyin.

In the Mahayana canon, the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' is ascribed entirely to Guanyin. This is unique, since most Mahayana Sutras are usually ascribed to [[Gautama Buddha]] and the teachings, deeds or vows of the bodhisattvas are described by Shakyamuni Buddha. In the ''Heart Sutra'', Guanyin describes to the [[arhat]] [[Sariputta]] the nature of reality and the essence of the Buddhist teachings. The famous Buddhist saying "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (色即是空，空即是色) comes from this sutra.

==Role in other religions==
[[File:Lahad-Datu Sabah Guan-Yin-Temple-01.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Chinese folk religion]] temple devoted primarily to the goddess Guanyin, in [[Lahad Datu]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].]]

Guanyin is an extremely popular goddess in [[Chinese folk religion]] and is worshiped in many Chinese communities throughout East and South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjdh.com/wumin/HTML/82218.html 於君方：《偽經》與觀音信仰]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gywh.net/guanyin/xingxiang.shtml 中國觀音文化促进會 观音形象] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311011104/http://www.gywh.net/guanyin/xingxiang.shtml |date=11 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bzzz.china84000.com/Article/sjyj/200807/Article_10.html 中国观音信仰的基本体系-宝藏杂志]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjnet.com/fjlw/200811/t20081117_92282.htm 信仰研究现状评析—李利安-学术论文-佛教在线]&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoism, records claim Guanyin was a Chinese woman who became an immortal, [[Cihang Zhenren]] in [[Shang Dynasty]] or Xingyin (姓音).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hi.baidu.com/axblog/blog/item/c7381508163b6530e924887f.html 太上碧落洞天慈航灵感度世宝忏起赞_仙道贵生。无量度人_百度空间]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guanyin is revered in the general Chinese population due to her unconditional love and compassion. She is generally regarded by many as the protector of women and children. By this association, she is also seen as a fertility goddess capable of granting children to couples. An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used when a child is expected. After the child is born, the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.&lt;ref name=Dore&gt;{{Cite book |title=Researches into Chinese Superstitions |last1=Doré S.J. |first1=Henry |last2=Kennelly, S.J. (Translator) |first2=M. |year=1914 |publisher=Tusewei Press, Shanghai}} Vol I p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Guanyin is also seen as the champion of the unfortunate, the sick, the disabled, the poor, and those in trouble. Some coastal and river areas of China regard her as the protector of fishermen, sailors, and generally people who are out at sea, thus many have also come to believe that [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], the goddess of the sea, is a manifestation of Guanyin. Due to her association with the legend of the [[Flood Mythology of China|Great Flood]], where she sent down a [[Dog in Chinese mythology|dog]] holding [[rice]] grains in its tail after the flood, she is worshiped as an agrarian and agriculture goddess. In some quarters, especially among business people and traders, she is looked upon as a goddess of fortune. In recent years there have been claims of her being the protector of air travelers.

Guanyin is also a ubiquitous figure found within the [[new religious movements]] of Asia:
* Within the Taiwan-based [[Yiguandao]] sect, Guanyin is called the "Ancient Buddha of the South Sea" (南海古佛) and frequently appears in their ''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]''. Guanyin is sometimes confused with Yue Hui Bodhisattva due to their similar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaya.org.tw/magazine/v1/2005/64/64hk1.htm 香光莊嚴第六十四期/歷史/觀音老母]{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guanyin is called the "Ancient Buddha of the Holy Religion" (聖宗古佛) in [[Zailiism]] and in the teachings of the [[Lord of Universe Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authority.ddbc.edu.tw/person/search.php?aid=A002803|title=人名規範資料庫|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zailiism she is the main deity worshipped.
* [[Ching Hai]] initiates her followers a meditation method called the "Quan Yin Method" to achieve enlightenment; followers also revere Ching Hai as an incarnation of Guanyin.
* Shumei Shinjikai acknowledges Guanyin or Kannon in Japanese as the deity of compassion or the Goddess of Mercy, who was actively guiding the founder Meishusama and represents a middle way between Zen and Pure Land Buddhism.
* Guanyin, known as "Quan Am Tathagata" (Quan Âm Như Lai) in the [[Cao Dai]] religion, is considered a Buddha and a teacher. She represents Buddhist doctrines and traditions as one of the three major lines of [[Cao Dai]] doctrines (Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism). She also symbolizes utmost patience, harmony, and compassion. According to her Divine messages via seances, her main role is to teach the Tao to female disciples, and guide them towards divinity. Another of her well-known role is to save people from extreme sufferings, e.g. fire, drowning, wrong accusation/ imprisonment, etc. There is even a prayer named "Salvation from sufferings" for followers to cite in dire conditions.

==Similarity to the Virgin Mary==
[[File:The Virgin Mary disguised as Kanon Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Virgin Mary]] disguised as [[Kannon]], [[hidden Christians of Japan|''kakure kirishitan'']] (Japanese hidden Christians), 17th century. Salle des Martyrs, [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]].]]
Some Buddhist and Christian observers have commented on the similarity between Guanyin and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. This can be attributed to the representation of Guanyin holding a child in Chinese art and sculpture; it is believed that Guanyin is the patron saint of mothers and grants parents filial children, this apparition is popularly known as the "Child-Sending Guanyin" (送子觀音). One example of this comparison can be found in the [[Tzu Chi]] Foundation, a Taiwanese Buddhist humanitarian organisation, which noticed the similarity between this form of Guanyin and the Virgin Mary. The organisation commissioned a portrait of Guanyin holding a baby, closely resembling the typical Roman Catholic [[Madonna and Child]] painting. Copies of this portrait are now displayed prominently in Tzu Chi affiliated medical centres, especially since Tzu Chi's founder is a Buddhist master and her supporters come from various religious backgrounds.

During the [[Edo period]] in Japan, when Christianity was banned and punishable by death, some underground Christian groups venerated Jesus and the Virgin Mary by disguising them as statues of Kannon holding a child; such statues are known as ''[[Kakure Kirishitan|Maria Kannon]]''. Many had a cross hidden in an inconspicuous location.

It is suggested the similarity comes from the conquest and colonization of the [[Philippines]] by Spain during the 16th century, when Asian cultures influenced engravings of the Virgin Mary, as evidenced, for example, in an ivory carving of the Virgin Mary by a Chinese carver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Victoria and Albert Museum, 2004 London Proms Performing Art Lecture with Christopher Cook and Marjorie Trusted |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/audio_proms_talk/index.html |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926021058/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/audio_proms_talk/index.html |archivedate=26 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (mp4 audio, requires Apple QuickTime).&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of Guanyin (Gwanse-eum) in Gilsangsa Temple in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] was sculpted by Catholic sculptor Choi Jong-tae, who modeled the statue after the Virgin Mary in hopes of fostering religious reconciliation in Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seoul Tour Plus |url=http://www.visitseoul.net/file_save/ebook/Seoul_tour_plus/EN/Seoul_tour_plus_healing_eng.pdf |website=visitseoul.net/ |publisher=Seoul Tourism Organization |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koehler |first1=Robert |title=Bodhisattva of Mercy, Gilsangsa Temple |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68558939@N00/5707195482/ |website=Flickr.com |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 1946 film [[Three Strangers]] the titular characters wish for a shared [[sweepstakes]] ticket to win before a statue of Guanyin, referred to in the film as Kwan Yin.

For a 2005 ''[[Fo Guang Shan]]'' TV series, [[Andy Lau]] performed the song ''Kwun Sai Yam'', which emphasizes the idea that everyone can be like Guanyin.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:观世音 (2005年电视剧)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdcitta.net/kanwu/fubao/zhuanti/2010-07-20/565.html 观音老人悟明长老 毕生弘扬大悲忏] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110220403/http://www.bdcitta.net/kanwu/fubao/zhuanti/2010-07-20/565.html |date=10 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xuefo.net/nr/article11/108420.html|title=果卿居士：回忆宣化上人－－学佛网|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jieshafangsheng.com/content-46-6516-1.html|title=戒杀放生网—提示信息|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 Thai movie [[The Billionaire]], also known as Top Secret: Wai Roon Pan Lan (วัยรุ่นพันล้าน), Guanyin appears to  entrepreneur Top (Itthipat Peeradechapan), founder of Tao Kae Noi Seaweed Snacks, providing him inspiration during his period of uncertainty.

Fantasy author [[Richard Parks (author)|Richard Parks]] has frequently utilized Guanyin as a character in his fiction, most notably in the short stories "A Garden in Hell" (2006) and "The White Bone Fan" (2009), the novella ''[[The Heavenly Fox]]'' (2011), and the novel ''All the Gates of Hell'' (2013).

'''Hara Tanzan''' (原坦山) (December 5, 1819 &amp;ndash; July 27, 1892) was a [[Sōtō|Soto]] [[Buddhist]] monk, head monk at the Saijoji temple in [[Odawara]]&lt;ref name=bijutsu&gt;{{cite web|title=美術人名辞典|publisher=SHIBUNKAKU Co., Ltd.|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160304074541/http://www.shibunkaku.co.jp/biography/search_biography_number.php?number=25212}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Tokyo]] during the [[Bakumatsu]] and [[Meiji period]]s. He was a forerunner of the modernization of Japanese Buddhism and the first (in Japan) to attempt to incorporate concepts from the natural sciences into Zen Buddhism.&lt;ref name=yoshinaga&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshinaga|first=Shinichi|title=The Psychologized Zen of HARA Tanzan : His Thought and Historical Influences|journal=Society for Mind-Body Science|date=30 October 2006|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110007154619|accessdate=28 November 2013|language=Japanese|issn=0918-2489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara was born in [[Iwakitaira Domain]]. At the age of 15, Hara enrolled at the [[Shoheizaka Academy]] (昌平坂学問所) where he studied both [[Confucianism]] and medicine, the latter under [[Taki Genken]].&lt;ref name=bijutsu /&gt; At the age of 20 or 26, he entered Buddhist priesthood, though he would go on to study Western medicine later in life.&lt;ref name=sekaidaihyakka&gt;{{cite book|title=世界大百科事典 第２版|year=1998|publisher=Hitachi Solutions Business, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=namedic&gt;{{cite book|year=2009|title=デジタル版 日本人名大辞典+Plus|publisher=Kodansha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara is featured in several [[koans]].  He was well known{{By who|date=August 2018}} for his disregard of many of the precepts of everyday Buddhism, such as dietary laws.

==Appearances in Koans==

===The Muddy Road===
This is one of the most famous stories of Tanzan.

:Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was falling. As they came around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross at an intersection.

:"Come on, girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her over the mud.

:Ekido did not speak until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he could no longer restrain himself. "[[Patimokkha|We monks don't go near females," he told Tanzan, "especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous.]] Why did you do that?"

===A Buddha===
In Tokyo in the Meiji era there lived two prominent teachers of opposite characteristics. One, Unsho, an instructor in 
Shingon, kept Buddha's precepts scrupulously. He never drank intoxicants, nor did he eat after eleven o'clock in the 
morning.  
  
The other teacher, Tanzan, a professor of philosophy at the Imperial University, never observed the precepts. When he 
felt like eating he ate, and when he felt like sleeping in the daytime he slept.  
  
One day Unsho visited Tanzan, who was drinking wine at the time, not even a drop of which is supposed to touch the 
tongue of a Buddhist.  
  
'Hello, brother,' Tanzan greeted him. 'Won't you have a drink?'  
  
'I never drink!' exclaimed Unsho solemnly.  
  
'One who does not drink is not even human,’ said Tanzan.  
  
'Do you mean to call me inhuman just because I do not indulge in intoxicating liquids!' exclaimed Unsho in anger. Then 
if I am not human, what am I?'  
  
'A Buddha.' answered Tanzan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Death==
Tanzan wrote sixty postal cards on the last day of his life, and asked an attendant to mail them. Then he died. The cards read:

:I am departing from this world.
:This is my last announcement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">The '''Herbrandization''' of a logical formula (named after [[Jacques Herbrand]]) is a construction that is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the [[Skolemization]] of a formula.  [[Thoralf Skolem]] had considered the Skolemizations of formulas in [[prenex form]] as part of his proof of the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] (Skolem 1920).  Herbrand worked with this dual notion of Herbrandization, generalized to apply to non-prenex formulas as well, in order to prove [[Herbrand's theorem (proof theory)|Herbrand's theorem]] (Herbrand 1930).

The resulting formula is not necessarily [[logical equivalence|equivalent]] to the original one. As with Skolemization which only preserves [[satisfiability]], Herbrandization being Skolemization's dual preserves [[Validity (logic)|validity]]: the resulting formula is valid if and only if the original one is.

==Definition and examples==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a formula in the language of [[first-order logic]].  We may assume that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains no variable that is bound by two different quantifier occurrences, and that no variable occurs both bound and free.  (That is, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; could be relettered to ensure these conditions, in such a way that the result is an equivalent formula).

The ''Herbrandization'' of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is then obtained as follows:

* First, replace any free variables in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by constant symbols.
* Second, delete all quantifiers on variables that are either (1) universally quantified and within an even number of negation signs, or (2) existentially quantified and within an odd number of negation signs.
* Finally, replace each such variable &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with a function symbol &lt;math&gt;f_v(x_1,\dots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_k&lt;/math&gt; are the variables that are still quantified, and whose quantifiers govern &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, consider the formula &lt;math&gt;F := \forall y \exists x [R(y,x) \wedge \neg\exists z S(x,z)]&lt;/math&gt;.  There are no free variables to replace.  The variables &lt;math&gt;y,z&lt;/math&gt; are the kind we consider for the second step, so we delete the quantifiers &lt;math&gt;\forall y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists z&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, we then replace &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with a constant &lt;math&gt;c_y&lt;/math&gt; (since there were no other quantifiers governing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;), and we replace &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with a function symbol &lt;math&gt;f_z(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; F^H = \exists x [R(c_y,x) \wedge \neg S(x,f_z(x))]. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''Skolemization'' of a formula is obtained similarly, except that in the second step above, we would delete quantifiers on variables that are either (1) existentially quantified and within an even number of negations, or (2) universally quantified and within an odd number of negations.  Thus, considering the same &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from above, its Skolemization would be:

: &lt;math&gt; F^S = \forall y [R(y,f_x(y)) \wedge \neg\exists z S(f_x(y),z)]. &lt;/math&gt;

To understand the significance of these constructions, see [[Herbrand's theorem (proof theory)|Herbrand's theorem]] or the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]].

'''Human shields''' may be civilians used against their will to deter attacks on military targets during an international armed conflict or they may be civilians who voluntarily protect either military or civilian targets from attack. The use of human shields is forbidden by ''[[Protocol I]]'' of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is also a [[specific intent]] [[war crime]] as codified in the ''[[Rome Statute]]'', which was adopted in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(ICC), art.8(20)(f) July 17, 1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 3; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the ''Rome Statute'' prohibits "utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations."&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the ''Rome Statute'' the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The ''Customary International Humanitarian Law'' guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are "arguably" customary in non-international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Henckaerts |first=Jean-Marie | last2=Doswald-Beck | first2=Louise |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf |date=2005}};[hereinafter CIHL]&lt;/ref&gt;  The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website| last=Marauhn |first=Thilo |title=Armed Conflict, Non-International |publisher=MPEPIL |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e243?result=1&amp;rskey=gZ7eSJ&amp;prd=OPIL |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Human shield}}
The laws of war first began to develop the [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] between military and civilian targets at The Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, the concept of total war permitted most actions that supported the war effort. In "total war" targeting civilians was allowed, if it would support a military objective to demoralize the enemy. Indiscriminate bombing was considered an acceptable method to achieve the military advantage of defeating enemy morale and eroding popular support for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.,''{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand.

L. Rev.|page=56}}, at 10;&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to protect civilians as a class were largely unsuccessful. World War II was also fought within the framework of the total war concept.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,''{{Smallcaps|Horst Boog, Et al.,7 Germany and the Second World War 10 (2006).}}(quoting the Casablanca Directive, which described Allied strategy as "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened")&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 were the first significant protections for civilians in war. These protections were expanded by the Additional Protocols in 1977. Protocol I requires that attacks be limited to military objectives, which are defined as targets that make an "effective contribution to military action" where the destruction of the target provides a "definite military advantage" to the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol I, art. 52(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal doctrine ==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Attacks shall be strictly limited to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.|source=—Protocol I, Geneva Conventions&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol  Additional  to the Geneva Conventions  of August  12,  1949,  and Relating to the
Protection  of Victims of International Armed Conflicts  (Protocol  I), opened for signature Dec.
12,  1977,  1125  U.N.T.S.  3, art. 52(2) [hereinafter  Protocol  I].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Military necessity can justify the use of force in certain circumstances, where there is a military advantage to be gained by an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the use of force is excessive relative to its anticipated military advantage it is said to be disproportionate. Disproportionate force is prohibited under international law.

Risk to civilians does not bar military action, but the principle of proportionality requires that precautions be taken to minimize the harm to these protected persons. This analysis includes considerations like whether circumstances permit the attacker to time a military action to minimize the presence of civilians at the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Bartels |first=Rogier |title=Dealing with the Principle of Proportionality in Armed Conflict in Retrospect: The Application of the Principle in International Criminal Trials |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/israel46&amp;start_page=271&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=275 |year= |volume=46 |journal=Israel Law Review |page=271}}, at 303&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Rome Statute using protected persons as shields in an international armed conflict is a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently debate amongst legal scholars about whether traditional proportionality analysis should be modified to take into account the culpability of actors who use human shields to gain a strategic advantage. In modern asymmetric warfare it has become difficult to distinguish between military targets and civilians, but State actors still rely on traditional principles that present challenges when applied to asymmetric conflicts. Non-state forces, like guerillas and terrorists, conceal themselves among civilian populations and may take advantage of this position to launch attacks. When military action targeting these unconventional combatants results in civilian deaths, State actors may blame the deaths on enemy forces who use human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proportionate proportionality analysis ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Military necessity permits a belligerent, subject to the laws of war, to apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money . . . it permits the destruction of life, of armed enemies and other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable . . . but does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. |source=—''United States v. List'', The Nuremberg Trials&lt;ref&gt;Agreement for the Prosecution and Punishment of the Major War Criminals of the European Axis, and Charter of the International Military Trubunal, Aug. 8, 1945, 82 U.N.T.S. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some scholars, including Ammon Rubinstein and Yaniv Roznai, argue that the use of human shields should be a factor in determining whether the use of force was justifiable under the guiding principles of [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. In their view, the use of human shields undermines an attackers right to self defense because the military necessity of self-defense must be a consideration in the excessive force analysis. Rubinstein and Roznai have described this analysis as a "proportionate proportionality."&lt;ref&gt;''See''{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

U. L. Rev. |page=479}}(arguing that an anlysis based on proportionality and distinction that does not discount attackers culpability when human shields are used "unfairly undermines the right to self-defense"), at 490&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubinstein and Roznai argue that an attack that would be disproportionate ought to be considered proportionate, if the presence of civilians is due to the wrongful actions of the enemy.  They use the term "impeded party" to describe the burden placed on the attacking party under International Humanitarian Law norms. They point out that "attacking party" has traditionally been synonymous with the aggressor, but that it is often the attacker who is "defending democracy" and acting in self-defense when they use force in response to a prior attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev.'|page=93}}, at 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Fischer believes that the increase of civilian casualties that began with the Vietnam War is partially due to an increased use of "illegal and perfidious" tactics in modern warfare, including the use of civilians as human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am. U. L. Rev. |page=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized Human Rights Watch for not including human shields doctrine as a factor in excessive force analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am. U. L. Rev. |page=479}}, at 488-89 (arguing that attackers can not meet Article 57 obligations to take "precationary measures" unless defenders separate civilian and military targets.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary and involuntary ===
Combatants in an armed conflict are prohibited from using protected civilians as involuntary human shields to support an unjust war effort. Civilians who are used as involuntary human shields by unlawful combatants do not lose their basic rights.&lt;ref name=OHEW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Haque |first=Adil Ahmed |editor-last=Lazar |editor-first=Seth  |encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Ethics and War |title=Human Shields |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-994341-8|}}; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of involuntary human shields does not release the other party from legal obligations to not target civilians or inflict excessive collateral damage.

Voluntary human shields may be considered "direct participants in hostilities," if they shield targeted personnel or properties. This could also be considered treason. However, if they are shielding protected personnel or properties, they may still retain their protected status. This debated area of customary international law has not yet been codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and the European Union are considered the main sources for voluntary human shields. In 2003, human rights activists travelled to Baghdad to serve as human shields and protest the unpopular U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2003, American peace activist [[Rachel Corrie]] was killed after she was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer in [[Rafah]] while volunteering with the [[International Solidarity Movement]] as a human shield to prevent the demolition of homes in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Maalouf |first=Kristina |title=The Political Question Doctrine in the Ninth Circuit and Why it Should not have Barred the Adjudication of ''Corrie v. Caterpillar'' |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ggulr44&amp;start_page=35&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=71 |year=2014 |volume=44 |journal=Golden Gate U.L L. Rev |page=35}}, at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current limitations of IHL ===
While IHL does prohibit attacks on civilians, the precautions a power must take before an attack remain ill-defined. Proportionality remains a nebulous standard that does not set a predictable standard of when a military action would be considered lawful. There is a lack of enforcement, and the increasing role of private actors and contractors on the battlefield presents new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. law ===
During the Civil War, the United States adopted the [[Lieber Code]], recognized by many scholars as the first detailed code governing conduct in war. Dr. [[Francis Lieber]] articulated an early version of the principle of proportionality: that civilians were not to be targeted, but were also not immune in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand. J. Transnat'l L. |page=1447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of human shields is prohibited and defined as a war crime by several U.S. military manuals. It is also defined as a crime triable by military commission under the US Military Commissions Act (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |title=Customary IHL – Practice Relating to Rule 97. Human Shields |publisher=International Committee for the Red Cross |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule97 |date= 12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern warfare tactic ==
If the belligerent attacks in areas where human shields are used, this can weaken international and domestic support by exploiting harmed civilians. For nations that are particularly sensitive to collateral damage, an enemy's use of shields may effectively deter or delay military actions.

'''''Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity''''' is a 2014 book by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], an Indian-American author, philanthropist and public speaker, published by HarperCollins. The book is an appeal against the thesis of [[Neo-Vedanta|neo-Hinduism]] and a defense of [[Vivekananda]]'s view of [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]]. The book argues for a unity, coherence, and continuity of the Yogic and Vedantic traditions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. It makes proposals for defending Hinduism from what the author considers to be unjust attacks from scholars, misguided [[Public intellectual#Public intellectual life|public intellectuals]], and hostile religious polemicists.

==Background and release==
Malhotra had written several previous books defending various aspects of Hinduism. He states that ''Indra's Net'' was catalyzed by a 2012 panel at the meetings of the [[American Academy of Religion]] to discuss his book ''[[Being Different]]'' (2011). Two panelists based their objections against the book on the "single premise"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=45}} that no unified Hindu tradition existed. These panelists "regarded any notion of Hindu unity as a dangerous fabrication and saw me as guilty of propagating it."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=45}} Malhotra had known of several distinct cases of bias
{{quote|
where the great Hindu visionaries of the modern era were being charged with [[proto-fascism]] which struck me as bizarre. But I had not connected the dots or realized how insidious and widespread such a theory had become. Once I started to unravel the myth-making of [[neo-Vedanta|neo-Hinduism]] and the ideological motivations behind it, I saw the dire need to contest its widespread acceptance among academic scholars and so-called experts on Hinduism. I decided that the battle must be taken to the [[academia|academic fortress]] where the nexus is headquartered and from where it spreads its [[narrative]]s.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=44}}
}}

The book's central metaphor is "[[Indra's net|Indra's Net]]". As a scriptural image "Indra's Net" was first mentioned in the [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] (c. 1000 [[BCE]]).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=4–5,310}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] verse 8.8.6. says: "Vast indeed is the tactical net of great Indra, mighty of action and tempestuous of great speed. By that net, O Indra, pounce upon all the enemies so that none of the enemies may escape the arrest and punishment." And verse 8.8.8. says: "This great world is the power net of mighty Indra, greater than the great. By that Indra-net of boundless reach, I hold all those enemies with the dark cover of vision, mind and senses."{{cite book |last=Ram |first=Tulsi |title=Atharva Veda: Authentic English Translation|year=2013 |publisher=Agniveer|pages=910–911 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU0CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA911 |accessdate=26 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU0CAgAAQBAJ |archivedate=30 March 2014}}}}{{rp|910–911}} In Buddhist philosophy, Indra's Net served as a metaphor in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=13}}{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}} and was further developed by [[Huayan school|Huayen]] Buddhism to portray the interconnectedness of everything in the universe.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=13}}{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}}{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}
Malhotra employs the metaphor of Indra's Net to express
{{quote|
the profound cosmology and outlook that permeates Hinduism. Indra's Net symbolizes the universe as a web of connections and interdependences.... The net is said to be infinite, and to spread in all directions with no beginning or end. At each node of the net is a jewel, so arranged that every jewel reflects all the other jewels.... a microcosm of the whole net.... [and] individual jewels always remain in flux.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=4–5}}
}}

The book uses Indra's Net as a metaphor for the understanding of the universe as a web of connections and interdependences, an understanding which Malhotra wants to revive as the foundation for [[Vedas|Vedic]] cosmology,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=4}} a perspective that he asserts has "always been implicit"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=18}} in the outlook of the ordinary Hindu.

''Indra's Net'' was released in India on 29 January 2014 at the [[Vivekananda International Foundation]], where a talk was given by [[Arun Shourie]].{{sfn|Shourie|2014}}
Shourie stated that in the book, Malhotra "has given us a pair of spectacles, a new pair of spectacles through which to understand... our own religions and our own tradition".&lt;ref name=shourietranscript14&gt;{{cite web |last=Das |first=Sankhadip |title=Transcript: Arun Shourie's Lecture on 'Indra's Net' |url=http://beingdifferentforum.blogspot.in/2014/03/transcript-arun-shouries-lecture-on.html |work=beingdifferentforum.blogspot.in |accessdate=24 March 2014 |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book seeks to expose and refute the so-called [[Neo-Vedanta|neo-Hinduism]] thesis,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=8}} intending to refute "the influential narrative that Hinduism was fabricated during British rule and became a dangerous ''new'' religion",{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}}{{rp|xiv}}{{refn|group=note|Scholars have argued that "Hinduism" is a concept that developed during the 19th century, imposing an unity to various Indian religions. Recently, this argument has been modificated, noting that there is also a long-standing mutual influence.}} and the thesis that "[[Swami Vivekananda]] plagiarized Western secular and Christian ideas and then recast them in Sanskrit terminology to claim Indian origins for them."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Western scholars argue that Hindu reformers like [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]], under the influence of and in defense against western culture and religion, created a new vision of Hinduism which incorporated western elements to safeguard it from these western influences.{{sfn|King|1999a}}{{sfn|King|1999b}}{{sfn|De Michelis|2005}}}} As Malhotra explains:
{{quote|Branding of contemporary Hinduism as a faux Neo-Hinduism is a gross mischaracterization of both traditional and contemporary Hinduism. (In this book) I will use "contemporary Hinduism" in a positive sense and distinct from the dismissive "Neo-Hinduism", and show that contemporary Hinduism is a continuation of a dynamic tradition.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}}}}

''Indra's Net'' contains 12 numbered chapters divided into two major parts, as well as introductory and concluding sections, notes, and an index. The first major part is called ''Purva Paksha'', "Examination of My Opponents' Positions". The second major part is called ''Uttara Paksha'', "My Response."

===Part I: Purva Paksha - "Examination of My Opponents' Positions"===
In this part of the book, Rajiv Malhotra gives an overview of his understanding of the development of the so-called "neo-Hinduism thesis."

====Chapter One- Eight myths to be Challenged====
Chapter One presents the following eight myths that, according to Malhotra, neo-Hinduism thesis supports:
* Myth 1: India’s optimum state is Balkanization:
** Malhotra says that by using this myth "theories of coherence of India and its civilization are dismissed" and this discourse has been used to "stir up internal divisiveness and conflict." 
* Myth 2: Colonial Indology’s biases were turned into Hinduism
** This myth propagates that while interpreting traditional Hindu texts "Indian leaders took their cues exclusively from the west".    
* Myth 3: Hinduism was manufactured and did not grow organically
** Malhotra mentions that proponents of neo-Hinduism thesis charge that Hindu leaders particularly "Vivekananda, Gandhi and Aurobindo invented a ''new'' religion called Hinduism", using "western ingredients in order to promote a "political agenda". Malhotra asserts that this "characterisation reveals a serious misunderstanding of Indian Culture."          
* Myth 4: Yogic experience is not a valid path to enlightenment and tries to copy Western science
** This myth calls into question the "direct experience of higher states of consciousness attained in meditation". Malhotra says that proponents of neo-Hinduism charge that only ''Sruti'' can lead to path of enlightenment. Core pointed mentioned in refuting this myth is that Hinduism has "room both for textual authority and direct experience".  
* Myth 5: Western social ethics was incorporated as seva and karma yoga
** Malhotra mentions that concepts of Seva and Karma Yoga have been part of ancient tradition. There have been ascetics, (even prior to arrival of Britishers) who "have devoted their lives serving the public rather than withdrawing from society".      
* Myth 6: Hinduism had no prior self-definition, unity or coherence
** Indra's Net explores this myth in great detail. Malhotra mentions that the West views Hinduism from its own traditions having a "central authority" or "closed canon". Hinduism unlike Abrahamic religions has a unique "[[open architecture]]" that celebrates "decentralization". Malhotra mentions that this book establishes that "Indian coherence is not built on "Western notions of coherence and unity".       
* Myth 7: Hinduism is founded on oppression and sustained by it
** Malhotra mentions that the Neo-Hinduism thesis demonizes Hinduism and Sanskrit as "oppressive and fossilized, thus discarding centuries of cultural and philosophical developments". In Indra's net, Hinduism has been explained as an "Open Architecture" that helps in "absorbing multiple communities, metaphysical points of view, and new scientific developments".
* Myth 8: Hinduism presumes the sameness of all religions
** Last chapter in Indra's Net (present book) refutes this idea.

====Chapter Two - The Mythmakers- A Brief History====
Chapter Two, gives a background about "myth-makers" and their inter-linkages. This chapter present a history of the neo-Hinduism thesis as it was developed and expressed by scholars and gained wider cultural attention. Malhotra highlights the importance of German scholar [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]] who, according to Malhotra, was the first to develop the thesis of Neo-Hinduism in 1950s. According to Malhotra, Hacker "popularized the use of term Neo-Hinduism to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being [[Swami Vivekananda]]."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}}

The book mentions that the roots of thesis of Neo-Hinduism were in the depiction of Hinduism by Christian missionaries as "India's past being chaotic, incoherent and without clear and ethical philosophical ideas". In this regard the books cites T.E Slater of London Missionary Society who mentions: "We cannot properly speak of the religion of India any more than we can speak of India as a country".{{sfn|Slater|2010}} He further states that "Hinduism is rather a congeries of divergent systems of thought, each of which at one time or another called itself Hinduism, but forms no part of a consistent whole".{{sfn|Slater|2010}} The book mentions that certain Western scholars subsequently "began to amplify" the notion that "contemporary Hinduism was an attempt to fabricate an identity that had never before existed"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}}

In subsequent chapters, most attention is given to writings by the German scholar [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]] (ch. 3), Leopold Fischer, later known as [[Agehananda Bharati]] (ch. 4), Ursula King (ch. 5), and the [[Trinidad]]-born [[Anantanand Rambachan]] (ch. 6), who are characterized, along with Hacker's associate William Halbfass, as the "pioneers"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=48}} who established the thesis or myth of Neo-Hinduism. Various details are supplied on these scholars' biographies, ideas, and sometimes methodologies.

Malhotra states that the work of these "founders" then led to "echoes"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=49}} among Western humanistic scholars such as [[Heinrich von Stietencron]], [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], [[Sheldon Pollock]], [[Richard E. King|Richard King]], and others. These led to further echoes among Indian academics such as [[Romila Thapar]] and [[Meera Nanda]], and among Indian public intellectuals such as [[Pankaj Mishra]] and [[Jyotirmaya Sharma]]. From these circles, the "myth of neo-Hinduism" has been widely disseminated through media, popular culture, and government policy-making, and is "increasingly assumed by cosmopolitan Indians who imagine they are... well-informed".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=55–6}} Part 1 also notes that these views have been resisted by some academic "defenders"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=145}} of contemporary Hinduism, including [[Arvind Sharma]],{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=145}} Brian Smith,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=146}} and Krishna Prakash Gupta.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=148}}

==== Chapter Three - Paul Hacker's Construction of 'neo-Hinduism' ====
This chapter is about Paul Hacker, who, as per Indra's Net was the pioneer of "neo-Hinduism" thesis. Chapter three begins by mentioning that during initial part of his career Hacker had developed "intense interest in [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]]". He spent a year as a professor at Mithila Postgraduate Research Institute in Darbhanga, India and then was awarded Indology Chair (Germany’s oldest chair for Indian studies) at the University of Bonn .

The chapter indicates that during an initial phase of his life, he used ideas of Hinduism in his personal explorations as a Christian. This is corroborated by Hacker's heir and admirer, [[Wilhelm Halbfass]].{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=16}} Halbfass also mentions that Hacker's conversion from Lutherean Protestantism to Catholicism in 1962 was partly motivated by the need to critique Hinduism from a firmer Christian footing.{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=16}}

The chapter indicates that the extent of "positive engagement" with contemporary Hinduism was limited to what Hacker viewed as "pure" traditional Vedanta. It is mentioned that there was a "tipping point" beyond which Hacker began to altogether dismiss modern Vedanta as exemplified by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]].

The chapter further indicates following important points:
# Hacker "developed the thesis of invention of Hinduism in ten articles published between 1954 and 1978". 
# In these articles, "acting on Hacker's wishes the editor of his collected works excluded Hackers's polemical Christian writing." This "misled readers into thinking that his writings on Hinduism were objective evaluations".
# The book mentions that no one suggested the term ''neo-Christianity'' for "the revisions that were undertaken in Christianity during the same period when Vivekananda was active" and yet it seemingly is acceptable to use ''neo-Hinduism'' for any changes during the same period.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010| p=188}} The book also mentions the argument between Indian philosopher J. N. Mohanty and Wilhelm Halbfass on this issue.{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p= 324}}
# The chapter highlights four major areas in which Hacker claims that "neo-Hinduism", deviates seriously from traditional Hinduism. These are:
## '''Importance of Direct Experience over traditional text-based doctrines:''' Hacker mentions [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]], [[Debendranath Tagore]], [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] etc., under influence of Western thought, "reversed the priority established by the Sage [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumarila]] and other orthodox commentators". Hacker alleges that "Radhakrishnan inverts the priority between Shruti and experience from the order found in [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimansa]] philosophy{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=248}} (i.e. For Radhakrishnan experience ranks higher than Shruti).
## '''"Tat Tvam Asi" Ethic:''' Hacker mentions that the rationale of "Tat Tvam Asi" as deliberately misconstrued by Vivekananda. According to Hacker "Tat Tvam Asi" originally referred to merging of individual self with the "ultimate self" - the ''Brahman.'' Hacker disputes Vivekananda's interpretation that this is the ethic of altruism. The article also cites Hacker's opposition to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s interpretation of this ethic.{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=277}} Hacker mentioned that this system of ethics as originally envisioned "did not support any social purpose", instead it caused Indian to be "apathetic and socially uninterested".
## '''Nationalist Agenda:''' Hacker mentions that Gandhi's principle of ''Ahimsa'' was borrowed from Christianity's teaching of loving ones's neighbour as oneself. Hacker mentioned that'''- "'''(Gandhi) made Ahimsa a norm for political action which it has never been in the Hindu Past".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p= 242–243}} The book also says that Hacker particularly attacked the interpretation of ''Dharma'' by Vivekananda, [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]], and Radhakrishanan in his essay "The Concept of Dharma in neo-Hinduism". Hacker argues that Sri Aurobindo (and later under his influence, Radhakrishnan) redefined ''Dharma'' as social activism or ''Svadharma'' (one's own Dharma), which was more in line of Western concepts.
## '''Inclusiveness and sameness:''' Hacker describes the neo-Hindu inclusiveness as a tendency to appropriate everything good from disparate Indian traditions and label it Hindu. Halbfass agrees with this claim and mentions that "Inclusivism is a new device created to bring fictional unity to Hinduism which had been absent."

==== Chapter Four - Agehananda Bharati on Neo Hinduism as a "Pizza Effect" ====
This Chapter is about [[Agehananda Bharati]] and his thesis on "Neo-Hinduism", who was influenced by the writings of Paul Hacker. Bharati was professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]] for over 30 years, an academic [[Sanskrit]]ist, a writer on religious subjects, and a [[Hindu]] [[monk]] in the [[Dasanami Sannyasi]] [[Order (religious)|order]]. According to Malhotra, his shift towards what Malhotra calls a negative outlook on the so-called "Hindu Renaissance,"{{sfn|Bharati|1970}} called "contemporary Hinduism" by Malhotra, started from his paper ''The Hindu Renaissance and its Apologetic Patterns'' published in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' in 1970.{{sfn|Bharati|1970}} According to Bharati, as summarized and paraphrased by Malhotra, Neo-Hinduism is a "political and artificial fabrication" that is "completely disconnected from the past". According to Malhotra, two major points made by Bharati are that: (1) "Neo-Hinduism" is not “Scholarly” as per western standards and (2) "Neo-Hinduism" does not follow the scholarly traditions of Hinduism itself.{{refn|group=note|Bharati notes that only "a small fraction"of the literature of the Hindu Renaissance approaches learned orhtodoxy. He compares this to Ramana Maharshi, noting that Ramana Maharshi uses a "solid scriptutal diction." Bharati calls Ramana Maharshi an example of the "Great Tradition" of Hinduism, with "statements that could have been made at any time," in contrast to the Hindu Renaissance jargon.{{sfn|Bharati|1970|p=283}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bharati further notes: "The orthodox pandit's approach to exegesis and to the use of the scripture converges with the Western Indologist's to the extent that the primary text is taken as the base from where both proceed. The agents of the Renaissance mistrust and dislike both, and they replace them by nontextual, generalized, impressionistic peroration of the type set forth by Vivekananda and the other scions of the Renaissance and its apologetic."{{sfn|Bharati|1970|p=285}}}}

Bharati introduced the well-known term "[[pizza effect]]". Pizza, which originated in Italy, was brought to the US by Italian immigrants. Then varieties of taste, toppings, and embellishments were developed in the US. This modified pizza was brought back to Italy. Agehananda Bharati said that Indians similarly copied western ideas and values, gave them Indian names and then re-marketed them to the west. Bharati mentions that even Vivekananda's and Gandhi’s insistence on physical work (linked to Karma Yoga) is a western import (Western work ethics). The success of these familiar ideas in an exotic guise led in turn to an appreciation of the enculturated ideas in India, due to the fame that their proponents acquired in the west.{{sfn|Bharati|1970|p=273}}

An instance of this pizza effect, as noted by Bharati (and incorporated by Neo Hinduism thesis), is that "[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagvad Gita]] was given the exalted stature by Britishers and Western Indologists and Indians simply followed it". Bharati mentions that Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi "took inspiration from Gita only after it was glorified by Westerners". Rajiv Malhotra mentions that "Bharati conveniently ignores that fact that long before arrival of Europeans, Shankara, Ramanuja, Vallabha had written commentaries on Gita".

===Part II: Uttara Paksha - "My Response"===

The second part is called ''Uttara Paksha'', "My Response." It first centers on Andrew J. Nicholson's ''[[Unifying Hinduism]]'', which argues that already in medieval times Brahmanical thinkers sought to reconcile the various astika-traditions, and the studies by [[Anantanand Rambachan]], who argues that Vivekananda misunderstood Shankara's use of the term ''[[anubhava]]''. The subsequent chapters present Malhotra's view on Hinduism as an "open architecture," and the means to defend this open architecture against western hegemony.

It opens with chapter eight, which argues, following Nicholson, that prior to colonialism there had been "a vibrant flow of Indian ideas"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=173}} and much unification of Hinduism by thinkers such as [[Vijnanabhiksu]]. It presents the concepts of "[[Āstika and nāstika|astika]] (those who affirm) and [[Āstika and nāstika|nastika]] (those who do not affirm)"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=154}}&amp;nbsp;— terms sometimes loosely translated as orthodoxy and non-orthodoxy&amp;nbsp;— arguing that
{{quote|The very existence of these old philosophical categories is clear evidence that people we later started calling Hindus did indeed have an awareness of collective unity and coherence regardless of whether or not they had a name for their identify.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=154}}}}

However, the [[Colonial India|colonial period]] promulgated several distorted understandings of Indian thought, including views of [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical schools]] as "frozen, homogenized and isolated... at war against one another in a manner typical in Western history".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=169}} According to the book, these distortions were shaped by the needs of Europeans to construct arguments in purely ''intra''-European debates on topics such as [[pantheism]] and Europeans' own imagined [[Sanskrit]]-speaking [[Aryan]] ancestry.

Chapter nine document traditional Hinduism's concern for [[selfless service|service to society]]. In chapter ten Malhotra takes issue with Rambachan's scholarly work, arguing that Yoga ''is'' part of Shankara's work. According to Malhotra, "contemporary Advaita Vedanta [...] is based on the experiences of Ramakrishna and crystallized by Swami Vivekananda."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=200}} Malhotra further argues{{refn|group=note|Based on an unpublished manuscript by Kundan Singh (2008), ''Rambachan and the Limits of Social-constructivist Bias in the Analysis of the Thoughts of Swami Vivekananda''. Unpublished paper presented at the Seventh International World Association of Vedic Studies Conference, Orlando, Florida, 2008)}} that Vivekananda's view on anubhava was consistent with later developments in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, and that this "refutes Rambachan's claim that Vivekananda was mimicking European ideas on [[Religious experience#History|direct experience]]."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=202-203}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Mysticism#Scientific studies of mysticism|Scientific studies of mysticism]] and [[Nonduality#Nondual consciousness|Nondual consciousness]] for the notion of "direct experience."}}

In chapter eleven a "big picture"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=233}} vision of Hinduism is presented, based on integral unity, or "unity-in-diversity",{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=234}} represented by Indra's Net. The computer-derived image of "[[open architecture]]" is offered as a metaphor for the Hindu approach to the divine, with a lineage ([[sampradaya]]) or individual teacher ([[guru]]) functioning analogously to a "'[[systems integrator]]' - who selects the components for the client"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=243}} if the client foregoes a do-it-yourself approach. The open-architecture metaphor is "applicable to numerous different schools which share common principles, symbols, and techniques, all... designed to help people gain access to higher states of consciousness.... [and] all have certain common standards and architectural principles".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=242}} [[Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]] and other{{who|date=April 2014}} promulgators of contemporary Hinduism were thus merely offering "an ongoing adaptation"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=259}} within "a long-standing, continually evolving tradition".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=259}}

Chapter twelve, the concluding chapter, warns that the openness and flexibility of the Indian approach is also making it vulnerable to "digestion by predators",{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=259}} such as Western scholars or entrepreneurs who repackage Hindu ideas in Western secular terms, with original Indian sources forgotten. Westerners become "falsely established as original thinkers",{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=267}} while the uncredited Indian source is represented as oppressive or irrational.{{refn|group=note|From ''Indra's Net'' (p. 267): "The Indian source gets depicted in one of two extreme ways: on the one hand, it is abusive to women, hopelessly backward, ridden with weird notions of caste, dowry, sati, etc., and ruled by some very strange-looking half-animal gods; on the other, it is full of romantic otherworldly 'mystical wisdom' that has great potential but lacks 'rationality', which the West must supply."}}

The book's concluding chapter proposes ways to prevent "predators"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=271}} from exploiting the open architecture of Hinduism by more clearly establishing its core principles, such as [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]].
Malhotra proposes that the notion of astika could be helpful for defense if it were clarified. He suggests that several criteria could be used to "disqualify"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=283}} any philosophical or religious view from being considered as astika: history centrism,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=283}} a synthetic cosmology,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=287}} fear of chaos,{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=288}} and a disembodied view of knowing.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=284}}
Malhotra explains that his proposal "is merely a starting point for further discussion and evolution of the categories.... this is how the open architecture has functioned in the past and must function now."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014| p=279}}

V. Raman's blog (http://acharyavidyasagar.wordpress.com)|accessdate=1 April 2014 |date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticized scholars, [[Anantanand Rambachan]], has also written a response extensively contesting the representation of his scholarship.{{sfn|Rambachan|2015}}
''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote that the book "articulates the multidimensional, [[holography|holographic]] understanding of reality" and "offers a detailed, systematic rejoinder"&lt;ref name=thehindu20140205/&gt; to views slandering contemporary Hinduism as illegitimate and inherently oppressive.

In ''[[Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture]]'', Doug Oman wrote that "''Indra’s Net'' is a stimulating, valuable, and partly contentious book that, despite some errors in details, supplies needed correctives for one cluster of serious imbalances in how contemporary
Hinduism has been presented. Over time, concerns it highlights could and should inform health professional training materials for religious diversity".&lt;ref name=oman16/&gt;{{rp|411}}
He also suggested that "Proposing the distinctive core of Hinduism as a dynamic '[[open architecture]]' is perhaps the book’s most stimulating and important scientific contribution,"&lt;ref name=oman16/&gt;{{rp|410}} a model that "suggests many new lines for [[empirical research|empirical inquiry]]"&lt;ref name=oman16/&gt;{{rp|411}} and that "might be adapted to study '[[spiritual but not religious]]' Westerners".&lt;ref name=oman16/&gt;{{rp|411}}

In ''[[The Economic Times]]'', Vithal Nadkarni noted the [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Vedic]] origins of the image of Indra's net. To the reviewer, Malhotra's contention that Hinduism has always spanned traditional, [[Modernity|modern]] and [[postmodernity|post-modern]] categories "evokes the image of [[Trimurti|Shiva's Trinity]], also known as that of Master of Time past, present and future, enshrined at... [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]]".&lt;ref name=nadkami14/&gt;

In ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'', [[M. V. Kamath]] wrote that "Malhotra has done his job in explaining Hinduism [remarkably] well".&lt;ref name=kamath14/&gt;

On ''YouTube'', [[Subramanian Swamy]], former president of the [[Janata Party]] (1990–2013), stated with regard to ''Indra's Net'' that "this kind of writing is something that ultimately should become textbook reading for graduate students in India".&lt;ref name=swamy14/&gt;{{rp|2:45-2:54}} He added that "this imperialism in scholarship [as criticized in the book] is something that Rajiv Malhotra is fighting alone; we need much more support being given to him".&lt;ref name=swamy14/&gt;{{rp|5:18-5:30}}

At the ''Medha Journal'', Pradip Gangopadhyay wrote that Malhotra had "written a stout defense of the coherence and unity of Hinduism",&lt;ref name=gagn14/&gt; although he expressed differences with some parts of Malhotra's analysis. Gangopadhyay felt that Malhotra's "defense of [[Vivekananda|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Swami Vivekananda]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] is genuine and sincere but not always effective", and was "amazed" why Malhotra "did not see [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] as a unifier of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=gagn14/&gt;

On his blog, [[Varadaraja V. Raman]] wrote that "Malhotra has done it again: Written a substantial book on a topic that should interest all those who care for the Hindu world.... Malhotra does for Hinduism what [[G. K. Chesterton]] in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' and [[C. S. Lewis]] in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' did for their religion: presenting robust, positive, and enlightened visions of the religion."&lt;ref name=raman2014/&gt; He added that "What is not pointed out in the book, but deserves mention, is that in spite of more than a century of adverse propaganda, a great many educated people in the West have, by and large, positive images of India and Hinduism."&lt;ref name=raman2014/&gt;

At the website ''Lokvani'', Bijoy Misra expressed appreciation of the book's concern to refute misrepresentations of Hinduism, explaining that he becomes "concerned because the new [erroneous western-driven] literature does become the reading material for my own children and grandchildren, who would have little access to good traditional resources,"&lt;ref name=misra2014/&gt; and that the book "has particular significance for people like me who wish to practice their Hindu faith in the open society of the United States."&lt;ref name=misra2014/&gt; Bijoy Misra also published a review in the journal ''World Affairs: The Journal of International Issues''.&lt;ref name="misrajii2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Misra |first1=Bijoy |title=Indra's NET: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity [book review] |journal=World Affairs: The Journal of International Issues|date=2014|volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=152–155 |url=http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:wa&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=2&amp;article=br |accessdate=4 June 2016 |issn=0971-8052 |oclc=37129916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

===Anantanand Rambachan===
[[Anantanand Rambachan]], whose work was repeatedly criticized in ''Indra's Net'', especially in Chapter 6 ("Rambachan's Argument to Fragment Hinduism"), published a response in the Indian popular cultural magazine ''Swarajya''.{{sfn|Rambachan|2015}} Rambachan stated that "too many of his [Malhotra's] descriptions of my scholarship belong appropriately to the realm of fiction and are disconnected from reality."{{sfn|Rambachan|2015}} Rambachan organized his lengthy response "around thirteen of his [Malhotra's] 'myths' about my work. I can easily double this number,"{{sfn|Rambachan|2015}} also stating that 
{{quote|I share the author’s value for Hindu unity, but [...] The author [Malhotra] wrongly equates serious theological engagement within a tradition with its fragmentation [...] and it is misleading to hold me responsible for what he perceives as Hindu disunity [...] A unity that is grounded in mature and respectful acknowledgment of diversity and difference, open to mutual learning, and rejoicing in all that we share, is a credible one that Hindus can fearlessly and confidently pursue.{{sfn|Rambachan|2015}}

{{quote|
When writing the first edition of ''Indra's Net'', I included Andrew Nicholson's book (Nicholson, 2010) for my literature review and for citation purposes, because of its alluring title, ''Unifying Hinduism''. I was intrigued that a Westerner would break ranks with those who held that Hinduism had lacked unity prior to British colonialism. Nicholson's promise of understanding unity seemed appealing to me, because I (incorrectly) assumed he meant integral unity. Hence, I referenced many of his ideas and arguments, ''naming him as a source about thirty times''.... [But Nicholson's] idea of Hinduism's unity is that it was the result of a relatively recent ''historical'' process; hence the unity is ''not inherent'' in the cosmology.... I call this view a synthetic unity, a unity achieved by gluing things together that in fact were separate. My contention has always been that the unity of sanatana dharma (now commonly known as Hinduism) has ''always'' been built into the tradition from its Vedic origins.&lt;ref name=inet2016/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}

==Revised edition==

A revised edition of ''Indra's Net'' was published by HarperCollins India in 2016. The revised edition omits most references to the work of Andrew Nicholson, and further explains Malhotra's ideas concerning the unity of Hinduism as inherent in the tradition from the times of its Vedic origins.&lt;ref name=inet2016/&gt;{{rp|161–162}} The revised chapter 8, with references, is available online. &lt;ref&gt;[http://rajivmalhotra.com/books/indras-net/changes-chapter-8/ ''Indra's Net'', revised edition, chapter 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aristotelis De anima.jpg|thumb|right|14th century Manuscript of Buridan's ''Questions on Aristotle's'' [[De Anima]].]]
'''Jean Buridan''' ({{IPA-fr|byʁidɑ̃|lang}}; [[Latin]]: ''Johannes Buridanus''; {{circa|1300}} – {{circa|lk=no|1358/61}}) was an influential 14th century [[French people|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

Buridan was a teacher in the [[Faculty (division)#Faculty of Art|faculty of arts]] at the [[University of Paris]] for his entire career, focusing in particular on [[logic]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]. Buridan sowed the seeds of the [[Copernican revolution]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, T.]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sWScX_aduGMC&amp;dq= The Copernican Revolution]'', 1957, pp. 119–123.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the concept of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]], the first step toward the modern concept of [[inertia]] and an important development in the [[History of science in the Middle Ages|history of medieval science]]. His name is most familiar through the [[thought experiment]] known as [[Buridan's ass]], however this thought experiment does not appear in his extant writings.

==Life==
===Education and career===
Buridan was born sometime before 1300 at or near the town of [[Béthune]] in [[Picardy]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"&gt;Zupko 2014, §1&lt;/ref&gt; He received his education in Paris, first at the Collège Lemoine and then at the [[University of Paris]], receiving his [[Master of Arts]] degree and formal license to teach at the latter by the mid-1320s.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt;

Unusually, he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts, rather than obtaining the doctorate in [[law]], [[medicine]] or [[theology]] that typically prepared the way for a career in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt; Also unusual for a philosopher of his time, Buridan further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a [[Secular clergy|secular cleric]], rather than joining a [[religious order]]. A papal letter of 1329 refers to him as simply, "''clericus Atrebatensis diocoesis, magister in artibus'' [a cleric from the Diocese of Arras and Master of Arts]."&lt;ref&gt;Faral 1950, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As university statutes only permitted those educated in theology to teach or write on the subject, there are no writings from Buridan on either theological matters or commentary of [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]''.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt;

Speculation on his reasons for avoiding religious matters have remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Zupko 2003, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars think it is unlikely that he went unnoticed, given his philosophical talents. As well, it is unlikely that he could not afford to study theology, given that he received several bursaries and stipends. Indeed, he is listed in a document from 1349 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the University.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt; Zupko has speculated that Buridan "deliberately chose to remain among the '''artists'' [artistae],'"&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt; possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect, rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt;

The last appearance of Buridan in historical documents came in 1358, where he was mentioned as the adjudicator in a territorial dispute between the [[England|English]] and Picard nations.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt; It is supposed that he died sometime after then, since one of his benefices was awarded to another person in 1361.&lt;ref&gt;Michael 1985, pp. 79–238 399–404&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bishop]] [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], himself renowned as a [[logician]], was among the most notable of his students.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

An ordinance of [[Louis XI of France]] in 1473, directed against the [[nominalism|nominalists]], prohibited the reading of his works.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Apocryphal stories===

Apocryphal stories abound about his reputed amorous affairs and adventures which are enough to show that he enjoyed a reputation as a glamorous and mysterious figure in Paris life.&lt;ref&gt;Faral 1950, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; None of the stories can be confirmed, and most contradict known historical information.&lt;ref name="Faral 9-33"&gt;Faral 1950, p. 9-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rumors hold that he died when the King of France had him put in a sack and thrown into the River [[Seine]] after his affair with the Queen came to light. [[François Villon]] alludes to this in his famous poem ''[[Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis]]''. Others suggest that he was expelled from Paris due to his nominalist teachings and moved to [[Vienna]] to found the [[University of Vienna]]. Another story talks of him hitting [[Pope Clement VI]] with a shoe.&lt;ref name="Zupko 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faral 9-33"/&gt;

==Impetus theory==
{{main|Theory of impetus}}
The concept of ''inertia'' was alien to the physics of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle, and his [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] followers held that a body was only maintained in motion by the action of a continuous external [[force]]. Thus, in the Aristotelian view, a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to ''eddies'' or ''vibrations'' in the surrounding medium, a phenomenon known as ''[[antiperistasis]]''. In the absence of a proximate force, the body would come to rest almost immediately.

The theory of impetus proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body, imparted when it was set in motion. Buridan was the first to name this motion-maintaining property ''impetus'' but the theory itself probably did not originate with him. A less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in the [[Avicenna]]'s doctrine of ''mayl'' (inclination).&lt;ref name="Zupko 6"/&gt; In this he was possibly influenced by [[John Philoponus]] who was developing the Stoic notion of ''hormé'' (impulse).&lt;ref name="Zupko 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zupko 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between Buridan's theory and that of his predecessor is that he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously, instead asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and [[gravity]] which might be opposing its impetus. Buridan further held that the impetus of a body increased with the speed with which it was set in motion, and with its quantity of matter. This is closely related to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Buridan saw impetus as ''causing'' the motion of the object:

:''...after leaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion'' (''Questions on Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' XII.9: 73ra).&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Glick, S. J. Livesay, F. Wallis, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;dq= Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia]'', 2005, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buridan also contended that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined by the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject. In this way, the acceleration of a falling body could be understood in terms of its gradual accumulation of units of impetus.&lt;ref name="Zupko 6"/&gt;

===Legacy===

Because of his developments, historians of science [[Pierre Duhem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duhem|first1=Pierre|title=Études sur Léonard de Vinci|date=1906–13|publisher=Hermann|location=Paris|volume=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anneliese Maier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Anneliese|title=Studien zur Naturphilosophie der Spätscholastik|date=1955|publisher=Storiae Letteratura|location=Rome|chapter=Metaphysische Hintergründe der spätscholastischen Naturphilosophie}}&lt;/ref&gt; both saw Buridan as playing an important role in the demise of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=Physical Science in the Middle Ages|date=1971|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521292948|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Physical_Science_in_the_Middle_Ages.html?id=bD2himiEabQC&amp;redir_esc=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duhem even called Buridan the forerunner of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;Duhem 1906–13&lt;/ref&gt; Zupko has disagreed, pointing out that Buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics, but instead remained a committed Aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent.&lt;ref name="Zupko 6"/&gt;

'''Klaus K. Klostermaier''' (born 1933) is a prominent German-Canadian scholar on [[Hinduism]] and [[Indian history]] and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (1993), Today's Woman in World Religions, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791416884}}, page 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna King (2006), Indian religions : renaissance and renewal : the Spalding papers in Indic studies, Equinox, {{ISBN|978-1845531690}}, See chapter by Karel Werner and Klaus Klostermaier, [https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7511234 Publisher's Summary, Stanford University]&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a PhD in [[philosophy]] from the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] in 1961, and another in "Ancient Indian History and Culture" from the [[University of Bombay]] in 1969.

An ordained Catholic priest, Klostermaier was a missionary and theology teacher for nine years in India in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=karelwerner132/&gt; His study of Hindu texts and scholarship, while living with practicing Vaishnava Hindus there, resulted in his ''Der Hinduismus'' published in 1965.&lt;ref name=karelwerner132/&gt; The expertise he gained then, led to him being appointed advisor to the Papal office, in the Vatican, on non-Christian religions.&lt;ref name=karelwerner132&gt;Karel Werner (1986), Review: Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland (New Series), Volume 118, Issue 01, pages 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Department of [[Religion]] at the [[University of Manitoba]] ([[Canada]]) in 1970. He received a Rh-Institute Award for "Excellence in the [[Humanities]]", of a Templeton Course Award in Science and Religion and an Award for Excellence in Graduate teaching from the University of Manitoba. He was the University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Manitoba in Canada.&lt;ref name=klostermaircanada/&gt;&lt;ref name=hcoward50years100&gt;Harold Coward (2014), Fifty Years of Religious Studies in Canada: A Personal Retrospective, Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

In 1998, for his scholarship on Hinduism, he was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]],&lt;ref name=hcoward50years100/&gt;&lt;ref name=klostermaircanada&gt;Oneworld Publishers, [https://www.oneworld-publications.com/authors/klaus-k-klostermaier Klaus Klostermair], Description of Klaus K Klostermair biography (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society of Canada, The Academies of Arts, Humanities and Sciences of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; and was Head of the Department of Religion at the University of Manitoba (Canada) from 1986 to 1997, and director of an "Asian Studies Center", 1990–1995.

He was the Director of Academic Affairs at the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]] from 1997–1998.

== Reception ==
Many of his books have been peer reviewed in journals, some as textbooks on Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;P Pratap Kumar (2010), Introducing Hinduism: The Master Narrative — A Critical Review of Textbooks on Hinduism, Religious Studies Review, Volume 36, Issue 2, pages 115–124&lt;/ref&gt;

George M. Williams described ''Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' as an "Excellent resource by top scholar featuring concise entries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology|publisher=Oxford University|page=314|author=George M. Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Coward]] describes the 2nd edition of ''A Survey of Hinduism'' as "This book offers the most comprehensive, balanced, accessible and yet deeply scholarly presentation of Hinduism in English,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4431-a-survey-of-hinduism.aspx|title=A Survey of Hinduism|work=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "Thomas Hopkins's, The Hindu Religious Tradition, the standard work when it was published some twenty-five years ago, looks rather primitive when compared with Klaus Klostermaier's ''A Survey of Hinduism'', already in second edition by 1994".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Coward (1996), Book Review: "Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices", Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies, Volume 9, pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Klostermaier's ''Survey of Hinduism'' is said to favour "Hindu voices" in its presentation and thereby offer views that have little currency in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Joel P. Brereton |title=A Survey of Hinduism by Klaus K. Klostermaier (Review) |journal=Journal of Asian History |volume=25 |number=1 |year=1991 |pp=86–87 |jstor=41930803}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it states that the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] is [[Vedic]], which pushes back the [[Vedic period]] by several thousand years beyond the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knut A. Jacobsen |title=A Survey of Hinduism by Klaus K. Klostermaier (Review) |journal=Numen |volume=44 |number=1 |year=1997 |pp=97–98 |jstor=3270387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism have also been voiced about the ''Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patricia M. Greer |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism by Klaus K. Klostermaier (Review) |journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies |volume=6 |number=1 |year=2002 |pp=92–94 |jstor=20106796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Witzel]] has called him a "recent convert to a [[David Frawley|Frawleyan]] view of the world which pictures India as the unique cradle of civilization at 10,000 BCE."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Witzel |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Witzel |title=Ein Fremdling im Rgveda |journal=[[Journal of Indo-European Studies]] |volume=31 |number=1 &amp; 2 |year=2003 |pp=107–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}

She was noted for serving as [[Chief of Protocol of the United States]] from 1981 to 1982. Annenberg was married to [[Walter Annenberg]], who was an [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] and newspaper publishing magnate.

In her role as the ambassador's wife, Leonore directed a major renovation of the ambassador's official residence. The Annenbergs contributed to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 presidential campaign and upon his inauguration, Leonore was named [[Chief of Protocol of the United States|Chief of Protocol]], placing her in charge of advising the president, vice president, and Secretary of State on matters relating to [[diplomatic protocol]].

The Annenbergs became major philanthropists, donating money to education facilities, [[Charitable organization|charitable causes]], and the arts. Leonore served on many committees and boards as well.

==Ambassador's wife==
Upon her husband's appointment as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969, Mrs. Annenberg ordered a renovation of the thirty-five room [[Winfield House]], the ambassador's official [[London, England|London]] residence.

The Annenbergs contributed substantially to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 presidential campaign, and upon Reagan's election in 1981, Lee Annenberg was named as [[Chief of Protocol of the United States]]. This position placed her in charge of advising the [[President of the United States|President]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] on matters dealing with [[diplomatic protocol]], and formally welcoming foreign [[dignitary|dignitaries]] upon their arrival to the United States.&lt;ref name="leonore cop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination of Leonore Annenberg To Have the Rank of Ambassador While Serving as Chief of Protocol for the White House|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=43365|publisher=americanpresidency.org|accessdate=2007-11-24|first=Peter|last=Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annenberg oversaw a staff of 60 who worked on myriad details, ranging from the choice of the state gifts that will be given to the guest, to the bathrooms the foreign delegation may visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D7153AF931A35751C1A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Why It's Black Tie at White House|author=Gamarekian, Barbara|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-26|date=December 2, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her position, "It's all about making your guests feel respected and welcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schifando, Peter|author2=J. Jonathan Joseph |year=2007|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|page=43|title=Entertaining at the White House with Nancy Reagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annenberg attracted some controversy during her tenure when she curtsied before the visiting [[Prince Charles]] upon arriving for a diplomatic visit, commentators saying it was unseemly in a republic which gained its independence from the same monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0514/051427.html|title=The great curtsy controversy|author=Melvin Maddocks|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2011-09-26|date=May 14, 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chief of Protocol, she achieved the rank of [[Ambassador of the United States|Ambassador]].&lt;ref name="leonore cop"/&gt; Friends of [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]], the Annenbergs hosted the Reagans annually at their [[Rancho Mirage, California]] estate, "[[Sunnylands]]".&lt;ref name="wadies-nyt"/&gt; Annenberg resigned her post in January 1982, stating that she wanted to spend more time with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tonight, big giver will be receiving|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/home_top_stories/20070618_Tonight__big_giver_will_be_receiving.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131060431/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/home_top_stories/20070618_Tonight__big_giver_will_be_receiving.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-31|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=2007-06-18|accessdate=2007-11-25|first=Karen|last=Heller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and committee work==
After leaving her post at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], Lee Annenberg began work to promote and enhance cultural appreciation in the United States.&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnylandstrust.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=436150|publisher=The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands|title=Leonore Annenberg|accessdate=2008-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925001437/http://www.sunnylandstrust.org/about/about_show.htm?doc_id=436150|archive-date=2008-09-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband continued to donate money to worthy causes as [[philanthropist]]s. In 2001, Annenberg was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegie.org/sub/awardees/annenbergs.html|title=Ambassador Leonore Annenberg|accessdate=2008-06-26|year=2001|publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222317/http://www.carnegie.org/sub/awardees/annenbergs.html |archivedate = May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being presented the award, she explained why she and her husband donated to causes as philanthropists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Walter and I believe that education is the foundation of a democratic society. When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, my husband has responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.'&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mrs. Annenberg served many charitable organizations and on many committees.&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; Stemming from her interest in and endowments to the arts, she was a trustee emerita and a member of the Acquisitions Committee of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], one of the managing directors of The [[Metropolitan Opera]], honorary trustee and former board president of the Palm Springs Art Museum, and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; Mrs. Annenberg was chairwoman emerita of the Foundation of Art and Preservation in Embassies, and a member of the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]].&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt;

She was also a member of the Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania and an active trustee emeritus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; She served on the governing boards of both [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg Schools for Communication]].&lt;ref name="trust"/&gt; In 1993, she and her husband, [[Walter Annenberg|Walter]], were awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826194408/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 |date=August 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikinews| Billionaire philanthropist Leonore Annenberg dies at 91}}
Lee Annenberg resided in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] prior to her death on March 12, 2009, aged 91. According to a family spokesperson, Leonore Annenberg died at [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] of natural causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8364">'''Leopoldo Zea Aguilar''' (June 30, 1912 in [[Mexico City]]&amp;nbsp;– June 8, 2004) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

==Biography==
One of the integral Latin Americanism thinkers in history, Zea became famous thanks to his master's thesis, ''El Positivismo en México'' (''Positivism in Mexico'' - 1943), in which he applied and studied [[positivism]] in the context of his country and the world during the transition between the 19th and 20th centuries. With it he began the defense of [[Latin American integration|American Integration]], first suggested by the Liberator and Statesman [[Simón Bolívar]], giving it his own interpretation based in the context of [[neocolonialism]] during the separation of the [[American imperialism|American Empire]] and Mexico.

In his works, Zea demonstrates that historical facts aren't independent from ideas, and that they do not arise from what is considered unusual, but from simple reactions to certain situations of human life.
&lt;!-- En sus planteamientos, demuestra que los hechos históricos no son independientes a las ideas y en la misma forma no se manifiesta en lo abstracto sino a una simple reacción a una determinada situación de la vida humana y popular. --&gt;

In his vision of a united [[Latin America]], he defended his beliefs concerning the place of mankind in the region.  Zea explained that the ''discovery'' of 1492 was nothing more than a ''concealment'' in cultural and known terms, a product of the ideological cross-breeding of the configuration of the Latin American identity, a matter which he revealed on the 5th centenary in 1992. Later, he studied the [[Ontology|ontological]] analysis of Latin America in the cultural and geo-historical planes.

Being of poor origin, Zea worked in 1933 in the office of ''Telégrafos Nacionales'' to help afford the costs of his secondary and university [[education]].

Zea was associated with the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) beginning with his training as a Professor and Philosopher in 1943. In 1947 he founded the Faculty of Philosophy and gave lectures on History of ideas in America. In 1954, he was appointed to a full-time position as a researcher at the Philosophical Studies Center of the University.  In 1966 he became Director of the Faculty, holding this position until 1970. During his time as Director he founded the Latin American Studies College (in 1966) and later founded the Coordination and Propagation Center of the UNAM Latin American Studies (1978). He received multiple awards including the [[Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes]] in 1980, the [[Gabriela Mistral Prize|Premio Interamericano de Cultura "Gabriela Mistral"]] (of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]]) and the [[Medalla Belisario Domínguez]] (of the [[Senate of Mexico]]) in 2000.  Three years later he was cataloged and honored by the UNAM as the oldest professor to work continually without interruptions until his death.

Zea was compared to many diverse political, revolutionary, and intellectual personalities, such as [[Germán Arciniegas]] (who was his friend), [[Che Guevara]], [[José Gaos]] (his mentor), [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], [[Andrés Bello]], [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and others.

His [[philosophy]] embodied his concept of a united Latin America, not in the terms of a [[utopia]], but based in reality, and the renewal of the fight for a people in demand for said change. As a result, he opened up the discourse to other scholars of the subject in the future.

He is Professor of the Philosophy of Law and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University]], and Professor of Law and Distinguished Faculty Fellow at [[Queen's University, Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;http://law.queensu.ca/faculty-research/faculty-directory/green&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Born in [[Bridge of Weir]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]], and educated at [[Queen's University]], Canada, and at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], he completed his dissertation—which culminated in a book, ''The Authority of the State''—under professors [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and later [[Joseph Raz]].  Like Raz, he has been an expositor and defender of the tradition of [[legal positivism]] and wrote the introduction and new supplementary materials for the third edition of [[H.L.A. Hart]]'s classic work ''The Concept of Law.''

In 2006, Green was elected to the Professorship of Philosophy of Law at [[Oxford University]], which includes a Fellowship at [[Balliol College]].  The Professorship, a new statutory chair, was created upon the retirement of Joseph Raz from his personal Chair, also at Balliol. It is one of just two statutory professorships in [[jurisprudence]] at Oxford, the other being held by [[John Gardner (law)|John Gardner]]. In 2010, the distinguished lawyer, Philip Gordon, endowed the Balliol fellowship, and Green became the first Pauline and Max Gordon Fellow at Balliol.  At the same time, Green took up a part-time appointment as Professor and Distinguished University Fellow in the Philosophy of Law at Queen's University. Green is also an Adjunct Professor at [[McMaster University]].

Prior to this, Green taught for most of his career at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] of [[York University]], in Toronto. He has also taught at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], at [[Boalt Hall]] Law School at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]; at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], and was for several years a Regular Visiting Professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] law school. He has been a visiting fellow at [[Columbia University]]'s Center for Law and Philosophy, and a Hauser Global Faculty member at [[New York University School of Law]].

He is founding co-editor (with [[Brian Leiter]]) of ''Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Law''.

'''Mario Kopić''' (born 13 March 1965) is a [[philosopher]], [[author]] and [[translator]]. His main areas of interest include: [[History of Ideas]], [[Philosophy of Art]], [[Philosophy of Culture]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] and [[Philosophy of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zarez.hr/clanci/razgovor-s-mariom-kopicem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danas.rs/dodaci/vikend/knjiga_danas/ili_cemo_naci_smisao_ili_cemo_se_izgubiti&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopić is influenced by and writes extensively on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Reiner Schürmann]] and [[Dušan Pirjevec]]. He also translated works by Nietzsche (''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''), [[Giorgio Agamben]], Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida, [[Emmanuel Levinas]] and Dušan Pirjevec into [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

==Life and work==
Mario Kopić was born in [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]. He studied [[Philosophy]] and [[Comparative Literature]] at the [[University of Zagreb]]; [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] and [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]]; [[History of Ideas]] at the ''Institute Friedrich Meinecke'' at the [[Free University of Berlin]] (under the mentorship of [[Ernst Nolte]]); and [[Comparative Religion]] and [[Anthropology of religion]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] (under the mentorship of Ida Magli).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrvatskodrustvopisaca.hr/hr/dogadanje/biblioteka-tvrda-nova-knjiga-marija-kopica-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Kopić's philosophical work is under the influence of the [[Italy|Italian]] philosophical approach known as ''pensiero debole''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odjek.ba/?broj=16&amp;id=17&lt;/ref&gt; or "weak thought", the [[political]] thought of [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]],&lt;ref&gt;http://pescanik.net/2011/10/hannah-arendt-lijevo-ili-desno/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pescanik.net/2010/12/misljenje-bez-sjaja-slave/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ethical]]-political thought of late [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pescanik.net/2013/08/mislilac-nove-eticnosti/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his latest works ''The Unhealable Wound of the World'', ''The Challenges of the Post-metaphysics'', ''Sextant'' and ''The Beats of the Other'' Kopić developed a kind of onto-politics of liberal-conservative [[postmodernism]] and the post-anthropocentric [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.komunikacija.org.rs/komunikacija/casopisi/fid/XXI_2/15/download_ser_lat&lt;/ref&gt; For him the world is the space of [[being]] as event, and only then the arena of national and social or political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odjek.ba/eng/index.php?broj=02&amp;id=06&lt;/ref&gt; The world, or existence, is our ontological responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://zlaticahoke.blogspot.hr/2016/01/internet-and-philosophy.html/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopić appears in [[Igor Ivanov Izi]]'s 1995 film N.E.P.&lt;ref name="N.E.P.-1995"&gt;https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0465784/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolar was born in [[Maribor]] as the son of the literary critic [[Jaro Dolar]]. In 1978 he graduated in [[Philosophy]] and [[French language]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]], under the supervision of the renowned philosopher [[Božidar Debenjak]]. He later studied at the [[University of Paris VII]] and the [[University of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://egs.edu/faculty/mladen-dolar|title=Mladen Dolar - The European Graduate School|website=egs.edu|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolar was the co-founder, together with [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Rastko Močnik]], of the Society for Theoretical Psychoanalysis, whose main goal is to achieve a synthesis between [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalysis and the philosophy of [[German idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Society_for_Theoretical_Psychoanalysis,_Ljubljana|title=Society for Theoretical Psychoanalysis, Ljubljana - Culture of Slovenia|website=www.culture.si|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolar has taught at the University of Ljubljana since 1982. In 2010 Dolar began his tenure as an Advising Researcher in theory at the [[Jan Van Eyck Academie]], [[Maastricht]], [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janvaneyck.nl/4_4_cv/cv_t_dol.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722031320/http://www.janvaneyck.nl/4_4_cv/cv_t_dol.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main fields of expertise are the philosophy of [[G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22659">{{Gnosticism}}
The '''Nag Hammadi library''' (also known as the "[[Chenoboskion]] Manuscripts" and the "Gnostic Gospels"{{efn|name=pagels|group=notes|The texts are referred to as the "Gnostic Gospels" after [[Elaine Pagels]]' 1979 book of the same name, but the term also has a more generic meaning.}}) is a collection of early Christian and [[Gnostic texts]] discovered near the [[Upper Egypt]]ian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. 

Thirteen leather-bound [[papyrus]] [[codex|codices]] buried in a sealed jar were found by a local farmer named Muhammed al-Samman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Meyer]] and [[James M. Robinson]], ''The Nag Hammadi Scriptures: The International Edition''. HarperOne, 2007. pp 2-3. {{ISBN|0-06-052378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings in these codices comprised 52 mostly Gnostic [[treatise]]s, but they also include three works belonging to the ''[[Hermetica|Corpus Hermeticum]]'' and a partial translation/alteration of [[Plato]]'s [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]. In his introduction to ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', James Robinson suggests that these codices may have belonged to a nearby [[Saint Pachomius|Pachomian]] monastery and were buried after [[Saint Athanasius]] condemned the use of [[Biblical canon|non-canonical]] books in his [[Easter letter|Festal Letter of 367 A.D]]. The discovery of these texts significantly influenced modern scholarship's pursuit and knowledge of early [[Christianity]] and [[Gnosticism#Christianity and Gnosticism|Gnosticism]].

The contents of the codices were written in the [[Coptic language]]. The best-known of these works is probably the [[Gospel of Thomas]], of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete text. After the discovery, scholars recognized that fragments of these sayings attributed to Jesus appeared in manuscripts discovered at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in 1898 ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1|P. Oxy. 1]]), and matching quotations were recognized in other early Christian sources. Subsequently, a 1st or 2nd century date of composition circa 80 [[AD]] or earlier &lt;!--- History International channel this date ---&gt; has been proposed for the lost Greek originals of the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. The buried manuscripts date from the 3rd and 4th centuries.

The Nag Hammadi codices are currently housed in the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Eg-NagHamadi-map.png|right|thumb|The site of discovery, [[Nag Hammadi]] in map of Egypt]]
The story of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 has been described as 'as exciting as the contents of the find itself'.&lt;ref&gt;(Markschies, ''Gnosis: An Introduction'', 48).&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, two Egyptian brothers found several papyri in a large earthenware vessel while digging for fertilizer around the [[Jabal al-Ṭārif|Jabal al-Ṭārif caves]] near present-day [[Hamra Dom]] in Upper Egypt. Neither originally reported the find, as they sought to make money from the manuscripts by selling them individually at intervals. The brothers' mother burned several of the manuscripts, worried, apparently, that the papers might have 'dangerous effects' (Markschies, ''Gnosis'', 48). As a result, what came to be known as the Nag Hammadi library (owing to the proximity of the find to Nag Hammadi, the nearest major settlement) appeared only gradually, and its significance went unacknowledged until some time after its initial discovery.

In 1946, the brothers became involved in a [[feud]], and left the manuscripts with a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[priest]]. His brother-in-law in October that year sold a [[codex]] to the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo (this tract is today numbered Codex III in the collection). The resident [[Coptologist]] and religious historian Jean Doresse, realizing the significance of the artifact, published the first reference to it in 1948. Over the years, most of the tracts were passed by the priest to a Cypriot antiques dealer in Cairo, thereafter being retained by the Department of Antiquities, for fear that they would be sold out of the country. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution]] in 1952, these texts were handed to the Coptic Museum in Cairo, and declared national property.&lt;ref name="The Nag Hammadi Library"&gt;Robinson, James M. ed., ''The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition.'' HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahor Labib]], the director of the Coptic Museum at that time, was keen to keep these manuscripts in their country of origin.

Meanwhile, a single codex had been sold in Cairo to a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[antiques|antique dealer]]. After an attempt was made to sell the codex in both [[New York City]] and [[Paris]], it was acquired by the [[C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich|Carl Gustav Jung Institute]] in [[Zurich]] in 1951, through the mediation of [[Gilles Quispel]]. It was intended as a birthday present to the famous [[psychologist]]; for this reason, this codex is typically known as the [[Jung Codex]], being Codex I in the collection.&lt;ref name="The Nag Hammadi Library"/&gt;

Jung's death in 1961 resulted in a quarrel over the ownership of the Jung Codex; the pages were not given to the Coptic Museum in Cairo until 1975, after a first edition of the text had been published. The papyri were finally brought together in Cairo: of the 1945 find, eleven complete books and fragments of two others, 'amounting to well over 1000 written pages' are preserved there.&lt;ref&gt;(Markschies, ''Gnosis: An Introduction'', 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
The first edition of a text found at Nag Hammadi was from the Jung Codex, a partial translation of which appeared in Cairo in 1956, and a single extensive facsimile edition was planned. Due to the difficult political circumstances in Egypt, individual tracts followed from the Cairo and Zurich collections only slowly.

This state of affairs did not change until 1966, with the holding of the [[Messina Congress]] in [[Italy]]. At this conference, intended to allow scholars to arrive at a group consensus concerning the definition of gnosticism, [[James M. Robinson]], an expert on religion, assembled a group of editors and translators whose express task was to publish a [[bilingual]] edition of the Nag Hammadi codices in English, in collaboration with the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity at the [[Claremont Graduate University]] in [[Claremont, California]].

Robinson was elected secretary of the [[International Committee for the Nag Hammadi Codices]], which had been formed in 1970 by [[UNESCO]] and the Egyptian Ministry of Culture; it was in this capacity that he oversaw the project. A facsimile edition in twelve volumes was published between 1972 and 1977, with subsequent additions in 1979 and 1984 from the publisher [[E.J. Brill]] in [[Leiden]], entitled, ''The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices.'' This made all the texts available for all interested parties to study in some form.

At the same time, in the [[German Democratic Republic]], a group of scholars—including [[Alexander Böhlig]], Martin Krause and [[New Testament]] scholars [[Gesine Schenke]], [[Hans-Martin Schenke]] and [[Hans-Gebhard Bethge]]—were preparing the first German language translation of the find. The last three scholars prepared a complete scholarly translation under the auspices of the [[Berlin]] [[Humboldt University]], which was published in 2001.

The James M. Robinson translation was first published in 1977, with the name ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', in collaboration between E.J. Brill and [[Harper &amp; Row]]. The single-volume publication, according to Robinson, 'marked the end of one stage of Nag Hammadi scholarship and the beginning of another' (from the Preface to the third revised edition). Paperback editions followed in 1981 and 1984, from E.J. Brill and Harper, respectively. A third, completely revised, edition was published in 1988. This marks the final stage in the gradual dispersal of gnostic texts into the wider public arena—the full complement of codices was finally available in unadulterated form to people around the world, in a variety of languages. A cross reference apparatus for Robinson's translation and the Biblical canon also exists.&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., ''The Comprehensive New Testament'', Cornerstone Publications (2008), {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English edition was published in 1987, by [[Yale]] scholar [[Bentley Layton]], called ''The Gnostic Scriptures: A New Translation with Annotations'' (Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1987). The volume included new translations from the Nag Hammadi Library, together with extracts from the [[Heresiology|heresiological]] writers, and other gnostic material. It remains, along with ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English,'' one of the more accessible volumes of translations of the Nag Hammadi find. It includes extensive historical introductions to individual gnostic groups, notes on translation, annotations to the text, and the organization of tracts into clearly defined movements.

Not all scholars agree that the entire library should be considered Gnostic. Paterson Brown has argued that the three Nag Hammadi Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth cannot be so labeled, since each, in his opinion, may explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory.&lt;ref&gt;Essay on the [http://www.metalog.org/ Ecumenical Coptic Project] website, from which the requisite Coptic font may be downloaded.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227104649/http://www.metalog.org/ |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Robinson, NHLE, p.&amp;nbsp;10) Only a few lines from the beginning of ''Origin of the World'' are discernible on the bottom of the eighth leaf.

{{Nihongo|'''Net café refugees'''|ネットカフェ難民|''netto kafe nanmin''}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''cyber-homeless'''|サイバーホームレス|''saibā hōmuresu''}}, are a class of [[homeless]] people in [[Japan]] who do not own or rent a residence (thus having no [[Japanese addressing system|permanent address]]) and sleep in 24-hour [[Internet café]]s or [[manga café]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/28/japan.socialexclusion|title=Tokyo dreaming|publisher=Guardian|language=English|author=Justin McCurry|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such cafés originally provided only Internet services, some have expanded their services to include food, drink, and showers.  They are often used by commuters who miss the last train; however, the net café refugee trend has seen large numbers of people use them as their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]]. [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/eyeonasia/archives/2007/08/japans_net_refu.html Japan's Net Café Refugees]. August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] study estimated that over 5,400 people are spending at least half of their week staying in net cafés.&lt;ref&gt;Water Week. [http://waterweek.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/new-japanese-underclass-net-cafe-refugees-emerges-homeless-and-low-paid-living-in-cubicles-and-net-lounges/ New Japanese underclass, “net cafe refugees”, emerges: homeless and low-paid, living in cubicles, and net lounges]. 17 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this phenomenon is part of an increasing [[wealth gap]] in Japan, which has historically boasted of having a very [[economic inequality|economically equal]] society.&lt;ref name=motherboard&gt;{{cite news |last1=Paul |first1=Kari |title=The Japanese Workers Who Live in Internet Cafes |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgbkdy/the-japanese-workers-who-live-in-internet-cafes |work=Motherboard |date=18 March 2015 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coin-Locker Japan 1.jpg|thumb|right|A coin locker in Japan, costing 100 yen per day]]

==Economics==
According to the Japanese government survey, those staying have little interest in manga or the Internet, and are instead using the place because of the low price relative to any of the competition for temporary housing, [[business hotel]]s, [[capsule hotel]]s, [[hostel]]s, or any other option besides sleeping on the street.  It was also estimated that about half of those staying have no job, while the other half work in low-paid temporary jobs, which paid around 100,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]] ($1000) per month – lower than what is needed to rent an apartment and pay for transportation in a city like [[Tokyo]].

==Facilities==
Some internet cafés offer free showers and sell underwear and other personal items, enabling net café refugees to use the internet cafés like a hotel or hostel.&lt;ref name=motherboard/&gt;

==Cyber-homeless==
Another word for Net café refugees is ''cyber-homeless'', a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms|based on English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_news_america/7951800.stm Japan's recession] [[BBC News]], [[Tokyo]] 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the cyber-homeless are [[unemployed]] or [[underemployment|underemployed]] and cannot afford to rent even the cheapest apartment, which is more than the cost per month to rent an internet booth daily. The cyber-homeless may even use the address of the internet café on [[resume]]s when applying for jobs to conceal their present form of accommodation.

The fee of around ¥1400 to ¥2400 [[Japanese yen|yen]] for a night – which may include free soft drinks, TV, [[manga|comics]] and internet access – is less than for [[capsule hotel]]s. Some cyber-homeless may also be [[freeter]]s.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_1106434"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425822/1106434 |title=Cyber cafes a homeless haven |date=7 May 2007 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Japan==

Internet cafés in [[Dublin]], Ireland are also known to allow homeless people to sleep in chairs or on desks overnight, typically charging [[€]]6–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1121/661637-homelessness-dublin/|title=21% rise in numbers sleeping rough in Dublin|date=21 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lennyantonelli.ie/lenny-antonelli-1/dot-com-boom|title=Dot com boom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/internet-cafes-prove-an-unlikely-refuge-for-city-s-homeless-1.6235|title=Internet cafes prove an unlikely refuge for city's homeless|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/internet-caf-exploiting-homeless-by-charging-10-a-night-to-sleep-on-chairs-and-floors-35470069.html|title=Internet café 'exploiting' homeless by charging €10 a night to sleep on chairs and floors – Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuroesthetics''' ([[Differences between British and American English|or]] '''neuroaesthetics''') is a relatively recent sub-discipline of empirical [[aesthetics]]. Empirical aesthetics takes a [[Scientific method|scientific]] approach to the study of [[aesthetic]] [[perception]]s of [[art]], [[music]], or any object that can give rise to aesthetic judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00443/full|title = Crossing boundaries: toward a general model of neuroaesthetics|last = Martin|first = Manuela M.|date = 7 August 2015|journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00443|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroesthetics received its formal definition in 2002 as the scientific study of the [[Nervous system|neural]] bases for the contemplation and creation of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nalbantian|first=Suzanne|title=Neuroaesthetics: neuroscientific theory and illustration from the arts|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=December 2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=357–368|doi=10.1179/174327908X392906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroesthetics uses [[neuroscience]] to explain and understand the aesthetic experiences at the [[neurology|neurological]] level.  The topic attracts scholars from many disciplines including [[neuroscientist]]s, [[art historian]]s, [[artist]]s, [[psychologist]]s,

== Overview ==
Neuroaesthetics is a field of experimental science that aims to combine (neuro-)psychological research with aesthetics by investigating the "perception, production, and response to art, as well as interactions with objects and scenes that evoke an intense feeling, often of pleasure.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroaesthetics: a coming of age story|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1530-8898|pmid = 20175677|pages = 53–62|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2010.21457|first = Anjan|last = Chatterjee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recently developed field seeks among other things the [[neural correlate]]s of aesthetic judgment and creativity. It is argued that visual aesthetics, namely the capacity of assigning different degrees of beauty to certain forms, colors, or movements, is a human trait acquired after the divergence of human and other ape lineages,&lt;ref name="conde"/&gt; rendering the experience of beauty a defining characteristic of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Next steps in neuroaesthetics: Which processes and processing stages to study?|last = Leder|first = Helmut|date = 2013|journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One core question for the field is whether art or aesthetic preferences are guided by a set of universal laws or principles. Additionally, the evolutionary rationale for the formation and characteristics of these principles are sought. It is believed that identification of the brain circuitry involved in aesthetic judgments (e.g., by using through the use of [[brain imaging]]) can help pinpoint the origin of these responses.&lt;ref name="ramachandran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V.S.|author2=Hirstein, William|title=The Science of Art: A Neurological Theory of Aesthetic Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=1999|volume=6|issue=6–7|pages=15–51|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/rama/art.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302011954/http://www.imprint.co.uk/rama/art.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches of study ==
Researchers who have been prominent in the field combine principles from [[perceptual psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], neurological deficits, and functional brain anatomy in order to address the evolutionary meaning of beauty that may be the essence of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=C. W.|title=NEUROSCIENCE:Enhanced: Is Art Lawful?|journal=Science|date=30 July 1999|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=673–674|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is felt that neuroscience is a very promising path for the search for the quantified evaluation of art.&lt;ref name=technoscience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salah|first=A.A.A.|author2=Salah, A.A|title=Technoscience art: A bridge between neuroesthetics and art history?|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=147–158|url=http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/12500/12500B.pdf|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.12.2.147|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the aim of discovering general rules about aesthetics, one approach is the observation of subjects viewing art and the exploration of the mechanics of [[Visual perception|vision]].&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt; It is proposed that pleasing sensations are derived from the repeated activation of neurons due to primitive visual stimuli such as horizontal and vertical lines. In addition to the generation of theories to explain this, such as [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|Ramachandran's]] set of laws, it is important to use neuroscience to determine and understand the neurological mechanisms involved.

The link between specific brain areas and artistic activity is of great importance to the field of neuroesthetics.&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt; This can be applied both to the ability to create and interpret art. A common approach to uncover the neural mechanisms is through the study of individuals, specifically artists, with neural disorders such as [[savant syndrome]] or some form of [[traumatic injury]]. The analysis of art created by these patients provides valuable insights to the brain areas responsible for capturing the essence of art.

The aesthetic enjoyment of individuals can be investigated using brain imaging experiments. When subjects are confronted with images of a particular level of aesthetics, the specific brain areas that are activated can be identified. It is argued that the sense of beauty and aesthetic judgment presupposes a change in the activation of the brain's reward system.&lt;ref name="technoscience"/&gt;

A crucial aspect of research lies in whether aesthetic judgment can be thought of as a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up process]] driven by neural primitives or as a top-down process with high level cognition. Neurologists have had success researching primitives. However, there is a need to define higher level abstract philosophical concepts objectively with neural correlates. It is suggested that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down, intentional orientation of attention and the bottom-up perceptual facilitation of image construction.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cupchik Gerald C | year = 2009 | title = Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003 | pmid = 19223099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, because untrained persons automatically apply the object-identification habit to viewing artworks, top-down control to reduce this habit may be necessary to engage aesthetic perception. This suggests that artists would show different levels of activation than non-artists.

Aesthetic responses to different types of art and techniques has recently been explored. Cubism is the most radical departure from Western forms of art, with the proposed purpose of forcing the viewer to discover less unstable elements of the object to be represented. It eliminates interferences such as lighting and perspective angle to capture objects as they really are. This may be compared to how the brain maintains an object's identity despite varying conditions.&lt;ref name = "lengger"/&gt; [[modern art|Modern]], [[representational art|representational]], and [[impressionism|impressionistic art]] has also been studied for the purpose of explaining visual processing systems. Yet aesthetic judgments exists in all domains, not just art.&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt;

== Theories of pioneers ==
{{underlinked|section|date=October 2012}}

=== Semir Zeki's laws of the visual brain ===
[[Semir Zeki]], professor of neuroesthetics at the [[University College London|University College of London]], views art as an example of the variability of the brain.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeki Semir | year = 2001 | title = Artistic Creativity and the Brain | url = | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5527| pages = 51–52 | doi=10.1126/science.1062331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeki3"&gt;Zeki, Semir. (1999). Inner Vision: an exploration of art and the brain. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeki4"&gt;Zeki, Semir. (2008). Splendours and Miseries of the Brain, Wiley Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a neurological approach to the source of this variability may explain particular subjective experiences as well as the ranges of abilities to create and experience art. Zeki theorizes that artists unconsciously use techniques to create visual art to study the brain. Zeki suggests that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...the artist is in a sense, a neuroscientist, exploring the potentials and capacities of the brain, though with different tools. How such creations can arouse aesthetic experiences can only be fully understood in neural terms. Such an understanding is now well within our reach."&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, Semir. "[http://www.neuroesthetics.org/statement-on-neuroesthetics.php Statement on Neuroesthetics]." Neuroesthetics. Web. 24 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He proposes two supreme laws of the visual brain.

====Constancy====
Despite the changes that occur when processing visual stimuli (distance, viewing angle, illumination, etc.), the brain has the unique ability to retain knowledge of constant and essential properties of an object and discard irrelevant dynamic properties. This applies not only to the ability to always see a banana as the color yellow but also the recognition of faces at varying angles.

Comparatively, a work of art captures the essence of an object. The creation of art itself may be modeled off of this primitive neural function. The process of painting for example involves distilling an object down to represent it as it really is, which differs from the way the eyes see it. Zeki also tried to represent the [[Theory of Forms|Platonic Ideal]] and the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian Concept]] through the statement: forms do not have an existence without a brain and the ability for stored memory, referring to how artists such as Monet could paint without knowing what the objects in order to capture their true form.&lt;ref name = "zeki1998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeki Semir | year = 1998 | title = Art and the Brain | url = | journal = Daedalus | volume = 127 | issue = 2| page = 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abstraction====
This process refers to the hierarchical coordination where a general representation can be applied to many particulars, allowing the brain to efficiently process visual stimuli. The ability to abstract may have evolved as a necessity due to the limitations of memory. In a way, art externalizes the functions of abstraction in the brain. The process of abstraction is unknown to cognitive neurobiology. However, Zeki proposes an interesting question of whether there is a significant difference in the pattern of brain activity when viewing abstract art as opposed to representational art.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"/&gt;

=== Ramachandran's eight laws of artistic experience ===
[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and his fellow researchers including [[William Hirstein]], developed a highly speculative theory of human artistic experience and the neural mechanisms that mediate it.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; These "laws" combine to develop underlying high order concepts of the human artistic experience. Although not all encompassing as there are undoubtedly many other principles of artistic experience, the theorists claim that they provide a framework for understanding aspects of visual art, aesthetics and design. Although testing of these principles quantitatively may provide future evidence for specific areas of the brain responsible for one kind of aesthetic appeal, the theory faces substantial philosophical and historical objections.

====Peak shift principle====
&lt;!-- Redirect from [[Peak Shift Phenomenon]] --&gt;
This psychological phenomenon is typically known for its application in animal [[discrimination learning]]. In the peak shift effect, animals sometimes respond more strongly to exaggerated versions of the training stimuli. For instance, a rat is trained to discriminate a square from a rectangle by being rewarded for recognizing the rectangle. The rat will respond more frequently to the object for which it is being rewarded to the point that a rat will respond to a rectangle that is longer and more narrow with a higher frequency than the original with which it was trained. This is called a [[supernormal stimulus]]. The fact that the rat is responding more to a 'super' rectangle implies that it is learning a rule.

This effect can be applied to human pattern recognition and aesthetic preference. Some artists attempt to capture the very essence of something in order to evoke a direct emotional response. In other words, they try to make a 'super' rectangle to get the viewer to have an enhanced response. To capture the essence of something, an artist amplifies the differences of that object, or what makes it unique, to highlight the essential features and reduce redundant information. This process mimics what the visual areas of the brain have evolved to do and more powerfully activates the same neural mechanisms that were originally activated by the original object.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt;

Some artists deliberately exaggerate creative components such as shading, highlights, and illumination to an extent that would never occur in a real image to produce a [[caricature]]. These artists may be unconsciously producing heightened activity in the specific areas of the brain in a manner that is not obvious to the conscious mind. It should be noted here that a significant portion of the experience of art is not self-consciously reflected upon by audiences, so it is not clear whether the peak-shift thesis has any special explanatory power in understanding the creation and reception of art.

====Isolation====
Isolating a single visual cue helps the organism allocate attention to the output of a single module thereby allowing it to more effectively enjoy the peak shift along the dimensions represented in that module.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; In other words, there is a need to isolate the desired visual form before that aspect is amplified. This is why an outline drawing or sketch is sometimes more effective as art than an original color photograph. For example, a cartoonist may exaggerate certain facial features which are unique to the character and remove other forms which it shares such as skin tones. This efficiency prevents non-unique features from detracting from the image. This is why one can predict that an outline drawing would be more aesthetically pleasing than a color photograph.

The viewers attention is drawn towards this single area allowing one's attention to be focused on this source of information. Enhancements introduced by the artist more carefully noted resulting in the amplification of [[limbic system]] activation and reinforcement.

====Grouping====
Perceptual grouping to delineate a figure from the background may be enjoyable. The source of the pleasure may have come about because of the evolutionary necessity to give organisms an incentive to uncover objects, such as predators, from noisy environments. For example, when viewing ink blots, the visual system segments the scene to defeat camouflage and link a subset of splotches together. This may be accomplished most effectively if limbic reinforcement is fed back to early vision at every stage of visual processing leading up to the discovery of the object. The key idea is that due to the limited attentional resources, constant feedback facilitates processing of features at earlier stages due to the discovery of a clue which produces limbic activation to draw one's attention to important features.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; Though not spontaneous, this reinforcement is the source of the pleasant sensation. The discovery of the object itself results in a pleasant 'aha' revelation causing the organism to hold onto the image.

An artist can make use of this phenomenon by teasing the system. This allows for temporary binding to be communicated by a signal to the limbic system for reinforcement which is a source of the aesthetic experience.

====Contrast====
Extracting contrast involves eliminating redundant information and focusing attention. Cells in the [[retina]], the [[Lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate body]] or relay station in the brain, and in the [[visual cortex]] respond predominantly to step changes in luminance rather than homogeneous surface colors. Smooth gradients are much harder for the visual system to detect rather than segmented divisions of shades resulting in easily detectable edges. Contrasts due to the formation of edges may be pleasing to the eye. The importance of the visual neuron's varying responses to the orientation and presence of edges has previously been proven by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may hold evolutionary significance since regions of contrast are information rich requiring reinforcement and the allocation of attention. In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.

====Perceptual problem solving====
Tied to the detection of contrast and grouping is the concept that discovery of an object after a struggle is more pleasing than one which is instantaneously obvious. The mechanism ensures that the struggle is reinforcing so that the viewer continues to look until the discovery. From a survival point of view, this may be important for the continued search for predators. Ramachandran suggests for the same reason that a model whose hips and breasts are about to be revealed is more provocative than one who is already completely naked.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; A meaning that is implied is more alluring than one that is explicit.

====The generic viewpoint====
The visual system dislikes interpretations which rely on a unique vantage point. Rather it accepts the visual interpretation for which there is an infinite set of viewpoints that could produce the class of retinal images. For example, in a landscape image, it will interpret an object in the foreground as obscuring an object in the background, rather than assuming that the background figure has a piece missing. 
In theory, if an artist is trying to please the eye, they should avoid such coincidences.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; However, in certain applications, the violation of this principle can also produce a pleasing effect.

====Visual metaphors====
Ramachandran defines a metaphor as a mental tunnel between two concepts that appear grossly dissimilar on the surface, but instead share a deeper connection. Similar to the effects of perceptual problem solving, grasping an analogy is rewarding. It enables the viewer to highlight crucial aspects that the two objects share. Although it is uncertain whether the reason for this mechanism is for effective communication or purely cognitive, the discovery of similarities between superficially dissimilar events leads to activation of the limbic system to create a rewarding process.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt;

Support for this view is highlighted by the symptoms of [[Capgras delusion]], where sufferers experience reduced facial recognition due to impairments in the connections from the inferotemporal cortex to the [[amygdala]], which is responsible for emotions. The result is that a person no longer experiences the warm fuzzy feeling when presented with a familiar face. A person's 'glow' is lost through what is suggested as due to the lack of limbic activation.

====Symmetry====
The aesthetic appeal of symmetry is easily understandable. Biologically it is important during the detection of a predator, location of prey, and the choosing of a mate as all of these tend to display symmetry in nature. It complements other principles relating to the discovering of information rich objects. Additionally, evolutionary biologists suggest that the predisposition towards symmetry is because biologically, asymmetry is associated with infection and disease,&lt;ref name ="ramachandran"/&gt; which can lead to poor mate selection. However, departures from symmetry in visual art are also widely considered beautiful, suggesting that while symmetry may explain the judgment that a particular individual's face is beautiful, it cannot explain the judgment that a work of art is beautiful.

== Areas of the brain linked to the processing of visual aesthetics ==
Aesthetic perception relies heavily on the processing by the visual centers in the brain such as the [[Visual cortex|V1 cortex]]. Signals from V1 are distributed to various specialized areas of the brain.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"/&gt; There is no single area where all specialized visual circuitry connect, reducing the chances of determining a single neural center responsible for aesthetics, rather a neural network is more likely.&lt;ref name = "conde"/&gt; Therefore, the visual brain consists of several parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given task such as color or motion. Functional specializations of the visual brain are already known.&lt;ref name = "kawabata" /&gt;

Physiological phenomenon can explain several aspects of art appreciation. Different [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate areas]] of the visual cortex may have evolved to extract correlations of different visual features. The discovery and linking of various visual stimuli is facilitated and reinforced by direct connections from these areas to [[Limbic system|limbic structures]]. Additionally, art may be most appealing if it produces heightened activity in a single dimension rather than redundant activation of multiple modules, restricted by the allocation of attentional resources.&lt;ref name = "ramachandran" /&gt; In experimentation to determine specific areas, many researchers allow the viewer to decide the aesthetic appeal prior to the use of imaging techniques to account for the varying perceptions of beauty. When individuals contemplate the aesthetic appeal, different neural processes are engaged than when pragmatically viewing an image.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; However, processes of object identification and aesthetic judgment are involved simultaneously in the overall perception of aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; [[File:MRI of orbitofrontal cortex.jpg|thumb|left|Location of the orbito-frontal cortex shown through MRI]]

===Prefrontal cortex===
The [[prefrontal cortex]] is previously known for its roles in the perception of colored objects, decision making, and memory. Recent studies have also linked it to the conscious aesthetic experience because it is activated during aesthetic tasks such as determining the appeal of a visual stimuli. This may be because a judgment is needed, requiring visiospatial memory. In a study performed by Zeki and Kawabata, it was found that the [[orbito-frontal cortex]] (OFC) is involved in the judgment of whether a painting is beautiful or not.&lt;ref name="kawabata"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawabata Hideaki, Zeki Semir | year = 2004 | title = Neural Correlates of Beauty | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 91 | issue = 1| pages = 1699–1705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is high activation in this region when a person views paintings which they consider beautiful. Surprisingly, when a person views a painting which they consider ugly, no separate structures are activated. Therefore, it is proposed that changes in the intensity of activation in the orbito-frontal cortex correlate with the determination of beauty (higher activation) or ugliness (lower activation). Additionally, the medial OFC has been found to respond aesthetics in terms of the context of which it is presented, such as text or other descriptions about the artwork. The current evidence linking the OFC to attributed hedonistic values across gustatory, olfactory, and visual modalities, suggests that the OFC is a common center for the assessment of a stimulus's value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kirk Ulrich | displayauthors=etal | year = 2008 | title = Modulation of aesthetic value by semantic context: An fMRI study | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.10.009 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 1125–1132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of aesthetics for these areas must be due to the activation of the brain's reward system with a certain intensity.

[[File:Gray726-Brodman-prefrontal.svg|thumb|Prefrontal cortex is highlighted in orange. Location of Brodmann's areas indicated by numerical tabs.]]
Additionally, the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|prefrontal dorsalateral cortex]] (PDC) is selectively activated only by stimuli considered beautiful whereas prefrontal activity as a whole is activated during the judgment of both pleasing and unpleasing stimuli.&lt;ref name = "conde"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cela-Conde Camilo J |displayauthors=etal | year = 2004 | title = Activation of the Prefrontal Cortex in the Human Visual Aesthetic Perception | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 16| pages = 6321–6325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0401427101| pmc = 395967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex may be generally activated for directing the attention of the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms towards aesthetic perception in viewers untrained in visual arts.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; In other words, related directly to a person viewing art from an aesthetic perception due to the top-down control of their cognition. The lateral prefrontal cortex is shown to be linked to higher order self-referential procession and the evaluation of internally generated information. The left lateral PFC, [[Brodmann area 10]], may be involved in maintaining attention on the execution of internally generated goals associated with approaching art from an aesthetic orientation.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; As previously mentioned, directing of attention towards aesthetics may have evolutionary significance.

===Additional areas===
Emotions play a large role in aesthetic processing. Experiments designed specifically to force the subjects to view the artwork subjectively (by inquiring of its aesthetic appeal) rather than simply with the visual systems, revealed a higher activation in the brain's emotional circuitry. Results from these experiments revealed high activation in the bilateral [[Insular cortex|insula]] which can be attributed to the emotional experience of viewing art.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; This correlates with other known emotional roles of the insula. However, the correlation between the insula's varying states of activation and positive or negative emotions in this context is unknown. The emotional view of art can be contrasted with perception related to object recognition when pragmatically viewing art. The right [[fusiform gyrus]] has been revealed to show activation to visual stimuli such as faces and representational art.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; This holds importance in the field because as Ramachandran also speculated, object recognition and the search for meaning can evoke a pleasant emotional response. The [[motor cortex]] was also shown to be involved in aesthetic perception. However, it displayed opposite trends of activation from the OFC.&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt; It may be a common correlate for the perception of emotionally charged stimuli despite its previously known roles. Several other areas of the brain were shown to be slightly activated during certain studies such as the [[anterior cingulate cortex]],&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt; previously known for its involvement in the feeling of romance, and the left [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]], whose purpose may be to direct spatial attention.&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt;

Different artistic styles may also be processed differently by the brain. In a study between filtered forms of [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Representation (arts)|representation art]], the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] [[gyri]], left [[cingulate sulcus]], and bilateral [[fusiform gyrus]] showed increased activation with increased preference when viewing art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vartanian O., Goel V | year = 2004 | title = Neuroanatomical correlates of aesthetic preference for paintings | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 893–897 | doi=10.1097/00001756-200404090-00032}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, activation in the bilateral occipital gyri may be caused by the large processing requirements placed on the visual system when viewing high levels of visual detail in artwork such as representational paintings.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; Several areas of the brain have been shown to respond particularly to forms representational art perhaps due to the brain's ability to make object associations and other functions relating to attention and memory. This form of stimuli leads to increased activation in the left [[frontal lobe]] and bilaterally in the parietal and [[limbic lobe]]s.&lt;ref name = "lengger"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lengger Petra G | year = 2007 | title = Functional neuroanatomy of the perception of modern art: A DC-EEG study on the influence of stylistic information on aesthetic experience | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1158 | issue = | pages = 93–102 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2007.05.001| pmid = 17559816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the left superior parietal lobule, [[Brodmann area 7|Brodmann's area 7]], has been shown to play a role in active image construction during the viewing of art specifically containing indeterminate forms such as soft edge paintings.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; Bottom up processes such as edge detection and the exploration of visual stimuli are engaged during this type of aesthetic perception. These roles are consistent with previously known parietal lobe responsibilities in spatial cognition and visual imagery.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
There are several objections to researchers' attempts to reduce aesthetic experience to a set of physical or neurological laws.&lt;ref&gt;For a general critique, see Jonathan Gilmore, "Brain Trust," Artforum. Online at http://www.italianacademy.columbia.edu/art_and_neuro/paper_su06_Gilmore.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable whether the theories can capture the evocativeness or originality of individual works of art.&lt;ref name = "ramachandran" /&gt; Experiments performed may not account for these theories directly. Also, current experimentation measures a person's verbal response to how they feel about art which is often selectively filtered. Ramachandran suggests the use of [[galvanic skin response]] to quantify the judgment associated viewing aesthetics. Overall, it can be argued that there is lack of proportion between the narrow approach to art taken by researchers versus the grand claims they make for their theories.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Anthony. (1999). Signs of the Times: Cracking the code of art's allure. The Unesco Courier.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future directions and related fields ==
Since 2005 the notion of bridging brain science and the visual arts has blossomed into a field of increasing international interest. In his 2008 book, ''Neuroarthistory: from Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'', Professor [[John Onians]] of the [[University of East Anglia]] considers himself to be at the forefront of the field of neural scientific biased art historical research, although such a 'history' is much shorter than Onians would have us believe. Many historical figures he deals with as precursors for neuroarthistory (Karl Marx, for example) have very little to do with modern neuroscience as it is understood today. Contemporary artists like [[Mark Stephen Smith]] (William Campbell Gallery, USA) and others have developed extensive bodies of work mapping the convergence of brain science and painting. Smith's work explores fundamental visual analogies between neural function and self-expression in abstract art. The past decade has also seen a corresponding growth in the aesthetics of music studied from neuroscientific approaches. Psychological and social approaches to art help provide other theories of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lavazza, Andrea(2009). Art as a metaphor of the mind. ''Phenom Cogn Sci'', 8 159-182&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research on disorders and psychological conditions that affect visual processing such as [[dementia]] may provide other valuable insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mendez Mario F | year = 2006 | title = Dementia as a window to the neurology of art | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.03.002 | pmid = 15193339 | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universiteit Twente|University of Twente]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppverbeek.nl/ Retrieved 8th of february 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Netherlands]]), member of the [[Dutch council of state|Dutch council for the Humanities]] and chair of the [[Society for Philosophy and Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spt.org/board/ Retrieved 8th of february 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Verbeek studied Philosophy of Science, Technology &amp; Society at the University of Twente and obtained his [[PhD]] in 2000. His [[dissertation]] was published in English under the title "What things do: philosophical reflections on technology, agency and design".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-02539-5.html Retrieved 8th of february 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He worked closely together with 
[[Hans Achterhuis]] and 
[[Don Ihde]] in formulating an original, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|post-phenomenological]] approach in the tradition of
[[Philosophy of technology|Philosophy of Technology]]. As chair of the philosophy department at the University of Twente, he has been chairman of the young academy, the platform for young researchers of the Dutch Royal Academy of Sciences. Currently, he works on a research project for which he obtained an NWO Vici grant&lt;ref&gt;http://ethicsandtechnology.eu/news/peter-paul-verbeek-awarded-the-nwo-vici-prize/ Retrieved 8th of february 2015&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at the expansion of his theory of technological mediation in the areas of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]].

== Theory of Technological Mediation ==
Verbeek's theory of technological mediation builds on the postphenomenological approach that was firstly stipulated by  
Don Ihde. This approach finds its origins in a synthesis between classical phenomenology and American pragmatism, with as one of its major premises the thesis that "technology only bears meaning in a use context".&lt;ref&gt;Ihde (2009) Postphenomenology and Technoscience; Sunny Press&lt;/ref&gt; From a critique of classical philosophy of technology, in which Verbeek explicitly elaborates on the existentialist philosophy of 
[[Karl Jaspers]] and the hermeneutic philosophy of technology of 
[[Martin Heidegger]].

Verbeek presents as the purpose of his theory of technological mediation to systematically analyzing the influence of technology on human behavior in terms of the role technology plays in human-world relations.&lt;ref&gt;Verbeek (2006); Materializing Morality; Science, technology &amp; human values; vol. 31 nr. 1 p.363&lt;/ref&gt; In his original theory, a number of different human-technology-world relations are stipulated:&lt;ref&gt;Verbeek (2005) What things do; philosophical reflections on technology, agency, and design; Pennsylvania University Press (p.126-128)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Embodiment relations: in which the technology does not call attention to itself but to aspects of the world given through it (e.g. glasses)
* Hermeneutic relations: in which the technology represent a certain aspect of the world (e.g. a thermometer) 
* Background relations: in which technology shapes the experiential context, going beyond conscious experience (e.g. room temperature through a central heating system)
* Alterity relations: in which technology presents itself as quasi other to the subject (e.g. an ATM)

A unique feature of Verbeek's philosophy of technology is its basis in an empirical analysis of technologies. Instead of generating an overarching framework by which the universal features of specific technologies can be analyzed, Verbeek takes the technology itself as point of departure; which is for example illustrated by his analysis of ultrasound technology &lt;ref&gt;Verbeek (2008) Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality : A Postphenomenological Analysis; Human Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophical aspects of the abortion debate''' are [[logical argument]]s that can be made either in support of or in opposition to [[abortion]].

==Overview==
The '''philosophical arguments''' in the [[abortion debate]] are [[deontological]] or rights-based.  The view that all or almost all abortion should be illegal generally rests on the claims: (1) that the existence and moral right to life of human beings (human organisms) begins at or near conception-[[fertilization]]; (2) that induced abortion is the deliberate and unjust killing of the [[embryo]] in violation of its right to life; and (3) that the law should prohibit unjust violations of the right to life.  The view that abortion should in most or all circumstances be legal generally rests on the claims: (1) that women have a right to control what happens in and to their own bodies; (2) that abortion is a just exercise of this right; and (3) that the law should not criminalize just exercises of the right to control one's own body and its life-support functions.

Although both sides are likely to see the rights-based considerations as paramount, some popular arguments appeal to [[consequentialist]] or [[utilitarian]] considerations.  For example, anti-abortion advocacy groups (see the list below) sometimes claim the existence of [[post-abortion syndrome]] or a [[abortion – breast cancer hypothesis|link between abortion and breast cancer]], alleged medical and psychological risks of abortion.  On the other side, pro-choice groups (see the list below) say that criminalizing abortion will lead to the deaths of many women through "[[back-alley abortion]]s"; that unwanted children have a negative social impact (or conversely that [[legalized abortion and crime effect|abortion lowers the crime rate]]); and that [[reproductive rights]] are necessary to achieve the full and equal participation of women in society and the workforce. Consequentialist arguments on both sides tend to be vigorously disputed, though are not widely discussed in the philosophical literature.

==Philosophical argumentation on the moral issue==

Contemporary philosophical literature contains two kinds of arguments concerning the morality of abortion. One family of arguments (see the following three sections) relates to the moral status of the embryo—the question of whether the embryo has a right to life, is the sort of being it would be seriously wrong to kill, or in other words is a "person" in the moral sense.  An affirmative answer would support claim (1) in the central anti-abortion argument, while a negative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-choice argument.

Another family of arguments (see the section on Thomson, below) relates to bodily rights—the question of whether the woman's bodily rights justify abortion ''even if'' the embryo has a right to life.  A negative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-life argument, while an affirmative answer would support claim (2) in the central pro-choice argument.

===Arguments based on criteria for personhood===

{{Further|Beginning of human personhood}}

Since the zygote is genetically identical to the embryo, the fully formed fetus, and the baby, questioning the beginning of personhood could lead to an instance of the [[Sorites paradox]], also known as ''the paradox of the heap''.&lt;ref name=pmid15295850&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/a:1004375726894 |year=1998 |last1=Kerckhove |first1=Lee F |journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=175–189 |last2=Waller |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Anne Warren]], in her article arguing for the permissibility of abortion,&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1973&lt;/ref&gt; holds that moral opposition to abortion is based on the following argument:

#It is wrong to kill innocent human beings.
#The embryo is an innocent human being.
#Hence it is wrong to kill the embryo.
Warren, however, thinks that "human being" is used in different senses in (1) and (2). In (1), "human being" is used in a moral sense to mean a "person", a "full-fledged member of the moral community".  In (2), "human being" means "biological [[human]]".  That the embryo is a biologically human organism or animal is uncontroversial, Warren holds. But it does not follow that the embryo is a person, and it is persons that have rights, such as the right to life.&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1973: 457.  The same point is made in Tooley 1972: 40-43; Singer 2000: 126-28 and 155-156; Pojman 1994: 280; and elsewhere.  Note that "person" can also be used in two senses.  In [[Consciousness#Consciousness as the basis of personal identity|John Locke]]'s sense (often employed in discussions of personal identity), "person" is a ''descriptive'' term that tells us about a being's ''psychological'' properties.  In Warren's sense, "person" is a ''moral'' or ''evaluative'' term that tells us about a being's ''moral'' properties.  Warren and others hold, however, that being a person in the moral sense actually requires being a person in the psychological sense.&lt;/ref&gt;

To help make a distinction between "person" and "biological human", Warren notes that we should respect the lives of highly intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], even if they are not biological humans. She thinks there is a cluster of properties that characterize persons:&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1973: 458.  Glover 1977:127 and English 1975: 316-317 also refer to a 'cluster' of properties as constituting personhood.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[consciousness]] (of objects and events external and/or internal to the being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain
#[[reasoning]] (the ''developed'' capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems)
#self-motivated [[Action (philosophy)|activity]] (activity which is relatively independent of either genetic or direct external control)
#the capacity to [[communicate]], by whatever means, messages of an indefinite variety of types, that is, not just with an indefinite number of possible contents, but on indefinitely many possible topics
#the presence of self-concepts, and [[self-awareness]], either individual or racial, or both
A person does not have to have each of these, but if something has all five then it definitely is a person whether it is biologically human or not, while if it has none or perhaps only one then it is not a person, again whether it is biologically human or not. The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes [[fetal pain|susceptible to pain]]—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1973: 458-459&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers apply similar criteria, concluding that the embryo lacks a right to life because it lacks self-consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Tooley]] argues that the bearer of a right to life must conceive of itself "as a continuing subject of experiences and other mental states" (Tooley 1972: 44), or must at some time possess "the concept of a continuing self or mental substance" (Tooley 1984: 218)&lt;/ref&gt; or rationality and self-consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;Singer 2000: 128 and 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pojman 1994: 281-2&lt;/ref&gt; or "certain higher psychological capacities" including "autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 2002: 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Others conclude that personhood should be based on "brain birth" concept, which is in essence the reversal of the [[brain death]] used as a modern definition of medical [[death]]. Under this proposal, presence of brain waves would be enough to grant personhood, even with other features lacking. Based on whether brain activity in the [[brain stem]], or just in the [[cerebral cortex]], is relevant for personhood, two concepts of "brain birth" emerge:&lt;ref name=pmid9752625&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jme.24.4.237 |jstor=27718134 |pmid=9752625 |pmc=1377672 |title=The Problematic Symmetry between Brain Birth and Brain Death |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=237–42 |last1=Jones |first1=D. Gareth |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* at the first appearance of brain waves in lower brain (brain stem) - 6–8 weeks of gestation (paralleling "whole brain death")
* at the first appearance of brain waves in higher brain (cerebral cortex) - 19-20 weeks of gestation (paralleling "higher brain death")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/fetalpain/AnandPainReport.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These writers disagree on precisely ''which'' features confer a right to life,&lt;ref&gt;On the pro-life side (see below), it is similarly unclear ''which'' features one must have a natural capacity for, in order to have a right to life (cf Schwarz 1990: 105-109), or ''which'' features constitute a "future like ours".&lt;/ref&gt; but agree those features must be certain ''developed'' psychological or physiological features which the embryo lacks.

Warren's arguments face two main objections.  The '''comatose patient''' objection claims that as patients in a reversible [[coma]] do not satisfy Warren's (or some other) criteria—they are not conscious, do not communicate, and so on—therefore they would lack a right to life on her view.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 197; Schwarz 1990: 89; Rogers 1992; Beckwith 1993: 108; Larmer 1995: 245-248; Lee 2005: 263&lt;/ref&gt; One response is that "although the reversibly comatose lack any ''conscious'' mental states, they do retain all their ''unconscious'' [or ''dispositional''] mental states, since the appropriate neurological configurations are preserved in the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Stretton 2004: 267, original emphasis; see Glover 1977: 98-99; Singer 2000: 137; Boonin 2003: 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; This may allow them to satisfy some of Warren's criteria. The comatose also still possess brain activity ([[neural oscillation|brain waves]]), so this objection does not apply to "brain birth" theories. Finally, there are some post-natal humans who are unable to feel pain due to genetic disorders and thus do not satisfy all of Warren's criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6379795/ns/health-childrens_health/t/rare-disease-makes-girl-unable-feel-pain/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''infanticide''' objection points out that infants (indeed up to about one year of age, since it is only around then that they begin to outstrip the [[Animal cognition|abilities]] of non-human animals) have only one of Warren's characteristics—consciousness—and hence would have to be accounted non-persons on her view; thus her view would permit not only abortion but [[infanticide]].  Warren agrees that infants are non-persons (and so killing them is not strictly murder), but denies that infanticide is generally permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1982&lt;/ref&gt; For, Warren claims, once a human being is born, there is no longer a conflict between it and the woman's rights, since the human being can be given up for [[adoption]]. Killing such a human being would be wrong, not because it is a person, but because it would go against the desires of people willing to adopt the infant and to pay to keep the infant alive. (Although, this clarification has problems of its own: beef cattle, chickens, or any other livestock raised for meat--or indeed even some plants--have supporters who would pay to keep the animals alive. Thus, according to Warren, it must be wrong to kill animals, and perhaps even plants.)

Nonetheless, Warren grants that her argument [[logical consequence|entails]] that infanticide would be morally acceptable under some circumstances, such as those of a desert island.  Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] similarly concludes that infanticide, particularly of severely [[disabled]] infants, is justifiable under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Singer 2000: 186-193&lt;/ref&gt; And Jeff McMahan grants that under very limited circumstances it may be permissible to kill one infant to save the lives of several others.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 2002: 359-360&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents may see these concessions as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of these writers' views; while supporters may see them merely as examples of unpleasant acts being justified in unusual cases.

Since brain waves appear in the lower brain (brain stem) in 6–8 weeks of gestation, and in the higher brain (cerebral cortex) in 19-20 weeks of gestation, both "whole brain" and "higher brain" brain birth personhood concepts based on the presence of brain waves do not permit infanticide.&lt;ref name=pmid9752625/&gt;

===The natural capacities view===

Some opponents of Warren's view believe that what matters morally is not that one be ''actually exhibiting'' complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or '''natural capacity''' to develop such qualities.  In other words, what is crucial is that one be the ''kind'' of entity or [[substance theory|substance]] that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself to the point of exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not ''actually'' exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe [[Alzheimer's]]).  Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it ''[[Essential property|essentially]]''—therefore (on this view) they ''essentially'' have a right to life: they could not possibly ''fail'' to have a right to life.&lt;ref&gt;Grisez 1970: 277-287; Lee 1996 and 2004; Lee and George 2005: 16-20; Schwarz 1990: 91-93; Beckwith 1993: 108-10; Reichlin 1997: 22-23; and many others.  Note that on Marquis's view (see below), by contrast, one ''could'' fail to have a right to life—for example by becoming [[persistent vegetative state|irreversibly comatose]], since one's future would then lack valuable experiences and activities.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, since modern [[embryology]] shows that the embryo begins to exist at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.

Grounding the right to life in essential ''natural'' capacities rather than accidental ''developed'' capacities is said to have several advantages.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee 2004: 254-255; Lee and George 2005: 18-19; Schwarz 1990: 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; As developed capacities are on a continuum, admitting of greater and lesser degrees—some, for example, are more rational and self-conscious than others—therefore: (1) the "developed capacities" view must ''arbitrarily'' select some particular degree of development as the cut-off point for the right to life—whereas the "natural capacities" view is non-arbitrary; (2) those whose capacities are ''more'' developed would have ''more'' of a right to life on the 'developed capacities' view—whereas the "natural capacities" view entails we all have an ''equal'' right to life; and (3) the continuum of developed capacities makes the exact point at which personhood ensues vague, and human beings around that point, say between one and two years of age, will have a shadowy or [[vagueness|indeterminate]] moral status—whereas there is no such indeterminacy on the "natural capacities" view.&lt;ref&gt;This third point is discussed in McMahan 2002: 261-265&lt;/ref&gt;

Some defenders of Warren-style arguments grant that these problems have not yet been fully solved,&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 2002: 261-265; Stretton 2004: 281-282&lt;/ref&gt; but reply that the "natural capacities" view fares no better.  It is argued, for example, that as human beings vary significantly in their natural cognitive capacities (some are [[inheritance of intelligence|naturally]] more intelligent than others), and as one can imagine a series or spectrum of species with gradually diminishing natural capacities (for example, a series from humans down to [[amoebae]] with only the slightest differences in natural capacities between each successive species), therefore the problems of arbitrariness and inequality will apply equally to the "natural capacities" view.&lt;ref&gt;Stretton 2004: 270-274 (both responses); McMahan 2002: 217 (spectrum argument only)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there is a continuum not only of developed but of ''natural'' capacities, and so the "natural capacities" view will inevitably face these problems as well.

Some critics reject the "natural capacities" view on the basis that it takes mere species membership or genetic potential as a basis for respect (in essence a charge of [[speciesism]]),&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 2002: 209-217; Stretton 2004: 275-276&lt;/ref&gt; or because it entails that [[anencephalic]] infants and the [[persistent vegetative state|irreversibly comatose]] have a full right to life.&lt;ref&gt;Stretton 2004: 276 (both points); Boonin 2003: 55 (irreversibly comatose only)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as with Marquis's argument (see below), some theories of [[personal identity]] would support the view that the embryo will never ''itself'' develop complex mental qualities (rather, it will simply give rise to a distinct substance or entity that ''will'' have these qualities), in which case the "natural capacities" argument would fail. Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz 1990: 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prolifeadvocate.us/persnbw2.html |title=Christian Research Journal, Summer 1991, page 28 - When Does a Human Become a Person?|accessdate=2010-02-18 |last=Beckwith |first=Francis J. |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarville.edu/centerforbioethics/resources/articles/conception.pdf |format=PDF|title=Ethics &amp; Medicine, volume 19:1 - The conception view of personhood: a review |accessdate=2010-02-18 |last=Sullivan|first=Dennis M|year=2003}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The deprivation argument===

A seminal essay by [[Don Marquis (philosopher)|Don Marquis]] argues that abortion is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989.  For a similar argument (published earlier), see Stone 1987 and 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim.  The harm consists in the fact that "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future":&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 190&lt;/ref&gt; I am deprived of all the valuable "experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments" that I would otherwise have had.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 189&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a being has a highly valuable future ahead of it—a "future like ours"—then killing that being would be seriously harmful and hence seriously wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 190.  The type of wrongness appealed to here is presumptive or ''prima facie'' wrongness: as noted below, it may be overridden in exceptional circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; But then, as a standard embryo ''does'' have a highly valuable future, killing it ''is'' seriously wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 192&lt;/ref&gt; And so "the overwhelming majority of deliberate abortions are seriously immoral", "in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being".&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 183.  Although Marquis views the killing of an embryo or normal human adult as seriously wrong, he avoids any reference to "[[rights]]" or the "right to life", and so is apparently not committed to [[deontological ethics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of this argument is that abortion is wrong in all the cases where killing a child or adult with the same sort of future as the embryo would be wrong.  So for example, ''if'' involuntary [[euthanasia]] of patients with a future filled with intense physical pain is morally acceptable, aborting embryos whose future is filled with intense physical pain will also be morally acceptable.  But it would not do, for example, to invoke the fact that some embryo's future would involve such things as being raised by an unloving family, since we do not take it to be acceptable to kill a five-year-old just because her future involves being raised by an unloving family.  Similarly, killing a child or adult may be permissible in exceptional circumstances such as self-defense or (perhaps) [[capital punishment]]; but these are irrelevant to standard abortions.

Marquis's argument has prompted several objections.  The contraception objection claims that if Marquis's argument is correct, then, since sperm and ova (or perhaps a sperm and ovum jointly) have a future like ours, [[contraception]] would be as wrong as murder; but as this conclusion is (it is said) absurd—even those who believe contraception is wrong do not believe it is as wrong as murder—the argument must be unsound.  One response&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1987: 816-817; cf Marquis 1989: 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; is that neither the sperm, nor the egg, nor any particular sperm-egg combination, will ever ''itself'' live out a valuable future: what will later have valuable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments is a ''new entity'', a ''new organism'', that will come into existence at or near conception; and it is ''this'' entity, not the sperm or egg or any sperm-egg combination, that has a future like ours.

As this response makes clear, Marquis's argument requires that what will later have valuable experiences and activities is the ''same entity'', the same biological organism, as the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;This view, known as 'Animalism' (since it takes you and I to be essentially animals rather than Lockean persons or embodied minds or souls), is defended in Olson 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The identity objection rejects this assumption.  On certain theories of personal identity (generally motivated by [[thought experiment]]s involving [[brain]] or [[cerebrum]] transplants), each of us is ''not'' a biological organism but rather an ''embodied mind'' or a ''person'' (in 
[[Consciousness#Consciousness as the basis of personal identity|John Locke]]'s sense) that comes into existence when the brain gives rise to certain developed psychological capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Supporters of the embodied mind view include Tooley 1984: 218-219 (using the term "subject of consciousness"); McMahan 2002: ch 1; and Hasker 1999: ch 7.  Supporters of the personhood view include Warren 1978: 18; McInerney 1990 (though there is some ambiguity); Doepke 1996: ch 9; and Baker 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; If either of these views is correct, Marquis's argument will fail; for the embryo (even the early ''fetus'', lacking the relevant psychological capacities) would not ''itself'' have a future of value, but would merely have the potential to give rise to a ''different'' entity, an embodied mind or a person, that ''would'' have a future of value.  The success of Marquis's argument thus depends on one's favored account of personal identity.

The interests objection claims that what makes murder wrong is not just the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis 1989: 198&lt;/ref&gt; If the opponent responds that one can ''have'' an interest in one's future without ''taking'' an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Stone 1994: 282 n 4&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does ''in fact'' desire to preserve it),&lt;ref&gt;Boonin 2003: 70-85&lt;/ref&gt; then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.

The equality objection claims that Marquis's argument leads to unacceptable inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Paske 1998: 365; Stretton 2004: 250-260; see also McMahan 2002: 234-235 and 271&lt;/ref&gt; If, as Marquis claims, killing is wrong because it deprives the victim of a valuable future, then, since some futures appear to contain much more value than others—a 9-year-old has a much longer future than a 90-year-old, a [[middle class]] person's future has much less gratuitous pain and suffering than someone in extreme [[poverty]]—some killings would turn out to be much more ''wrong'' than others.  But as this is strongly counterintuitive (most people believe all killings are ''equally'' wrong, other things being equal), Marquis's argument must be mistaken.  Some writers have concluded that the wrongness of killing arises not from the harm it causes the victim (since this varies greatly among killings), but from the killing's violation of the intrinsic worth or personhood of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;For example, McMahan 2002: 240-265&lt;/ref&gt; However, such accounts may themselves face problems of equality,&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 2002: 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and so the equality objection may not be decisive against Marquis's argument.

The psychological connectedness objection claims that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections—sufficient correlations or continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like—between the being as it is now and the being as it will be when it lives out the valuable future.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney 1990; McMahan 2002: 271; Stretton 2004: 171-179&lt;/ref&gt; As there are few psychological connections between the embryo and its later self, it is concluded that depriving it of its future does not seriously harm it (and hence is not seriously wrong).  A defence of this objection is likely to rest, as with certain views of [[personal identity]], on thought experiments involving [[brain]] or [[cerebrum]] swaps; and this may render it implausible to some readers.

===The bodily rights argument===
{{See also|Artificial womb}}
In her well-known article "[[A Defense of Abortion]]", [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] argues that abortion is in some circumstances permissible ''even if'' the embryo is a person and has a right to life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions.  Her central argument involves a [[thought experiment]].  Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist.  He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own.  If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected.  Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him.  The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something&amp;mdash;the use of your body&amp;mdash;to which he has no right.  Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances.  However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.&lt;ref&gt;"All the same, I agree that the desire for the child's death is not one which anybody may gratify, should it turn out to be possible to detach the child alive." in Thomson's ''A Defense of Abortion''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this argument generally agree that unplugging the violinist is permissible, but claim there are morally relevant disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion. The most common objection is that the violinist scenario, involving a [[kidnap]]ping, is analogous only to abortion after [[rape]].  In most cases of abortion, it is said, the pregnant woman was ''not'' raped but had intercourse voluntarily, and thus has either tacitly consented to allowing the embryo to use her body (the '''tacit consent''' objection&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Warren 1973; Steinbock 1992&lt;/ref&gt;), or else has a duty to sustain the embryo because the woman herself caused it to stand in need of her body (the '''responsibility''' objection&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002&lt;/ref&gt;). Other common objections turn on the claim that the embryo is the pregnant woman's child whereas the violinist is a stranger (the '''stranger versus offspring''' objection&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;e.g. Schwarz 1990; Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002&lt;/ref&gt;); that abortion kills the embryo whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die (the '''killing versus [[letting die]]''' objection&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;); or, similarly, that abortion intentionally causes the embryo's death whereas unplugging the violinist merely causes death as a foreseen but unintended side-effect (the '''intending versus foreseeing''' objection;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Finnis 1973; Schwarz 1990; Lee 1996; Lee and George 2005&lt;/ref&gt; cf the [[doctrine of double effect]]).

Defenders of Thomson's argument&amp;mdash;most notably David Boonin&lt;ref&gt;Boonin 2003: ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;reply that the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not hold, either because the factors that critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but do not apply to abortion in the way that critics have claimed.  Critics have in turn responded to Boonin's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Beckwith 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. [[John Noonan]] proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect them from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.&lt;ref&gt;"The Morality of abortion: legal and historical perspectives" John T. Noonan, Harvard University Press, 1970 {{ISBN|0-674-58725-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed.  But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were.  The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between gestation and childbirth on the one hand, and using your body as a kidney dialysis machine on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equipresources.org/atf/cf/%7B9C4EE03A-F988-4091-84BD-F8E70A3B0215%7D/JAA025.pdf |format=PDF|title=Christian Research Journal, volume 30, number 4 - Suffer the violinist: Why the pro-abortion argument from bodily autonomy fails |accessdate=2009-10-25 |last=Poupard|first=Dr Richard J|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Koukl &amp; S Klusendorf, "Making Abortion Unthinkable: The Art of Pro-Life Persuasion" STR Press, California (2001) p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Nathanson &amp; Richard Ostling "Aborting America".

===Respect for human life===
{{See also|Virtue ethics}}
One argument against the right to abortion appeals to the (secular) value of a human life. The thought is that all forms of human life, including the fetus, are inherently valuable because they are connected to our thoughts on family and parenthood, among other natural aspects of humanity. Thus, abortion can express the wrong attitudes towards humanity in a way that manifest vicious character. This view is represented by some forms of [[Humanism]] and by moral philosopher [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in her widely anthologized article "Virtue Theory and Abortion".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=1991|title=Virtue Theory and Abortion|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|volume=20|issue=3|pages=223–246|jstor=2265432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking about abortion in this way, according to Hursthouse, shows the unimportance of rights because one can act viciously in exercising a moral right. For example, she says, "Love and friendship do not survive their parties' constantly insisting on their rights, nor do people live well when they think that getting what they have a right to is of preeminent importance; they harm others, and they harm themselves."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hursthouse argues that the ending of a human life is always a serious matter and that abortion, when it is wrong, is wrong because it violates a respect for human life.

The '''Professorship of Divinity and Biblical Criticism''' at the [[University of Glasgow]] was founded in 1861. The patron was formerly the Crown (i.e. a [[Regius Professorship]]).  Since 1935, the [[University Court]], acting on the recommendation of a Board of Nomination consisting of representatives of the University Court and of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], appoints the Professor.

==Biography==
Shodo Harada was born into a [[Zen]] temple in 1940 in [[Nara, Japan]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweeping"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shodo Harada Roshi|url=http://sweepingzen.com/shodo-harada-bio/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still in high school he encountered his teacher, [[Mumon Yamada]], while running an errand for his father to [[Myōshin-ji]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He was impressed by how little he knew of Buddhism at this encounter.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; After college he entered Shofukuji and began his training in 1962 under [[Rinzai]] master and [[Japanese calligraphy|Japanese calligrapher]] Mumon Yamada,&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; from whom he received [[Dharma transmission]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweeping"/&gt;

In 1982 he was sent by Mumon to Sogen-ji to help an elderly abbot tend to the building and training schedules. In September 1989, Harada came to the [[United States]] to provide instruction for students and in 1995 founded One Drop Zendo (or, Tahoma One Drop Zen Monastery) on [[Whidbey Island]] in [[Island County, Washington]], where the practice mirrors the practices found at Sogen-ji. Nearby the Tahoma One Drop Monastery, Harada has opened a [[hospice]] known as Enso House in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Senauke| first =Hozan Alan| authorlink =Hozan Alan Senauke| title =

'''Social threefolding''' is a [[sociological]] theory suggesting the progressive independence of society's [[economic]], [[political]] and [[cultural]] institutions. It aims to foster [[human rights]] and equality in political life, [[freedom]] in cultural life (art, science, religion, education, the media), and associative [[cooperation]] in economic life. The idea was first proposed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in the great cultural ferment immediately following the end of the [[First World War]].

The process of achieving the cooperative independence of these three societal realms is meant to be achieved through a gradual transformation of existing societal structures.&lt;ref&gt;"Where the old conditions still exist, these can be taken as the basis from which to work towards the new separation of functions. Where the old order has already melted away or is in process of dissolution, individuals and small groups of people must find the initiative to start reconstructing along the new lines of growth. To try in twenty-four hours to bring about a transformation in public life is recognized by thoughtful socialists themselves as midsummer madness. They look to gradual, opportune changes to bring about what they regard as social welfare." [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA023/English/AP1972/GA023_c02.html Threefold Social Order], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed that the three social spheres had very gradually, over thousands of years, been growing independent of each other, and would naturally tend to continue to do so, and that consciously furthering aspects of this independence thus works in accordance with society's natural evolution. 

Steiner held it to be socially destructive when one of the three spheres attempts to dominate the others; for example, theocracy means a cultural impulse dominates economy and politics; unregulated and socially irresponsible varieties of capitalism allow economic interests to dominate politics, culture and media; and state socialism means political agendas dominate culture and economic life.  A more specific example: [[Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter]] suggests governments frequently fail when they begin to give "discretionary, particularly preferential privileges to competitive industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salter|first=Arthur|title=Recovery|year=1933|publisher=G. Bell|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for this independence to arise in such a way that those three realms can provide mutual balance. 

Many concrete reform proposals to advance a "threefold social order" at various scales have been advanced since 1919.  Some intentionally cooperative businesses and organizations, mostly in Europe, have attempted to realize a balance between the three spheres, within local structures.  [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] deserve special mention in this regard.&lt;ref name=Tummer&gt;Lía Tummer, ''Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy for Beginners'', Writers and Readers Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86316-286-X}}, pp. 123-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Another application has been the creation of various socially responsible banks and foundations. [[Bernard Lievegoed]] incorporated significant aspects of social threefolding in his work on [[organizational development]]. 

==Historical origins==
[[File:Vortragsplakat.jpg|thumb|Threefolding poster. June 30, 1919]]
Prior to the end of [[World War I]], Steiner spoke increasingly often of the dangerous tensions inherent in the contemporary societal structures and political entanglements.&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 117-120. (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested a collapse of traditional social forms was imminent, and every aspect of society would soon have to be built up consciously rather than relying on the inheritance of past traditions and institutions. After the war, he saw a unique opportunity to establish a healthy social and political constitution and began lecturing throughout post-war [[Germany]], often to large audiences, about his social ideas. These were taken up by a number of prominent cultural and political leaders of the time, but did not succeed in affecting the reconstitution of Germany taking place at the time.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;

After the failure of this political initiative, Steiner ceased lecturing on the subject.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; The impulse continued to be active in other ways, however, in particular through economic initiatives intended to provide support for non-governmental cultural organizations. Banks, such as; 
*The [[GLS bank|GLS Gemeinschaftsbank]] (Community Bank) in [[Bochum]], Germany
*[[Triodos Bank]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]
*The ''[[Rudolf Steiner Foundation]]'' in the United States

All were later founded to provide loans (and sometimes grants) to socially relevant and ethically responsible initiatives. Steiner himself saw the continuation of this impulse in the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], the first of which also opened in 1919.&lt;ref name=Tummer/&gt;  The Rudolf Steiner Foundation has also played a role in support of B-Lab, the non-profit corporation that has sought to midwife "benefit corporations" and legislation permitting such corporations to be set up.  Benefit corporation officers are legally permitted and required to consider not only shareholder value and profit, but a range of "socially responsible" criteria for corporate decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;According to Bart Houlahan, co-founder of B Lab, which has been central to the national drive for legislation permitting the creation of B-corporations, "RSF has been a pioneer in B Lab’s work from day one." See http://rsfsocialfinance.org/2012/09/b-lab-movement/ See also https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/03/16/corporate-responsibility-nonprofit-b-lab-shows-strong-growth/ And see http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three realms of society==

Steiner distinguished three realms of society:
* the [[economy]];
* [[politics]], law, and [[human rights]]; and
* [[culture|cultural institutions]], including science, education, arts, religion, and media.

Steiner suggested the three would only become mutually corrective and function together in a healthy way when each was granted sufficient independence.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner Press, 4th edition, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Preparata&gt;Preparata, Guido Giacomo (Fall 2006). Perishable money in a threefold commonwealth: Rudolf Steiner and the social economics of an anarchist Utopia. ''Review of Radical Political Economics'', '''38'''(4):619-648. [http://rrp.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/38/4/619 Reprint copy]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner argued that increased autonomy for the three spheres would not eliminate their mutual influence, but would cause that influence to be exerted in a more healthy and legitimate manner, because the increased separation would prevent any one of the three spheres from dominating the others, as they had frequently done in the past. Among the various kinds of macrosocial imbalance Steiner observed, there were three major types: 

* Theocracy, in which the cultural sphere (in the form of a religious impulse) dominates the economic and political spheres.
* State Communism and state socialism, in which the state (political sphere) dominates the economic and cultural spheres.
* Traditional forms of capitalism, in which the economic sphere dominates the cultural and political spheres.

Steiner related the [[French Revolution]]'s slogan, [[Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]], to the three social spheres as follows:&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;&lt;ref name=Preparata/&gt;
*''Liberty'' in cultural life (education, science, art, religion, and the press),
*''Equality'' of rights, democracy, in political life, and
*''Cooperation'' in a decentralized, freely contractual, economic life outside the state and operating within the legal and regulatory boundaries, including labor laws, set by the democratic state. Economic "cooperation," for Steiner, did not mean state socialism, but cooperative types of capitalism, such as are sometimes referred to today as stakeholder capitalism.

According to Steiner, those three values, each one applied to its proper social realm, would tend to keep the cultural, economic and political realms from merging unjustly, and allow these realms and their respective values to check, balance and correct one another. The result would be a society-wide separation of powers. 

===Separation between the state and cultural life===

''Examples:'' 
A [[government]] should not be able to control culture; i.e., how people think, learn, or worship. A particular [[religion]] or [[ideology]] should not control the levers of the State. Steiner held that [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] were the ideal for [[education]] and cultural life.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;  Concerning children, Steiner held that all families, not just those with economic means, should be enabled to choose among a wide variety of independent, non-government schools from kindergarten through high school.&lt;ref name="From many possible" /&gt;

===Separation between the economy and cultural life===
''Examples:'' 
The fact that places of worship do not make the ability to enter and participate depend on the ability to pay, and that libraries and some museums are open to all free of charge, is in tune with Steiner’s notion of a separation between cultural and economic life. Efforts to protect scientific research results from commercial manipulation are also in tune with the idea. In a similar spirit, Steiner held that all families, not just those with the economic means, should have freedom of choice in education and access to independent, non-government schools for their children.&lt;ref name="From many possible"&gt;A few of many possible examples from Steiner's work''':''' ''"...there is no reason why the free spirit in man should defer to any stereotyped pattern in the interest of the state; it'' [the free spirit] ''is not to be limited by the condition that only those shall receive education who can command economic resources,''" -- from Lecture V of Steiner's, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/SocialIssues/SocialFuture/19191029p01.html ''The Social Future''].  In the same lecture, he says, "''everything relating to the spiritual and intellectual department of life should be detached from the political or equity state, and the spiritual organization should be independently administered in freedom.''" In his main work on social questions, ''Toward Social Renewal'', Steiner repeatedly says society needs ''freedom'' for all the activities in the cultural sphere -- education, science, art, religion -- they must be independent of state and economic power.  He argues that education, like other cultural activities, should no longer be administered by or under the authority of the State, and should be based on pedagogical freedom for teachers, as well as for the families who will choose freely among teachers and schools.  With regard to independence from economic power, he writes, for example on page 92 of his main sociological work, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA023/English/SCR2001/GA023_index.html ''Toward Social Renewal: Basic Issues of the Social Question''], that all "''children shall have the right to receive an education,''" i.e., not just those children whose parents happen to have sufficient economic power to afford decent schooling. In the same book, on pages 3-4, he writes that "''education, from which all spiritual and cultural life emerges and develops, must be administered by the educators, without any interference from political or economic quarters''." ''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolph Steiner Press; 4th edition (April 2000), {{ISBN|1-85584-072-3}}; {{ISBN|978-1-85584-072-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation between the state and the economy===

''Examples:'' 
People and businesses should be prevented from buying politicians and laws. A politician shouldn’t be able to parlay his political position into riches earned by doing favors for businessmen. Slavery is unjust, because it takes something political, a person’s inalienable rights, and absorbs them into the economic process of buying and selling. Steiner said, "In the old days, there were slaves. The entire man was sold as commodity... Today, capitalism is the power through which still a remnant of the human being—his labor power—is stamped with the character of a commodity."&lt;ref name=Preparata/&gt; Yet Steiner held that the solution that state socialism gives to this problem only makes it worse.

===Cooperative economic life===

Steiner advocated [[cooperative]] forms of capitalism, or what might today be called [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] capitalism, because he thought that conventional [[shareholder]] [[capitalism]] ''and'' [[state socialism]], though in different ways, tend to absorb the State and human rights into the economic process and transform laws into mere commodities.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner rejected state socialism because of that, but also because he believed it reduces the vitality of the economic process.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet Steiner disagrees with the kind of [[libertarian]] view that holds that the State and the economy are kept apart when there is absolute economic competition. According to Steiner's view, under absolute competition, the most dominant economic forces tend to corrupt and take over the State,&lt;ref name="Toward Social Renewal 1999, page 88"&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; in that respect merging State and economy. Second, the State tends to fight back counter-productively under such circumstances by increasingly taking over the economy and merging with it, in a mostly doomed attempt to ameliorate the sense of injustice that emerges when special economic interests take over the State.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Steiner held that uncoerced, freely self-organizing&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; forms of ''cooperative'' economic life, in a society where there is freedom of speech, of culture, and of religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; will 1) make State intervention in the economy less necessary or called for,&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2) will tend to permit economic interests of a broader, more public-spirited sort to play a greater role in relations extending from the economy to the State.  Those two changes would keep State and economy apart more than could absolute economic competition in which economic special interests corrupt the State and make it too often resemble a mere appendage of the economy.&lt;ref name="Toward Social Renewal 1999, page 88"/&gt; In Steiner's view, the latter corruption leads in turn to a pendulum swing in the opposite direction''':''' government forces, sometimes with the best of intentions, seek to turn the economy increasingly into a mere appendage of the State. State and economy thus merge through an endless iteration of pendulum swings from one to the other, increasingly becoming corrupt appendages of each other.

Steiner held that State and economy, given increased separateness through a self-organizing and voluntarily more cooperative economic life, can increasingly check, balance, and correct each other for the sake of continual human progress. In Steiner’s view, the place of the State, vis-a-vis the self-organizing, cooperative economy, is ''not'' to own the economy or run it, but to regulate/deregulate it, enforce laws, and protect human rights as determined by the state's open [[democratic process]].&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner emphasized that none of these proposals would be successful unless the cultural sphere of society maintained and increased its own freedom and autonomy vis-a-vis economic and State power.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward Social Renewal'', Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press, 1999, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing would work without spiritual, cultural, and educational freedom.

==Economic support for culture==

A central idea in social threefolding is that the economic sphere should donate funds to support cultural and educational institutions that are independent of the State. As businesses become profitable through the exercise of creativity and inspiration, and a society's culture is a key source of its creativity and inspiration, returning a portion of the profits made by business to independent cultural initiatives can act as a kind of seed money to stimulate further creative growth. 

In this view, taxes ''sometimes'' serve as an unhealthy form of forced donation which artificially redirect businesses' profits. Since taxes are controlled by the state, cultural initiatives supported by taxes readily fall under government control, rather than retaining their independence.&lt;ref name=Brull&gt;Drs. A. H. Bos; Dr. D. Brüll; Mr A.C. Henny, ''Maatschappijstructuren in beweging'', Vrij Geestesleven, 1973, {{ISBN|90-6038-042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed in educational freedom and choice, and one of his ideals was that the economic sector might eventually create scholarship funds that would permit all families to choose freely from (and set up) a wide variety of independent, non-government schools for their children.

==Education's relation to the state and the economy==
For Steiner, separation of the cultural sphere from the political and economic spheres meant education should be available to all children regardless of the ability of families to pay for it and, from kindergarten through high school, should be provided for by private and|or state scholarships that a family could direct to the school of its choice. Steiner was a supporter of educational freedom, but was flexible, and understood that a few legal restrictions on schools (such as health and safety laws), provided they were kept to an absolute minimum, would be necessary and justified.

==Civil society==
Institutions of [[civil society]]—non-profits that for the most part are independent of both the State and the economic life—[https://web.archive.org/web/20150123224523/https://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/21246-civil-society-chinese-stylethe-rise-of-the-nonprofit-sector-in-post-mao-chinaby.html#.URM-8KVEEZk are globally on the rise]. See also [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/50105/lester-m-salamon/the-rise-of-the-nonprofit-sector this]. And [https://web.archive.org/web/20130521234304/http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/news/civil-society/new-almanac-chronicles-decades-growth-voluntary-sector-workforce this]. There has been a debate among students of Steiner's sociology whether this means the cultural realm as Steiner understood it is developing greater independence from governmental and economic institutions. Nicanor Perlas has [https://www.amazon.com/Shaping-Globalization-Society-Cultural-Threefolding/dp/9719223308 argued in the affirmative].  [https://web.archive.org/web/20121111182343/http://socialrenewal.com/about_us.php Gary Lamb] has argued otherwise.

==Politicians working out of a threefold social vision==
[[Nicanor Perlas]], winner of the [[Right Livelihood Award]], in 2009 announced [https://web.archive.org/web/20100727070306/http://thepoc.net/blogwatch-features/3404-get-to-know-nicanor-perlas.html candidacy for the presidency of the Philippines]. Perlas has written extensively about social threefolding.&lt;ref name="Mason 2009 p. 21"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Andy | title=The Barefoot guide to working with organisations and social change | publisher=Barefoot Collective | location=South Africa | year=2009 | isbn=9780620432405 | page=21 |oclc=915122389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hMDwOzFtwC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reform movements whose leaders and members may never have heard of social threefolding still unintentionally advance one or another of its three aspects, for example movements seeking to 1) reduce the influence of money in politics by increasing governmental transparency, 2) develop cooperative and socially responsible forms of capitalism (for example, [https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps here:]), and 3) make it possible for all families, including poor ones, to have educational freedom and the right to choose among independent, non-government schools for their children (for example, [https://www.edchoice.org/ here]).

[[File:Dr S Z Hasan --.jpg|right|thumb|Syed Zafarul Hasan]]

'''Syed Zafarul Hasan''' (14 February 1885 – 19 June 1949) was a prominent twentieth-century [[Muslim]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==

He was the eldest son of Khan Sahib Syed Diwan Mohammad.

Hasan was educated at Allahabad (M.A., LL. B.) and obtained doctorates from the universities of [[Erlangen]] and [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], and [[Oxford University]]. Dr Zafarul Hasan was the first Muslim Scholar of the Indian sub-continent to secure a PhD from Oxford in Philosophy. His doctoral thesis ''Realism'' is a classic on the subject. Prominent philosophers and educationists lauded his work, among them, his teacher Prof. John Alaxander Smith (1863–1930), and Allama Mohammad Iqbal.

He started teaching at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Aligarh, India in 1911. In 1913, he became professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Islamia College University|Islamia College]], Peshawar. From 1924 to 1945 he was professor of philosophy at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Aligarh  - where he  also served as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy and Dean of the Faculty of Arts. There, in 1939, he put forward the 'Aligarh Scheme' along with Dr Afzaal Hussain Qadri. They published a scheme ("The Problem of Indian Muslims") proposing three independent States.

From 1945 until the partition of the sub-continent, Dr Hasan was [[Emeritus]] Professor at [[Aligarh]]. In August 1947, he migrated to [[Lahore, Pakistan]]. He started work on a book that he could not complete due to his death in 1949. Only one volume ("PHILOSOPHY - A Critique") was ready, which was published from Lahore by Institute of Islamic Culture in 1988.

He received honours and served on a number of bodies: Member of Court, Member of Executive Council, Finance Co., Com. of Advanced Studies, Aligarh Muslim Univ.; Dir., Jamiat-ut-Tamaddunil-Islami, Bombay; Member, International Academy of Philosophy, Erlangen. Pres., Islami Jamaat, Aligarh. Member: Education Committee, All-India Muslim League; Kant Gesellscaft (Germany); Mind Assn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1463">'''Takiyettin Mengusoglu''' (1905–1984) was a Turkish philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;http://felsefe.istanbul.edu.tr/node/52&lt;/ref&gt;

Mengusoglu was born in Malatya province of Turkey. After finishing the high school he went to Germany and became a student of [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. He was known as Takiyettin Temuralp at that time and published '''Über die grenzen der erkennbarkeit bei Husserl und Scheler''' in German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.husserl.net/books/title.php?opt=3&amp;source=793]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of the university textbook '''Felsefeye Giris (Introduction to Philosophy)'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remzi.com.tr/index.asp?anakategori=59&amp;kategori=149&amp;kitapid=933&lt;/ref&gt;

Mengüşoğlu founded a new school of [[anthropology]] which he called ontological anthropology. This anthropology deals with man not through any conceptualization but through "his concrete biopsyhichic wholeness".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edebiyatdergisi.hacettepe.edu.tr/2000172SevgiIyi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iyi, Sevgi, "Yüzyılımızda İki Antropoloji Anlayışı, [[Heidegger]] ve Mengüşoğlu", ''Hacettepe Üniversitesi Edebiyat Fakültesi Dergisi'', 17(2):1&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this new anthropology would be more suitable approaching man and solving concrete problems in the human world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Textual scholarship''' (or '''textual studies''') is an [[umbrella term]] for disciplines that deal with describing, transcribing, editing or annotating [[text (literary theory)|text]]s and physical [[document]]s. 

==Overview==
Textual research is mainly historically oriented. Textual [[scholar]]s study, for instance, how writing practices and printing technology has developed, how a certain writer has written and revised his or her texts, how literary documents have been edited, the history of reading culture, as well as censorship and the authenticity of texts. The subjects, methods and theoretical backgrounds of textual research vary widely, but what they have in common is an interest in the genesis and derivation of texts and textual variation in these practices.

There are many ways to think if you are a textual scholar, some are interested in what the author is trying to intend or there are those who seek to see how the text is transmitted. Textual scholars produce their own editions of what they discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/|title=Textual Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplines of textual scholarship include, among others, [[textual criticism]], [[stemmatology]], [[paleography]], [[genetic editing|genetic criticism]] (critique génétique), [[bibliography]] and [[history of the book]]. Textual scholar [[David Greetham (textual scholar)|David Greetham]] has described textual scholarship as a term encompassing "the procedures of enumerative bibliographers, descriptive, analytical, and historical bibliographers, paleographers and codicologists, textual editors, and annotators-cumulatively and collectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-0058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some disciplines of textual scholarship focus on certain material sources or text genres, such as [[epigraphy]], [[codicology]] and [[diplomatics]]. 

The historical roots of textual scholarship date back to the 3rd century BCE, when the scholarly activities of copying, comparing, describing and archiving texts became professionalized in the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, David C.:  ''Textual Scholarship.

==History==
The Tej Gyan Foundation was founded in 1997 by Sirshree. The foundation was created to help people realise the true purpose of their life. This method of understanding was created by Sirshree, and is known as the "existential [[wisdom]] of the ultimate truth."

Since it was created, the foundation has been responsible for publishing a number of books about [[spirituality]]. These books have included the two most famous books, The Warrior’s Mirror and The Magic of Awakening.&lt;ref name="The Warriors Mirror"&gt;{{cite book |last= |author=Sirshree |editor-first= |editor-last= |title=The Warriors Mirror - Path to Peace |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2010 |pages= |chapter= |isbn=9780143415206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Magic of Awakening"&gt;{{cite book |last= |author=Sirshree |editor-first= |editor-last= |title=The Magic of Awakening - 111 Answers on Life and Living |publisher=Penguin Books |date=20111 |pages= |chapter= |isbn=9780143067177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two books were published by [[Penguin India]] in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

The foundation has also created a number of events and seminars based on Sirshree’s teachings. This includes the seminar Fearless Child, the program focuses on cultivating the fearlessness.

'''Sir William David Ross''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|KBE|FBA|size=100%}} (15 April 1877&amp;nbsp;– 5 May 1971), known as '''David Ross''' but usually cited as '''W. D. Ross''', was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his work in ethics. His best-known work is ''The Right and the Good'' (1930), and he is perhaps best known for developing a [[ethical pluralism|pluralist]], [[deontology|deontological]] form of [[Ethical intuitionism|intuitionist]] ethics in response to [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]]'s intuitionism. Ross also [[s:Author:William David Ross|critically edited and translated a number of Aristotle's works]], in addition to writing on Greek philosophy.

His accomplishments include his work with [[John Alexander Smith]] on a 12-volume translation of [[Aristotle]].

==Life==
William David Ross was born in [[Thurso]], Caithness in the north of [[Scotland]] the son of John Ross (1835-1905).&lt;ref&gt;Grave of John Ross, Grange Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of his first six years as a child in southern [[India]]. He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1895, he gained a first class [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in [[classics]]. He completed his studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], with a First in Classical Moderations in 1898 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Calendar 1905'', Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1905, pp. 137, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to a lectureship at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] in 1900, and elected to a fellowship in 1902.

Ross joined the army in 1915. During [[World War I]], he worked in the [[Ministry of Munitions]] and was a major on the special list. He was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1918 in recognition of his services during the war, and was promoted to a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]  in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Ken. [http://www.manitowoc.uwc.edu/staff/awhite/ken95.htm Sir David Ross's pluralistic theory of duty (the beginnings)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051017102909/http://www.manitowoc.uwc.edu/staff/awhite/ken95.htm |date=17 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross was [[White's Professor of Moral Philosophy]] (1923–1928), [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Oriel College, Oxford]] (1929–1947), [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1941 to 1944 and [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] (1944–1947). He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1939 to 1940. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and was its President 1940–1944.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the British Academy Volume LVII&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the many governmental committees on which he served was as chair of the Civil Service Tribunal, on which one of his two colleagues was [[Leonard Woolf]], who thought that the whole system of fixing governmental remuneration should be done on the same basis as the US model (of dividing the civil service into a relatively small number of pay grades).&lt;ref&gt;The Journey not the Arrival Matters by Leonard Woolf, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross did not agree with this radical proposal. In 1947 he was appointed chairman of the first [[Royal Commission on the Press, United Kingdom]].
[[File:The Ross family grave, Grange Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The Ross family grave, Grange Cemetery]]

He died in Oxford on 5 May 1971. He is memorialised on his parents grave in the [[Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].

==Family==
His younger brother was Rev Donald George Ross (1879-1943).

He married Edith Ogden in 1906 and they had four daughters, Margaret (who married [[Robin Harrison]]), Eleanor, Rosalind (who married [[John Miller Martin]]), and Katharine. Edith died in 1953.

He was a cousin of [[Arthur Berriedale Keith|Berriedale Keith]].

==Ross's ethical theory==
W. D. Ross was a [[Moral realism|moral realist]], a non-naturalist, and an [[Ethical intuitionism|intuitionist]].&lt;ref&gt;Stratton-Lake, Philip. (2002). 'Introduction'. In Ross, W. D. 1930. ''The Right and the Good''. Reprinted 2002. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]: ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there are moral truths. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The moral order...is just as much part of the fundamental nature of the universe (and...of any possible universe in which there are moral agents at all) as is the spatial or numerical structure expressed in the axioms of geometry or arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, W. D. 1930. ''The Right and the Good''. Reprinted with an introduction by Philip Stratton-Lake. 2002. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, according to Ross, the claim that something is good is true if that thing really is good. Ross also agreed with [[G.E. Moore|G.E. Moore's]] claim that any attempt to define ethical statements solely in terms of statements about the natural world commits the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

Ross rejected Moore's [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethics. According to consequentialist theories, what people ought to do is determined only by whether their actions will bring about the most good. By contrast, Ross argues that maximising the good is only one of several ''prima facie'' duties (prima facie obligations) which play a role in determining what a person ought to do in any given case.

In ''The Right and the Good,'' Ross lists seven ''prima facie'' duties, without claiming his list to be all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; justice; beneficence; non-maleficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even contradict one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty to help people who helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the ''absolute obligation'' or ''absolute duty'', the action that the person ought to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=William David|title=The Right and the Good|date=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|page=21|edition=1946 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently argued, however, that Ross should have used the term "pro tanto" rather than "prima facie". [[Shelly Kagan]], for example, wrote:

{{quote|It may be helpful to note explicitly that in distinguishing between pro tanto and prima facie reasons I depart from the unfortunate terminology proposed by Ross, which has invited confusion and misunderstanding. I take it that&amp;nbsp;– despite his misleading label&amp;nbsp;– it is actually pro tanto reasons that Ross has in mind in his discussion of what he calls prima facie duties.&lt;ref name="Kagan-p17"&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'', (Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]], 1989) p.&amp;nbsp;17n.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Explaining the difference between pro tanto and prima facie, Kagan wrote: "A pro tanto reason has genuine weight, but nonetheless may be outweighed by other considerations. Thus, calling a reason a pro tanto reason is to be distinguished from calling it a prima facie reason, which I take to involve an epistemological qualification: a prima facie reason appears to be a reason, but may actually not be a reason at all".&lt;ref name="Kagan-p17" /&gt;

'''''Xinxin Ming''''' (alternate spellings '''''Xin Xin Ming''''' or '''''Xinxinming''''') ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 信心銘; [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn]]: ''Xìnxīn Míng''; Wade–Giles: ''Hsin Hsin Ming''; Japanese: ''Shinjinmei'' or ''Shinjin no Mei''), ''Faith in mind'', is a poem attributed to the Third Chinese Chán ([[Zen]]) Patriarch Jianzhi [[Sengcan]] 鑑智僧璨 (Hànyǔ Pīnyīn: Jiànzhì Sēngcàn; Wade–Giles: Chien-chih Seng-ts'an; Japanese: Kanchi Sōsan, died 606) and one of the earliest Chinese Chan expressions of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] mind training practice.

== Title translation ==
"Xinxin" has commonly been interpreted as "faith" or "trust."  For example, one translation is "Faith in Mind" (See ''The Poetry of Enlightenment: Poems by Ancient Ch'an Masters'', Ch'an Master Sheng-Yen).  While this interpretation may appear to some to be a departure from the traditional view of seeking refuge in the [[Three Jewels]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma]] and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]), it is actually a deliberate declaration and poetic polemic of the Chan ([[Zen]]) school written as a response to the increasingly popular movement of faith in Amitaba Buddha known as [[Pure Land Buddhism]].  From the Chan/Zen point of view, Buddha and Mind are one (即心即佛) (see the [[Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch]] (六祖壇經)), as expressed in [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]]'s famous dictum "Mind is Buddha". Thus, faith in outward Buddhas is contrary to the goal of Buddhism, which is the direct experience of enlightenment. This can only be attained by having faith in Mind as Shakyamuni Buddha himself did. Variations of the title include: "Inscription on Trust in the Mind", "Verses on the Faith Mind", and "On Believing in Mind", as well as others. John McRae (1986:316 n. 64) argues that the title should be translated as "Inscription on Relying on the Mind" or "Inscription of the Perfected Mind". The word "inscription" does accurately convey the idea of a truth that can survive the test of time and is the more literal meaning of ''ming'' (銘).

Another reading of the text allows that Xinxin could be understood as the Truthful Mind, which is always ready and perfect, implying that there is no need to further "perfect" it. Because in the Chinese language today, Xinxin (信心) usually means "trust", "confidence", or "believing mind", it is often forgotten that Xinxin can also be understood as the truthful mind (信實的心).&lt;ref&gt;A translation of the Xinxin Ming based on this interpretation is available at: [http://www.ln.edu.hk/econ/staff/Xin%20Xin%20Ming.doc].  This is consistent with the traditional view of [[Buddha nature]] being there all the time. It just waits to be rediscovered.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Chan/Zen view, the true mind is perfect as it is and only false views obscure the true mind's inherent perfection. As the text states,

"Any degeneration of your previous practice on emptiness arises because of false perspectives.
There is really no need to go after the Truth but there is indeed a need to extinguish biased views." (前空轉變  皆由妄見  不用求真  唯須息見)

Moreover, the passage that follows immediately after explicitly warns against losing the original, true mind (失心):

"Do not dwell in the two biased views. Make sure you do not pursue. The moment you think about right and wrong, that moment you unwittingly lose your true mind." (二見不住  慎勿追尋 才有是非  紛然失心)

Whether translated as Faith in Mind, Believing in Mind, Trust in Mind, or The Truthful Mind, the central message of the Xinxin Ming is the same: to point directly to Mind by giving up one-sided views so we can see the One Suchness of reality as it is.(心若不異  萬法一如)

== Authorship ==
Although Sengcan has been traditionally been attributed as the author, modern scholars believe that the verse was written well after Sengcan's death, probably during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (Chinese: 唐朝; pinyin: Tángcháo) (618 – 907). (Dumoulin, p 97) Some scholars note the similarity with a poem called Mind Inscription&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Texts Henrik H. Sorensen [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mindins.htm translation] of "Mind Inscription", the  possible original source of Xinxin Ming&lt;/ref&gt; by Niu-t'ou Fa-jung (594-657) (Gozu Hõyû 牛頭法融) of the Ox-head School of Chan and have speculated that the Xinxin Ming is an abridged version of the Mind Inscription. The classical source of the Xinxin Ming can be found in the [[Transmission of the Lamp]] (Wade–Giles: Ching-te Ch'uan-teng Lu;  Japanese: Keitoku Denkōroku 景德傳燈錄  景徳伝灯録).&lt;ref&gt;for a fuller discussion on authorship see [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/fm/fm.htm Sacred Texts ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219231518/http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/fm/fm.htm |date=February 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books/about/Hsin_Hsin_Ming.html?id=57ANwnLKmc4C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Hsin-Hsin Ming: Verses on the Faith-Mind|last=Seng-t'san|first=|date=2001-04-01|publisher=White Pine Press|year=|isbn=9781893996144|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Xinxin Ming has been much beloved by Chan (Zen) practitioners for over a thousand years. It is still studied in Western Zen circles.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Soeng (2004), p. xiii: "The poem ... is one of the most beloved texts of the Zen tradition and one of the most familiar of the early Zen texts."&lt;/ref&gt;

As an early expression of Chan Buddhism, the ''Inscription on Faith in Mind'' reveals the Buddhist missionary use of expedient means ([[upaya]]) in China by adapting [[Tao]]ist terminology to the Buddhist context of awakening. It also draws on the [[Perfection of Wisdom|Wisdom sutras]] as well as the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]] and [[Lankavatara Sutra]] to express the essential unity of opposites and the basic nature of emptiness (''[[śūnyatā]]'') &lt;ref&gt;The early great proponent of the Buddhist analysis of emptiness was [[Nagarjuna]] (c.150-250 AD) (Chinese: 龍樹).&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem professes the need to take pleasant and unpleasant life experiences with a sense of equanimity.  Broadly speaking, the Xinxin Ming deals with the principles and practice of [[nondualism|non-duality]], that is, with the application of nonduality and the results of its practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Pajin (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excerpts ==

===Opening verse===

The opening verse, variously translated, sets out the fundamental principle:

: The best way [Great Way, the [[Tao]]] is not difficult
: It only excludes picking and choosing
: Once you stop loving and hating
: It will enlighten itself. 
: (trans. D. Pajin)

Alternatively:

: The Perfect Way knows no difficulties
: Except that it refuses to make preferences;
: Only when freed from hate and love,
: It reveals itself fully and without disguise 
: (trans. by [[D.T. Suzuki]])&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;Suzuki (1960), pp. 76-82; see also, Soeng (2004), pp. 133, 139, 145, 151, 157, 163, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last verse===
The poem ends with:

: Emptiness here, Emptiness there,
: but the infinite universe stands always before your eyes.
: Infinitely large and infinitely small;
: no difference, for definitions have vanished
: and no boundaries are seen.
: So too with Being
: and non-Being.
: Don't waste time in doubts and arguments
: that have nothing to do with this.
: One thing, all things:
: move among and intermingle, without distinction.
: To live in this realization
: is to be without anxiety about non-perfection.
: To live in this faith is the road to non-duality,
: Because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind.
: Words! The Way is beyond language,
: for in it there is
:: no yesterday
:: no tomorrow
:: no today. 
:[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202055942/http://home.att.net/~paul.dowling/archive/zen/hsin.htm (trans. Richard B. Clarke)]

Alternatively:

: One in All,
: All in One&amp;mdash;
: If only this is realized,
: No more worry about your not being perfect!

:Where Mind and each believing mind are not divided,
:And undivided are each believing mind and Mind,
:This is where words fail;
:For it is not of the past, present, and future.
