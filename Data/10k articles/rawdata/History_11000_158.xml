      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25205">The '''1980s professional wrestling boom''' (more commonly referred to as the '''Golden Age''') was a surge in the popularity of [[professional wrestling]] in the [[United States]] and elsewhere throughout the 1980s. The expansion of [[cable television]] and [[pay-per-view]], coupled with the efforts of [[Professional wrestling promotion|promoters]] such as [[Vince McMahon]], saw professional wrestling shift from a system controlled by numerous regional companies to one dominated by two nationwide companies: McMahon's [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). The decade also saw a considerable decline in the power of the NWA, a [[cartel]] which had until then domineered the wrestling landscape, and in the efforts to sustain belief in the [[verisimilitude]] of wrestling.

== History ==
In the early 1980s, professional wrestling in the U.S. consisted mainly of three competing organizations: the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), which ran a territorial system around the country.

=== National Wrestling Alliance ===
Multiple NWA territories were very successful in the 1970s and continued that success in the early 1980s. TBS became a cable television superstation based on broadcasting [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] with both [[Mr. Wrestling II]] and [[Tommy Rich]] being the top headliners in the territory. [[Ric Flair]] rose to prominence in Mid Atlantic Wrestling, while [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] was the fan favorite in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]. [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South Wrestling]] had the first significant African American champion [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] [[Junkyard Dog]].

=== American Wrestling Association ===
At the beginning of the 1980s, the AWA had the largest television business with distribution of their weekly broadcast in Chicago, Denver, Green Bay, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Omaha, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Winnipeg. The AWA expanded into the top ten media market of the Bay Area after Roy Shire ran his last battle royale (the annual Royal Rumble continues this idea) at the [[Cow Palace]] on January 24, 1981, demonstrating that the AWA was positioned to prosper as other promotions failed.

The AWA had the talent what would ultimately lead Vince McMahon Jr.'s WWE to pre-eminence in professional wrestling. [[Gene Okerlund]] and [[Bobby Heenan]] were AWAs major on air talent. [[Hulk Hogan]] became the top babyface after Verne Gagne retired from full-time wrestling in 1981 and Nick Bockwinkel became the AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Hogan faced Bockwinkel on April 18, 1982, and on April 24, 1983, with both being decided with "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dusty finish|Dusty finishes]]" where Hogan pinned Bockwinkel for a three count, but was then stripped of the title. Hogan said Gagne offered him the championship on the latter occasion in exchange for his merchandise rights and money from touring with other promotions which would show Gagne understood wrestling was becoming a bigger business in the 1980s; however, Hogan refused. Gagne's failure to keep his fortunate position is a significant factor in the history of professional wrestling.

=== World Class Championship Wrestling ===
In 1982, Continental Productions, a subsidiary of Dallas independent station KXTX began syndicating a one-hour show internationally from the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas, of former NWA affiliate [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] run by [[Fritz Von Erich]]. Channel 11 had broadcast Von Erich's professional wrestling television program as Saturday Night Wrestling for over a decade before Channel 39 began the second broadcast.

The channel 39 broadcast was innovative because it was more like professional sports with host [[Bill Mercer]], a former broadcaster for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], mobile cameras at ringside with multiple shotgun microphones as used by Don King to capture and enhance the sound of impacts and crowd noise for boxing pay per views, and vignettes and interviews inspired by the Rocky movies to accentuate the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] or babyface of a wrestler outside of the ring.

The show featured the babyface [[Von Erich family|Von Erich brothers]] [[David Von Erich|David]], [[Kerry Von Erich|Kerry]], and [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]] against heels from the stable of [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], who culminated nearly two decades of his career in Texas by booking the feud between the Freebirds and the Von Erichs in 1982, and then [[Skandor Akbar]]'s Devastation, Inc. stable in 1983.  The channel 39 syndicated show earned extremely high ratings - higher than ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and many wrestling promotions in the United States, including the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinder, Mack (June 13, 2006). "Heroes of World Class DVD a definite treasure". CANOE – SLAM! Sports. Retrieved April 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Von Erichs were the most recognizable babyfaces in professional wrestling throughout the United States in 1982 and 1983. The fall of the Von Erichs and death of nearly every wrestler associated with the promotion are attributed to abuse of drugs, primarily steroids, stimulants including cocaine, and pain killing opiates.

=== The World Wrestling Federation expands ===
[[File:Vince McMahon 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Vince McMahon]], owner of then World Wrestling Federation, changed professional wrestling fundamentally in the 1980s]]
In 1982, [[Vince McMahon]] purchased the business from his ailing father [[Vincent J. McMahon]]. On December 23, 1983, he signed AWA superstar Hulk Hogan to debut in 1984. To play Hogan's nemesis, he signed talents including World Championship Wrestling heel "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and AWA manager Bobby "The Brain" Heenan. McMahon stated in the documentary ''The UnReal Story of Professional Wrestling'' that he did not think his father would have ever sold him the company if he knew what he was planning to do. "He probably would have said, 'Vinny, what are you doing? You're gonna wind up at the bottom of a river'", he explained.

At the end of 1983, two major developments increased competition to be the premier professional wrestling promotion. On November 24, 1983, Ric Flair defeated [[Harley Race]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] at the closed circuit wrestling event [[Starrcade]], which inaugurated Flair's golden era and was credited with showing that a major event could earn significant income across many locations. On December 23, 1983, WWF signed Hogan to return after appearing in ''[[Rocky III]]'' in 1982 and developing a babyface gimmick in the AWA.

Fortune for the WWF came at the expense of WCCW and AWA. On January 23, 1984, Hogan defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Shortly after the match, the WWF began promoting wrestling shows with Hogan in the main event in parts of the United States outside the Northeast, which changed a long-standing non-aggression pact between the WWF and other wrestling promotions. On February 10, David Von Erich died in Tokyo, Japan. While there was a short term boost culminating in Kerry Von Erich's victory over Ric Flair for the NWA World title in front of a packed Texas Stadium crowd on May 6, WCCW rapidly lost momentum as the death of [[Gino Hernandez]] and the suicide of [[Mike Von Erich]] caused a cloud over the promotion that became its legacy. The AWA signed a TV contract with [[ESPN]], but the revenue was insignificant compared to the WWF's pay per view business, which was based on annual March/April events featuring Hogan in a landmark world championship match each year from 1986 to 1991.&lt;!--- WM1 WAS NOT PPV AND HOGAN WAS IN A TAG MATCH, NOT A TITLE MATCH. AT WM8, HOGAN WAS IN A PURE GRUDGE MATCH AND OUT OF TITLE CONTENTION ---&gt;

With competition from cable superstations broadcasting WCCW, AWA and NWA, McMahon syndicated WWF television shows outside of the promotion's traditional Northeastern territory and began a home video distribution label called [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]]. McMahon would use the additional income generated by advertising, television deals, and video sales and rentals to further his bold ambition to tour nationally. However, such a venture required huge capital investment — one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse.

McMahon did not meet immediate success. In May 1984, in a failed attempt to garner a greater appeal in the Southeast, McMahon bought a controlling interest in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW), an NWA member which held the lucrative Saturday time slot on [[Atlanta]]-based [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]]—known outside of Atlanta as "[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|Superstation TBS]]." &lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs1-can.html|title=End of an era on TBS Solie, Georgia and 'Black Saturday'|accessdate=2007-04-10|author=Molinaro, John F.|publisher=SLAM! Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 1984 — later dubbed "[[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]]" — WWF programming began airing in the TBS timeslot formerly occupied by GCW programming.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; The WWF programming was not successful and viewed as comical compared to the NWA.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; Due to low ratings and viewer protests, TBS began airing wrestling by [[Ole Anderson]]'s promotion, as well as [[Bill Watts]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], both of which garnered higher ratings than McMahon's WWF show.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; Later, McMahon sold the TBS timeslot to rival promoter [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; In the WWE documentary ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'', Crockett explained that his purchase of the timeslot basically paid for McMahon's first WrestleMania.&lt;ref name="The Rise and Fall of WCW"&gt;''The Rise and Fall of WCW'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1984, the regional territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|date=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; system of the NWA in [[Canada]] and the United States was clearly in jeopardy. In June 1984, [[Jack Tunney]] transferred his control in Maple Leaf Wrestling to the WWF. The AWA, WCCW and Memphis-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] formed [[Pro Wrestling USA]] in 1985 but the endeavor failed by the end of the year.

Many fans, especially those in the [[Deep South]], were angered by the collapse of their local wrestling promotions. Some of the more well known promotions included Championship Wrestling from [[Florida]] and [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], were affected. These fans turned to [[Atlanta]]-based WCW broadcast on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]]. In most of these areas, WWF shows were not financially successful until 1997-98.

=== Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection ===
The WWF would go on to a period of unprecedented success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=god166/&gt; The success was in part precipitated by the "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection", a period of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the music industry.&lt;ref name=god166&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was formed by WWF manager [[Lou Albano]], who met singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] on a trip to [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=god166/&gt; Lauper asked Albano to appear as her father in her video for the single "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]" in 1983.&lt;ref name=god166/&gt; 
McMahon later booked Lauper and Albano on a segment of ''[[Piper's Pit]]''.&lt;ref name=god166/&gt; During the segment, the Rock 'n' Wrestling storyline began when Lou called Lauper a "broad", while Lauper retaliated by hitting him with her purse.&lt;ref name=god169&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; She then challenged Lou to a match between two female wrestlers of their choice.&lt;ref name=god169/&gt;

[[MTV]] broadcast the first live wrestling match on cable television as well as  the first live women's professional wrestling  match. Lauper chose [[Wendi Richter]], while Albano chose [[The Fabulous Moolah]].&lt;ref name=god169/&gt; The match was scheduled for July 23, 1984, at ''[[The Brawl to End it All]]'', broadcast live on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name=god169/&gt;&lt;ref name=raging87&gt;Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, Lauper interfered on Richter's behalf by hitting Moolah in the head with her purse, dubbed "The Loaded Purse of Doom".&lt;ref name=god169/&gt; At the conclusion of the match, Richter defeated Moolah for the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Championship]], which the WWF had promoted as having been held by Moolah for the previous 28 years.&lt;ref name=god171&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between Lauper and the WWF continued with the video for the song "[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]", "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]", and "[[She Bop]]", all of which featured WWF wrestlers.&lt;ref name=god171/&gt; Richter later had a match with Moolah's protégé [[Leilani Kai]] at ''[[The War to Settle the Score]]'', with Lauper and Moolah in their respective corners.&lt;ref name=god176&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt; Kai won the title with the help of Moolah.&lt;ref name=god176/&gt; Richter and Kai had a rematch at the [[WrestleMania I|inaugural WrestleMania]], where Richter regained the title.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 1985, ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]'', an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] starring the character of Hulk Hogan, premiered on [[CBS]]. The series ran until June 6, 1987, in the process expanding Hogan's young fanbase.&lt;ref name="hhrnw"&gt;[http://www.tv.com/hulk-hogans-rock-n-wrestling/show/3843/summary.html?full_summary=1&amp;tag=showspace_links;full_summary Hulk Hogan's Rock 'N' Wrestling]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The inaugural WrestleMania ===
In 1985, to counter the [[AWA Super Sunday|AWA's Super Sunday]], the NWA's Starrcade and WCCW's Star Wars, the WWF created its own flagship show, [[WrestleMania I]], held at Madison Square Garden and broadcast on 135 [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]]. The future of not just the WWF's national experiment but the whole professional wrestling industry came down to the success or failure of this pay-per-view. WrestleMania was an extravaganza marketed as "the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling". The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had been running Starrcade a few years prior to WrestleMania, and even the elder McMahon had marketed large [[Shea Stadium]] cards viewable in closed circuit locations. However, Wrestlemania I drew the interest of the mainstream media by including celebrities such as [[Mr. T]] and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event. MTVs popularity and coverage of the Women's wrestling feud created a great deal of interest in WWF programming at this time.

The show was a huge success. Hogan, who won in the main event, appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' which, after the swimsuit issue, was the magazine's best seller of 1985. Professional wrestling began to become mainstream, thanks, in large part, to the appeal of Hulkamania among children. Large television networks took wrestling into their weekly programming, including ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', premiering on [[NBC]] in May 1985, as well as the syndicated weekly show ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'' (which was also broadcast internationally). While ''Championship Wrestling'' was generally taped in [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]], ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' was taped in front of packed arenas around the country.

WrestleMania's popularity and ratings appeal made professional wrestling a television mainstay. Professional wrestling, now synonymous with the WWF, began to throw more grandiose matches. In November 1985, a second pay-per-view "[[The Wrestling Classic]]" took place. The concept, a one-night tournament, was a huge success and would become a regular event, titled [[King of the Ring]].

=== NWA competes with WWF ===
Jim Crockett, also envisioning a nationwide promotion, absorbed several other NWA members into a single entity known as [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP). In 1986, he renamed JCP "NWA World Championship Wrestling". He would acquire several more promotions, including some non-NWA members, in the following year. By late 1987, Crockett's ownership of so many NWA affiliates, coupled with his continued presidency of the NWA, gave him considerable power. However, Crockett's spending had left JCP indebted, with the promotion facing a $5 million deficit.&lt;ref name="The Rise and Fall of WCW"/&gt; Crockett's attempt to generate revenue with the broadcast of the highly promoted [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade]] pay-per-view in late 1987 was thwarted by McMahon, who held his [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view on the same day. The WWF threatened to cancel their contracts with cable companies that dared to carry Starrcade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|author2=Mooneyham, Mike|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|date=2002-07-16|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60690-5|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only five cable companies opted to remain loyal to Crockett, which gave them only an $80,000 profit after expenses. A similar situation arose in January 1988, when Crockett's [[Bunkhouse Stampede]] pay-per-view was counter-programmed by the inaugural [[Royal Rumble (1988)|Royal Rumble]], which aired for free on the [[USA Network]]. On November 21, 1988, Crockett was obliged to sell his promotion to Ted Turner. Under the ownership of Turner, the promotion was rechristened [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). After years of financial turmoil and the constant changing of bookers, WCW would resume competition with McMahon's WWF when former AWA commentator [[Eric Bischoff]] was appointed as the promotion's Executive Vice President.

=== Hulk Hogan, André the Giant and Randy Savage ===
[[File:Hulk Hogan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Hulk Hogan]]]]
WWF held its most successful event, [[WrestleMania III]], in March 1987. It achieved the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America. The main event, where Hogan scoop-slammed (later dubbed "the body slam heard around the world") and defeated [[André the Giant]], helped the show go down in wrestling history as one of the greatest ever produced and made the WWF's popularity soar. In February 1988, Hogan and André faced each other in a special WrestleMania III rematch on the Friday night [[prime time]] spin-off of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', titled ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]'' which saw Hogan lose to André by manipulation of the [[Ted DiBiase|"Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]]. After the match, André handed the title to DiBiase as promised, resulting in the title being vacated and setting the stage for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at [[WrestleMania IV]]. On a previous edition of the same show, [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] made his official transition from heel to babyface in his match against [[The Honky Tonk Man]], with [[Miss Elizabeth]] bringing in Hogan to aid Savage against The Honky Tonk Man and [[The Hart Foundation#The Hart Foundation|The Hart Foundation]]. This eventually struck a friendship between Savage and Hogan.

At [[WrestleMania IV]], Savage won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament, with Elizabeth and Hogan at his side. Months later, Hogan and Savage teamed up as [[The Mega Powers]]; and at the first ever [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam]], they faced off against DiBiase and André's tag team known as [[The Mega Bucks]]. Though friends and tag partners, over the period of a year tensions began to build for various reasons, finally resulting in Savage striking Hogan in early 1989, turning Savage heel once again, and setting up a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania V]], which saw Hogan after over a year once again hold the title. Savage and Hogan continued to feud until the February 1990 edition of ''[[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event III|The Main Event]]'', where Hogan successfully defended the title in a special WrestleMania V rematch.

=== End of an era ===
[[File: André the Giant in the late '80s.jpg|right|thumb|[[Andre the Giant]]]]
Generally, [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, is acknowledged as the end of the 1980s wrestling boom. The event saw one of the last WWF appearances of André the Giant (as a member of the [[The Colossal Connection|Colossal Connection]]), who had become barely mobile in the ring due to real life health issues, and his parting with long-time manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]]. In addition, [[Nikolai Volkoff]] (then part of [[The Bolsheviks]]) played his standard part as the evil [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russian]] for one last time before turning babyface and embracing America, reflecting the end of the [[Cold War]].  The main event was a title-for-title match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Ultimate Warrior]]. It not only pitted the WWF's two biggest faces against each other, but was intended as the "passing of the torch" from Hogan, the star of the 1980s, to Warrior, who was immensely popular and considered to be Hogan's successor. Hogan's clean pin fall loss (another first) signaled the end of an era. However, Hogan lingered on in the WWF for the next three years, winning the title for another three times. By the early 1990s, Hogan started appearing with much less frequency on WWF events, with Warrior taking the main-event spot through all of 1990 and 1991.

In 1992, allegations of [[anabolic steroid]] abuse and [[sexual harassment]] were harming the WWF's family-friendly image. Around this time as well, Dr. George Zahorian, a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, was accused of selling anabolic steroids to many WWF wrestlers, including Hogan, who took a long hiatus from the WWF after [[WrestleMania VIII]].

The fans who were kids in the mid and late 1980s were teens by the 1990s, and many eventually grew bored with the comic book style of wrestling of the 1980s, turning their attention away from their childhood favorites such as Hogan, Junkyard Dog, and [[Jimmy Snuka|"Superfly" Jimmy Snuka]], in favor of newer and grittier wrestlers like [[The Undertaker]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], and [[Bret Hart|Bret "Hitman" Hart]]; then in the [[Attitude Era]] in favor of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Triple H]], [[Mick Foley]] (whether competing as Cactus Jack, Dude Love, or Mankind), and [[The New Age Outlaws]]. This was special to Hogan's return to the WWF in February 1993, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' (which replaced another WWF program during the 1980s, ''Prime Time Wrestling'') where Hogan received a lackluster reaction from the crowds.

[[File:East-Hem 100ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Hemisphere in [[AD 100]], at the end of the first century]]

The '''1st century''' was the [[century]] that lasted from [[AD 1]] to [[AD 100]] according to the [[Julian calendar]]. It is often written as the {{nowrap|'''1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]]'''}}&lt;ref&gt;in violation of the general rule that the abbreviation [[AD]] should ''precede'' the date IN question.&lt;/ref&gt; or {{nowrap|'''1st century [[Common Era|CE]]'''}} to distinguish it from the [[1st century BC]] (or BCE) which preceded it. The 1st century is considered part of the [[Classical era]], epoch, or [[History by period|historical period]].

During this period, Europe, North Africa, and the Near East fell under increasing domination by the [[Roman Empire]], which continued expanding, most notably conquering [[Britannia|Britain]] under the emperor [[Claudius]] ([[AD 43]]). The reforms introduced by [[Augustus]] during his long reign stabilized the empire after the turmoil of the previous century's civil wars. Later in the century the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], which had been founded by [[Augustus]], came to an end with the suicide of [[Nero]] in [[AD 68]]. There followed the famous [[Year of Four Emperors]], a brief period of civil war and instability, which was finally brought to an end by [[Vespasian]], ninth Roman emperor, and founder of the [[Flavian dynasty]]. The Roman Empire generally experienced a period of prosperity and dominance in this period and the First Century is remembered as part of the Empire's golden age.

The 1st century saw the [[Christianity in the 1st century|appearance of Christianity]].

China continued to be dominated by the [[Han Dynasty]], despite a fourteen-year interruption by the [[Xin dynasty]] under [[Wang Mang]]. Han rule was restored in [[AD 23]]; Wang Mang's rule represents the watershed between the Western/Former Han and the Eastern/Later Han. [[History of the Han Dynasty|The capital was also moved]] from [[Chang'an]] to [[Luoyang]].

'''Aboriginal Canoes''' were a significant advancement in canoe technology. [[Dugout (boat)|Dugouts]] were stronger, faster, and more efficient than previous types of [[Scarred tree|bark canoes]]. The Aboriginal peoples' use of these canoes brought about many changes to both their hunting practices and society.  The [[Australian Aboriginal]] people began using these canoes around the 17th century in coastal regions of [[Australia]].  As the popularity of dugouts grew their use quickly spread across the continent. Dugout canoes were brought to Northern Australia by Buginese trepang (sea cucumber) fishermen from Makassar, South Sulawesi, current evidence says from around 1640.

== Construction ==

Aboriginal canoes were constructed much more easily than previous types of vessels, such as bark canoes. This ease of construction played a significant role in the dugout canoes’ widespread use. While earlier vessels required a great deal of labor and time-consuming sewing to make, dugout canoes were constructed easily and in a shorter period of time.&lt;ref name="Mitch"&gt;Mitchell 2005&lt;/ref&gt; First, one would have to cut down a tree and shape the exterior into an even form. The sides of the canoe were shaped in one of two ways. They were either carved straight up and down or in a "u" shape, curving in towards the center of the boat. Next, one would literally dig out the inner wood of the log to make space for the oarsmen to sit and paddle.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas 1905,&lt;/ref&gt; In some early dugout canoes, Aboriginal people would not make the bottoms of the canoes smooth, but would instead carve "ribbing" into the vessel. Ribbing (literally sections of wood that looked like ribs) was used to stabilize bark canoes, and though not necessary to dugout canoes, was a carryover in the transition from one canoe type to the other.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; Both the chopping down of the tree and the digging out of the log were easily done with an iron-[[axe]].&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bellwood and Hiscock 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

The wood used in the construction of dugout canoes was essential to its strength and durability. A wide variety of trees were used depending upon the location of a particular people, but in most cases the Aboriginal people used a type of native [[sycamore]] possibly [[Litsea reticulata]] or [[Cryptocarya glaucescens]] (Silver sycamore), White sycamore ([[Polyscias elegans]] or Cryptocarya obovata), [[Ceratopetalum succirubrum]] (Satin sycamore), [[Cardwellia sublimia]], [[Cryptocarya hypospodia]] (Bastard Sycamore), [[Ceratopetalum virchowii]] (Pink Sycamore) or [[Ceratopetalum corymbosum]] (Mountain sycamore).&lt;ref&gt;http://keys.trin.org.au/key-server/data/0e0f0504-0103-430d-8004-060d07080d04/media/Html/taxon/index_common.htm ''Species Index by Common Name'' in Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Polyscias.html Sorting Polyscias names&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodsolutions.com.au/Wood-Species/satin-sycamore Satin sycamore, also known as Ceratopetalum succirubrum&lt;/ref&gt; Sycamores are strong and extremely durable, making them suitable for use in the construction of dugout canoes.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

== Uses ==

Both [[sea turtles]] and [[dugongs]] were essential components of the [[Bush tucker|Aboriginal diet]].&lt;ref name="Mitch"/&gt; The transformation from bark canoes to dugout canoes greatly increased the ability of the tribal hunters to catch and kill both of these types of sea creatures due primarily to a more formidable structure.  Dugout canoes included a stronger and better platform for harpooning that greatly increased the stability of an upright hunter by providing essential footing.&lt;ref name="Mitch"/&gt; In order to capture [[dugongs]] and [[sea turtles]], the hunters needed to maintain the utmost degree of stealth. Perfect balance was required and the new dugout canoes gave the hunters this necessary edge.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the shift towards using dugout canoes maximized the overall possibilities of seafarers.  Not only did increased sturdiness, speed and stability of Dugout canoes make hunting easier, but these characteristics also allowed for long-distance travel.&lt;ref name="Worsley"&gt;Worsley 1955,&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Bark canoes had been only used for inland use or travel extremely close to the shore, Dugout canoes offered a far greater range of travel which allowed for trade outside the area of the village. Dugout canoes were capable of traveling distances over 500&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Mitch"/&gt; This new vessel gave the Aboriginal people the ability and opportunity to explore, trade and locate additional resources located outside the central location.

== Impacts ==

The widespread use of dugout canoes had many impacts on Aboriginal life. The most significant were results of the Aboriginal peoples' ability to hunt larger prey. With the strength to transport larger prey over longer distances, dugout enabled the Aboriginals to vastly expand their hunting grounds. This larger prey also enabled the Aboriginals to support a larger group of people over a longer period of time. This increase in the ability to support population led to both population growth and expansion.

'''Taqi al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn 'Ali ibn 'Abd al-Qadir ibn Muhammad al-Maqrizi''' (1364–1442)&lt;ref name=makrizi&gt;[[Franz Rosenthal]], [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-makrizi-SIM_4838 al-Maḳrīzī]. [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Second Edition. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Arabic Language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|تقى الدين أحمد بن على بن عبد القادر بن محمد المقريزى}}) was an Egyptian Arab historian&lt;ref name="Holmes2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Holmes|title=Ancient Egypt In An Hour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZZMcsdMPXcC&amp;pg=PA11|date=6 December 2010|publisher=History In An Hour|isbn=978-1-4523-3674-9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; more commonly known as '''al-Maqrizi''' or '''Makrizi'''. Although he was "a [[Mamluk|Mamluk-era]] historian and himself a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]], he is remarkable in this context for his unusually keen interest in the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid dynasty]] and its role in Egyptian history."&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Walker, ''Exploring an Islamic Empire: Fatimid History and its Sources'' (London, [[I.B. Tauris]], 2002), p. 164. The material for updating this article is taken from Walker's account of al-Maqrizi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Maqrizi was born in Fatimid [[Cairo]] and spent most of his life in [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=makrizi/&gt; When he presents himself in his books he usually stops at the 10th forefather although he confessed to some of his close friends that he can trace his ancestry to [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|Al-Mu‘izz li-Din Allah]] -first Fatimid caliph in Egypt and the founder of al-Qahirah- and even to [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mamluk.uchicago.edu/MSR_VII-2_2003-Rabbat_pp1-19.pdf|title=Who Was al-Maqr{{!}}z{{!}}? A Biographical Sketch|last=RABBAT|first=NASSER|date=2003|website=mamluk.uchicago.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained in the [[Hanafi]]te school of law. Later, he switched to the [[Shafi'i]]te school and finally to the [[Ẓāhirī|Zahirite]] school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]], ''Inba al-Ghumar bi-Anba al-'Umr''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasser Rabbat, "Who was al-Maqrizi?" pg. 13. Taken from Mamlūk Studies Review, Vol. 7, Part 2. Middle East Documentation Center, [[University of Chicago]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Maqrizi studied theology under one of the primary masterminds behind the [[Zahiri Revolt]],&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, ''Tajrid al-Tawhid al-Mufid'', pg. 33 of the introduction of Sabri bin Salamah Shahin. [[Riyadh]]: Dar al-Qubs, 2005. {{ISBN|978-9960-49-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his vocal support and sympathy with that revolt against the Mamluks likely cost him higher administrative and clerical positions with the Mamluk regime.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbat, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Maqrizi was an attribution to a quarter of the city of [[Baalbek]], from where his paternal grandparents hailed.&lt;ref name=makrizi/&gt; Maqrizi confessed to his contemporaries that he believed that he was related to the Fatimids through the son of [[Ma'ad al-Muizz Li-Deenillah|al-Muizz]]. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] preserves the most memorable account: his father, as they entered the [[al-Hakim Mosque]] one day, told him "My son, you are entering the mosque of your ancestor." However, his father also instructed al-Maqrizi not to reveal this information to anyone he could not trust; Walker concludes:
:Ultimately it would be hard to conclude that al-Maqrizi conceived any more than an antiquarian interest in the Fatimids. His main concern seems more likely to be the meaning they and their city might have for the present, that is, for Mamluk Egypt and its role in Islam. (p. 167)

In 1385, he went on the Islamic pilgrimage, the [[Hajj]]. For some time he was secretary in a government office, and in 1399 became inspector of markets for Cairo and northern Egypt. This post he soon gave up to become a preacher at the [[Mosque of 'Amr ibn al 'As]], president of the [[al-Hakim Mosque]], and a lecturer on tradition. In 1408, he went to [[Damascus]] to become inspector of the Qalanisryya and lecturer. Later, he retired into private life at Cairo.

In 1430, he again went on Hajj with his family and travelled for some five years. His learning was great, his observation accurate and his judgement good, but his books are largely compilations, and he does not always acknowledge the sources upon which he relied.

==Writings==
Most of Al-Maqrizi's works, exceeding 200,&lt;ref&gt;Okasha El Daly (2005), ''Egyptology: the missing millennium : ancient Egypt in medieval Arabic writings'', UCL, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned with Egypt. The most important is the ''Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar'' (2 vols., Bulaq, 1854), translated into French by [[Urbain Bouriant]] as ''Description topographique et historique de l'Égypte'' (Paris, 1895–1900; compare [[A. R. Guest]], "A List of Writers, Books and other Authorities mentioned by El Maqrizi in his Khitat," in ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1902, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–125).

Of his ''History of the Fatimites'' an extract was published by J.G.L. Kosegarten in his ''Chrestomathia'' (Leipzig, 1828), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–123; the ''History of the Ayyubit and Mameluke Rulers'' has been translated into French by [[Etienne Marc Quatremère]] (2 vols., Paris, 1837–1845).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/histoiredessulta01maqr Histoire des sultans mamlouks, de l'Égypte, écrite en arabe (1845)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maqrizi began a large work called the ''Muqaffa'', an encyclopedia of Egyptian biography in alphabetic order. Another Egyptian historian, [[al-Sakhawi]], believed this would require eighty volumes to complete, but only sixteen were written. Three autograph volumes exist in manuscript in [[Leiden]] and one in Paris.

[[File:Aleksander Kaminski Grave.jpg|thumb|Cross on the grave of Aleksander Kamiński at the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw]]
In "Przeglad Propagandowy" (1943 No. 2), under the alias "Hubert", Kamiński published an article "Podstawy ideowe propagandy wojskowej" (The Ideological Basics of Military Propaganda).

At the same time, in April 1941 Kamiński succeeded Captain Zygmunt Hempel in leading the BiP Division of the Warsaw-City District of ZWZ – Warsaw District of the Home Army under the alias "Faktor", and from November 1942 – "Fabrykant". Among other things, a cell called "Sztuka" (Art) was created, which initiated works of art, which were distributed or exhibited during the occupation (puppet theatre, caricatures, songs). He organized and then supervised the work of the Propaganda Commission (KOPR), which since spring of 1942 had been producing the entire publishing output of the Home Army Warsaw District Headquarters. He remained the head of BiP of the Warsaw Home Army District Headquarters until June 1944.

The best known and most visible effects of Wawer's activity include drawings of the "anchor" of the Fighting Poland and "V" signs, as well as anti-German inscriptions in public places, distribution of leaflets, gassing of cinemas and megaphone actions. Kamiński personally participated in the first series of such actions – destruction of exhibitions of photographers showing photographs of uniformed Germans (5 December 1940).

Kamiński is the author of one of the most famous books of occupied Warsaw, "[[Stones for the Rampart|Kamienie na szaniec]]" (Stones for the Rampart), which was first published in July 1943. He wrote the book on the basis of [[Tadeusz Zawadzki|Tadeusz "Zośka" Zawadzki's]] account of his colleagues from the 23rd Warsaw Scouting Team, including [[Jan Bytnar]] and [[Maciej Aleksy Dawidowski|Aleksy Dawidowski]], written after the [[Operation Arsenal|Arsenal action]] in April 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/749297494|title=Bohaterowie "Kamieni na szaniec" w świetle dokumentów|date=2007|publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN|others=Strzembosz, Tomasz (1930–2004).|isbn=9788301153304|edition=Wyd. 3|location=Warszawa|oclc=749297494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podręcznik dla kierowników oddziałów Zawiszy" ("The Leader. Manual for Branch Managers of Zawisza") (part 1-2, December 1942, edition II 1943, edition III 1944).[[Image:PomnikAleksandraKamińskiego02.jpg|thumb|Kamiński memorial in [[Łódź]]]]In April 1944, Kamiński was placed by the counterintelligence of the [[National Armed Forces]] (NSZ) on one of the so-called proscription lists (it included the names of people suspected of being leftist, Communist and/or Jewish in origin).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733026248|title=Karuzela na placu Krasińskich : studia i szkice z lat wojny i okupacji|last=Tomasz.|first=Szarota,|date=2007|publisher=Oficyna Wydawnicza RYTM|isbn=9788373993365|edition=Wyd. 2|location=Warszawa|oclc=733026248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the NSZ document Aleksander Kamiński was described as "a Jew-lover who always inclined towards the extreme left-communist".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[Warsaw uprising]] he continued to be the editor-in-chief of the "Information Bulletin" (which at that time was already published openly as a daily newspaper) until the last issue on 4 October 1944.

On 30 September 1944 the head of the Home Army Headquarters, Colonel [[Jan Rzepecki]], alias ''Chairman'', applied for Kamiński's promotion to the rank of Second Lieutenant of the Polish Army (WP) Reserve. After the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising, he was no longer involved in any underground activity.

=== Post-war period ===
From May 1945 to 1950 Kamiński was an assistant at the faculties of social pedagogy and general pedagogy of the [[University of Łódź]]. In 1947 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD degree]] in philosophy after defending his dissertation "The Scouting method in upbringing and schooling".

Still active in the ZHP: from January 1946 he was a member of the Ideological Commission and the [[Scout Law|Law]] and [[Scout Promise|Promise of Scouting]]. By the ordinance of 12 January 1946, Kamiński was appointed a member of the Provisional General Scouting Council, and from March 1946, he was the Second Vice President of the Polish Scouting Association. In 1947 he was deprived of this position, and in January 1949 removed from the ZHP for ideological reasons. At the beginning of 1950, Kamiński was also removed from the University of Łódź. In 1951, all his works were withdrawn from Polish libraries and [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|censored]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53121004|title=Cenzura PRL : wykaz książek podlegających niezwłocznemu wycofaniu 1.X.1951 r.|date=2002|publisher=Wydawn. "Nortom"|others=Żmigrodzki, Zbigniew.|isbn=8385829881|location=Wrocław|oclc=53121004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1956, under surveillance of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Security Office]].
[[File:Tablica Aleksander Kamiński Łódź 2010.jpg|thumb|A plaque on the building at Aleksander Kamiński Street 30 in Łódź]]
Kamiński returned to [[scouting]] in 1956, when the events of October 1956 brought renewal and hope for democratic change in the country. Kaminski participated in discussions on the situation in the scouting sector and the possibility of reactivating ZHP. On 26 November 1956, he met with a group of instructors representing the Kraków community, who were in the process of finalizing the reactivation of ZHP. They refused to support him in the implementation of his concept of reactivating scouting activities within the OHPL (Scouting Organization of the People's Republic of Poland), presenting their position (and evidence) that the only correct solution was to reactivate the ZHP (which they did on 4 December 1956). At that time, at the beginning of December, he held meetings with 25 instructors from the pre-war ZHP. Kamiński went with them to the meeting of OHPL activists in Łódź, which was transformed into the "All-Poland Meeting of Scouting Activists" (National Congress of Scouting Activists). He became a member of the Supreme Scouting Council and was later elected [[List of Presidents of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association|Chairman]].

However, Kamiński held the position of the Chairman of the Council for less than a year and a half. He resigned under pressure from the forces that sought to subjugate ZHP ideologically to the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].
[[File:Popiersie Aleksandra Kamińskiego w Łazienkach Królewskich w Warszawie 2017.jpg|thumb|Bust of Aleksander Kamiński in the Royal Baths in Warsaw]]
In 1958, Kamiński returned to work at the University of Łódź, where he headed the Department of Social Pedagogy. In 1958, he was a member of the National Committee of the [[Front of National Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;Trybuna Robotnicza, nr 4 (4350) 7 stycznia 1958 roku, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 he obtained his postdoctoral degree on the basis of his work "Prehistory of Polish Youth Associations", and in March 1969 he was awarded the title of Associate Professor.

Active in the [[Polish Teachers' Union|Polish Teachers Association]] and in the Polish Mental Hygiene Association, member of the Committee of Pedagogical and Psychological Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences. At the beginning of the 1970s, on the order of the authorities, Kamiński prepared a report on the consequences of possible introduction of work free Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;He approached that idea critically, drawing attention to the negative social effects of, among other things, "weakening of social life – meetings, trade union events, etc., weakening of education, training and involvement in public affairs". He warned that this could cause "hooliganism, drunkenness, erotic entertainment" as well as an increase in the number of car accidents due to the increased number of weekend trips. He also quoted GUS data on the rapid growth of alcohol consumption on Saturday evenings. Andrzej Krajewski "The happiest day of the week". "Gazeta Prawna' No 212(3853)&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring in 1972, he returned to Warsaw, where he died on 15 March 1978. Buried at the [[Powązki Military Cemetery]], Warsaw, in the quarters of the Home Army Scouting Battalion "Zoska" (A20-1-13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/812740801|title=Orły niepodległości : Cmentarz Wojskowy na Powązkach w Warszawie w setną rocznicę jego powstania (1912–2012)|last=Tadeusz.|first=Sobieraj,|date=2012|publisher=Apostolicum|isbn=9788370318086|location=Warszawa|oclc=812740801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end Kamiński rested next to Rudy, Alek and Zośka, who were so close to him as the heroes of "Stones for the Rampart".

On 5 May 1991, the [[Yad Vashem]] Institute posthumously awarded Aleksander Kamiński the title of "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]" for his help given during the occupation to members of the Jewish scouts' organization and the Jewish resistance movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/443558424|title=Księga Sprawiedliwych wśród Narodów Świata : ratujący Żydów podczas Holocaustu : Polska|date=2009|publisher=Fundacja Instytut Studiów Strategicznych|others=Krakowski, Shmuel., Gutman, Israel., Bender, Sara., Yad ṿa-shem, rashut ha-zikaron la-Shoʼah ṿela-gevurah.|isbn=9788387832599|location=Kraków|oclc=443558424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aloers''''' (the word is originally [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) were independent [[peasant]] proprietors of ''alous'' in what is now [[Catalonia]], especially during the years between the [[Carolingian]] reconquest of the [[Marca Hispanica|Hispanic Marches]] from the [[Moors]] in the late 9th century and the consolidation of [[feudalism]] in that region in the 11th century. They generally practised family-based [[subsistence farming]].

The owner of property in ''alou'' (from the Frankish ''alôd'' = full domain) was considered by medieval jurists to have "''no other lord than God''".

A '''backronym''', or '''bacronym''', is a constructed phrase that purports to be the source of a word that is an [[acronym]]. Backronyms may be invented with either serious or humorous intent, or they may be a type of [[false etymology]] or [[folk etymology]].

An [[acronym]] is a word derived from the initial letters of the words of a phrase:&lt;ref name="dict-ref-acronym"&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acronym | title=Acronym | work = Dictionary.com |accessdate=2006-11-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061028021324/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Acronym| archivedate= 28 October 2006 | deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word ''[[radar]]'' comes from "radio detection and ranging".&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.nasaexplores.com/show_k4_teacher_st.php?id=030703122033 |author= NASA |authorlink= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work= Nasa Explores |title= RADAR means: '''Ra'''dio '''D'''etection '''a'''nd '''R'''anging }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this was chosen because more people are familiar with radar than RAM: ~~~ --&gt;

By contrast, a backronym is constructed by creating a new phrase to fit an already-existing word, name, or acronym. For example, the [[United States Department of Justice]] assigns to its [[Amber Alert]] program the meaning "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amberalert.gov/ |title=AMBER Alert - America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response |publisher=Amberalert.gov |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2010-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174209/http://www.amberalert.gov/| archivedate= 27 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term originally referred to [[Amber Hagerman]], a 9-year-old abducted and murdered in [[Texas]] in 1996.

Backronyms are often used for comedic effect, as when [[NASA]] named its [[International Space Station|ISS]] treadmill the Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (C.O.L.B.E.R.T.) after [[Stephen Colbert]]. The backronym was a lighthearted compromise in recognition of the comedian's ability to sway NASA's online vote for the naming of an ISS module later named ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]''.&lt;ref name="colbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html |title=COLBERT Ready for Serious Exercise |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please don't change 'combination' to 'portmanteau'. It is likely to start a silly edit war. See Talk Archive 3 and Talk Archive 1 for some past arguments about the wording. --&gt;
The word is a combination of ''backward'' and ''acronym'', and has been defined as a "reverse acronym".&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/bacronym.asp |accessdate=2009-05-19 |first=Paul |last=McFedries |authorlink=Paul McFedries |title=bacronym |work=Word Spy: The World Lover's Guide to New Words |publisher=[[WordSpy.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest known citation in print is as "bacronym" in the November 1983 edition of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' monthly [[neologism]] contest.&lt;!--2 refs if needed: https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/colmnst/levey/levey.htm#neologism and http://www.fun-with-words.com/neologisms_competition.html--&gt; The newspaper quoted winning reader Meredith G. Williams of [[Potomac, Maryland]], defining it as the "same as an acronym, except that the words were chosen to fit the letters".&lt;ref name="wordspy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levey|first1=Bob|title=When You Can't Decide, You Just Pick Them All|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1983/11/08/when-you-cant-decide-you-just-pick-them-all/fbd4bf9c-b383-4e55-9bd7-508cb9f69f1b/|date=November 8, 1983|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- PLEASE: Do not add new backronyms without citations and mentioning SIGNIFICANCE on [[Talk:Backronym]] This is a list of examples. It is ''not'' meant to be exhaustive. This section illustrates a concept; it's not an anthology. Please suggest items on the talkpage first, and make sure there's a [[wp:rs]] reliable source. New items should be in wide circulation. --&gt;

Backronyms can be constructed for educational purposes, for example to form [[mnemonic]]s. An example of such a mnemonic is the [[Apgar score]], used to assess the health of newborn babies. The rating system was devised by and named after [[Virginia Apgar]], but ten years after the initial publication, the backronym ''APGAR'' was coined in the US as a mnemonic learning aid: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/CP/Views/Exhibit/narrative/obstetric.html|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, NIH|title=The Virginia Apgar Papers - Obstetric Anesthesia and a Scorecard for Newborns, 1949-1958| accessdate=2008-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and other [[Twelve-step programs|12-step programs]] use backronyms as teaching tools, similar to slogans such as "one day at a time", or "Let go, let God", but often with an ironic edge. For example, a ''slip'' may be expanded as "Sobriety Losing Its Priority",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gf4y3fdElKgC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Sobriety+losing+its+priority%22|title=Keep Coming Back: Humor and Wisdom for Living and Loving Recovery by Meiji Stewart Google Books Result|accessdate=2008-07-08 | isbn=978-1-56838-378-1 | year=1999 | publisher=Hazelden Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''denial'' as "Don't Even Notice I Am Lying".&lt;ref name="12-steps-recovery.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lord Wolf Designs |url=http://12-steps-recovery.com/library/acronyms.html |title=Recovery Related Acronyms and Meanings for A.A. &amp; N.A. use |publisher=12-steps-recovery.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backronyms are also created as jokes or as slogans, often expressing consumer loyalties or frustration. For example, the name of the restaurant chain ''[[Arby's]]'' is a play on the letters "RB", referring to the company's founders, the Raffel brothers. An advertising campaign in the 1980s created a backronym with the slogan "America’s Roast Beef, Yes Sir!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2234863/ |title=Too Much Beef: Why Arby's is so low on the restaurant food chain. |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-11-07 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some backronyms name the subject to make obvious its purpose or characteristics; the [[GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]] (abbreviated [[MOAB]]) and others in the series were heavily promoted by the [[United States]] as the "Mother of All Bombs", a backronym during the [[Iraq War]]. US news coverage in the days leading up to the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] claimed "Mother of All Bombs" to be the US response to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s phrase "mother of all battles" from the first Gulf War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/03/12/air-force-tests-mother-all-bombs/ |title=Air Force Tests 'Mother of All Bombs' |publisher=Fox News |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[commercial aviation]], [[ETOPS]] is officially an acronym for Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAP 789: Requirements and Guidance Material for Operators |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%20789.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-24 |quote=Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS) Pre-Departure Service Check |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127112145/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%20789.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; defining safety standards for long-distance over-water flights by planes with only two engines, but in aviation vernacular, the colloquial backronym is "Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen |first=John T. |title=The Economic Geography of Air Transportation: Space, Time, and the Freedom of the Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlyLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285|date=5 April 2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-15657-2 |page=285 |quote=In the dark humor common in the airline industry, ETOPS is sometimes translated as "engines turn or passengers swim," but in actual practice, the safety of twinjets on over-water routes has been outstanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies or products have spawned multiple humorous backronyms, with positive connotations asserted by supporters or negative ones by detractors. For example, the car company [[Ford]] was said to stand for "First On Race Day", by [[aficionados]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitionplus.com/2006_07/dick_brannan.html |title=Drag Racing's Internet Magazine |publisher=Competition Plus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023131543/http://www.competitionplus.com/2006_07/dick_brannan.html |archivedate=2009-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but disparaged as "Fix Or Repair Daily", by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jalopnik.com |url=http://jalopnik.com/5879789/the-definitive-guide-to-derogatory-auto-acronyms |title=The definitive guide to derogatory auto acronyms |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BusinessBalls.com |url=http://www.businessballs.com/acronyms.htm |title=acronyms and abbreviations |publisher=Business Balls.com |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar backronyms have been directed against many other automakers, such as "Fix It Again Tony" for [[Fiat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2009/0506/1224245982906.html| title=Fix it again, Sergio –  and then fix the rest of 'em | date=May 6, 2009| publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newser.com/story/57710/fiat-has-long-shed-fix-it-again-tony-reputation.html |title=Fiat Has Long Shed 'Fix It Again Tony' Reputation |first1=John |last1=Johnson |publisher=Newser |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backronyms have also been coined by military personnel during wartime. The backronym for [[Spam (food)|Spam]], "Something Posing As Meat", was said to have originated from [[jaundiced]] soldiers who were sick of eating canned meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Words for Old: Recycling Our Language for the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VPO4CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Caroline|last=Taggart|publisher=[[Michael O'Mara Books]]|date=2015|isbn=9781782434733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British contribution to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] was code-named "[[Operation Telic]]", meaning "directed or tending to a definite end", from the Greek word {{lang-grc|τέλος|telos|label=none}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/telic|title=telic - Definition of telic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst service personnel as a backronym for "Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullet Magnet: Britain's Most Highly Decorated Frontline Soldier|author-link=Mick Flynn|first=Mick|last=Flynn|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]]|date=2010|isbn=9780297860013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backronyms are sometimes created to name laws or programs. The official title of the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]], a 2001 [[Act of Congress|Act of the U.S. Congress]], is "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001".&lt;ref&gt;Public Law #56 of the 107th Congress {{USPL|107|56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have noted a trend among US lawmakers to devise names that form a desired acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Micah|title=The Most Powerful Special Interest in Washington: The Acronym|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=May 19, 2012|url=https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/the-most-powerful-special-interest-in-washington-the-acronym/ |access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As false etymologies===
Sometimes a backronym is so commonly heard that it is widely but incorrectly believed to have been used in the formation of the original word, and amounts to a [[false etymology]] or an [[urban legend]]. Examples include [[wikt:posh|''posh'']]{{anchor|POSH}}, an adjective describing stylish items or members of the upper class. A popular story derives the word as an acronym from "Port Out, Starboard Home", referring to nineteenth century first-class cabins on [[ocean liners]], which were shaded from the sun on outbound voyages east (e.g. from Britain to [[British India|India]]) and homeward heading voyages west.&lt;ref name="posh"&gt;
{{cite book|title=Port Out, Starboard Home: And Other Language Myths|publisher=Penguin Books|last=Quinion|first=Michael|isbn=0-14-101223-4|year=2005}}; published in the US as
{{cite book|title=Ballyhoo, Buckaroo, and Spuds|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-085153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word's actual etymology is unknown, but more likely related to [[Romani language|Romani]] ''påš xåra'' ("half-penny") or to [[Urdu]] (borrowed from Persian) ''safed-pōśh'' (one who wears "white robes"), a derogatory term for wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title =posh, ''adj.'' and ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexicographer [[Jesse Sheidlower]] writes in his book [[The F-Word (book)|''The F-Word'']] that acronyms were rare in the English language prior to the twentieth century, and most etymologies of common words or phrases that suggest origin from an acronym are false.&lt;ref name=F-word&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sheidlower |first1=Jesse |authorlink1=Jesse Sheidlower |title=The F-Word |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2009 |isbn=0-19-539311-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include the brand name ''[[Adidas]]'', named after company founder [[Adolf Dassler|Adolf "Adi" Dassler]] but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sports";&lt;ref name="adidas book"&gt;All Day I Dream About Sport: The Story of the Adidas Brand, {{ISBN|1-904879-12-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wiki]]'', said to stand for "What I Know Is",&lt;ref name="economist-wiki"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794228|title=The wiki principle|work=Economist.com|accessdate=2006-11-15|date=2006-04-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061007095842/http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794228| archivedate= 7 October 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact derived from the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] phrase ''wiki-wiki'' meaning "fast";&lt;ref name="dict-ref-wiki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wiki|title=wiki - Definitions from Dictionary.com|accessdate=2006-11-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206015347/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wiki| archivedate= 6 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Yahoo!]], sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth".&lt;ref name="Yahoo-Info"&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Yahoo! - How It All Started... |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/info/misc/history.html |date=2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129061649/http://docs.yahoo.com/info/misc/history.html |archive-date=29 November 2001 |work=Yahoo.com |accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distress signal [[SOS]] is often believed to be an abbreviation for "Save Our Ship" or "Save Our Souls". In fact, it was chosen because it has a simple and unmistakable Morse code representation{{snd}} three dots, three dashes, three dots, all sent without any pauses between characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohrer |first=Finlo |title=Save our SOS |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7444184.stm |publisher=BBC News Magazine |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 80 batik paintings being exhibited in the museum.&lt;ref name="visitpenang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitpenang.gov.my/portal3/penang-tourism-news/1816-batik-painting-museum.html|title=Batik Painting Museum|publisher=visitpenang.gov.my|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Museum showcases the earliest batik paintings done in the 1950s by the 'Father of Batik Painting' Chuah Thean Teng in Penang and the subsequent works by other Malaysian artists. Currently there are now 80 batik paintings by 25 artists in display. A small international section is included. Visitors will be able to view an excellent collection of magnificent batik paintings not to be seen anywhere else. This is definitely the only batik painting museum in Malaysia, and possibly in the world.

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose.

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

[[File:DirkvdM natural spiral.jpg|thumb|A natural left-handed helix, made by a certain climber plant's [[tendril]]. |171x171px]]
Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

'''Clotilde Tambroni''' (29 June 1758 – 2 June 1817), was an Italian [[philologist]], [[linguist]] and [[poet]]. She was a [[professor]] in the [[Greek language]] at the [[University of Bologna]] in 1793–1798, and a professor in Greek and [[literature]] in 1800–1808.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;G. Melzi, Dizionario di opere anonime e pseudonime di scrittori italiani, Pirola, Milano 1848, pp 332&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded in achieving institutional recognition by a university long before women in many parts of the world could even attend university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|last=Wiles|first=R|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=0198725205|location=Oxford|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as her native Italian, she was also fluent in French, English and Spanish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1790, Clothilde Tambroni was invited into the Accademia degli Inestricati, and then in 1792 also admitted to the [[Accademia degli Arcadi]], under the pseudonym of ''Doriclea Sicionia.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/tambroni-clotilde-481331-persona|title=Tambroni Clotilde - Storia e memoria di bologna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having had no opportunity to obtain an academic degree, on 23 November 1793 she was assigned the Chair of Greek Language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homolaicus.com/uomo-donna/donne_famose.htm|title=Donne famose di Bologna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, after having lost her position for refusing to swear her loyalty to the new Cisalpine government, she worked in Spain as a researcher alongside her father, Emanuele Aponte, and was accepted into the l’Accademia Reale di Madrid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Notwithstanding her political ideas, in September 1799 she was restored to the Accademia degli Inestricati as Chair of Greek Language and Literature, and in 1804 was granted a large pay rise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She retired early, citing reasons of ill-health although the Greek Chair was to be abolished under the Napoleonic reforms, which privileged the teaching of science to the detriment of literary studies, although Tambroni herself said at her inaugural speech on 11 January 1806, science and literature had always been linked and notable scientists and humanists both produced by the Bolognese institution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Adamo Tadolini]] sculpted her marble bust, supervised by [[Canova]] who was a friend of the Tambroni family.&lt;ref&gt;G. Tambroni, Intorno la vita di Antonio Canova, Salviucci, Roma 1823.&lt;/ref&gt; She received a lengthy dedication by [[Ireneo Affò]], in his volume ''[https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_59YNk7RX7moC/bub_gb_59YNk7RX7moC_djvu.txt Ragionamento Del Padre].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/name/clotilde-tambroni|title=Clothilde Tambroni - Artists - Royal Academy of Arts|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Academy of Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colnect Collectors Club Community''', is a [[website]] containing [[wiki]]-like [[collectable]]s catalogs. It allows collectors to manage their personal [[collecting|collection]] using these catalogs and automatically match their swap/wish-lists with those of other collectors. Colnect provides a marketplace dedicated to buying and selling collectibles. 
Colnect's [[phone cards]] catalog is the biggest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://it.themarker.com/tmit/article/3471 |title=TechNation- מדור הטכונולוגיה וההייטק של דה מרקר - TheMarker |work=TheMarker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130111818/http://it.themarker.com/tmit/article/3471 |archivedate=2009-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel-on-blog.com/colnects-collectible-phone-cards-listing-has-just-passed-100000/ Article from "Israel on Blog"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Colnect was founded in 2002 as ''Islands Phonecards Database'' with the aim to create a catalog of all phonecards. Since autumn 2008, [[Postage stamp|stamps]] and [[coins]] are supported in addition to [[phone cards]]. In the mean time, 38&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colnect.com/en/main/categories|title=Colnect, connecting collectors: Colnect|work=colnect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; types of collectables are represented. Here is an overview of selected collectibles:

== Features ==
The collectables catalogs on Colnect are created by collectors using the site. New items are added by contributors and verified by volunteering editors. Though any collector may add their comments on a catalog item, actual changes are done only by site-trusted editors.
All users can see the catalog information (issue dates, print runs, pictures, etc.). Registered users can additionally manage their personal collection by marking each item as belonging to their collection, swap list or wish list while browsing through the catalogs.
These users automatically can match their swap list with a wish list of another user and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/colnect-is-a-no-frills-collectibles-marketplace-and-wiki-someone-wake-up-david-cowan/|title=Colnect Is A No-Frills Collectibles Marketplace And Wiki.  Someone Wake Up David Cowan!|author=Roi Carthy|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Users can purchase a Premium membership with additional features. Contributors get it for free. Premium members can download any list with collectables and open it as a [[spreadsheet]].

Colnect provides a marketplace for collectibles. It is publicly available since December 27, 2017. Sales on the marketplace are connected to the centralized catalogs. Sellers can post items for sale directly from the catalog and buyers can view information about a collectible on the item's page.

== Statistics ==
The site reports it caters for collectors from 113&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colnect.com/en/collectors/countries|title=Collectors : Countries List  [Collectibles: All]|work=colnect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries. Hundreds of them are helping the site voluntarily, including the translators who translate Colnect into 62 languages.

As of 2018 Colnect lists 435 Chinese transportation tickets, which are issued by 147 different Chinese companies.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Money Matters (The [[British Museum]]) - [https://chinesemoneymatters.wordpress.com/2018/06/27/49-chinese-transportation-tokens-and-tickets/ 49.

Within the field of [[social evolution]], '''Hamiltonian spite''' is a term for behaviours occurring among conspecifics that have a cost for the actor and a negative impact upon the recipient.

==Theories on altruism and spitefulness==

[[W. D. Hamilton]] published an influential paper on [[altruism]] in 1964 to explain why genetic kin tend to help each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. Part  I and II. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7: 1–16 and 17–52.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that genetically related individuals are likely to carry the copies of the same [[alleles]]; thus, helping kin may ensure that copies of the actors' alleles pass onto next generations of both the recipient and the actor.

While this became a widely accepted idea, it was less noted that Hamilton published a later paper that modified this view.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1970. Selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model. Nature 228: 1218–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper argues that by measuring the genetic relatedness between any two (randomly chosen) individuals of a population several times, we can identify an average level of relatedness. Theoretical models predict that (1) it is adaptive for an individual to be altruistic to any other individuals that are more closely related to it than this average level, and also that (2) it is adaptive for an individual to be spiteful against any other individuals that are less closely related to it than this average level. The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself. Hamilton mentioned birds and fishes exhibiting [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] (more specifically: ovicide) as examples for such behaviours.

Briefly, an individual can increase the chance of its genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations either by helping those that are more closely related, or by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery WL, Brown JS, FitzGerald GJ 2003. Spite: altruism’s evil twin. Oikos, 102, 413–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster KR, Wenseleers T, Ratnieks FLW 2001. Spite: Hamilton’s unproven theory. Annales Zoologici Fennici 38: 229–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubts about the adaptive nature of spiteful behaviour==

Though altruism and spitefulness appear to be two sides of the same coin, the latter is less accepted among evolutionary biologists.

First, unlike the case with the beneficiary of an altruistic act, targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge: bites will provoke bites. Thus harming non-kin may be more costly than helping kins.

Second, presuming a [[Panmixia|panmictic population]], the vast majority of pairs of individuals exhibit a roughly average level of relatedness. For a given individual, the majority of others are not worth helping or harming. While it is easy to identify the few most closely related ones (see: [[kin recognition]]), it is hard to identify the most genetically distant ones.

Most terrestrial [[vertebrates]] exhibit a certain degree of site fidelity, so levels of kinship tend to correlate negatively with spatial distance. While this may provide some cues to identify the least related individuals, it may also ensure that non-kin rarely if ever meet each other.

==Spiteful behaviour in animals==
===Infanticide===

Many animal species exhibit infanticide, i.e. adults tend to kill the eggs or the offspring of conspecifics, even if they do not feed on them (in the absence of [[cannibalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;van Schaik CP, Janson CH (eds.) 2000. Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of spitefulness is relatively free from the threat of revenge – provided that the parents and relatives of the target are either weak or far away. Infanticide may not be a form of spite as in many cases the loss of offspring to the female brings it back into estrous providing a mating advantage to an infanticidal male. This is seen in lions. &lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik, C. P., &amp; Janson, C. H. (Eds.). (2000). Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Meles meles MHNT.jpg|thumb|210px|When infected by tuberculosis, badgers emigrate from their natal group.]]

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

An individual carrying a long-lasting infection of virulent pathogens may benefit from (1) channelling the flow of pathogens from its own body away from its kin and (2) directing them toward non-kin conspecifics. The adaptive nature of this behaviour has been supported by the analysis of theoretical models &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/transmission.pdf Rózsa L 1999. Influencing random transmission is a neutral character in hosts. Journal of Parasitology, 85, 1032–35.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~fadionisio/Selfish_and_Spiteful_behaviour_parasites_pathogens2007.pdf Dionisio F 2007. Selfish and spiteful behaviour through parasites and pathogens. Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9: 1199-1210]&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the analyses of the behavioural repertoire of different animal species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/spite.pdf Rózsa L 2000. Spite, xenophobia, and collaboration between hosts and parasites. Oikos 91: 396–400.]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[tuberculosis]]-infected [[European badger]]s and [[rabies]]-infected [[dog]]s equally tend to emigrate from their natal ranges before starting to distribute the pathogens. Similarly, wild herds of [[Asian elephants]] tend to defecate into drinkwater holes apparently to keep rival herds away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct102005/1184.pdf Jog M, Watve M 2005. Role of parasites and commensals in shaping host behaviour. Current Science 89: 1184–91]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lüen Kindermord.jpg|thumb|330px|Wartime infanticide is a characteristic aspect of human aggression.]]

==Spiteful behaviour in humans==
===Wartime infanticide===

Throughout human history, [[war]] often emerges as a costly form of aggression typically targeting the non-kin enemy. Naturally, most wars appear to be motivated by potential benefits other than the genetic. Nevertheless, the widespread occurrence of [[rape]]{{citation needed|reason=Don't the following sentences contradict this?|date=August 2013}} and [[infanticide]] during periods of war indicates Hamiltonian elements as well. Infanticide is a biologically spiteful action in that it costs the killer time and energy, and opens the killer to the threat of revenge, without any direct compensating benefits.{{citation needed|reason=While such a behavior *may* be spiteful, it does not match the definition of Hamiltonian spite we give|date=August 2013}} Rape, by contrast, is not, in the strict definition of the word, biologically spiteful as it is likely to have a direct fitness increase on the rapist (by increasing his number of direct descendants in the next generation, should the victim fall pregnant).

===Economy===

It was recently suggested that spiteful motivations may also play a role in economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Boari M 2007. The ethics of rationality. Elucidations in the theoretical foundations of economics by relation to ethics. In: Vranceanu R, Djelic M-L, editors. Moral foundations of management knowledge. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publications; p. 107–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

{{See also|McNeill's law}}

Moreover, another paper argues that the motivation for biological aggression – i.e. using pathogens as weapons – is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/motivation.pdf Rózsa L 2009. The motivation for biological aggression is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire. Medical Hypotheses 72: 217–19.]&lt;/ref&gt; This argument contradicts the widespread belief that biological weapons are rare and aberrant tools of warfare and it is supported by the following observations:
* the use of pathogen weapons predates the scientific understanding of infections and epidemics;
* attempts of biological aggression are easy to hide and to overlook, thus it appears to be underrepresented in written history;
* it is a frequent component of our expectations concerning the likely behaviour of an enemy;
* it is also a frequent component of threats (see e.g. ''white powder letters'');
* several languages appear to bear linguistic references to our motivation for biological aggression in profanity.
* given that wartime epidemics tend to kill people at a rate exceeding (or at least comparable to) that of traditional weapons, all wars fought in recorded history incorporated an implicit element of aggression by biological means.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">'''Hillel Cohen-Bar''' (born in Jerusalem, 5 October 1961) is an [[Israel]]i scholar who studies and writes about Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine/Israel. He is an associated professor at the Department of Islam and Middle East Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the head of the Cherrick Center for the Study of Zionism and the State of Israel at that university.

Cohen is especially familiar with [[east Jerusalem]], the topic of his book, ''Kikar Hashuk Reka'' (The Marketplace is Empty or: The Rise and Fall of Arab Jeruslaem), because of  the years he spent as a correspondent for east Jerusalem affairs for the Israeli weekly ''[[Kol Ha'ir]]''. He published extensively on the Palestinian internal refugees and on the 1948 war. Two of his books deal with Palestinian collaborators and the Israeli security agencies, using methodology that can be described as history-from-below. The [[Jerusalem Post]] calls his books "an accessible mixture of academic research and vivid journalistic reporting. Cohen manages to show empathy when relating human issues, but maintains a professional distance regarding events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reluctant Residents|author=Cidor, Peggy|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2007-10-10|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257269870&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|accessdate=2008-10-31}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first became known in other countries in 2008 when his book ''[[Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917-1948]]'' was published with the University of California Press. His book ''Good Arabs: The Israeli Security Services and the Israeli Arabs'' was published with the same press. His latest book ''[[Year Zero of the Arab-Israeli Conflict]]'' was published by Brandeis University Press, 2015.

{{Book of Mormon}}
Many members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] claim '''historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon'''. Most, but not all, Mormons hold the book's connection to ancient American history as an article of their faith. This view finds little acceptance outside of Mormonism.&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duffy|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that the Book of Mormon is an ancient American history has no academic and scientific credibility.&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004 37"/&gt; Mormon [[Apologetics|apologists]] have proposed multiple theories to explain apparent inconsistencies with the archaeological, genetic, linguistic and other records.

==Contents of the book==
The Book of Mormon gives an account of two civilizations formed by families who migrated to the [[Americas]]. One group of families came from Jerusalem in 600 BC and afterward separated into two nations, known as the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s. Another group came much earlier, when God confounded the tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]; that group is known as the [[Jaredite]]s. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites. Latter Day Saints claim that these Lamanites are among the ancestors of the Native Americans.

==Latter Day Saint views==
The dominant and widely accepted view among Latter Day Saints is that the Book of Mormon is a true and accurate account of these ancient American civilizations whose religious history it documents. [[Joseph Smith]], whom most Latter Day Saints believe to have translated the work, stated, "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."&lt;ref name="LDS BoM Intro"&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction Introduction], [[Book of Mormon]], LDS Church (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Unresolved issues of the book's historicity and the lack of supporting archaeological evidence have led some adherents to adopt the position that the Book of Mormon may have been the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Grant H.

==Archaeology==
{{Main|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon}}
Discussion regarding the historicity of the Book of Mormon often focuses on [[archaeology|archaeological]] issues, some of which relate to the large size and the long time span of the civilizations mentioned in the book. A contemporary Mormon view is that these civilizations rose and fell in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{citation |title= Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands |first= Joseph L. |last= Allen |year= 2003 |place= American Fork, Utah |publisher= [[Covenant Communications]] |isbn= 1591562724 |oclc= 54031905 |page= }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations of their magnitude and duration would be expected to leave extensive archaeological records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240600963528|title=Crusading against straw men: an alternative view of alternative archaeologies: response to Holtorf (2005)|first1=Garrett G.|last1=Fagan|first2=Kenneth L.|last2=Feder|date=1 December 2006|publisher=|journal=World Archaeology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=718–729|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/00438240600963528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Mesoamerican civilizations did exist in the time period covered by the Book of Mormon, including the [[Olmec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]].

Adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement give varied responses to these criticisms.

===LDS-funded archaeology===
In 1955, Thomas Ferguson, a Latter Day Saint and the founder of the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), with five years of funding from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon cities would be found within ten years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote to Ferguson questioning the progress made, given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found.&lt;ref name= "Larson 1990"&gt;{{citation |first= Stan |last= Larson |title= The Odyssey of Thomas Stuart Ferguson |journal= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |date= Spring 1990 |pages= 76, 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Replying to Hougey as well as secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated June 5, 1972: "Ten years have passed . ... I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon cities would be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation."&lt;ref name= "Larson 1990"/&gt;

During the period of 1959–61, NWAF colleague Dee Green was editor of the ''BYU Archaeological Society Newsletter'' and had an article from it published in the summer of 1969 edition of ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', pp 76–78 in which he acknowledged that the NWAF findings did not back up the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. After this article and another six years of fruitless search, Ferguson published a 29-page paper in 1975 entitled, "Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography: Response of Thomas S. Ferguson to the Norman &amp; Sorenson Papers" in which he concluded, "I'm afraid that up to this point, I must agree with Dee Green, who has told us that to date there is no Book-of-Mormon geography".&lt;ref&gt;"Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography: Response of Thomas S. Ferguson to the Norman &amp; Sorenson Papers", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a 1976 letter in which he stated: "The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology. I should say—what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book."&lt;ref name= "Larson 1990"/&gt;

The archaeological investigations of NWAF-sponsored projects have contributed towards the documentation and understanding of pre-Columbian societies, particularly in Mesoamerica. Currently, BYU maintains 86 documents on the work of the NWAF at the BYU NWAF website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/spc/nwaf/ BYU NWAF website]&lt;/ref&gt; and these documents are used outside both BYU and the LDS Church by researchers.

==Linguistics==
{{Main|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon}}
An additional criticism of the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon concerns linguistics. According to the text, the Nephites and the Lamanites initially spoke [[Hebrew]] (600 BC) and might have spoken a modified Semitic language until at least 400 AD, when the Book of Mormon ends.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The non-canonized introductory paragraph to the LDS Church 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon stated that the Lamanites were the "principal ancestors of the American Indians".&lt;ref name = principal/&gt; No Semitic language is spoken natively in the Americas today, however, and there is no evidence that any Native American language has been influenced by any Semitic language at any point in its history. Historical linguists who specialize in the languages of Native America are in agreement that the languages of Native America cannot be proven to be related to each other within the last eight to ten thousand years, let alone within the last thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell. 1997. ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America''. Oxford University Press.; Ives Goddard. 1996. "Introduction," ''Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17, Languages''. Ed. Ives Goddard. Washington: Smithsonian Institution; Marianne Mithun. 1999. ''The Languages of Native North America''. [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; A common counterargument is that the Book of Mormon mentions contact with other civilizations&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|24|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that might have had their own non-Semitic languages that influenced or supplanted any Semitic language being spoken. Apologists{{which|date=August 2013}} point out that the introduction merely stated that the peoples mentioned in the Book of Mormon are the primary ancestors of the Native Americans; it did not claim that they are the sole ancestors.&lt;ref name="principal"&gt;The original 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon does not make this claim. In 2007, the introduction to the Book of Mormon was changed to state that the Lamanites are "among the ancestors of the American Indians." The 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon states that the Lamanites are "the principal ancestors of American Indians."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthon Transcript==
{{Main|Anthon Transcript}}

The "[[Anthon Transcript]]" (also known as the "Caractors" document) is a small piece of paper on which Joseph Smith wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, these characters were from the [[golden plates]] (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the Book of Mormon) and represent the [[reformed Egyptian]] writing that was on the plates. This paper was then delivered to professor [[Charles Anthon]], a well-known classical scholar of [[Columbia College, Columbia University]], for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates.&lt;ref name="JS-H"&gt;{{cite book |title=''Joseph Smith–History'' |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Smith |coauthors= |year= |publisher=[[LDS Church]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1/64-65 |accessdate=2009-11-29}} See also: [[Joseph Smith–History]].&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, and Anthon himself, claim that Anthon believed any idea of reformed Egyptian was a hoax all along and that Harris was being duped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Chapter XVIII |chapterurl= https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/269/mode/1up |title= [[Mormonism Unvailed]] |author= [[Eber D.

Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Knopf, 2005), 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthon's own accounts differ, however: in his first he states that he refused to give his opinion at all; in the second he declares that he gave his opinion "without any hesitation" with intent to expose the transcript as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling|last=Bushman|first=Richard|publisher=Knopf|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-4270-4|location=|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population genetics==
{{Main|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
The Book of Mormon tells of the [[Jaredite|people of Jared]], consisting of several families from the [[Tower of Babel]], who migrated to America from the Old World before Abraham's time; a group including Lehi's family&lt;!--Ishmael's family, Zoram, and possibly others--&gt; who migrated to America from Jerusalem around 600 BC; and another group (the [[Mulekite|people of Mulek]]) who migrated to America from Jerusalem about eight years later. Although the Book of Mormon makes no overt assertions regarding the migration or non-migration of other groups to America, an introductory paragraph added to the 1981 edition identifies the Lamanites as the "principal ancestors of the American Indians."&lt;ref name = principal/&gt; In 2007, this statement was changed to "among the ancestors".&lt;ref name="LDS BoM Intro"/&gt;

North American Indians are generally considered the genetic descendants of East Eurasian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of North American Indians, D. Andrew Merriwether, "Mitochondrial DNA," pages 817–30&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have published works that suggest that current studies of genetic anthropology using DNA evidence do not provide support for the Book of Mormon. To date there have been no DNA studies that link any Native American group with West Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;One of the more vocal challengers to the DNA vs. The Book of Mormon issue is [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1933243 Dr. Thomas W. Murphy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Southerton|2004|p= }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mormon researchers claim that it is not valid to use genetics to attempt to prove or disprove the historicity of the Book of Mormon, citing a lack of source genes and the improbability of tracing Israelite DNA even if present.&lt;ref&gt;Geneticists have noted the difficulties in using genetics in this area for a variety of reasons. Some of these are our lack of knowledge concerning Sariah's descent (or others' in Lehi's party), have access to DNA from this period (600 BC Israel), or know what other groups would have intermarried with these groups (or in what numbers).

==Smithsonian Institution statement on the Book of Mormon==
The [[Smithsonian Institution]] issues a standard reply to requests for their opinion regarding the Book of Mormon as an archaeological or scientific guide.&lt;ref name="missingauthor"/&gt; Prior to 1998, the statement denied any evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Old and New Worlds: "Certainly there was no contact with the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews or other peoples of Western Asia or the Near East." In 1998, the Smithsonian began issuing a shorter letter without the detailed response found in the first letter, and limited its comment to briefly deny any use of the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide by the institution. Some Mormons believe that this was in part due to a critique&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John L. |last= Sorenson |authorlink= John L.

==Limited geography model==
[[File:Book of Mormon Lands and Sites2.jpg|right|550px|thumb|Map showing the possible lands and sites of the Book of Mormon in Mesoamerica]]
{{See also|Limited geography model (Book of Mormon)}}
Since the time of its publication, most Latter Day Saints have viewed and explained the Book of Mormon as a comprehensive history of all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mauss|2003|p= }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this understanding of the Book of Mormon is referred to as the "hemispheric model." Other Latter Day Saints, however, believe that the hemispheric model is an assumption not supported by a close reading of the text. [[B. H. Roberts]] states the inadequacy of the hemispheric model in ''Studies of the Book of Mormon'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[C]ould the people of Mulek and of Lehi ... part of the time numbering and occupying the land at least from Yucatan to Cumorah ... live and move and have their being in the land of America and not come in contact with other races and tribes of men, if such existed in the New World within Book of Mormon times? To make this seem possible the area occupied by the Nephites and Lamanites would have to be extremely limited, much more limited, I fear, than the Book of Mormon would admit our assuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1985|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon have not been identified. Several groups of Mormon scholars and apologists, including the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have proposed that the city [[Zarahemla]] is located somewhere within Central America because of the description given in {{lds|Alma|alma|22|27}} as a narrow neck of land bordering sea on the west and on the east. This approach, often referred to as the "[[Limited Geography Model (Book of Mormon)|Limited Geography Model]]," argues for a more limited view of the Book of Mormon, suggesting that the book is a history of only a small group of Native Americans in Central America. This theory has been gaining substantial support among LDS scholars since the mid-1980s because it more accurately represents the descriptions given within the text itself. For instance, the populations and civilizations described in the Book of Mormon were likely too small (only a few million) to fill entire continents; moreover, there is much evidence that one common assumption of the past—that Book of Mormon civilizations were alone in America—is probably incorrect. Most LDS authors hold the belief that the Book of Mormon events took place within a limited region in Mesoamerica, and that others were present on the continent at the time of Lehi's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This geographical and population model was formally published in an official church magazine, ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', in a two-part series by [[John L. Sorenson]] published in September and October 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sorenson |first= John L |authorlink= John L.

== Other defenses of historicity ==
The Gospel Topics essays section of the LDS official website hosts two essays entitled "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies"]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Book of Mormon Translation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng "Book of Mormon Translation."]&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the few official Church statements with regard to such historical issues.

Mrnavić believed that the [[Illyrians]] were Slavs.&lt;ref name=Fine-421/&gt;
He claimed that [[Skanderbeg]], the national hero of [[Albania]], was of Slav origin, which prompted [[Frang Bardhi]] to write a biography on Skanderbeg published in Venice in 1636&lt;ref&gt;Georgius Castriotus Epirensis, vulgo Scanderbegh.

'''Janko Pleterski''' (1 February 1923 – 8 June 2018)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/poslovil-se-je-janko-pleterski-59110.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Slovenia]]n [[historian]], [[politician]] and [[diplomat]].

He was born in [[Maribor]], Slovenia, then part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. He attended high school in [[Ljubljana]]. In August 1941, he was arrested by the [[Fascist]] authorities of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italian]]-occupied [[Province of Ljubljana]] and imprisoned in [[Alessandria]], [[Italy]]. After the [[Italian armistice]] in September 1943, he returned to Ljubljana. In July 1944, he joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan resistance]]. After the end of [[World War II]], he worked at the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] foreign ministry in [[Belgrade]] as an expert on border issues with Italy and [[Austria]]. In 1953, he became a researcher at the [[Institute for Ethnic Studies]] in Ljubljana. In 1963, he obtained a PhD in modern history at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. Between 1970 and 1982, he taught modern political history of [[Slovenes]] and [[South Slavs]] at the same university. Between 1988 and 1990, he was member of the Presidential Council of the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], as part of the reformist circle of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] around [[Milan Kučan]] and [[Janez Stanovnik]] who negotiated with the [[DEMOS coalition|opposition]] a gradual democratisation of Slovenia. In 1989, he became a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Pleterski wrote extensively on the Slovene history of late 19th and early 20th century, with an emphasis on the history of [[Carinthian Slovenes]], and on the relations between Slovenes and other Yugoslav peoples.

He was the father of the historian and archeologist [[Andrej Pleterski]].

==Change of era==
* '''1460''' {{nihongo|''Kanshō gannen''|寛正元年}}: The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The old era ended and a new one commenced in ''Chōroku'' 4.

&lt;!-- Do these paragraphs belong in this article? 
Until former-[[Emperor Go-Komatsu]] died in 1433, Go-Hanazono held only  a title.  Although he may have been identified as the formal head of the [[dairi|Daïri]] or the Imperial "government", the fact-of-the-matter was that any real authority in the court was wielded by his "retired" uncle.  During these years, Go-Komatsu exercised indirect powers in a  uniquely Japanese a practice known as [[cloistered rule]].  After Komatsu's death, Go-Hanazono enjoyed 30 years of direct imperial rule; and after he did step down from the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], Go-Hanozano intended that the conventional pattern of indirect government by cloistered emperors would be resumed.
After Go-Hanazono gave up the throne, there were no further abdications until 1586 (''Tenshō 14''), when [[Emperor Ōgimachi]] gave over the reins of government to a grandson who would come to be known as [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]].  The dearth of abdications is attributable to the disturbed state of the country and to the fact that there was neither any dwelling in which an ex-emperor could live nor any excess funds in the treasury to support him.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869'', pp. 340-341.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this instance, the former emperor lived another seven years after he descended from the throne.  At age 52, Go-Hanazono died on January 18, 1471 (''[[Bunmei]] 3, 12th month'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA356,M1  p. 356.]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''Kristian Sophus August Erslev''' (December 28, 1852, [[Copenhagen]] – June 20, 1930, [[Frederiksberg]]) was a Danish [[historian]]. His work involved a variety of subjects, including [[historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Tandrup: “Ravn”, Bind 1 &amp; II, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Erslev's influence on the Danish academic community was great and he was considered "the master" Danish historian. As editor of the Danish ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' he also set the standards for solid, factual historical writing. He looked to other European scientists for inspiration, but never fully solved the problems of objectivity and the influence of "the person behind the pen".&lt;!-- This link isn't dead, but the site isn't working&lt;ref&gt;http://historikeren.com/kristianerslev.htm&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; He was openly attacked by later generations of Danish historians for his strong belief in "the truth".&lt;ref&gt; Inga Floto: "Problematiseringen af objektiviteten - Historieskrivningen og den dokumentariske roman", Historisk Tidsskrift, bind 78, 113-37, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Erslev was inspired in his early days by the idea that historians should strive to create "true science". However, in his older days he became disillusioned by his previous ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jan N.H. Jensen - Kr. Erslev og objektivitetsproblemet i begyndelsen af det 20. århundrede&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">A '''landscape zodiac''' (or '''terrestrial zodiac''') is a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape, such as roads, streams and field boundaries. Perhaps the best known alleged example is the Glastonbury [[Temple of the Stars]], situated around [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], England. The temple is thought by some to depict a colossal [[zodiac]].

==Theory==
The theory was first put forward in 1935 by [[Katherine Maltwood]], an artist who "discovered" the zodiac in a vision, and held that the "temple" was created by [[Sumer]]ians about 2700 BC. Interest was re-ignited in 1969 by Mary Caine in an article in the magazine ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]''.

The landscape zodiac plays an important role in many [[occult]] theories. It has been associated with the Celtic Saints, [[Grail]] legend and [[King Arthur]] (according to some legends buried in Glastonbury).

==Criticism==
The idea was examined by two independent studies, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 &lt;ref&gt;Ian Burrow, Somerset's Planning Department staff archeologist, concluded that "while the outlines of the effigies may be plotted today, their antiquity is illusory" [http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in 1983 by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Liz Bellamy, ''Ley Lines In Question'', pages 162-168. (Tadworth, UK: World's Work, 1983). {{ISBN|0-437-19205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the standard methods of landscape historical research.  Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea.  The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors.  The Cancer boat (not a crab as would be expected) is made up of a network of eighteenth century drainage ditches and paths.  There are some [[Neolithic]] paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the "temple" in any form, from conventional archaeologists or mainstream historians.

==List of landscape zodiacs==
Beside the Glastonbury arrangement further zodiacs have been alleged in Britain in following years including:

*[[Kingston upon Thames]] Zodiac
*The Lizard Zodiac, [[Cornwall]]
*Bodmin Moor Zodiac
*The [[Pumpsaint]] Zodiac
*[[Nuthampstead]] Terrestrial Zodiac
*The [[Sheffield]] Zodiac, [[South Yorkshire]]

There is rarely a strong scientific case for these discoveries. Their nebulous existence is in many ways similar to [[urban myths]], [[ufology]], or [[ley lines]]. They seem to play a part in personal belief systems, possibly as fictional devices; for example "The Brighton Zodiac" - created by Sally Hurst, based on the streets of that town - features as a plot device in [[Robert Rankin]]'s novel "[[The Brightonomicon]]". [[Mark Valentine]] has compiled a checklist of 'The Literature of Terrestrial Zodiacs in Britain' in 'The Network of Ley Hunters' Newsletter'(&lt;ref&gt;http://wormwoodiana.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/the-literature-of-terrestrial-zodiacs.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Landscape zodiacs and psychogeography==
In the walks around the M25 motorway documented in psychogeographer [[Iain Sinclair]]'s 2003 novel ''London Orbital'', the walkers trace the mythical Kingston upon Thames Zodiac.&lt;ref name="Sinclair "&gt;Iain Sinclair, ''London Orbital '' (Penguin Books, London, 2005), {{ISBN|0-14-101474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11854">'''Mateus Soares de Azevedo''' (born 1959) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[History of religions|historian of religions]], Islamologist, and esoterismologist, who has written several books on the [[Perennial Philosophy]] and the comparative study of religions, specially Christian and Islamic mysticisms. He is one of the best known writers on the [[Perennial philosophy]] in the Portuguese language. His most recent book in English is ''Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought'' (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), which won in the "Comparative Religion" category of The USA "Best Books 2011" Awards. He has translated into Portuguese, from the original French, several of the books of the perennialist master [[Frithjof Schuon]] (1907–1998).

== Biography ==

Soares de Azevedo was born in the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]] state, in a family with roots in the historical city of [[Ouro Preto]], where he lived his childhood. His family ancestors include Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, Minister of Justice and of Finance in the Empire, and governor of the province of Minas Gerais, and [[Diogo de Vasconcelos]], renowned historian and politician, author of ''História Média de Minas Gerais''. In [[São Paulo]], he attended gymnasium and high school at Colégio Santa Cruz, of French Canadian priests, and graduated in Literature and Journalism at the University of São Paulo (USP). He has a graduate degree in [[international relations]] from [[George Washington University]] and holds a master's degree in [[History of religions]] from the [[University of São Paulo]], with a thesis on the contemporary relevance of the [[Perennial Philosophy]].

He is the author of seven books on the philosophical and mystical dimensions of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], and about one hundred articles and essays dealing with the Perennial Philosophy and traditional spirituality in the contemporary world, several of them translated into English, French, and Spanish.

His most recent book in English is ''Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought'' (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), a critique both of religious and anti-religious fundamentalism; the later represented specially by polemicists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. This book is the winner in the "Comparative Religion" category of The USA "Best Books 2011" Awards. It is also the ForeWord Book of the Year Award Finalist for "Religion", and Midwest Book Award Silver Medal for "Current Events".

In Portuguese, his latest work is ''O Livro dos Mestres'' (The Book of Masters. São Paulo: Ibrasa, 2016), which is composed of outlines of the messages of around twenty spiritual masters of recent times, from diverse religious traditions.

Another relatively recent book by Soares de Azevedo is ''Occultism and Religion in Freud, Jung, and Mircea Eliade'', co-authored with the Australian author and professor [[Harry Oldmeadow]].&lt;ref&gt;Published in São Paulo, Brazil, by Ibrasa, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived a year in [[London]], England, in the 1980s, where he experienced the intellectual impact of the work of French metaphysician [[René Guénon]], which expounds a profound critique of modern materialism and relativism from a purely metaphysical perspective. In the 1990s, he lived a season in Washington, DC, and  studied under [[William Stoddart]], Rama Coomaraswamy, and Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]]. There he deepened the study of the Perennial Philosophy and experienced the spiritual impact of the teachings of the German metaphysician and esoterist [[Frithjof Schuon]]. For Azevedo,&lt;ref&gt;See in this respect his "Men of a Single Book" (World Wisdom Books, 2010), especially the introduction and chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; the Perennial Philosophy casts a unique and contemporary light on the spiritual heritage of the peoples and updates the message of the traditional religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, giving to twenty-first century man a practical alternative to modern skepticism and intellectual confusion.

It is noteworthy to grasp that the precursors of the Perennial Philosophy are sapiential masters such as [[Plato]], Pythagoras, Shankara, and [[Meister Eckhart]], and that the foundations of this school of thought are in pure Metaphysics, or in the "nature of things", not in one of the great Revelations, notwithstanding the fact that the Perennial Philosophy prescribes the need for  personal attachment to one of the orthodox religious forms.

Azevedo absorbed elements both from Guénon and Schuon, as well as from William Stoddart,  in his works, such as ''Men of a Single Book'' and ''Iniciación al Islam y al Sufism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Iniciación al Islam y al Sufism", Barcelona, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the editor of two anthologies published in the United States. The first is ''Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity And The Perennial Philosophy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Books/ItemDetail.asp?ProductID=132 Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity and The Perennial Philosophy] catalog information at the publisher's website.&lt;/ref&gt; featuring works by [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[René Guénon]], [[Titus Burckhardt]] and other perennialists. The second is ''Remembering in a World of Forgetting: Thoughts on Tradition and Postmodernism'', a collection of the most important essays by the British perennialist author [[William Stoddart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Books/ItemDetail.asp?ProductID=183 Remembering in a World of Forgetting: Thoughts on Tradition and Postmodernism] at the publisher's website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notker the Stammerer''' ({{lang-la|Notcerus Balbulus}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantica.be/la/comment/sqvenisanctespiritus.html Cantica Chorus Gregorianus]&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa}} 840 – 6 April 912 AD), also called '''Notker I''', '''Notker the Poet''' or '''Notker of Saint Gall''', was a musician, author, poet, and [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] at the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]], now in [[Switzerland]]. He is commonly accepted to be the "Monk of Saint Gall" (''Monachus Sangallensis'') who wrote ''Gesta Karoli'', (the "deeds of [[Charlemagne]]").&lt;ref&gt;Derek Wilson, ''Charlemagne: A Biography'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Notker was born around 840, to a distinguished family. He would seem to have been born at [[Jonschwil]] on the River [[Thur River (Switzerland)|Thur]], south of [[Wil]], in what would become much later (in 1803) the canton of Saint Gall in Switzerland; some sources claim [[Elgg]] to be his place of birth. He studied with [[Tuotilo]] at Saint Gall's monastic school, and was taught by {{Interlanguage link multi|Iso of St. Gallen|de|3=Iso von St. Gallen}}, and the Irishman, Moengall. He became a monk there and is mentioned as librarian in 890 and as master of guests in 892–4. He was chiefly active as a teacher, and displayed refinement of taste as poet and author.&lt;ref name=Kampers&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11125b.htm Kampers, Franz, and Klemens Löffler. "Notker." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ekkehard IV]], the biographer of the monks of Saint Gall, lauds him as "delicate of body but not of mind, [[stuttering]] of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine, a vessel of the Holy Spirit without equal in his time".&lt;ref name=Kampers/&gt; He died in 912. He was [[beatification|beatified]] in 1512.

==Works==
He completed Erchanbert's chronicle, arranged a [[martyrology]], composed a metrical biography of [[Saint Gall]], and authored other works.&lt;ref name=Kampers/&gt;

In his martyrology, he appeared to corroborate one of [[St Columba]]'s miracles. [[St Columba]], being an important father of Irish monasticism, was also important to [[St Gall]] and thus to Notker's own monastery. [[Adomnan of Iona]] had written that at one point Columba had through clairvoyance seen a city in Italy near Rome being destroyed by fiery sulphur as a divine punishment and that three thousand people had perished. And shortly after Columba saw this, sailors from Gaul arrived to tell the news of it. Notker claimed in his martyrology that this event happened and that an earthquake had destroyed a city which was called 'new'. It is unclear what this city was that Notker was claiming, although some thought it may have been Naples (previously called 'Neapolis' - new city). However Naples was destroyed by a volcano in 512 before Columba was born, and not during Columba's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''[[Liber Hymnorum]]'', created between 881 and 887, is an early collection of ''[[sequence (poetry)|Sequences]]'', which he called "[[hymn]]s", mnemonic poems for remembering the series of pitches sung during a [[melisma]] in [[plainchant]], especially in the [[Alleluia]]. It is unknown how many or which of the works contained in the collection are his. The hymn ''[[Media Vita]]'', was erroneously attributed to him late in the [[Middle Ages]].

[[Ekkehard IV]] wrote of fifty sequences composed by Notker. He was formerly considered to have been the inventor of the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]], a new species of religious lyric, but this is now considered doubtful, though he did introduce the genre into Germany. It had been the custom to prolong the [[Alleluia]] in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] before the [[Gospel]], modulating through a skillfully harmonized series of tones. Notker learned how to fit the separate syllables of a [[Latin]] text to the tones of this jubilation; this poem was called the sequence (q.v.), formerly called the "jubilation". (The reason for this name is uncertain.) From 881–7 Notker dedicated a collection of such verses to Bishop [[Liutward of Vercelli]], but it is not known which or how many are his.

==The Monk of Saint Gall==
[[File:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|Notker Balbulus, from a medieval manuscript]]

The "Monk of Saint Gall" (Latin: ''Monachus Sangallensis''; the name is not contemporary, being given by modern scholars), the ninth-century writer of a volume of didactic eulogistic anecdotes regarding the Emperor Charlemagne, is now commonly believed to be Notker the Stammerer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/stgall-charlemagne.asp "The Monk of Saint Gall", Medieval Sourcebook, Fordham University]&lt;/ref&gt; This monk is known from his work to have been a native German-speaker, deriving from the [[Thurgau]], only a few miles from the Abbey of Saint Gall; the region is also close to where Notker is believed to have derived from. The monk himself relates that he was raised by Adalbert, a former soldier who had fought against the [[Saxons]], the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] ("Huns" in his text) and the Slavs under the command of Kerold, brother of [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]], Charlemagne's second wife; he was also a friend of Adalbert's son, Werinbert, another monk at Saint Gall, who died as the book was in progress.&lt;ref&gt;i, Postscript.&lt;/ref&gt; His teacher was {{Interlanguage link multi|Grimald von Weißenburg|de}}, the Abbot of Saint Gall from 841 to 872, who was, the monk claims, himself a pupil of [[Alcuin]].

The monk's untitled work, referred to by modern scholars as ''De Carolo Magno'' ("Concerning Charles the Great") or ''Gesta Caroli Magni'' ("The Deeds of Charles the Great"), is not a biography but consists instead of two books of anecdotes relating chiefly to the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and his family, whose virtues are insistently invoked. It was written for [[Charles the Fat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Innes|Innes, M.]] (1998) "Memory, orality and literacy in an early medieval society", ''Past and Present'', 158, pp. 3-36.&lt;/ref&gt; great-grandson of Charlemagne, who visited Saint Gall in 883.&lt;ref&gt;The visit is mentioned, i.34.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been scorned by traditional historians, who refer to the Monk as one who "took pleasure in amusing anecdotes and witty tales, but who was ill-informed about the true march of historical events", and describe the work itself as a "mass of legend, saga, invention and reckless blundering":&lt;!--quotes need sources--&gt; historical figures are claimed as living when in fact dead; claims are attributed to false sources (in one instance,&lt;ref&gt;ii.16.&lt;/ref&gt; the Monk claims that "to this King [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] [the Short] the learned [[Bede]] has devoted almost an entire book of his ''Ecclesiastical History''"; no such account exists in Bede's history – unsurprisingly, given that Bede died in 735 during the reign of Charlemagne's grandfather [[Charles Martel]]); and Saint Gall is frequently referenced as a location in anecdotes,&lt;ref&gt;i.12, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of historical verisimilitude ([[Pepin the Hunchback]], for example, is supposed to have been sent to Saint Gall as punishment for his rebellion, and – in a [[trope (literature)|trope]] owed to [[Livy]]'s tale of [[Tall poppy syndrome|Tarquin and the poppies]] – earns a promotion to rich [[Prüm Abbey]] after advising Charlemagne through an implicit parable of hoeing thistles to execute another group of rebels). The Monk also mocks and criticizes bishops and the prideful, high-born incompetent, showy in dress and fastidious and lazy in habits, whilst lauding the wise and skillful government of the Emperor with nods to the deserving poor. Several of the Monk's tales, such as that of the nine rings of the Avar stronghold, have been used in modern biographies of Charlemagne.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Monk of Saint Gall is commonly believed to be Notker the Stammerer: Louis Halphen&lt;ref&gt;Halphen, "Le moine de Saint-Gall", in his ''Études critiques sur l'histoire de Charlemagne'', 1921, ch. 4:139-42.&lt;/ref&gt; has delineated the points of similarity between the two: the Monk claims to be old, toothless and stammerering; and both share similar interests in church music, write with similar idioms, and are fond of quoting [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/eckehard1.html|title=Three Monks of St. Gall |author=Ekkehard of St. Gall|publisher=Fordham.edu|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is dated to the 880s from mentions in it of [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]] (died 880), half-brother of Charles the Fat, the "circumscribed lands" of Carloman's son [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], who succeeded as King of the Germans in 887, and the destruction of [[Prüm Abbey]], which occurred in 882.

'''Petrus Albinus''' (German name: '''Peter von Weiße'''; 1543–1598) was a professor at [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] in Germany and is known as the father of Saxon historiography.

== Life ==
Petrus Albinus was born on 18 June 1543 in [[Schneeberg (Ore Mountains)|Schneeberg]] in the [[Ore Mountains]] of central Europe. His father was Peter Weis, who built the Hospital Church in Schneeberg. He was married to Magdalena Hübsch, daughter of a  ''Ratskämmerer'' and mining entrepreneur, who had moved to Schneeberg from [[Nuremberg]]. In keeping with the common practice of the day he Latinized his name to Petrus Albinus. After attending [[grammar school]] in [[Schneeberg (Ore Mountains)|Schneeberg]] and [[Sächsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Meißen|princely school]] at [[Meissen]], Albinus studied in [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], received his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1553 and worked in [[Lauban]]. In 1559 he moved to the [[Viadrina European University|University of Viadrina]] in [[Frankfurt/Oder]], and in 1564 the [[Leucorea]] in [[Wittenberg]]. He focused mainly on legal and historical research.

[[File:Petrus Albinus Land- und Bergchronica Titel.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Meißnischen Bergk-Chronica'', 1590]]
[[File:Petrus Albinus Land- und Bergchronica Illustration.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''Meißnischen Bergk-Chronica'', 1590]]

In Wittenberg he took over the task of completing the history of [[Upper Saxony]] and the [[House of Wettin]] begun by [[Georg Fabricius]]. For example, in 1579, he indexed the letters and documents of the [[Bishopric of Meissen]]. From 1579 to 1588 he was a [[dean (education)|dean]] of the [[University of Wittenberg]]; in 1586 he took over as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and worked until 1588 in Wittenberg. In 1588, Albinus was called to [[Dresden]] to be appointed as secretary to [[Prince-Elector]] [[Christian I of Saxony|Christian I]] of [[Saxony]], where he took oversight of all the documents of the Saxon royal house.

During his time at Wittenberg, he wrote, in manuscript, a history of his native town of Schneeberg; parts of it were printed as the Chronicle of the Meissen Region and Mountains (''Meißnische Land- und Bergchronik'', 1580–89), but some parts remained unfinished. Other chronicles were left by him as manuscripts in the archives, for example, those of [[Altzella Abbey|Altzelle]] [[Annaberg-Buchholz|Annaberg]], [[Crimmitschau]] and [[Torgau]]. Several volumes of unpublished collections are preserved in the Dresden Library.

Although his research does not meet current scientific standards, his works qualify him as the father of Saxon local history, local history research and historiography. Albinus was married twice. First, in 1576 to Ludmilla Fritsch and, later, in 1584 to Magdalena, a daughter of Samuel Selfisch, with whom he had eight children.

He died on 31 July 1598 in [[Dresden]].

[[File:Matejko Sigismund Augustus and Barbara.jpg|thumb|250px|King of Poland - [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and Queen [[Barbara Radziwiłł]] in Vilnius by [[Jan Matejko]].]]
The '''Polish Golden Age''' refers to the period from the late 15th century [[Jagiellon Poland]] to the death of the last of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellons]], [[Sigismund August]] in 1572. Some historians claim that the Golden Age lasted until the mid-17th century, when in 1648 the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was ravaged by the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish invasion]]. During its Golden Age, the Commonwealth became one of the largest kingdoms of Europe, stretching from modern-day [[Estonia]], to [[Moldavia]] and [[Silesia]]. [[Military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Its army]] was able to defend the realm against numerous [[Teutonic knights]], Turkish, Swedish, Russian, and Tatar invasions. The country prospered thanks to its enormous grain, wood and salt exports.

In the 16th century, the area of the Commonwealth reached almost 1 million km, with a population of 11 million. Its goods were transported to [[Western Europe]] via [[Baltic Sea]] ports of [[Gdańsk]], [[Elbląg]], [[Riga]], [[Klaipėda|Memel]] and [[Königsberg]]. The Commonwealth had several major cities, such as [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]], [[Lviv]], [[Vilnius]], [[Toruń]] and [[Kiev]].

During the Golden Age the Commonwealth was regarded as one of the most powerful European states. It had a unique system of government, known as the [[Golden Liberty]], in which all nobles ([[szlachta]]), regardless of economic status, were considered to have equal legal status and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. One of its features was the [[Liberum veto]], used for the first time in 1653. Nobility, which consisted of both szlachta and [[magnate]]s, made up approximately 8-10% of the population.

In the early 16th century the situation for peasants was relatively good, but they deteriorated over the course of the time. Poverty was widespread, peasants were forced to work for the nobility (see [[serfdom]]), which resulted in them escaping in large numbers to the forests, hills and [[Wild Fields]] in the [[Ukraine]], where they joined the [[Cossacks]].

== Culture of Polish Renaissance ==

=== Literacy, education and patronage of intellectual endeavors ===
[[File:007KrakówCN.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]]]

The Polish printing industry began in [[Kraków]] in 1473, and by the early 17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth: eight in Kraków, the rest mostly in [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]] and [[Zamość]]. The [[Jagiellonian University|Academy of Kraków]] possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools, and in townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the 16th century almost every parish ran a school.

The [[Lubrański Academy]], an institution of higher learning, was established in [[Poznań]] in 1519. [[Protestant Reformation|The Reformation]] resulted in the establishment of a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction was the creation of Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]] in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own.

The university itself experienced a period of prominence at the turn of the 15th/16th century, when especially the mathematics, astronomy and geography faculties attracted numerous students from abroad. Latin, Greek, Hebrew and their literatures were likewise popular. By the mid 16th century the institution entered a crisis stage, and by the early 17th century regressed into Counter-reformational conformism. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a university college in Vilnius, but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy of Kraków were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad.

[[Sigismund I the Old]], who built the presently existing [[Wawel]] Renaissance castle, and his son [[Sigismund II Augustus]], supported intellectual and artistic activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite. Their patronage example was followed by ecclesiastic and lay feudal lords, and by patricians in major towns.

=== Science ===
[[File:De revolutionibus 1617 Astronomia instaurata.png|thumb|upright|''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', the seminal work on the heliocentric theory of Renaissance astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543)]]

Polish science reached its culmination in the first half of the 16th century as the medieval point of view was criticized and more rational explanations were sought. ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', published by [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] in [[Nuremberg]] in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into understanding of the physical universe, dispensing with the Christianity-adopted [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic]] anthropocentric model and setting free the expansion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.

Copernicus, a son of a Toruń trader from Kraków, made many contributions to science and the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, he later studied at Italian universities. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, a political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and he led the defense of [[Olsztyn]] against the forces of [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albrecht Hohenzollern]]. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.

[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]], one of the most important astronomers in history]]

[[Josephus Struthius]] became famous as a physician and medical researcher. [[Bernard Wapowski]] was a pioneer of Polish cartography. [[Maciej Miechowita]], a rector at the Cracow Academy, published in 1517 ''Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis'', a treatise on the geography of the East, an area in which Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise for the rest of Europe.

[[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] was one of the greatest theorists of political thought in [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]]. His most famous work, ''On the Improvement of the Commonwealth'', was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki|Wawrzyniec Goślicki]] (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled ''De optimo senatore'' (''The Counsellor'' in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.

Historian [[Marcin Kromer]] wrote ''De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum'' (On the origin and deeds of Poles) in 1555 and in 1577 ''Polonia'', a treatise highly regarded in Europe. [[Marcin Bielski]]'s ''Chronicle of the Whole World'', a universal history, was written ca. 1550. The chronicle of [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] (1582) covered the history of [[Eastern Europe]].

=== Literature ===
[[File:Jan Kochanowski.png|thumb|left|[[Jan Kochanowski]], Polish Renaissance poet who established poetic patterns that would become integral to the Polish literary language]]

Modern Polish literature begins in the 16th century. At that time the [[Polish language]], common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas of public life, including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church and other official uses, coexisting for a while with Latin. [[Klemens Janicki]], one of the Renaissance Latin language poets, a laureate of a papal distinction, was of peasant origin. Another plebeian author, [[Biernat of Lublin]], wrote his own version of Aesop's fables in Polish, permeated with his socially radical views.

A Literary Polish language breakthrough came under the influence of the Reformation with the writings of [[Mikołaj Rej]]. In his ''Brief Discourse'', a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces.Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend [[Jan Kochanowski]] became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.

[[File:ArrasWawel.jpg|thumb|Tapestry with shield-bearing satyrs and monogram ''SA'' of king Sigismund Augustus, ca. 1555]]

[[Jan Kochanowski|Kochanowski]] was born in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the universities of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled in the village of [[Czarnolas]], a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic ''Frascas'' (trifles),epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy ''The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys'', and the most highly regarded ''[[Threnody|Threnodies]]'' or laments, written after the death of his young daughter. The poet [[Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński]], an intellectually refined master of small forms, bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque artistic periods.

=== Music ===
[[File:Wawel12.jpg|thumb|Wawel Castle]]

Following the European and Italian in particular musical trends, the [[Renaissance music]] was developing in [[Poland]], centered around the royal court patronage and branching from there. [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I]] kept from 1543 a permanent choir at the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel castle]], while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. [[Jan z Lublina|Jan of Lublin]] wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other keyboard instruments. Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were [[Wacław of Szamotuły]], [[Mikołaj Gomółka]], who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and [[Mikołaj Zieleński]], who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School polyphonic style.

=== Architecture, sculpture and painting ===
[[File:2 Kaplica Zygmuntowska (27.XI.2008).JPG|thumb|[[Sigismund's Chapel]]]]

Architecture, sculpture and painting developed also under Italian influence from the beginning of the 16th century. A number of professionals from [[Tuscany, Calgary|Tuscany]] arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. [[Francesco Fiorentino]] had started work on the tomb of [[John I Albert|Jan Olbracht]] in 1502, and then together with [[Bartolommeo Berrecci]] and [[Benedykt from Sandomierz]] rebuilt the royal castle between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built [[Sigismund's Chapel]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]]. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in [[Brzeg]], and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class had gained economic strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residences to make them resemble the [[Wawel Castle]]. [[Kraków Cloth Hall|Kraków's Sukiennice]] and [[Poznań Town Hall|Poznań City]] Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.

Between 1580 and 1600 [[Jan Zamoyski]] commissioned the Venetian architect [[Bernardo Morando]] to build the city of [[Zamość]]. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and [[Mannerism]] aesthetic paradigms. Tombstone sculpture, often inside churches, is richly represented on graves of clergy and lay dignitaries and other wealthy individuals. Jan Maria Padovano and Jan Michałowicz of Urzędów count among the prominent artists.

Painted illuminations in [[Balthasar Behem Codex]] are of exceptional quality, and draw their inspiration largely from Gothic art. [[Stanisław Samostrzelnik]], a monk in the Cistercian monastery in [[Mogilany|Mogiła]] near Kraków, painted miniatures and polychromed wall frescos.

== Jagiellonian dynasty ==
At the end of the 15th century, the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonians]] reigned over vast territories stretching from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea|Black]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The dynasty reigned in several [[Central Europe]]an countries between the 14th and 16th centuries. Members of the dynasty were [[List of Polish monarchs|Kings of Poland]] (1386–1572), [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] (1377–1392 and 1440–1572), [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] (1440–1444 and 1490–1526), and [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Kings of Bohemia]] (1471–1526).

In 1515, during a [[First Congress of Vienna|congress in Vienna]], a dynastic succession arrangement was agreed to between [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], Holy Roman Emperor and the Jagiellon brothers, [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary]] and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]. It was supposed to end the Emperor's support for Poland's enemies, the Teutonic and Russian states, but after the election of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Maximilian's successor in 1519, the relations with Sigismund had worsened.

The Jagiellon rivalry with the [[House of Habsburg]] in central Europe was ultimately resolved to the Habsburgs' advantage. The decisive factor that damaged or weakened the monarchies of the last Jagiellons was the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s Turkish expansion. Hungary's vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the [[Belgrade]] fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland–Lithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the [[Battle of Mohács]], where the young [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II Jagiellon]], son of [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislas II]], was killed. Subsequently, after a period of internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.

== Republic of nobility ==
[[File:Quincunx Polonia.jpg|thumb|Conception of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] of [[Stanisław Orzechowski]], a [[szlachta]] ideologist. In 1564 Orzechowski wrote ''Quincunx'', in which he expounded principles of a state identified with its nobility.]]

By the [[Union of Lublin]] a unified [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (''Rzeczpospolita'') was created in 1569, stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountains]] to present-day [[Belarus]] and western and central [[Ukraine]] (which earlier had been [[Kievan Rus']] principalities). Within the new federation some degree of formal separation of Poland and [[Lithuania]] was retained (distinct state offices, armies, treasuries and judicial systems), but the union became a multinational entity with a common monarch, parliament, monetary system and foreign-military policy, in which only the nobility enjoyed full citizenship rights. Moreover, the nobility's uppermost stratum was about to assume the dominant role in the Commonwealth, as magnate factions were acquiring the ability to manipulate and control the rest of ''szlachta'' to their clique's private advantage. This trend, facilitated further by the liberal settlement and land acquisition consequences of the union, became apparent around the time of the 1572 death of [[Sigismund II Augustus|Sigismund Augustus]], the last monarch of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]].

One of the most salient characteristics of the newly established [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] was its multiethnicity, and accordingly diversity of religious faiths and denominations. Among the peoples represented were [[Poles]] (about 50% or less of the total population), [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]], [[Russia|Rus]]' people (corresponding to today's [[Belarusians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]] or their East Slavic ancestors), [[Germans]], [[Estonians]], [[Jewish community|Jews]], [[Armenian diaspora|Armenians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Czechs]], among others, for example smaller West European groups. As for the main social segments in the early 17th century, nearly 70% of the Commonwealth's population were peasants, over 20% residents of towns, and less than 10% nobles and clergy combined. The total population, estimated at 8–10 millions, kept growing dynamically until the middle of the century. The Slavic populations of the eastern lands, Rus' or [[Ruthenia]], were solidly, except for the Polish colonizing nobility (and Polonized elements of local nobility), Eastern Orthodox, which portended future trouble for the Commonwealth.

[[File:Krasiczync.jpg|thumb|left|Castle in [[Krasiczyn]]]]

The political doctrine of the Commonwealth was: ''our state is a republic under the presidency of the King''. Chancellor [[Jan Zamoyski]] summed up this doctrine when he said that ''Rex regnat et non-gubernat'' ("The King reigns but [''lit.'' 'and'] does not govern").The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a ''Senat'' and an elected king (''Pic. 1''). The king was obliged to respect citizens' rights specified in King [[Henry's Articles]] as well as in ''[[Pacta conventa]]'', negotiated at the time of his [[election]].

The monarch's power was limited in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance). Over time, the [[Henrician Articles]] were merged with the Pacta Conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones).

[[File:Unia polsko-litewska w 1635.png|thumb|[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its maximum extent, after the [[Truce of Deulino]] in 1619, overlaid over modern borders.]]

The foundation of the Commonwealth's political system, the "[[Golden Liberty]]" (Polish: ''Złota Wolność'', a term used from 1573 on), included:
* [[Election|election of the king]] by all nobles wishing to participate, known as ''wolna elekcja'' ([[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]);
* [[Sejm]], the Commonwealth parliament which the king was required to hold every two years;
* ''[[Pacta conventa]]'' (Latin), "agreed-to agreements" negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier Henrician Articles.
* ''[[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]]'' guaranteed by [[Warsaw Confederation|Warsaw Confederation Act]] 1573
* ''[[rokosz]]'' (insurrection), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms;
* ''[[liberum veto]]'' (Latin), the right of an individual Sejm deputy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a "free veto" nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks;
* ''[[Confederation (Poland)|konfederacja]]'' (from the Latin ''confederatio''), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim.

== Livonian War; struggle for Baltic area domination ==
[[File:Wojciech Gerson - Gdańsk in the XVII century.jpg|thumb|[[Gdańsk]] in 16th century]]

In the 16th century the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became increasingly interested in extending its territorial rule to [[Livonia]], especially to gain control of Baltic seaports, such as [[Riga]], and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]],&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally ruled by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Brothers of the Sword]] knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision course with Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.

Other powers aspiring to the Livonian Baltic access responded by partitioning the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian state]], which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, and soon the Danes and Swedes had occupied other parts of the country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians sought a union with the Polish–Lithuanian state. [[Gotthard Kettler]], the new Grand Master, met in [[Vilnius]] (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish King. The agreement of November 28 called for secularization of the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Brothers of the Sword]] Order and incorporation of the newly established [[Duchy of Livonia]] into the ''Rzeczpospolita'' ("Republic") as an autonomous entity. The Union of Vilnius also created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. [[Sigismund II Augustus|Sigismund II]] obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers. These conflicts led to grueling wars with Russia (1558–1570 and 1577–1582) and other struggles over control of Baltic trade and freedom of navigation.

The Baltic region policies of the last Jagiellon king and his advisors were the most mature of the 16th century Poland's strategic programs. The outcome of the efforts in that area was to a considerable extent successful for the Commonwealth. The Livonian wars came to a conclusion under the reign of King Stephen Báthory.

In 1576, [[Stephen Báthory]] became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania. He turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the [[Battle of Wenden (1578)|Battle of Wenden]]. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult [[siege of Pskov]]. Under the 1582 [[Truce of Yam-Zapolsky|Truce of Jam Zapolski]], which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of [[Estonia/Transnational issues|Estonia]].

== House of Vasa ==
[[John III of Sweden]] married [[Catherine Jagiellon|Catherine Jagellonka]], the sister of Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. When Sigismund II of Poland died without issue, the son of John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagellonka was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania as Sigismund III in 1587. On John's death, Sigismund also gained the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish throne]].

=== Polish-Swedish union ===
[[File:Zygmunt III w stroju koronacyjnym.jpg|thumb|left|200px|'''[[Sigismund III Vasa]]''' (1566 - 1632) was [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], monarch of the united [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from 1587 to 1632, and [[List of Swedish monarchs|King of Sweden]] from 1592 until he was deposed in 1599. He was the son of King [[John III of Sweden]] and his first wife, [[Catherine Jagiellon|Catherine Jagellonica of Poland]]]]

After the death of [[John III of Sweden]], his son [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]] became heir to the throne of [[Sweden]]. Sigismund at that time was already the elected King of Poland (since 1587). Sigismund certainly valued the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish throne]] and upon learning about the death of his father, and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles of Södermanland]], he asked the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) for permission to leave the Commonwealth and go to Sweden, where he could secure the Swedish crown. The Sejm gave him permission, and on 3 August 1593, Sigismund, accompanied by his wife, [[Anne of Austria, Queen of Poland|Anna of Habsburg]], and other followers, departed for Sweden.

The agreement of 19 February seemed to have calmed the situation; Sigismund was crowned in the [[Uppsala Cathedral|Cathedral of Uppsala]] and became the king of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden was now in a personal union with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]]. In July, Sigismund left Sweden in the hands of the regency council and returned to Poland. Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the [[Privy Council of Sweden]] and Sigismund's uncle Duke Charles.

Sigismund, however, reneged on his earlier promises, opening [[Catholic school]]s, and giving Catholics prominent posts. Charles in turn did not give up on acquiring the Swedish throne and pursued his own political agenda. The new [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] he summoned at [[Arboga]] in 1597 – again despite the King's orders – saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, Duke Charles did not achieve support for his military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were successfully taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to Poland to convince Sigismund to take counteractions. Sigismund sent a diplomatic mission, in an attempt to solve the conflict by negotiations. Charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time, trying to confirm his power at another Riksdag (in Arboga), recruiting peasants for his army, and isolating Sigismund's followers.

In 1598, the Sejm gave Sigismund the go-ahead to wage a military campaign against his opponents in Sweden; however it refused to give him significant support. Sigismund's army was composed mostly of mercenaries ([[Germans]] and [[Hungarians]]), supported by a relatively small [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish force]] (although with some artillery).

[[War against Sigismund|Sigismund's campaign]] was poorly planned. He was unable to coordinate his troop movements with his supporters, particularly Fleming who was supposed to attack Charles from [[Finland]]. After initial successes (the taking of [[Kalmar]] and defeating Charles' troops at [[Stegeborg Castle|Stegeborg]]), Sigismund's forces were defeated on September 25, 1598, at the [[Battle of Stångebro]], (also known as the battle of [[Linköping]]). Sigismund was captured and forced to hand over some of his followers such as the [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden|Chancellor of Sweden]], [[Erik Larsson Sparre]], (1550–1600). In May 1599, Charles' forces captured the last fortress held by Sigismund, Kalmar. On July 24, 1599, the Riksdag in [[Stockholm]] officially dethroned Sigismund. The new King of Sweden was Charles IX of Sweden, and the [[Polish–Swedish union]] was dissolved after barely seven years of existence.In March 1600, some of Sigismund's supporters were executed, including five senators in an event known as the [[Linköping Bloodbath]].

=== Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) ===

The [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Polish–Muscovite War]] (1605–1618), in Poland known as the ''[[Dimitriads]]'', was a sequence of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried out by the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and private armies and mercenaries led by the Commonwealth aristocracy), when the Russian Tsardom was torn by a series of civil wars, a period referred to as the "[[Time of Troubles]]". The sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was not formally at war with Russia until 1609, and various [[Russia]]n factions fought amongst themselves, allied with the Commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them. [[Sweden]] also participated in the conflict during the course of the [[Ingrian War]] (1610–1617), sometimes allying itself with Russia, and other times fighting against it. The aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of their goals, which ranged from minor border adjustments to imposing the Polish Kings or the Polish-backed impostors' claims to the Russian throne and even the creation of a new state by forming a union between the commonwealth and Russia.

[[File:Chorikov The Siege of Smolensk by the Poles.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Smolensk (1609–11)|The defence of Smolensk]] from the Poles by [[Boris Chorikov]].]]

The war can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, certain commonwealth [[szlachta]] (nobility), encouraged by some [[Boyar|Russian boyars]] (Russian aristocracy), but without the official consent of the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], attempted to exploit Russia's weakness and intervene in its civil war by supporting the impostors for the tsardom, False Dmitriy I and later False Dmitriy II, against the crowned tsars, [[Boris Godunov]] and Vasili Shuiski. The first wave of the Polish intervention began in 1605 and ended in 1606 with the death of False [[Dmitri I]]. The second wave started in 1607 and lasted until 1609, when Tsar Vasili made a military alliance with Sweden. In response to this alliance, the Polish king Sigismund III decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon Russia, aiming to weaken Sweden's ally and to gain territorial concessions.

Hetman of the Crown [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]] held a triumphal entry by the Kraków suburb of the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Palace]], leading with him the prisoners: the Russian tsar Wasyl IV Szujski, his brothers: Dimitri Szujski with his wife - Grand Duchess Ekaterina Grigoryevna, daughter Grigory Malyuta Skuratov and Ivan Shuysky Mikhail Shein, and Filaret, the non-canonical Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia .

After early commonwealth victories ([[Battle of Klushino]]), which culminated in Polish forces entering [[Moscow]] in 1610, Sigismund's son, Prince [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław of Poland]], was briefly elected tsar. However, soon afterwards, Sigismund decided to seize the [[Line of succession to the former Russian throne|Russian throne]] for himself. This alienated the pro-Polish supporters among the boyars, who could accept the moderate Władysław, but not the pro-Catholic and [[anti-Eastern Orthodox]] Sigismund. Subsequently, the pro-Polish Russian faction disappeared, and the war resumed in 1611, with the Poles being ousted from Moscow in 1612 but capturing the important city of Smolensk (see ''[[Siege of Smolensk (1609–11)|Siege of Smolensk (1609–1611)]]''). However, due to internal troubles in both the Commonwealth and Russia, little military action occurred between 1612 and 1617, when Sigismund made one final and failed attempt to conquer Russia. The war finally ended in 1618 with the [[Truce of Deulino]], which granted the Commonwealth certain territorial concessions, but not control over Russia which thus emerged from the war with its independence unscathed.

==Life==
Stefan Wolle was born in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].   He father was a committed supporter of East Germany's [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|recently constructed]] [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|ruling party]].&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;   He attended school in Berlin and embarked on a traineeship in the book trade.   After undertaking his military service he was enrolled at [[Berlin]]'s [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] to study historical sciences.   However, in 1972 he was released from the university on account of his "intellectual arrogance".&lt;ref name=SWlautBS/&gt;   However, he was subsequently permitted to return and pursue his studies at the Humboldt between 1973 and 1976.&lt;ref name=SWlautwww&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=3885|title=Wolle, Stefan  * 22.10.1950  Historiker, Mitbegründer des Unabhängigen Historiker-Verbands|author=[[Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk]]|work=Wer war wer in der DDR?|publisher=Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin &amp; Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He still had not become a member of the  [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"'' / SED)]], and never would:&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;  he spent the next thirteen years as an academic researcher, attached to the Central Historical Institute and the Institute for General History at the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|(East) German Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=SWlautwww/&gt;

Wolle received his doctorate in 1984 for work on [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kievan Rus']], consciously selected as a non-ideological topic,&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt; and reworked for publication as a book in 1993.&lt;ref name=WladlautStef&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Buchverlag Union, München|isbn= 978-3-372-00305-3|title=Wladimir der Heilige. Rußlands erster christlicher Fürst |date=November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He came to wider prominence in the context of the [[Peaceful Revolution]] which was followed by [[German reunification]], formally in October 1990.&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;   During the second half of the 1980s he had been establishing contacts with underground opposition groups,&lt;ref name=SWlautBS/&gt; and after the [[Berlin Wall|wall]] [[Die Wende|was breached]] in November 1989 he was able to become a [[:de:Runder Tisch#Zentraler Runder Tisch in der DDR 1989/1990|Round Table]] expert witness on [[:de:Stasi-Unterlagen|Stasi files]].&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;   He was also a member of the "Normannenstraße Citizens Committee".  He was tasked, together with  {{Interlanguage link multi|Armin Mitter|de}},&lt;ref name=AMlautwww&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=2346|title=Mitter, Armin   * 1.5.1953   Historiker, Mitbegründer des Unabhängigen Historiker-Verbandes|author=[[Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk]]|work=Wer war wer in der DDR?|publisher=Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin &amp; Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ensuring the preservation of files at the Stasi national centre in Normannenstraße as the Stasi operation itself was dissolved.   During a period of rapid change, [[:de:Sturm auf die Stasi-Zentrale in der Normannenstraße 1990|the occupation]] in January 1990 by concerned citizens (taking their queue from similar actions in Erfurt, Lepizig and Rostock) of the building housing the archives, thwarted a more extensive destruction of the evidence.   In March 1990 Wolle and [[:de:Armin Mitter|Mitter]], using their access to the files, published a first edition of Stasi reports and instructions.   200,000 copies were printed within a few days&lt;ref name=SWlautwww/&gt; and by July 1990 250,000 had been produced.&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;   The question of what to do with the Stasi archives had become pressing very quickly because of the extent and nature of government surveillance over citizens in East Germany between 1949 and 1989:  in March 1990 a more structured approach to the archives began to emerge.   Stefan Wolle served as a member of what became known as the [[Stasi Records Agency|Stasi Records Agency (''"Bundesbeauftragter für die Stasi-Unterlagen"'' / BStU / "Gauck commission")]] between March 1990 and February 1991.&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;

In February&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt; or March 1991 Wolle and Mitter were summarily dismissed from the Stasi Records Agency for "disloyalty".   The dismissal came at the behest of [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], at that time [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Minister]] in the [[Fourth Kohl cabinet|German government]],&lt;ref name=SWlautwww/&gt; and followed a television interview in which Wolle had disclosed that the name of the last East German prime minister, [[Lothar de Maizière]], had appeared in Stasi files listing [[Informal collaborators (East Germany)|informal Stasi collaborators]].&lt;ref name=spiegel121991&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/13489025|page=41|title="Ein Unterschied"|volume=12/1991|date=18 March 1991|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   (Schäuble's intervention appeared to have arisen because the disclosure about de Maizière directly contradicted public assurances previously given by Schäuble in respect of the matter.&lt;ref name=spiegel121991/&gt;)   The dismissal had been implemented by [[Joachim Gauck]], then head of the Stasi Records Agency.   Writing later in a memoir, Gauck recalled his very deep regret over the affair:  he had been given no choice, and had indeed tried to reinstate Wolle at a later date.&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;

Between 1991 and 1996 Wolle was engaged as an academic research assistant at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]].  Between 1996 and 1998 his work was funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (''"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"'' / DFG)]].&lt;ref name="JesseSchubert2015"/&gt;   Between 1998 and 2000 he worked with the [[Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship|National Foundation for the Evaluation of the SED Dictatorship (''"Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur"'')]].&lt;ref name=SWlautwww/&gt;   Since 2002 he has worked with the [[:de:Forschungsverbund SED-Staat|Forschungsverbund SED-Staat (''" SED [one-party-]state Research Association"'')]] at Berlin's [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]].&lt;ref name=SWlautwww/&gt;

Since 2005 Stefan Wolle has been director of academic research at the popular [[DDR Museum]], which opened to the public in July 2006.&lt;ref name=SWlautBOR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borken.de/de/stadtleben/kultur-und-bildung/stadtmuseum/ausstellungen/damals-in-der-ddr/tischgespraech-mit-dr-stefan-wolle.html|work=Advertisement for a public lecture-seminar presented by Stefan Wolle|title=Damals in der DDR:  Tischgespräch mit Dr. Stefan Wolle|date= 16 September 2006|publisher=Stadt Borken| accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10801">The AN/FRC-117 '''Survivable Low Frequency Communications System''' ('''SLFCS''') was a communications system designed to be able to operate, albeit at low [[bit rate|data transfer rate]]s, during and after a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/slfcs.htm|title = Survivable Low Frequency Communications System (SLFCS)&amp;nbsp;– United States Nuclear Forces|accessdate = 2007-10-04|author = GlobalSecurity.org|date = 2005-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system used both [[very low frequency]] (VLF), and [[low frequency]] (LF) radio bands.

==Mission==
SLFCS was used for [[United States]] nuclear forces' [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] communications for [[Emergency Action Message]] dissemination and force direction. Single channel, receive only capability was provided at [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|ICBM]] [[Launch control center (ICBM)|launch control centers]].  The single channel operated between 14&amp;nbsp;kHz and 60&amp;nbsp;kHz to receive commands from remotely located Combat Operations Center&amp;nbsp;– Transmit/Receive (T/R) sites; this low frequency range is only slightly affected by nuclear blasts.

SLFCS' primary advantage was that it would experience minimal radio signal degradation as a result of nuclear detonations.  It would be an alternate means of communication during and after detonations, providing a survivable command and control communications network for the [[Strategic Air Command]] ([[Strategic Air Command|SAC]]), the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]), and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] ([[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]).  SLFCS would also relay signals from the [[United States Navy|Navy]]'s [[Low frequency|LF]]/[[Very Low Frequency|VLF]] systems.

==History==
The first program (487L) took six years from the time of the initial requirement to full operation. The second part (616A), which was basically a modification of an already operational system, took 10 years.

===Chronology===
*1961
**29 Sep&amp;nbsp;– Headquarters USAF issues Specific Operating Requirement 193, for the Survivable Low Frequency Communications System; system is envisioned to link Alternate Joint Command Center with command centers of SAC, NORAD, SAC numbered air forces with LF radio networks; a total of 18 transmit/receive (T/R) sites and 375 LF-receive only (R/O) in all SAC launch facilities, mobile Minuteman trains, SAC air base control rooms, and SAC UHF positive control stations in the northern tier
*1962
**12 Mar&amp;nbsp;– Amendment to SOR 193 changes number of transmit T/R sites to 19 (three each at AJCC, SAC, NORAD, two each at [[2d Air Force]], [[15th Air Force]] and [[8th Air Force]], one each at [[Larson AFB]], Southern [[Alaska]], [[Sondrestrom AB]], and the [[United Kingdom]]; Full Operating Capability was extended from July 1964 to May 1965.
**27 Apr&amp;nbsp;– A revised program directive delineated the network; T/R equipment would be installed at HQ SAC, the SAC numbered air force headquarters, and in the [[Post Attack Command and Control System|ABNCP]], Alternate Joint Command Center (AJCC) and NORAD command center.  14 Green Pine stations, missile [[Launch control center (ICBM)|launch control centers]], all SAC bomber wing command posts would have R/O terminals, as would the NORAD regional control centers. Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was placed at 1 Oct 1966.
*1968
**29 Jul 1968&amp;nbsp;– Silver Creek site accepted by [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]]&lt;ref name="AFHRA_1"&gt;Air Force Historical Research Agency: "History of 3902d Air Base Wing, July&amp;nbsp;– September 1968"&lt;/ref&gt;
**19 Aug 1968&amp;nbsp;– Silver Creek site turned on for continuous operation&lt;ref name="AFHRA_1" /&gt;
**5 Sep 1968&amp;nbsp;– Silver Creek begins operational testing&lt;ref name="AFHRA_1" /&gt;
*1971
**16 Jun&amp;nbsp;– SLFCS IOC obtained by [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] units
*1974
**26 Jul&amp;nbsp;– HQ USAF approves '''Program 616A''' (Improved SLFCS); system would improve SLFCS by providing anti-jam protection, improved [[modems]], increased range and make it compatible with the [[Navy]] LF/VLF system
*1978
**SAC conducts Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) at [[Ellsworth AFB]], [[South Dakota]] for Program 616A; test is successful
*1986
**30 Sep&amp;nbsp;– deactivation of [[Hawes Radio Relay Site]], [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]], California
**20 Oct&amp;nbsp;– destruction of [[Hawes Radio Relay Site]] by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]
*1996

'''Sławomir Cenckiewicz''' (born 1971) is a [[Poland|Polish]] historian and journalist. A former employee of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], he is currently the main historical consultant of the [[Wprost]] weekly. He gained much media attention following the 2008 by [[scientific publication]] (co-work with doktor [[Piotr Gontarczyk]]) - book "''SB a Lech Wałęsa. Przyczynek do biografii''" (SB and Lech Wałęsa. Contribution to biography), about [[Lech Wałęsa]] as an [[informant]] of the communist [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]].&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{pl icon}} ''SB a Lech Wałęsa. Przyczynek do biografii'', Warszawa 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-60464-74-8}} [co-author [[Piotr Gontarczyk]]&lt;/ref&gt; In their work, Dr. Gontarczyk and Dr. Cenckiewicz argued that in the 1970s, the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|NSZZ Solidarność]] leader and former President of Poland [[Lech Wałęsa]] was a secret informant of the Polish communist secret police [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] (SB).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/2126507/Lech-Walesa-was-Communist-spy,-claims-book.html Lech Walesa was Communist spy, claims book, Daily Telegraph, 14 Jun 2008, access 04-10-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the Historical Faculty of the [[Gdańsk University|Uniwersytet Gdański]]. His main fields of expertise are the modern history of Poland, including the opposition in the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] and the migrant [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]. He was [[habilitation|habilitated]] as a doctor of history by the [[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw|Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie]].

A '''trophy''' is a tangible, durable reminder of a specific achievement, and serves as recognition or evidence of merit. Trophies are often awarded for [[sports|sporting events]], from youth sports to professional level athletics. In many sports [[medal]]s (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies.

Originally the word trophy, derived from the Greek ''[[tropaion]]'', referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., [[headhunting]]) captured in battle. These [[war trophy|war trophies]] commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War Trophies|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/wartrophies.-tvA.htm|work=About.com US Military|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215957/http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/wartrophies.-tvA.htm|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this sense of the word is reflected in [[trophy hunting|hunting trophies]] and [[human trophy collecting]] by [[serial killer]]s.

A [[slang]] term for an individual or team's collection of trophies is '''silverware'''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Etymology ==
{{details|Tropaion}}
Trophies have marked victories since ancient times. The word ''trophy'', coined in English in 1550, was derived from the French ''trophée'' in 1513, "a prize of war", from Old French ''trophee'', from Latin ''trophaeum'', monument to victory, variant of ''tropaeum'', which in turn is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] τρόπαιον (''[[tropaion]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtro%2Fpaion|title=τρόπαιον|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605192701/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=tro%2Fpaion|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the neuter of [[wikt:τροπαῖος|τροπαῖος]] (''tropaios''), "of defeat" or "for defeat", but generally "of a turning" or "of a change",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtropai%3Dos|title=τροπαῖος|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605192720/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=tropai=os|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from τροπή (''tropē''), "a turn, a change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtroph%2F|title=τροπή|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605192738/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=troph%2F|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that from the verb τρέπω (''trepo''), "to turn, to alter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtre%2Fpw|title=τρέπω|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605192747/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=tre%2Fpw|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trophy|title=trophy|work=Online Etymological Dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331133817/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trophy|archivedate=2009-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greece, trophies were made on the battlefields of victorious battles, from captured arms and standards, and were hung upon a tree or a large stake made to resemble a warrior. Often, these ancient trophies were inscribed with a story of the battle and were dedicated to various gods. Trophies made about naval victories sometimes consisted of entire ships (or what remained of them) laid out on the beach. To destroy a trophy was considered a sacrilege.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/606508/trophy|title=trophy|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802021945/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/606508/trophy|archivedate=2010-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Romans kept their trophies closer to home. The Romans built magnificent trophies in Rome, including columns and arches atop a foundation. Most of the stone trophies that once adorned huge stone memorials in Rome have been long since stolen.&lt;ref name="madeHow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Trophy.html|title=Trophy|work=How Products are made, volume 6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828103253/http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Trophy.html|archivedate=2009-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greece, the winners of the Olympic games initially received no trophies except [[laurel wreath]]s. Later the winner also received an [[amphora]] with sacred olive oil. In local games, the winners received different trophies, such as a tripod vase, a bronze shield or a silver cup.

In ancient Rome, money usually was given to winners instead of trophies.

[[Chalice]]s were given to winners of sporting events at least as early as the very late 1600s in the New World. For example, the [[Kyp Cup]] (made by silversmith Jesse Kyp), a small, two-handled, sterling cup in the [[Henry Ford Museum]], was given to the winner of a horse race between two towns in New England in about 1699. Chalices, particularly, are associated with sporting events, and were traditionally made in silver. Winners of horse races, and later boating and early automobile races, were the typical recipients of these trophies. The [[Davis Cup]], [[Stanley Cup]], [[America's Cup]] and numerous [[List of world cups and world championships|World Cup]]s are all now famous cup-shaped trophies given to sports winners.&lt;ref name="madeHow" /&gt;

Today, the most common trophies are much less expensive, and thus much more pervasive, thanks to mass-produced plastic/resin trophies.

The oldest sports trophies in the world are the Carlisle Bells, a horse racing trophy dating back to 1559 and 1599 and were first awarded by Elizabeth I. The race has been run for over 400 years in Carlisle, Cumbria, United Kingdom. The bells are on show at the local museum, Tullie House, which houses a variety of historic artifacts from the area from Roman legions to present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlisle Bell]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

==Types==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Premiership trophy.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|right|The [[Premier League|Premier League Trophy]] is an example of a '''[[loving cup|loving-cup]]''' trophy.]] --&gt;
[[File:Karyn Marshall With Trophy.jpg|thumb|right|A trophy held by women's weightlifter [[Karyn Marshall]] made of wood and metal.]] 
Contemporary trophies often depict an aspect of the event commemorated, for example in basketball tournaments, the trophy takes the shape of a basketball player, or a basketball. Trophies have been in the past objects of use such as two-handled cups, bowls, or mugs (all usually engraved); or representations such as statues of people, animals, and architecture while displaying words, numbers or images. While trophies traditionally have been made with metal figures, wood columns, and wood bases, in recent years they have been made with plastic figures and marble bases. This is to retain the weight traditionally associated with a quality award and make them more affordable to use as recognition items. Trophies increasingly have used resin depictions.

The [[Academy Awards]] Oscar is a trophy with a stylized human; the [[Hugo Award]] for science fiction is a [[space ship]]; and the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] awards for its singles champions are a large [[loving cup]] for men and a large silver plate for women.

A '''[[loving cup|loving-cup]]''' trophy is a common variety of trophy; it is a [[cup]] shape, usually on a pedestal, with two or more handles, and is often made from [[silver]] or [[silver plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noto|first1=Suzanne|title=Loving Cup History|url=https://www.silvergallery.com/blog/loving-cup-history/|website=Silver Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hunting trophies''' are reminders of successes from hunting animals, such as an animal's head mounted to be hung on a wall.

'''Perpetual trophies''' are held by the winner until the next event, when the winner must compete again in order to keep the trophy. In some competitions winners in a certain number of consecutive or non-consecutive events receive the trophy or its copy in permanent ownership.

==Sporting==
Some sporting trophies include:

===Football===

[[File:Vuelta Olìmpica Libertadores 09 II.JPG|thumb|The [[Copa Libertadores (trophy)|Copa Libertadores Trophy]] being lifted by [[José Luis Calderón]] of winning team [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] (2009).]]

[[File:The FA Cup Trophy in 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[FA Cup]] in 2008.]]
Some of the world's most famous football trophies are:

*'''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy]]''' &amp;mdash; Awarded to the winners of the [[FIFA World Cup]] from the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] onwards. Previous winners were awarded the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]] (known simply as ''Victory'' until 1949), which was awarded in perpetuity to Brazil after their 3rd win in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. Both are referred to colloquially as ''the World Cup''
*'''[[Copa Libertadores (trophy)|Copa Libertadores Trophy]]''' &amp;mdash; Known simply as ''Libertadores'' or ''Copa'', awarded to the winners of the [[Copa Libertadores]] since 1960. It is one of the most prestigious laurels in the [[Western Hemisphere]].
*'''[[European Champion Clubs' Cup]]''' - colloquially ''the European Cup'', awarded to the winners of the European Cup (before 1992–93) and the [[UEFA Champions League]] (since 1992–93). It is the most prestigious trophy in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is affectionately known as "old big ears" due to its shape.
*The '''[[FA Cup]]''' &amp;mdash; Awarded to winners of the primary English domestic football knockout tournament, officially ''The Football Association Challenge Cup'', often referred to as just the ''FA Cup''. The FA Cup was inaugurated in 1871 and is therefore the oldest tournament in club football. The original trophy, however, was stolen in 1895 and the current trophy design, which was first awarded in 1911, is actually the fifth incarnation in total.
*The '''[[Scottish Cup]]''' &amp;mdash; Awarded to the winners of the primary domestic knockout cup tournament of Scotland (the ''Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup'', or just ''Scottish Cup''). The tournament was founded in 1873 and still presents the original trophy. The Scottish Cup is therefore the world's oldest national football trophy and second oldest national trophy, behind the Carlisle Bells race trophy dating back to 1599.

The original [[Jules Rimet Trophy]] was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and has never been recovered. Replicas were awarded to winning nations up to the retirement of the genuine trophy. However, prior to the 1966 final, [[The Football Association]] made an (unauthorised) replica in secret in gilded bronze for use in post-match celebrations due to security concerns – the genuine trophy was made out of close to 2&amp;nbsp;kg of pure gold. This has led to several conspiracy theories regarding which trophy was stolen – the FA replica, or the real trophy. FIFA purchased the replica for £254,500 (ten times the reserve price) in 1997, with the inflated price attributed to such rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/87e8256e-cbcc-11da-a7bf-0000779e2340.html|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Simon|last=Kuper|date=2006-04-14|title=Solid gold mystery awaits the final whistle|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306014341/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/87e8256e-cbcc-11da-a7bf-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trophy is held on behalf of FIFA by the [[National Football Museum]] in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. The current FIFA World Cup trophy inscribe the names of the teams that won the award at the underneath the base of the trophy.

A club that manages to win the Copa Libertadores trophy three consecutive times retain the trophy permanently. The current trophy has been used since 1975. Like the FIFA World Cup trophy, the winners of each edition of the tournament has their name inscribed on the trophy; unlike the FIFA World Cup trophy, a pedestal contains a list of winners in the form of badges. The current pedestal is the fourth in the trophy's history, having been used since 2009. The original trophy was awarded to [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] in 1970 (after their third win) - the present trophy is the third, identical edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espanol.sports.yahoo.com/noticias/d-sport-sabias-trofeo-copa-libertadores-hizo-03052010-79.html|title=¿Sabías que el trofeo de la Copa Libertadores se hizo en el Perú?|first=Fernando|last=Lozano|date=2010-05-03|newspaper=ElComercio.com.pe|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111133021/http://espanol.sports.yahoo.com/noticias/d-sport-sabias-trofeo-copa-libertadores-hizo-03052010-79.html|archivedate=2011-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2009, clubs that win the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] three times in successive seasons, or five times in total, were permitted to retain the trophy in perpetuity. The present trophy has been used since 2005–06 after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s fifth win in 2005. The original trophy was awarded to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in 1966 (after their sixth win) — the present trophy is the sixth incarnation overall.

Four trophies have served as an award (out of five made) for the winner of the FA Cup. The first (1871–1895) was stolen in [[Birmingham]] and melted down, the second (1896–1910) was presented to [[Lord Kinnaird]] and is held by [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]], the chairman of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] after private auction in 2005. The third (1910–1992) was retired after the 1992 final due to fragility and is held by [[The Football Association]]; two exact replicas of it were made, one of which has been awarded to the winners (1993–2013), the other remains as a backup in case of damage to the primary trophy. The same design was recast and was unveiled in 2014 to be more durable.

=== Gaelic Football ===
*'''[[Sam Maguire Cup]]''' - Awarded to the winners of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]].

The women's (Ladies) Singles winner is presented with the [[Venus Rosewater Dish]]. Other trophies are presented to the winners of the Doubles and Mixed Doubles.

'''Turris in Mauretania''' is an ancient settlement of [[Roman North Africa]]  in the [[Roman province]] of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d3t57.html Turris in Mauretania], at catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The location is unknown but believed to be in [[Algeria]]. The city was believed to be the site of an ancient [[bishopric]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1832.htm  Titular Episcopal See of Turris in Mauretania] at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt; but no bishops of antiquity are known to us. The suffix "in Mauretania" is to differentiate the town from cities that existed in Spain and adjoining provinces of Roman North Africa.

The [[diocese]] remains today a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1833.htm Titular Episcopal See of Turris in Proconsulari] at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently vacant.

'''Vera Ducas''' (1912–29 March 1948) was born to a Jewish family in [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Austria-Hungary/Czechoslovakia]]. She fled the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|1939 Nazi invasion]] with her husband and child. They lived in [[Turkey]] for several years before arriving in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. She didn't speak [[Hebrew]] and was unable to find work and is alleged to have become an informer for the British [[Palestine Police|CID]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry Levin, 'Jerusalem Embattled', Cassel, London, 1997. {{ISBN|0-304-33765-X}}, text copyright 1950, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

She was kidnapped from one of the main cafes of Jerusalem's [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]]&lt;ref&gt;[[The Scotsman]] on Sunday 29 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt; and her body found on a patch of waste ground, shot through the head. It was reported that the [[Stern Gang]] had announced that they had killed her, accusing her of spying for the British.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Downton, The Scotsman, Monday 30 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin's diary p.191, 21 May, refers to seeing old posters in Jerusalem announcing her execution, these he attributes to Etzel, ([[Irgun]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
