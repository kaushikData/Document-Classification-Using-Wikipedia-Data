'''Proposition 29''', the California Cancer Research Act, is a [[California ballot measure]] that was defeated by California voters at the [[California state elections, June 2012|statewide election on June 5, 2012]].

The measure would have placed a $1 [[excise]] on tobacco products into a protected fund to finance medical research on smoking-related illnesses, strengthen California’s smoking prevention and cessation programs, and enforce the state’s existing tobacco laws.

The independent [[California Legislative Analyst's Office]] projected that the measure would have generated approximately $855 million in first year, declining slightly but predictably (about 3% annually due to decrease in the number of smokers) every year thereafter. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2009/090811.pdf California Legislative Analyst’s Office, January 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure would have created a nine-member committee charged with administering direct revenues. This oversight committee was to be composed of cancer-research medical professionals, [[University of California]] Chancellors, and representatives of national disease advocacy groups. The measure restricted administration costs to no more than 2% of its direct tax revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i895_initiative_09-0097.pdf Full text of the California Cancer Research Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Cancer Research Act was widely supported by cancer advocates, including [[cancer survivor]] [[Lance Armstrong]] and the [[American Cancer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.californiansforacure.org/about/Steering_Committee# |title=Steering Committee of the Campaign to Pass the California Cancer Research Act |access-date=2011-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911144731/http://www.californiansforacure.org/about/Steering_Committee# |archive-date=2011-09-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==

===How CCRA revenue would have been spent===
According to the independent [[California Legislative Analyst's Office]], revenue raised by the measure would have been spent as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures.htm# |title=California Secretary of State, Qualified California Ballot Measures |access-date=2011-04-12 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Pc81JxoZ?url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures.htm# |archive-date=2014-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Approximately $75 million annually: Maintaining existing tobacco tax revenue streams to ensure that the [[California Proposition 99 (1988)]], [[California Proposition 10 (1998)]], General Fund and Breast Cancer programs funded by existing tobacco taxes are not negatively impacted by the [[excise]] tax increase;
* 60% (approximately $468 million annually): Research of cancer and tobacco-related disease "for the purpose of grants and loans to support research into the prevention, early detection, treatments, complementary treatments and potential cures of lung cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, emphysema and other tobacco related diseases, including but not limited to coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease";
* 15% (approximately $117 million annually): Facilities and capital equipment for research "for the purposes of grants and loans to provide facilities, including but not limited to those building, building leases and capital equipment as may be found necessary and appropriate by the Committee, to further [[biomedical]], [[epidemiological]], behavioral, health services, and other research whose primary focus is to identify and refine promising prevention, early detection, treatments, complementary treatments, rehabilitation and potential cures of [[lung cancer]] and other types of cancer, [[cardiovascular disease]], [[emphysema]] and other tobacco related diseases";
* 20% (approximately $156 million annually): Tobacco prevention and cessation to the state’s existing tobacco control program. These funds would be divided between the [[California Department of Public Health]] (80%) and the [[California Department of Education]] (20%) for their existing programs to prevent and reduce the use of tobacco.
* 3% (approximately $23 million annually): Tobacco law enforcement "to support law enforcement efforts to reduce [[cigarette smuggling]], tobacco tax evasion, and counterfeit tobacco products, to reduce illegal sales of tobacco products to minors, and to enforce legal settlement provisions and conduct law enforcement training and technical assistance activities for tobacco related statues".
* No more than 2% (approximately $16 million annually): Administration.

===Oversight===
The measure would have created a 9-member governing committee charged with administering the fund. The California Cancer Research Act Oversight Committee was to be composed of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiansforacure.com/facts/initiative Full Text of the California Cancer Research Act]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3 [[University of California]] chancellors;
* 3 "selected from among Cancer Center Directors of [[National Cancer Institute]] designated cancer centers located within the State of California" (appointed by the [[California Governor]])
* 1 "affiliated with a California Academic Medical Center who is a practicing [[physician]] with expertise in the prevention, treatment or research of [[cardiovascular disease]]" (appointed by the [[California Governor]])
* 2 "selected from among California representatives of California or national disease advocacy groups whose focus is tobacco-related illness, at least one of whom shall be a person who has been treated for a tobacco related illness."  (appointed by Director of [[California Department of Public Health]])
* A Committee to establish a peer review process for selection of grants modeled on the process used by the [[National Institutes of Health]].

==Ballot qualification==
The [[California Secretary of State]] confirmed that The California Cancer Research Act had qualified for California’s next statewide ballot on August 24, 2010, after its supporting coalition submitted 633,453 voter signatures for verification in June 2010. To qualify, the measure required 433,971 signatures, or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures.htm# |title=California Secretary of State, Qualified California Ballot Measures |access-date=2011-04-12 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Pc81JxoZ?url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures.htm# |archive-date=2014-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2016, the health minister of [[Angola]] reported 23 cases of [[yellow fever]] with 7 deaths among Eritrean and Congolese citizens living in Angola in Viana municipality, a suburb of the capital of [[Luanda]]. The first cases (hemorrhagic fever suspected as being yellow fever) were reported in Eritrean visitors beginning on 5 December 2015 and confirmed by the [[Pasteur Institute|Pasteur WHO reference laboratory]] in [[Dakar]], Senegal in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Situation report: Yellow fever outbreak in Angola, 14 March 2016|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/yellow-fever/sitreps/item/8440-sitrep-yellow-fever-outbreak-in-angola-14-march-2016.html|website=www.afro.who.int|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow fever - Africa (16): Angola 2016-02-27 10:11:59 Archive Number: 20160227.4053826 |url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/4053826|website=Pro-MED-mail|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outbreak was classified as an urban cycle of [[Yellow fever#Transmission|yellow fever transmission]], which can spread rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow fever - Africa (18): Angola|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/4090378|website=Pro-MED-mail|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary finding that the strain of the yellow fever virus was closely related to a strain identified in a 1971 outbreak in Angola was confirmed in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grobbelaar|first1=AA|last2=Weyer|first2=J|last3=Moolla|first3=N|last4=Jansen van Vuren|first4=P|last5=Moises|first5=F|last6=Paweska|first6=JT|title=Resurgence of Yellow Fever in Angola, 2015-2016.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=15 October 2016|volume=22|issue=10|pmid=27536787|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/10/16-0818_article|accessdate=21 August 2016|doi=10.3201/eid2210.160818|pmc=5038398|pages=1854–1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderators from [[ProMED-mail]] stressed the importance of initiating a vaccination campaign immediately to prevent further spread. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] classified the outbreak as Watch Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) on 7 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Fever in Angola|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/yellow-fever-angola|website=Traveler's Health|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO declared it a grade 2 event on its emergency response framework having moderate public health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow fever - Africa (40): Angola, WHO|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/4158727|website=Pro-MED-mail|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an emergency committee meeting in Geneva, Switzerland on 19 May 2016, the WHO declared that the outbreak was serious and might continue to spread, but decided not to declare a [[public health emergency of international concern]] (PHEIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) concerning Yellow Fever|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/ec-yellow-fever/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 May 2016|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jr|first1=Donald G.

The last case in Angola was on 23 June and the last case in DR Congo was on 12 July. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, stated: "The current battle against yellow fever in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo is coming to a close, ... But the broader war against the disease is just getting started."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning the war against yellow fever|url=http://www.who.int/features/2016/winning-the-war-against-yellow-fever/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ProMED-mail moderator Tom Yuill noted that maintaining vaccination coverage in the two countries will be the next challenge. Approximately 30 million people were vaccinated in the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow fever - Africa (110): Angola, Congo DR, WHO|url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/4657067|website=www.promedmail.org|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread within Angola==

By early February, suspected cases were being reported from [[Provinces of Angola|southern Huila province]], about a 1000 kilometers south, and the provinces of Bié, Benguela, Cunene, Cabinda, Hula, Huambo, Malange, Kwanza Sul, Uige, Zaire and Kwanza Norte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow fever - Africa (16): Angola 2016-02-27 10:11:59 Archive Number: 20160227.4053826 |url=http://www.promedmail.org/post/4053826|website=Pro-MED-mail|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 9 March 2016, the WHO reported that there were  65 confirmed cases, 813 suspected cases, and 138 deaths in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angola immunizes 6.7 million people against yellow fever|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/8413-angola-immunizes-67-million-people-against-yellow-fever.html|website=WHO Regional Office for Africa|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March, WHO reported that cases had occurred in 6 of the 18 provinces of Angola, and that transmission was ongoing.

One million doses of 6 million shipped in February went missing, resulting in shortages to fight the spreading epidemic in DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN bungles response to Africa's yellow fever outbreak|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c5be7d71b0cb4c99a05940f5adfc7166/ap-investigation-1-million-vaccines-vanished-angola#|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated shortage was 22 million doses as of August 2016.

If the epidemic were to spread, particularly into Asia, the [[Yellow fever vaccine|global supply of vaccine]] would have been insufficient to protect the millions of people that would need to be vaccinated to curb an epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merelli|first1=Annalisa|title=The world was running short of yellow fever vaccines—and millions were at risk|url=http://qz.com/539417/the-world-is-running-short-of-yellow-fever-vaccines-and-millions-are-at-risk/|website=Quartz|accessdate=17 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an emergency measure, experts  suggested the dose-sparing strategy to extend existing supplies of vaccine, which the WHO could provide under the Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yellow fever vaccine supply: a possible solution - The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30195-7 | volume=387 | year=2016|journal=The Lancet|pages=1599–1600

==Response to the epidemic==
In June 2016, a WHO representative in Luanda said that the initial investigation of the outbreak in December was thrown off course because the first cases in December 2015—the sick Eritrean visitors—had what were later identified as fake yellow fever vaccination certificates. All had been to the same restaurant, so food poisoning was initially suspected as the cause of the mystery illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Times|first1=Los Angeles|title=Yellow fever outbreak: Health officials to weigh declaring global emergency|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/global-development/la-fg-global-yellow-fever-snap-story.html|website=latimes.com|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was more than a month before blood samples from the Eritreans reached the Pasteur Institute lab and yellow fever was recognized. Public health experts identified that as one factor that delayed the response to the outbreak, which came close to being a much larger disaster, if vaccine supplies had not been successfully raised in time, or the disease had spread to other countries and continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calisher|first1=CH|last2=Woodall|first2=JP|title=Yellow Fever-More a Policy and Planning Problem than a Biological One.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=October 2016|volume=22|issue=10|pages=1859–60|pmid=27479749|doi=10.3201/eid2210.160875|pmc=5038394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concurrent [[2015–16 Zika virus epidemic|Zika outbreak]] drew attention away from a potentially far more serious epidemic of yellow fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jr|first1=Donald G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11272">The '''Adjective Check List''' ('''ACL''') is a psychological assessment containing 300 [[Adjective|adjectives]] used to identify common [[psychological trait]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adjective Check List Manual|last=Gough|first=H.G.|last2=Heilbrun, Jr.|first2=A.B.|publisher=CPP, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=|edition=1983|location=Palo Alto, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACL was constructed by [[Harrison G. Gough]] and Alfred B. Heilbrun, Jr. with the goal to assess psychological traits of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Gough, H. G. (1960). The Adjective Check List as a personalty assessment research technique. ''Psychological Reports, 6,'' 107-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACL measures 37 scales within 5 categories: [[modus operandi]] (4 scales), need (15 scales), topical (9 scales), [[transactional analysis]] (5 scales), and origence-intellectence (4 scales).&lt;ref name="mindgarden" /&gt; To complete the ACL, respondents select the adjectives that they believe describe themselves (or someone else). Any number of items may be selected from the list of adjectives. In this way, the results are customized to include only those adjectives salient to the individual being assessed. The ACL takes between 10-15 minutes to complete and may be administered to individuals, groups, or used by [[researcher]]s to describe study participants.&lt;ref name=mindgarden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindgarden.com/products/acl.htm|title=The Adjective Check List |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACL is protected by [[Copyright|copyright law]], published by Consulting Psychologists Press, and distributed by Mind Garden, Inc.

The ACL was first developed in the early days of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been used since 1952 by many psychologists worldwide and is one of the 100 most frequently used and cited tests in psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ACL Research and Uses ==
"The ACL offers several advantages. It is self-administering, may be completed in 10 to 15 minutes, arouses little resistance or anxiety, and has proved useful in studies of highly effective persons in occupations other than politics such as architecture, mathematics, law, medicine, and management.

"Further, as a multidimensional instrument, which taps several domains of personality, the ACL affords an appraisal of positive as well as negative factors in human behavior, thus avoiding the frequently found preoccupation with psychopathological bases of political activity. Additionally, as an established standardized, and quantitative assessment procedure, the ACL reduces the problems of reliability and comparability entailed in studies relying on interviews or on ad hoc, limited use or abbreviated personality measures” (Constantini &amp; Craik, 1980, p. 645).&lt;ref&gt;Constantini, E., &amp; Craik, K. H. (1980). Personality and politicians: California party leaders, 1960-1976. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''38''(4), 641.-661.&lt;/ref&gt;

"We propose that the Gough-Heilbrun Adjective Check List is another broad-range instrument with considerable promise as a general cross-cultural research tool. The argument is based on: the nature of the task, which seems appropriate in many cultural settings; the versatility of the method in addressing a variety of research questions; the fact that the instrument has been translated into many different languages; and the successful use of the method in recent cross-cultural studies" (Williams &amp; Best, 1983, p. 164).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. E., &amp; Best, D. L. (1983). The Gough-Heilbrun Adjective Check List as a cross-cultural research tool. In J.B Deregowski, S. Dziurawiec, &amp; R.C. Annis (Eds.) ''Expiscations in cross-cultural psychology.'' Netherlands: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger B.V.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ACL Success Factors at Work&lt;ref name="mindgarden" /&gt; ==
The ACL scales were realigned in 2012 by Rob Devine in consultation with Gough to highlight how collections of characteristics, skills, and competencies impact success at work. This realignment, called Success Factors at Work, uses 30 of the original 37 ACL scales and assigns each to one of six Work Success Factors which have proven to be central and important to success at work. The six Work Success Factors are:
* Managing Self
* Thinking and Deciding
* Getting Things Done
* Managing Work
* Working with People
* Leading People

== ACL Scales ==
The ACL consists of 37 scales within 5 categories:  modus operandi (4 scales), need (15 scales), topical (9 scales), transactional analysis (5 scales), and origence-intellectence (4 scales).

=== Modus Operandi Scales ===
The Modus Operandi Scales assess ways in which the individual approached the task of describing themselves (or someone else).
* '''Number Checked:''' Total number of adjectives checked.
* '''Favorable:''' The number of favorable (socially desirable) adjectives checked.
* '''Unfavorable:''' The number of unfavorable (socially undesirable) adjectives checked.
* '''Communality:''' Correspondence of responses to the pattern of checking typically found among people-in-general.

=== Need Scales ===
The Need Scales assess an individual's psychological needs or wants. These were identified as important in [[Henry Murray|Henry A. Murray]]'s [[Murray's system of needs|Need-Press Theory of Personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.A. (1938). ''Explorations in Personality.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Achievement:''' To strive to be outstanding in pursuits of socially recognized significance.
* '''Dominance:''' To seek and maintain a role as leader in groups, or to be influential and controlling in individual relationships.
* '''Endurance:''' To persist in any task undertaken.
* '''Order:''' To place special emphasis on neatness, organization, and planning in one's activities.

* '''Autonomy:''' To act independently of others or of social values and expectations.
* '''Aggression:''' To engage in behaviors that attack or hurt others.
* '''Change:''' To seek novelty of experience and avoid routine.
* '''Succorance:''' To solicit sympathy, affection, or emotional support from others.
* '''Abasement:''' To express feelings of inferiority through self-criticism, guilt, or social impotence.
* '''Deference:''' To seek and maintain subordinate roles in relationships with others.

=== Topical Scales ===
The Topical Scales assess a diverse set of attributes, potentialities, and role characteristics.
* '''Counseling Readiness:''' Readiness to accept counseling or professional advice in regard to personal problems, psychological difficulties, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbrun, A. B., Jr., &amp; Sullivan, D. J. (1962). The prediction of counseling readiness. ''Personnel and Guidance Journal, 41'', 112-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Self-Control:''' The extent to which self-control is imposed, and valued.
* '''Self-Confidence:''' Self-confidence, poise, and self-assurance.
* '''Personal Adjustment:''' Good adjustment in the sense of the ability to cope with situational and interpersonal demands and a feeling of efficacy.
* '''Ideal Self:''' Strong sense of personal worth; or, harmony between what one is and what one wants to be.
* '''Creative Personality:''' The desire to do and think differently from the norm, and a talent for originality.&lt;ref&gt;Gough, H. G. 1979. A creative personality scale for the Adjective Check List. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37,'' 1398-1405.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Military Leader:''' Steadiness, self-discipline, good judgment of the kind required in positions of military (or related) leadership.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, D. W., Crutchfield, R. S., Barron, F., Block, J., Gough, H. G., &amp; Harris, R. E. (1958). ''An assessment study of Air Force officers, Part 1: Design of the study and description of the variables'' (USAF WADC Tech.

* '''Masculine:''' Role-qualities such as ambition, assertiveness, and initiative associated with everyday notions of masculinity.
* '''Femininity:''' Role-qualities such as helpfulness, sympathy, and affection associated with everyday notions of femininity.

=== Transactional Analysis Scales ===
The Transactional Analysis Scales - an Egogram - assess components of ego functioning. These were identified as important by [[Eric Berne]]'s [[Transactional analysis|Transactional Analysis]] theory of personality.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, E. (1961). ''Transactional analysis in psychotherapy.'' New York: Grove Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Critical Parent:''' Attitudes of evaluation, severity, and skepticism associated with the concept of a "critical parent."

=== Origence-Intellectence Scales ===
The Origence-Intellectence Scales assess the balance between preferences for affective-emotional and rational-realistic models of functioning. These were identified as important by George S. Welsh's creativity and intelligence research.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, G. S. (1975). ''Creativity and intelligence: A personality approach.'' Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Institute for Research in Social Science, University of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, G. S. (1977). Personality correlates of intelligence and creativity in gifted adolescents. In J.C. Stanley, W.C. George, &amp; C.H. Solano (Eds.), ''The gifted and the creative: A fifty-year perspective.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High Origence - Low Intellectence:''' Feelings and emotion (high origence) valued more highly than detachment and rationality (low intellectence). High scores suggest informality, vitality, and playfulness.
* '''High Origence - High Intellectence:''' High value placed on both affect (origence) and rationality (intellectence). High scores suggest versatility, unconventionality, and individuality.
* '''Low Origence - Low Intellectence:''' No particular value placed on either origence or intellectence. High scores suggest contentment, conventionality, and optimism.
* '''Low Origence - High Intellectence:''' Rationality and analysis (intellectence) valued more highly than feelings and emotion (origence). High scores suggest logicality, industriousness, and cognitive clarity.

'''Alexander Anderson''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society of London|FLS]]}} (1748 in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland – 1811 on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St.&amp;nbsp;Vincent Island, Caribbean]]) was a Scottish surgeon and botanist.

Anderson studied at [[Edinburgh University]]. Fellow Aberdonian [[William Forsyth (horticulturist)|William Forsyth]] briefly employed him at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] in London, prior to Anderson's emigration to New York in 1774, where he stayed with his brother John, a printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Richard Alden|authorlink=Richard Alden Howard|title=The St.&amp;nbsp;Vincent Botanical Garden – the early years|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/476.pdf|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed in 1785 superintendent of the [[Botanic Gardens St. Vincent|government botanic garden]] at St.&amp;nbsp;Vincent, where he showed much activity. He was a correspondent of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], through whom he contributed to the Royal Society in 1789 an account of a [[bitumen|bituminous]] lake on St.&amp;nbsp;Vincent, which was afterwards published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' for that year.

In January 1791 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], proposed by [[Daniel Rutherford]], [[John Walker (naturalist)|John Walker]] and [[William Wright (botanist)|William Wright]].&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he went into [[The Guianas|Guiana]] on a botanising expedition; the plants he obtained being sent to Banks, are now in the herbarium of the [[British Museum]].

The [[Society of Arts]] voted him a silver medal in 1798 for a paper upon the plants in the garden at St. Vincent. He contemplated the production of a flora of the Caribbean islands, some sheets of which he sent to Banks; but this project was never carried out. He resigned his post in July 1811, and died on 8 September in the same year (the Royal Society of Edinburgh gives his date of death as 10 May 1811).

Anderson was succeeded as superintendent by his friend, the surgeon [[William Lochhead]].

==History==
This Project has two following alternatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irrigation.telangana.gov.in/icad/projects|title=Aliminati Madhava Reddy Project (AMRP)|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gravity scheme from foreshore of Srisailam reservoir, through two tunnels: This alternative to eliminate water pumping was taken up in 2004 and was scheduled for completion in 2010 but was delayed inordinately. &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-28/hyderabad/28268209_1_tunnel-boring-machine-tbm-irrigation-projects&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project==
Water is fed from the Puttamgandi foreshore pump house located at {{Coord|16|36|37|N|79|07|01|E|name=Puttangadi Pump House}} in to the nearby Puttamgandi tank from Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir. The pump house has ultimate capacity of five pumps each of 600 [[cusec]]s pumping capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/expert-suggests-alternative-plan-for-dindi-project/article8401180.ece|title=Expert suggests for full use of Puttamgandi pump house for Dindi project|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is supplied from the Puttamgandi tank by gravity to the entire irrigated area of the project via balancing reservoir called Akkampalli reservoir with 1.5 [[tmcft]] storage capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Akkampalli_Dam_D06050|title=Akkampalli Dam D06050|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Akkampalli reservoir, water is also pumped to the Hyderabad city for its water needs.

To eliminate the need of expensive water pumping and facilitate water flow by gravity to the Akkampalli reservoir, it is envisaged to bring water from [[Srisailam Dam|Srisailam reservoir]] to the plains of Nalgonda through two tunnels of a total length of {{convert|50.75|km|abbr=on}}. This scheme is known as Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project.

Puttamgandi tank water storage can be enhanced manyfolds by enlarging its water area and water depth by constructing earth bunds taking advantage of nearby continuous hillocks on three sides of the tank. The enhanced water storage capacity would serve as 100% reliable and assured water source for water needs of Hyderabad city without depending on water from Srisailam and  Nagarjuna Sagar reservoirs during drought years.

Back labor may be noted when the baby is face up in the birth canal (occiput posterior), and not face down, so that the back of the baby's skull ([[occiput]]) is pushed against the mother's [[sacrum]].  But back labor can also occur when the baby is not in that position.&lt;ref name="mayo1"/&gt;  The discomfort is often noted to be intensely painful, and may not completely abate between contractions.&lt;ref name="nursing"&gt;Klossner, N. Jayne.  ''Introductory Nursing, Vol. 1'', pp. 190, 432-33 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether back labor will occur cannot be predicted in advance.  Reports of how many mothers experience back labor vary,&lt;ref name="easing"&gt;Lieberman, Adrienne B.

'''Backgrounding''' is an intermediate stage sometimes used in [[cattle]] production which begins after [[weaning]] and ends upon placement in a [[feedlot]].  Background feeding relies more heavily on [[forage]] (e.g., [[pasture]], [[hay]]) in combination with [[Cereal|grains]] to increase a [[calf]]’s weight by several hundred pounds and to build up immunity to diseases before it enters a feedlot. Some cattle operations specialize in backgrounding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10459">'''Barrier nursing''' is a largely archaic term for a set of stringent [[infection control]] techniques used in [[nursing]]. The aim of barrier nursing is to protect medical staff against infection by patients and also protect patients with highly [[infectious disease]]s from spreading their pathogens to other non-infected people.

Barrier nursing was created as a means to maximize [[Isolation (health care)|isolation care]]. Since it is impossible to isolate a patient from society and medical staff while still providing care, there are often compromises made when it comes to treating infectious patients. Barrier nursing is a method to regulate and minimize the number and severity of compromises being made in [[Isolation (health care)|isolation care]], while also preventing the disease from spreading.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Barrier Nursing|journal=BMJ|volume=1|issue=5492|year=1966|pages=876–876|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5492.876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History &amp; usage ==
'''Barrier nursing''' started off as a term used by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)  to describe early [[infection control]] methods in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammon|first=J.|date=March 26 – April 8, 1998 |title=A review of the development of isolation precautions|journal=British Journal of Nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)|volume=7|issue=6|pages=307–310|doi=10.12968/bjon.1998.7.6.5727|issn=0966-0461|pmid=9661353}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1900s to early 2000s, 15 new terms had emerged and were also being used to describe [[infection control]]. The variety of terms that described infection care led to a misunderstanding of practice recommendations and eventual low adherence to isolation precautions; this eventually forced the CDC to combine all 15 terms into  one term called [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landers|first=Timothy|last2=McWalters|first2=Jessica|last3=Behta|first3=Maryam|last4=Bufe|first4=Gina|last5=Ross|first5=Barbara|last6=Vawdrey|first6=David K.|last7=Larson|first7=Elaine|date=October 2010|title=Terms used for isolation practices by nurses at an academic medical center|journal=Journal of advanced nursing|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2309–2319|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05398.x|issn=0309-2402|pmc=2974777|pmid=20722801}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays barrier nursing is becoming a less commonly used term and is not even recognized by most reputable databases or online scientific journals. Yet when it is seldom used, it relates mostly to  circumstantial protocols for situations  regarding [[Isolation (health care)|isolation health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443101472500382|title=Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Clinical Practice|last=Riley|first=Unell|date=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443101472|editor-last=Treleaven|editor-first=Jennifer|location=Edinburgh|pages=355–361|editor-last2=Barrett|editor-first2=A John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702039355000689|title=Tropical Infectious Diseases: Principles, Pathogens and Practice (Third Edition)|last=Enría|first=Delia A.|last2=Mills|first2=James N.|last3=Bausch|first3=Dan|last4=Shieh|first4=Wun-Ju|last5=Peters|first5=C.

== Simple vs strict barrier nursing ==

=== Simple barrier nursing ===
Simple barrier nursing is used when an infectious agent is suspected within a patient and [[Universal precautions|standard precautions]] aren't working. Simple barrier nursing consists of utilizing sterile: gloves, masks, gowns, head-covers and eye protection.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahmoud 375–381"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahmoud|first=H. K.|last2=Schaefer|first2=U. W.|last3=Schüning|first3=F.|last4=Schmidt|first4=C. G.|last5=Bamberg|first5=M.|last6=Haralambie|first6=E.|last7=Linzenmeier|first7=G.|last8=Hantschke|first8=D.|last9=Grosse-Wilde|first9=H.|date=1984-11-01|title=Laminar air flow versus barrier nursing in marrow transplant recipients|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00319885|journal=Blut|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=375–381|doi=10.1007/BF00319885|issn=0006-5242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses also wear Personalized protective equipment(PPE) to protect their bodies from infectious agents. Simple barrier nursing is often used for marrow transplants, [[Lassa virus|human Lassa virus]] transmission, [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] and other [[Virulence|virulent]] diseases.&lt;ref name="Mahmoud 375–381"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

=== Strict Barrier Nursing ===
Strict barrier nursing, which is also known as "rigid barrier nursing", is used for the rarer and more specific deadly viruses and infections: [[smallpox]], [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and [[rabies]]. Strict barrier nursing is a lot more demanding in terms of safety measure requirements because of the catastrophic effects that can occur if the disease or virus is allowed through the barrier. If patients cannot be isolated from one another completely, they have to at least be isolated from the rest of the patients within the hospital. In strict barrier nursing the patients and staff are usually isolated from the common population, and every attempt is made to establish a barrier between the inside and outside of the ward. The staff going on duty have to remove all outer clothing, pass through an [[airlock]] and put on a new set of PPE. When a staff member is going off duty, they are required to take a thorough shower and leave everything that was taken into the room to be disinfected or destroyed. While  strict barrier nursing methods cannot always be enforced, especially in lower income areas and countries, any modifications made must be based on sound principles. Since infection can be spread through [[fomite]]s, clothes or oxygen, all efforts must be made to limit the spread of these vessels.  The doctor's or nurse's hands must be thoroughly washed after touching anything in the cubicle. Taps and door-handles should be elbow- or foot-operated.  Hands should be washed in the cubicle and dried outside to eliminate contamination from paper or cloth towels. In addition, [[antiseptic]] hand-cream, dispensed from a foot-operated wall container would also serve as an additional precaution.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124169753000091|title=Emerging Infectious Diseases|last=Formenty|first=Pierre|date=2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780124169753|location=Amsterdam|pages=121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702051012000182|title=Manson's Tropical Infectious Diseases (Twenty-Third Edition)|last=Warrell|first=Mary J.|date=2014|publisher=W.B.

== Psychiatric effects of barrier nursing ==

=== Positive effects ===
* Older patients and patients with more experience are content with their situation and approach it with more positivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors = Barratt R, Shaban R, Moyle W|year = 2010|title = Behind barriers: patients’ perceptions of source isolation for Methicillin‑resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)|url=https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/35631|journal=Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing|volume=28|issue = 2|via=http://www.ajan.com.au/ajan_28.2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some patients enjoy the experience of privacy and quietness that a single barrier room provided.

=== Negative effects ===
* Barrier nursing/isolation influences the quality of care and opportunity for emotional support of the patient.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Barrier nursing imposes barriers on the expression of a patient's own identity and any normal interpersonal relationships that he/she may have.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Barrier nursing can lead to anxiety, anger, frustration and fear especially if the patient isn't given enough information, or incorrect information on their disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Barrier nursing equipment can sometimes aggravate the social stigma associated with their infectious disease.
''Although participants understood the importance for Personalized Protective equipment, they still found that its use increased their fear and sense of stigma.'' &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Placing patients in barrier nursing rooms may expose them to less medical care or access to associated treatment.
''Many researchers have indicated that healthcare professionals may regard a patient in source isolation differently from others. In studies regarding barrier nursing of patients with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] , medical staff admitted to spending less time with patients in source isolation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;''

=== Solutions to negative effects of barrier nursing/isolation ===
* Empowering patients with accurate and meaningful information about their disease as a means of coping with their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/6552913/'Patient_perspective'__psychological_effects_of_barrier_nursing_isolation_|title=PRIME PubMed {{!}} 'Patient perspective'--psychological effects of barrier nursing isolatio|website=www.unboundmedicine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Providing accurate information for family and visitors in order to ensure or reduce their initial ill‑informed fear of becoming infected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Ensuring patients have access to a telephone as a means of communication with the outside world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Designing facilities with windows and free space that allow patients to see the outside world and mitigate their feelings of confinement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Origin==
The exercise was named in the 1930s for American [[physiologist]] Royal H. Burpee, who developed the ''burpee test''. He earned a Ph.D. in [[applied physiology]] from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1940 and created the "burpee" exercise as part of his Ph.D. thesis as a quick and simple way to assess fitness.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pk.tc.columbia.edu/item/Seven-Quickly-Administered-Tests-Of-Physical-Capacity-And-Their-Use-In-Detecting-Physical-Incapacity-For-Motor-Activity-In-Men-And-Boys-51865 |title=Reference extract from Teachers College, Columbia University archive |work= |publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was popularized when the United States Armed Services adopted it as a way to assess the fitness level of recruits when the US entered [[World War II]]. Consisting of a series of the exercises performed in rapid succession, the test was meant to be a quick measure of agility, coordination, and strength.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/burpee |title=Definition of burpee from Oxford Dictionaries Online |work= |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progression ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The way to perform a burpee as originally intended has progressed since the 1930s. The up phase of the burpee used to be with the feet landing between the hands while still grounded, which creates unnecessary pressure on the lower back. It's now more common to land the feet on the outside of the hands.

== Confusion ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The burpee is sometimes confused with a [[Sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]]. A sprawl is similar to the burpee with the main difference being that the hips are thrust towards the ground in the plank position.

== Variants ==

; Muscle-up burpee : Combine a muscle-up (a variation of a [[pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]]) with the jump or do a muscle-up instead of the jump.
; One-armed burpee : The athlete uses only one arm for the whole exercise including the [[pushup]].
; One leg burpee : The athlete stands on one leg, bends at the waist and puts hands on ground so they are aligned with shoulders. Next jump back with the standing leg to plank position.

; Side burpee : The athlete bends at waist and places hand shoulder-width apart to the side of right or left foot.  Jump both legs out to side and land on the outer and inner sides of your feet.  Jump back in, jump up, and repeat on opposite side.
; Squat Thrust : Same as a four-count burpee.
; Tuck-jump burpee : The athlete pulls their knees to their chest (tucks) at the peak of the jump.

'''John Hunt''' (born 16 July 1981) is an Irish citizen who was [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily detained]] as a psychiatric patient. The conditions of Hunt's detention have been the subject of a sustained campaign by his former partner and mother of his child Gráinne Humphrys. He was committed as an involuntary psychiatric patient in 2005 and was detained at a secure psychiatric unit in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] until August 2011 when he was transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, [[Dundrum, Dublin|Dundrum]], [[Dublin]]. Until 2010 he was not granted leave for any temporary release from the Cork facility to visit his family. As a result of the campaign of his former partner that year the Cork hospital allowed Hunt six hours unsupervised leave every two weeks. However, following a violent altercation with a psychiatric nurse this leave was rescinded and Hunt was transferred to the main Irish [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic]] psychiatric unit in Dundrum.

As of 2013, Humphrys is still being quoted in the Irish press about Hunt's apparently ongoing psychiatric detention: "I am very critical about how his admission was dealt with – it was with the use of force and coercion. He didn’t want to take the medication at the time of his admission and I thought, fair enough. I couldn’t understand why there was not a better method of communication that we could use with him, like open dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/admission-assistants-authorised-officers-hse-983736-Jul2013/ Number of admission assistants for mental health patients halved since 2007]  Christina Finn with Support of the [[Mary Raftery]] Journalism Fund, [[TheJournal.ie]], 24/07/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

At the time of Hunt's birth, his family lived in the small, coastal town of [[Greystones]] in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]]. His father was a violent alcoholic and his mother had few supports in raising her children. His four-year-old brother drowned when he was eleven years old. Thereafter, Hunt began getting into fights and taking drugs. Humphrys attributes these behaviours to his history of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] and [[Self-esteem#Low self-esteem|low self-esteem]]. His first breakdown occurred shortly after the end of his relationship with his first long-term girlfriend. Humphrys has expressed the view in relation to Hunt's history that, 'trauma and loss, amongst other factors, form the bedrock of John’s problems — his so-called [[attachment disorder]] and [[paranoid schizophrenia]].'&lt;ref name="trapped"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hough| first = Jennifer| title = Trapped in a system without hope| work = Irish Examiner| accessdate = 2011-08-05| date = 2011-08-05| url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/trapped-in-a-system-without-hope-163301.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Involuntary committal and medication==

John Hunt was a resident of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]]. He experienced a breakdown while his then partner, Gráinne Humphrys, was pregnant with their child, Joshua. Frightened for his safety, Hunt's mother, Marion Hunt, instigated committal proceedings against her son.&lt;ref name="prisoner"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Allen| first = Christine| title = Psychiatric prisoner| work = Cork Independent| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-07-17| url = http://archive.corkindependent.com/local-news/local-news/psychiatric-prisoner/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was deemed a danger to himself, this led to his [[involuntary commitment|involuntary committal]] in 2006 at the [[Carrig Mór Centre]], a [[Psychiatric intensive-care unit|Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)]] in [[Shanakiel]], Cork.&lt;ref name="overriding"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Allen| first = Christine| title = Overriding culture| work = Cork Independent| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-06-24| url = http://archive.corkindependent.com/local-news/local-news/overriding-culture/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carraig Mór Centre is a two-storey building that was formerly part of the now defunct [[Our Lady's Hospital (Cork)|Our Lady's Hospital]] (Cork District Mental Hospital). Hunt was under the management of a [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] team in an 18-bed unit for involuntary patients deemed to have behavioural difficulties arising from their mental condition. Subsequent to his admission, he received a variety of diagnoses including [[Stimulant psychosis|drug-induced psychosis]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hough| first = Jennifer| title = System fails John as cry for freedom falls on deaf ears| work = Irish Examiner| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-07-19| url = http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/system-fails-john-as-cry-for-freedom-falls-on-deaf-ears-125519.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family visits at Carraig Mór were carried out in a small CCTV-monitored room at the facility that has been described as "cramped" and "uninviting".&lt;ref name="trapped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prisoner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="system"/&gt; 

Since his committal Hunt has been [[Involuntary treatment|forcibly medicated]] with a diverse range of [[psychoactive drug]]s including the [[typical antipsychotic]]s [[zuclopenthixol]] and [[chlorpromazine]], the [[atypical antipsychotic]] [[amisulpride]], benzodiazepines and sleeping tablets. They have had various adverse [[side effects]] and Humphrys expressed the view that he was "completely over-medicated".&lt;ref name="chemical"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Allen| first = Christine| title = Chemical Crucifixion| work = Cork Independent| date = 2011-01-21| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forced"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Allen| first = Christine| title = Forced treatment| work = Cork Independent| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-10-28| url = http://archive.corkindependent.com/local-news/local-news/forced-treatment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital authorities at Carraig Mór considered Hunt a 'chronic' patient and 'suitable' for long-term hospitalisation.&lt;ref name="system1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hough| first = Jennifer| title = System fails John as cry for freedom falls on deaf ears| work = Irish Examiner| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-07-19
| url = http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/system-fails-john-as-cry-for-freedom-falls-on-deaf-ears-125519.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign ==

In 2007 Humphrys began a campaign seeking to end 'The Incarceration of John'. The Irish Examiner has noted that she gained substantial attention to his case, powerfully portraying him as a lost soul imprisoned against his will and cut off from his family.&lt;ref name="trapped"/&gt; 

In the summer of 2010 former [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] Senator, [[Dan Boyle (politician)|Dan Boyle]], visited Hunt at the Carraig Mór facility. Senator Boyle acknowledged that Hunt was 'physically cared for' but expressed concern 'about the overriding culture of excessive medication there'. He also noted that Hunt 'was only allowed minimum contact with the outside world' and that he did not have access to a rehabilitation programme.&lt;ref name="overriding"/&gt; Humphrys argues that Hunt's treatment at the facility damaged him mentally and physically and she has characterised the mental health system as punitive and fostering dependency in patients.&lt;ref name="dehumanising"/&gt; She has also alleged that her former partner suffered in the facility as he has been perceived as non-compliant.&lt;ref name="dehumanising"/&gt;

Three days after Senator Boyle's visit to Hunt he called for a debate in the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] on 'the culture of mental health and psychiatric care services' in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Seanad"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Seanad Éireann| title = Seanad Eireann Debate: vol. 203, no. 8. Order of Business: Tuesday, 22 June 2010| work = Houses of the Oireachtas| accessdate = 2011-08-01| url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2010/06/22/00004.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his address Senator Boyle referred to his visit to the Cork psychiatric hospital and the fact that Hunt had only seen his son outside of that institution once in the previous four years.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Walsh| first = Jimmy| title = Call for review of psychiatric 'detention': Seanad report| work = Irish Times| accessdate = 2011-08-01| date = 2010-06-23| url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0623/1224273108334.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2010, following the campaign's expanded media presence and Senator Boyle's visit to Carraig Mór, Hunt was granted day release without supervision.&lt;ref name="dehumanising"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hough| first = Jennifer| title = ‘Dehumanising’ mental services widely criticised| work = Irish Examiner| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2010-11-11| url = http://examiner.ie/ireland/dehumanising-mental-services-widely-criticised-136098.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was allowed a six-hour pass every two weeks and, according to Humphrys, this reconnection with the world outside of the secure [[psychiatric hospital]] gave him 'new hope for his future'.&lt;ref name="forced"/&gt; Reflecting on Hunt's experience of the mental health system as a patient and her own as the partner and advocate of a psychiatric patient, Humphrys wrote to the medical authorities of the Carraig Mór Centre in early 2011 outlining her grievances, which was reproduced in the press.&lt;ref name="trapped"/&gt;

==Transfer to the Central Mental Hospital==
[[File:Central Mental Hospital, Windy Arbour - geograph.org.uk - 418279.jpg|thumb|Dundrum Road entrance to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin]]

Hunt's fortnightly passes were rescinded following an incident in June 2011 when he struck a male member of staff.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cork family fights against Central Mental Hospital transfer|newspaper=Cork Independent|date=2011-08-18|accessdate=2011-09-03|last=Allen|first=Christine|url=http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/3923/2011-33/Locked-up-and-lost|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105102338/http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/3923/2011-33/Locked-up-and-lost#|archive-date=2012-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities at the Carraig Mór Centre also barred all visits to Hunt by non-family members.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCarthy| first = John| title = Society's dilemma now!| work = Cork Independent| accessdate = 2011-07-31| date = 2011-06-23| url = http://www.corkindependent.com/stories/item/2672/2011-25/-Society%27s-dilemma-now!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context and causes of the incident, surrounding an attempted phonecall to his son, and whether it was properly investigated, were highlighted and contested by his family.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite news|title=Justice belongs to all or none|last=McCarthy|first=John|newspaper=Cork Independent|date=2011-08-18|accessdate=2011-09-03|url=http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/3868/2011-33/Justice-belongs-to-all-or-none|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020023319/http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/3868/2011-33/Justice-belongs-to-all-or-none#|archive-date=2011-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities at Carraig Mór reported the incident to the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] (the Irish police force) and also sent a report to the [[Mental Health Commission]], who directed that the incident should be addressed by a [[Mental Health Tribunal]]. His family and solicitor were not allowed to attend and were not consulted. The tribunal ruled that Hunt should be transferred to the [[Central Mental Hospital]], Dundrum, the main forensic psychiatric facility in Ireland.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; 

The Irish [[Health Service Executive]] has responded that it is the goal of the mental health services to “work in a collaborative way with patients and their families to ensure the best outcome possible for people who need mental health services”.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; They also stated that, “All patients detained under the Mental Health Act have access to independent legal advice. Their detention under the mental health act is reviewed at regular intervals by an independent mental health review tribunal. This tribunal has the power to end the patient’s detention".&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

Prior to his transfer Humphreys stated that she and Hunt's family were apprehensive about the plan to relocate him but that they remained hopeful that better rehabilitative services would be available to him in Dundrum than were accessible at Carraig Mór; she said Hunt was very worried about it but also it may be something new, though he was concerned he would never be released. John McCarthy, a mental health campaigner and the founder of [[Mad Pride]] Ireland, likened the facilities of John's detention as a form of "jail" where patients were held with "no judge, jury or release date".&lt;ref name="transferred"&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychiatric patient to be transferred to CMH|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=2011-08-12|accessdate=2011-09-03|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/psychiatric-patient-to-be-transferred-to-cmh-163951.html|first=Jennifer|last=Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
In Mauritania, it is illegal to grow, sell, possess, or use cannabis. In 1977, hearings before the US House stated that the Mauritanian Drug Enforcement Administration lacked the staff and training to adequately deal with the cannabis issue in the country. Officials presenting the hearings recommended that the country adopt harsher laws on cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. House.

Mauritania is part of a cannabis-trafficking route extending from Morocco through Mauritania and on to Mali, then overland to Egypt and eventually to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the International Narcotics Control Board (2007)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zPbkldHMq4C&amp;pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-0280-8|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one-third of Moroccan cannabis transits this [[Sahel]] route.&lt;ref name="AlcaroPirozzi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Riccardo Alcaro|author2=Nicoletta Pirozzi|title=Transatlantic Security from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2y-pAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|date=21 May 2014|publisher=Edizioni Nuova Cultura|isbn=978-88-6812-273-7|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco chooses to go through Mauritania to export its cannabis to avoid Algerian soils, the two countries being in a feud since the Western Sahara issue.&lt;ref name="carnegieendowment 49360"&gt;Wolfram Lacher, [https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/09/13/organized-crime-and-conflict-in-sahel-sahara-region-pub-49360 Organized Crime and Conflict in the Sahel-Sahara Region], ''Carnegieendowment.org'', 13 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Mauritania President [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]] stirred a controversy when he reduced the sentence of 5 cocaine smugglers, and a few months later the court released 30 convicted smugglers. In 2012, a smuggling network was dismantled, and it was discovered that it was using a special permit to cross the border delivered by the former head of police of Mauritania.&lt;ref name="carnegieendowment 49360"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WehreyBoukhars2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederic Wehrey|author2=Anouar Boukhars|title=Perilous Desert: Insecurity in the Sahara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQuVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|date=2 April 2013|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-87003-405-3|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz highlighted in a report on [[Western Sahara]] submitted to the [[UN Security Council]] by [[Ban Ki-moon]] that «considerable quantity of cannabis resin» goes from Morocco to eastern Africa through Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://allafrica.com/stories/201504202237.html West Africa: Mauritania Denounces the Threat of Moroccan Cannabis for the Sahel-Saharan Region (UN Report)], ''Allafrica.com'', 18 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When journalists of ''Al-Bayan'' elaborated on this idea in an article, it caused a diplomatic turmoil, and the chief adviser in the Algerian embassy in Nouakchott was expelled on the basis that Algeria was the source of those «lies and false allegations».&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/2015/04/27/Mauritania-Algeria-in-diplomatic-crisis-over-drugs-article-.html Mauritania, Algeria in diplomatic crisis over drugs article], ''Alarabiya.com'', 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizures===
A 2009 UN report on drug trafficking still considered that Mauritania lacked to resources to address its drug issues, and observed that very few drug seizures had been recorded in the country.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BEELAflkpPEC Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2009], ''United Nations Publications'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the Mauritanian authorities seized 2 tons of cannabis in [[Nouadhibou]], and 3.6 tons in [[Timbedra]] in May 2012.&lt;ref name="carnegieendowment 49360"/&gt;

In February 2016, the Mauritanian justice charged and jailed 11 people involved in a seizure of 1.3 tons of cannabis. The news report stated that a son of former president [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]] was involved in the traffick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/2016/02/06/11-arrested-in-mauritania-in-connection-with-13-tonnes-of-drugs-seized// 11 arrested in Mauritania in connection with 1.3 tonnes of drugs seized], ''Africanews.com'', 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, the Moroccan authorities seized 3.13 tons of cannabis in a truck at the [[Guerguarate]] crossing point between Morocco and Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-02/23/c_136080507.htm Morocco seizes over 3 tons of cannabis at crossing point with Mauritania], ''Xinhuanet.conm'', 23 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, at the same Guerguarate crossing point, the Moroccan authorities seized 7.42 tons of cannabis in a truck heading to Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://themaghrebtimes.com/03/13/morocco-seizes-7-42-tons-cannabis-crossing-point-mauritania/ Morocco seizes 7.42 tons of cannabis at crossing point with Mauritania], ''Themaghrebtimes.com'', 13 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
A 1996 report notes that small cannabis plots, irrigated by a dam on the [[Senegal river]], have been found in Southern Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Geopolitics of Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoDaAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Northeastern University Press|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">'''Carctol''' is an ineffective cancer treatment made by mixing eight Indian herbs.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Cancer | website=Cancer Research UK | date=30 August 2017 | url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer | access-date=8 August 2018|quote=there isn't any scientific evidence to prove that it is safe or works as a treatment for any type of illness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carctol has been aggressively marketed as being able to treat cancer and reduce the side-effects of [[chemotherapy]]. However, there is no [[medical evidence]] that it has any benefits whatsoever for people with cancer.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt;

==Background and promotion==

Carctol is a herbal dietary supplement marketed with claims it is based on traditional [[ayurvedic medicine]].&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; Its ingredients include ''[[Hemidesmus indicus]]'', ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'', ''[[Piper cubeba]]'', ''[[Ammani vesicatoria]]'', ''[[Lepidium sativum]]'', ''[[Blepharis edulis]]'', ''[[Smilax china]]'', and ''[[Rheum emodi]]''.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt;

It was first promoted in 1968 by Nandlal Tiwari.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; In 2009, [[Edzard Ernst]] wrote that it was still promoted in the [[United Kingdom]]; public relations companies hired by its sellers had garnered it wide coverage on the web and,&lt;ref name=ernst/&gt; according to the [[British Medical Journal]], in the media generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.804|title=PR coup for herbal cancer drug|year=2004|last1=Marks|first1=N.|journal=BMJ|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness and response==

[[Cancer Research UK]] say of Carctol, "available scientific evidence does not support its use for the treatment of cancer in humans".&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; Edzard Ernst has written "the claim that Carctol is of any benefit to cancer patients is not supported by scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=ernst&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000193025|title=Carctol: Profit before Patients? | year=2009 | last1=Ernst | first1=Edzard | authorlink=Edzard Ernst | journal=Breast Care | volume=4 | pages=31–33 | pmid=20877681 | issue=1 | pmc=2942009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harriet A. Hall]] includes Carctol among the biologically-based remedies promoted by [[naturopath]]s. Hall laments that frauds and [[quackery|quacks]] persistently try to take advantage of the vulnerability of cancer patients.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1179/1743291X12Y.0000000009|title=CAM for cancer: Preying on desperate people?|year=2012|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet A.| authorlink = Harriet A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29751">'''Childhood trauma''' has profound [[Psychological trauma|psychological]], [[Allostatic load|physiological]], and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. Referred to in academic literature as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), childhood trauma ranges from [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] to [[Child neglect|neglect]] to living in a household where a parent or sibling is treated violently or there is a parent with a mental illness. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|study on adverse childhood experiences]] determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html | publisher = Centers for Diesase Control | access-date = 6 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 30 years of study following the initial study has confirmed this. Many states, health providers, and other groups now routinely screen parents and children for ACEs.

=== Psychological impact===
{{Main|Stress in Early Childhood}}
Childhood trauma can increase the risk of [[mental disorder]]s including [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]), [[Attachment theory|attachment]] issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments.

=== Epigenetics ===
Child abuse can leave tracks, not only physically and emotionally, but also in the form of ''epigenetic marks'' on a child's genes. Although these epigenetic marks do not cause mutations in the DNA itself, the chemical modifications-including DNA methylation-change gene expression by silencing (or activating) genes. This can alter fundamental biological processes and adversely affect health outcomes throughout [https://www.genome.gov/27554258/child-abuse-leaves-epigenetic-marks/ life].  A 2013 study found that people who had experienced childhood trauma had different neuropathology than people with PTSD from trauma experienced after childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehta D, Klengel T, Conneely KN, Smith AK, Altmann A, Pace TW, Rex-Haffner M, Loeschner A, Gonik M, Mercer KB, Bradley B, Müller-Myhsok B, Ressler KJ, Binder EB | title = Childhood maltreatment is associated with distinct genomic and epigenetic profiles in posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 20 | pages = 8302–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23630272 | pmc = 3657772 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1217750110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study in rhesus macaques showed that DNA methylation changes related to early-life adversity persisted into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Provençal N, Suderman MJ, Guillemin C, Massart R, Ruggiero A, Wang D, Bennett AJ, Pierre PJ, Friedman DP, Côté SM, Hallett M, Tremblay RE, Suomi SJ, Szyf M | display-authors = 6 | title = The signature of maternal rearing in the methylome in rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex and T cells | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 32 | issue = 44 | pages = 15626–42 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23115197 | pmc = 3490439 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1470-12.2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socioeconomic costs of childhood trauma ==
The social and economic costs of child abuse and neglect are difficult to calculate. Some costs are straightforward and directly related to maltreatment, such as hospital costs for medical treatment of injuries sustained as a result of physical abuse and foster care costs resulting from the removal of children when they cannot remain safely with their families. Other costs, less directly tied to the incidence of abuse, include lower academic achievement, adult criminality, and lifelong mental health problems. Both direct and indirect costs impact society and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/impact/consequences/|title=Social and Economic Consequences of Child Abuse and Neglect|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |website=Child Welfare Information Gateway}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preventchildabuse.org/resource/the-estimated-annual-cost-of-child-abuse-and-neglect/|title=The Estimated Annual Cost of Child Abuse and Neglect | website = Prevent Child Abuse America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgenerational effects==
{{main|Transgenerational trauma}}

We can pass our epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to our children. The effects of trauma can be transferred from one generation of childhood trauma survivors to subsequent generations of offsprings. This is known as [[transgenerational trauma]] or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Maggie | last = Fox | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2 May 2016 | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/poor-parenting-can-be-passed-generation-generation-study-n566036 | title = Poor Parenting Can Be Passed From Generation to Generation | work = NBC News | access-date = 2017-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueknot.org.au/WHAT-WE-DO/Resources/General-Information/Compromise-adult-health|title=Childhood trauma compromises health via diverse pathways| website = The Blue Knot Foundation |access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crowwingenergized.org/adverse-childhood-experiences-aces-mental-illness-of-a-parent/|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs): Mental Illness of a Parent | website = Crow Wing Energized  |access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth TL | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in the development of behavior: advances, challenges, and future promises of a new field | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 25 | issue = 4 Pt 2 | pages = 1279–91 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24342840 | pmc = 4080409 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579413000618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feder A, Nestler EJ, Charney DS | title = Psychobiology and molecular genetics of resilience | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Resilience==
{{main|Psychological resilience}}

Exposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnow|first=B.

When an individual who is high in resilience experiences a potentially traumatic event, their relative level of functioning does not significantly deviate from the level of functioning they exhibited prior to exposure to a potentially traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, that same individual may recover more quickly and successfully from a potentially traumatic experience than an individual who could be said to be less resilient.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In children, level of functioning is operationalized as the child continuing to behave in a manner that is considered developmentally appropriate for a child of that age.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Level of functioning is also measured by the presence of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and so on.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== '''Factors that Affect Resilience''' ===
Factors that affect resilience include cultural factors like socio-economic status, such that having more resources at one’s disposal usually equates to more resilience to trauma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the severity and duration of the potentially traumatic experience affect the likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes as a result of childhood trauma.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One factor that does not affect resilience is gender, with both males and females being equally sensitive to risk and protective factors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cognitive ability is also not a predictor of resilience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Attachment has been shown to be one of the most important factors to consider when it comes to evaluating the relative resilience of an individual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Children with secure attachments to an adult with effective coping strategies were most likely to endure adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in an adaptive manner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Secure attachments throughout the lifespan (including in adolescence and adulthood) appear to be equally important in fostering and maintaining resilience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Secure attachment to one’s peers throughout adolescence is a particularly strong predictor of resilience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within the context of abuse, it is thought that these secure attachments decrease the extent to which children who are abused perceive others as being untrustworthy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, while some children who are abused might begin to view other people as being unsafe and unable to be trusted, children who are able to develop and maintain healthy relationships are less likely to hold these views. Children who experience trauma but also experience healthy attachment with multiple groups of people (in essence, adults, peers, romantic partners, etc.) throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are particularly resilient.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Personality also affects the development (or lack of development) of adult psychopathology as a result of childhood abuse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Individuals who scored low in neuroticism exhibit fewer negative outcomes, such as psychopathology, criminal activity, and poor physical health, after exposure to a potentially traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, individuals with higher scores on openness to experience, conscientiousness, and extraversion have been found to be more resilient to the effects of childhood trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Hubbard|first2=Brock|date=1996|title=Adaptational Style and Dispositional Structure: Coping in the Context of the Five-Factor Model|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00943.x|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=64|issue=4|pages=737–774|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00943.x|issn=0022-3506|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell-Sills|first=Laura|last2=Cohan|first2=Sharon L.|last3=Stein|first3=Murray B.|date=2006|title=Relationship of resilience to personality, coping, and psychiatric symptoms in young adults|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000579670500104X|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=44|issue=4|pages=585–599|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.05.001|issn=0005-7967|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Enhancing Resilience''' ===
One of the most common misconceptions about resilience is that individuals who show resilience are somehow special or extraordinary in some way.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Successful adaptation, or resilience, is quite common among children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is due in part to the naturally adaptive nature of childhood development. Therefore, resilience is enhanced by protecting against factors that might undermine a child's inborn resilience.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Studies suggest that resiliency can be enhanced by providing children who have been exposed to trauma with environments in which they feel safe and are able to securely attach to a healthy adult.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=Yates|first=Tuppett M.|title=Rethinking Resilience: A Developmental Process Perspective|date=2003|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/resilience-and-vulnerability/rethinking-resilience-a-developmental-process-perspective/63291D71377B6AB05456044A2AFE28DD|work=Resilience and Vulnerability|volume=|pages=243–266|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511615788.012|isbn=9780511615788|access-date=2018-11-20|last2=Egeland|first2=Byron|last3=Sroufe|first3=L. Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, interventions that promote strong parent-child bonds are particularly effective at buffering against the potential negative effects of trauma.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Furthermore, researchers of resilience argue that successful adaptation is not merely an end result but rather a developmental process that is ongoing throughout a person’s lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Thus, successful promotion of resilience must also be ongoing throughout a person’s lifespan.

== Prognosis==
Trauma affects all children differently (see [[Stress in early childhood#Levels of stress|Stress in early childhood]]). Some children who experience trauma develop significant and long-lasting problems, while others may have minimal symptoms and recover more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services | publisher = Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (US) | series = Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series | volume = 57 | location = Rockville (MD) | date = 2014 | chapter = Chapter 3, Understanding the Impact of Trauma. | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that despite the broad impacts of trauma, children can and do recover, and that trauma-informed care and interventions produce better outcomes than “treatment as usual”. Trauma-informed care is defined as offering services or support in a way that addresses the special needs of people who have experienced trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. | title = SAMHSA's Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma-Informed Approach | url = https://store.samhsa.gov/product/SAMHSA-s-Concept-of-Trauma-and-Guidance-for-a-Trauma-Informed-Approach/SMA14-4884 | location = Rockville, MD | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical trauma ===
Medical Trauma, sometimes called "pediatric medical traumatic stress" refers to a set of psychological and physiological responses of children and their families to pain, injury, serious illness, medical procedures, and invasive or frightening treatment experiences.

'''Daydreaming''' is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake. 

There are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst [[psychologists]], however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]].&lt;ref name="Klinger"&gt;Klinger, Eric (October 1987). ''[[Psychology Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and the negative vs. positive aspects==
[[File:Helleu - Daydream.jpg|thumb|right|''Daydream'' by [[Paul César Helleu]]]]
Negative aspects of daydreaming were stressed after human work became dictated by the motion of the tool. As [[craft production]] was largely replaced by [[assembly line]] that did not allow for any creativity, no place was left for positive aspects of daydreaming. It not only became associated with laziness, but also with danger.

For example, in the late 19th century, Toni Nelson argued that some daydreams with grandiose fantasies are self-gratifying attempts at "wish fulfillment". Still in the 1950s, some educational [[psychologist]]s warned parents not to let their children daydream, for fear that the children may be sucked into "[[neurosis]] and even [[psychosis]]".&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;

==Psychological studies==
[[The Interpretation of Dreams|Freudian psychology]] interpreted daydreaming as expression of the repressed instincts similarly to those revealing themselves in nighttime [[dreams]]. Like nighttime dreams, daydreams, also, are an example of wish-fulfilment (based on infantile experiences), and are allowed to surface because of relaxed censorship. He pointed out that, in contrast to nighttime dreams, which are often confusing and incoherent, there seems to be a process of "secondary revision" in fantasies that makes them more lucid, like daydreaming. The state of daydreaming is a kind of liminal state between waking (with the ability to think rationally and logically) and sleeping. They stand in much the same relation to the childhood memories from which they are derived as do some of the Baroque palaces of Rome to the ancient ruins whose pavements and columns have provided the material for the more recent structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=J.|title=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume V (1900-1901): The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part) and On Dreams.|year=1953|publisher=The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis|location=London|pages=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists Jerome L. Singer of [[Yale University]] and John S. Antrobus of the [[City College of New York]], created a daydream [[questionnaire]]. The questionnaire, called the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI), has been used to investigate daydreams. Psychologists Leonard Giambra and George Huba used the IPI and found that daydreamers' imaginary images vary in three ways: how vivid or enjoyable the daydreams are, how many guilt- or fear-filled daydreams they have, and how "deeply" into the daydream people go.&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;
 
[[Humanistic psychology]] on other hand, found numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[musical composer|composers]], [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Recent research==
Eric Klinger's research in the 1980s showed that most daydreams are about ordinary, everyday events and help to remind us of mundane tasks. Klinger's research also showed that over 75% of workers in "boring jobs", such as [[lifeguard]]s and [[truck driver]]s, use vivid daydreams to "ease the boredom" of their routine tasks. Klinger found that fewer than 5% of the workers' daydreams involved explicitly sexual thoughts and that violent daydreams were also uncommon.&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt;

Israeli high school students who scored high on the Daydreaming Scale of the IPI had more [[empathy]] than students who scored low. Some psychologists use the mental imagery created during their clients' daydreaming to help gain insight into their mental state and make diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vaitl, J. Gruzelier, D. Lehmann et al., "Psychobiology of Altered States of Consciousness," ''Psychological Bulletin'', vol. 131, no. 1, 2005, pp. 98–127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=The Daydream |title= The Head Trip: Adventures on the Wheel of Consciousness |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-679-31408-0 |first=Jeff |last=Warren |publisher=Random House Canada |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent research has also shown that daydreaming, much like nighttime dreaming, is a time when the brain consolidates learning. Daydreaming may also help people to sort through problems and achieve success. Research with [[fMRI]] shows that brain areas associated with complex problem-solving become activated during daydreaming episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511180702.htm |title=Brain's Problem-solving Function At Work When We Daydream |date=2009-05-12 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christoff |first=Kalina |author2=Alan M.

Research by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] has found that people who experience vivid [[dream]]-like [[mental image]]s reserve the word for these, whereas many other people when they talk about "daydreaming" refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of past memories, or just "spacing out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = D.

==Existing weir==
Dummugudem weir across the [[Godavari River]] was constructed nearly 150 years back by the famous British India engineer Sir [[Arthur Cotton]] who also constructed  [[Dowleswaram Barrage |  Dowleswaram]] and [[Prakasam Barrage|Prakasam ]] barrages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/protest-against-demolition-of-anicut/article4057783.ece&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of this weir was not for diverting the river water into canals but to use as cross over bridge during lean flow season. This weir has lost its relevance after construction of all weather road bridge near [[Bhadrachalam]] town to cross the river. A 24 MW hydroelectric station is constructed to use the level drop available across the Dummugudem weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.slsgroup.co.in/dummagudem.html |title= Dummagudem hydel project |accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jyothi Rao Pule Dummugudem Nagarjunasagar Sujala Sravanthi Project==
{{See also |Nagarjuna Sagar Dam # Godavari water transfer via Nagarjuna Sagar left canal}}
This project is also called Dummugudem to Sagar tail pond lift canal project. The canal starts from Dummugudem pond at {{Coord|17|57|43|N|80|51|31|E|name=Anantharam}} to [[Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond]] located across the [[Krishna River]]. This lift canal is an inter river basin transfer link by feeding Godavari river water from the Dummugudem pond to Krishna river basin to the extent of 165 [[tmcft]]. The total length of the canal is 244 km and the capacity of the canal is 22,000 [[cusec]]s to feed 165 tmcft water in three months duration of the monsoon season. Presently, the canal is planned to terminate at {{Coord|16|47|19|N|79|19|03|E|name=Halia}} by feeding the water into the Halia river to reach the downstream Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond. The required pumping head is 128 meters for the elevation difference of 30 meters between Dummugudem pond (45 [[Mean sea level|MSL]]) and Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond (75 MSL). Dummugudem pond to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal is entirely located in [[Telangana State]] and needs to be routed through high lands which necessitated more pumping head.&lt;ref name=dummu/&gt;

If this canal were to be terminated in to deep cut portion of [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam|Nagarjuna Sagar]] left canal near {{Coord|16|44|41|N|79|16|59|E|name=Alwala}}, water can reach by gravity to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir when its water level is at minimum draw down level of {{convert|155|m|ft|0}} MSL. It is more economical and purposeful to install a pump house drawing water from the deep cut portion of the canal to pump water up to Nagarjuna Sagar full reservoir level at {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} MSL with nearly 27 meters lift. Thus it is a viable project by eliminating the need of lifting water by 80 meters from tail pond to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir. This saved pumping head can be used to pump water from the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir to [[Srisailam Dam|Srisailam reservoir]] for supplying irrigation water to Kalwakurthi lift irrigation Scheme, Srisailam left bank canal, Dindi lift irrigation scheme, Palamuru lift canal, Nettampadu lift, Bhima lift, etc located in Telangana with 100% water dependability for all the projects drawing water from the Krishna river.

== Alternate to Dummugudem to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal==
{{Main|Polavaram Project}}

An alternative link canal to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond from [[Polavaram Project|Polavaram dam]] is also economically feasible to transfer [[Godavari]] water. This link canal passes entirely through the coastal Andhra region only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6048">The '''fit-and-proper-person test''' or '''director's test''' is a test aiming to prevent corrupt or untrustworthy people from serving on the board of certain organizations. First introduced in 2004 for owners and directors of major British football clubs, since November 2014 it also applies to the [[National Health Service in England]] for board members of [[NHS Trust]]s under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.

==Application to the National Health Service==

Directors of NHS Trusts can be deemed unfit if they have been involved in “serious misconduct or mismanagement”. The test is supervised by the [[Care Quality Commission]] but decisions are made by individual trusts.

A Trust must be satisfied that its directors are:
* of good character - consideration must be given to previous convictions and removal from a professional register when assessing this;
* and have the qualifications, competence, skills and experience necessary for their office;
* and are capable (once reasonable adjustments have been made) of performing tasks intrinsic to their job by reason of their health.

A trust must not “appoint or have in place” a director who has been responsible for, privy to, contributed to or facilitated any serious misconduct or mismanagement (whether unlawful or not) in the course of carrying on a regulated activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The CQC's new fit and proper persons test explained|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/leadership/insight-and-influence/the-cqcs-new-fit-and-proper-persons-test-explained/5077078.article#.VQM71_ysVyU|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CQC  received referrals from campaigners and [[whistleblowers]] in January 2015 which alleged that more than 20 current and former NHS chief executives, medical directors and senior board level executives were unfit for their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Care watchdog will not shirk from action against trusts with 'unfit' directors, says chief inspector of hospitals|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/news/health/social-care/care-watchdog-will-not-shirk-from-action-against-trusts-with-unfit-directors-says-chief-inspector-of-hospitals/5083230.article|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Local Government Chronicle|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Football==
[[File:Stephenvaughan.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Vaughan fell foul of the test]]
The test, introduced in 2004, is mandated by the [[Premier League]], the [[Football League]], the [[National League (English football)|National League]] and the [[Scottish Premier League]]. Anybody who takes over a club, runs one, or owns over 30% of its shares must be assessed. The first director known to have failed the test was Dennis Coleman, director of [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] when they went into [[Administration (British football)|administration]] in 2006 and 2008. He claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I came in and in effect saved the club. It is totally unfair for me to be disqualified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/23/rotherham.leaguetwofootball|title=Family saga puts Rotherham through the mill|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-04-23|accessdate=2010-09-29|first=David|last=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2009, [[Stephen Vaughan, Sr.|Stephen Vaughan]], then owner of [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], became the first owner to fail the test, after he was legally disqualified from being a director of any company. This was a result of [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] fraud as owner of [[Widnes Vikings]] rugby club. He transferred control of Chester to his son, Stephen Vaughan, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/18/chester-city-fit-proper-person-test|title=Chester City chief becomes first owner to fail fit and proper person test|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=David|last=Conn|date=2009-11-18|accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] owner [[Craig Whyte]] was found not to be a fit and proper person as the result of an independent enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17302801|title=Rangers' Craig Whyte not fit and proper person - Scottish FA|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, [[Louis Tomlinson]], former footballer and member of the [[boy band]] [[One Direction]], and John Ryan, businessman and previous Chairman of [[Doncaster Rovers]], launched a bid to buy the club but one month later Ryan was found not to be a fit and proper person due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28353954|title=Louis Tomlinson: Doncaster Rovers takeover is off - John Ryan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disqualifying events===
The Premier League has tighter restrictions than the Football League or National League. In general, a businessman will fail the test if:
*They have power or influence over another Football League club
*They hold a significant interest in another Football League club
*They become prohibited by law from being a director
*They are filing for [[bankruptcy]]
*They have been director of a club while it has suffered two or more unconnected events of [[insolvency]]
*They have been a director of two or more clubs of which, while they have been director, has suffered an event of insolvency

The '''International Day of Happiness''' is celebrated worldwide every March 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/international-days/international-day-of-happiness.html|title=International Day of Happiness, 20 March {{!}} DSPD|website=DSPD|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was conceptualized and founded by philanthropist, activist, statesman, and prominent [[United Nations]] special advisor [[Jayme Illien]] to inspire, mobilize, and advance the global happiness movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/5485985|title=U.N.-designated day offers opportunity to reflect on what makes us happy|date=2016-03-20|work=NewsOK.com|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livehappy.com/practice/happiness-around-world|title=Happiness Around the World|website=Live Happy Magazine|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/article204770864.html|title=What’s the happiest city in America?

In 2011, Illien brought the idea and concept of creating a new global day of awareness, the International Day of Happiness, to senior [[United Nations]] Officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eventofday.com/international-day-happiness-20th-march/|title=International Day of Happiness - 20th March - Event Of Day|date=2017-11-24|work=Event Of Day|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illien successfully campaigned to unite a global coalition of all 193 United Nations [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]], and secured the endorsement of then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki moon]], to support the concept of establishing a new official international [http://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/international-days/index.html#March UN calendar day] of observance known as the International Day of Happiness.

Illien authored [https://happinessday.org/resolutions/ UN resolution 66/281] ”International Day of Happiness”, which was ultimately adopted by the unanimous consensus of all 193 UN member states of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on June 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://happinessday.org/video/world-happiness-summit-part-one/|title=World Happiness Summit Part One {{!}} International Day of Happiness|date=2018-03-14|work=International Day of Happiness|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayme Illien chose March 20 for its significance as the March [[equinox]], a universal phenomenon felt simultaneously by all of [[human]]kind, and which occurs the moment when the [[Celestial equator|plane]] of [[Earth]]'s [[equator]] passes through the center of the [[Sun]]'s disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-nations-international-day-of-happiness-founder-celebrates-30th-anniversary-of-institute-for-global-leadership-300264549.html|title=United Nations International Day of Happiness Founder celebrates 30th Anniversary of Institute for Global Leadership|last=Day|first=Happiness|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://happinessday.org/video/world-happiness-summit-part-one/|title=World Happiness Summit Part One {{!}} International Day of Happiness|date=2018-03-14|work=International Day of Happiness|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2012, Secretary General Ban Ki moon emphasized the importance of the new international day of happiness in his closing remarks to the 66th session of the UN General Assembly, “Mr. President, during your tenure, the General Assembly also instituted a new observance on the [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/international-days/international-day-of-happiness.html UN calendar]: the International Day of Happiness.  Let us hope that through our work, including in the new session that begins tomorrow, we can turn that aspiration into reality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2012-09-17/remarks-closing-66th-session-general-assembly|title=Remarks at closing of the 66th Session of the General Assembly {{!}} United Nations Secretary-General|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever international day of happiness was celebrated on March 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/frances-moore-lappe/got-happiness-first-un-in_b_2909084.html|title=Got Happiness?

Every March 20 since 2013, the International Day of Happiness is celebrated in 193 UN Member states,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/world/america-getting-unhappier-global-report-finds/A69cHgc3UyYQX49tuaN4pM/|title=America is getting unhappier, UN global report finds|work=ajc|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 observer states, and 11 territories.

On the 3rd every international day of happiness, UN Secretary Ban Ki moon said "Happiness for the entire human family is one of the main goals of the United Nations," and called upon all human beings to "dedicate our efforts to filling our world with happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/happinessday/2015/sgmessage.shtml|title=Slideshow (accessible version) for International Day of Happiness - 20 March|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and background of the International Day of Happiness==
Founded June 28, 2012 The International Day of Happiness Resolution 66/281 was the result of the effort of United Nations adviser Jayme Illien,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehappy.com/practice/happiness-around-world http://www.livehappy.com/practice/happiness-around-world]&lt;/ref&gt; who conceptualized the idea for a U.N. Resolution that would recognize the [[pursuit of happiness]] as a human right and a "fundamental human goal."

Jayme Illien, founder of the International Day of Happiness, and Illien Global Public Benefit Corporation, gained the support for the idea of the new International Day of Happiness from the President of the UN General Assembly and United Nations Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], as well as all 193 UN member states to draft and adopt a new UN resolution to create the new international day, the International Day of Happiness. Jayme Illien authored UN resolution 66/281 and campaigned for its adoption by consensus of all 193 member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehappy.com/practice/happiness-around-world http://www.livehappy.com/practice/happiness-around-world]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's background==

==History of happiness and notable historical figures==
UN Resolution 66/281: International Day of Happiness's adoption in 2012 marks a new historical milestone in humankind's ultimate quest for happiness, which dates back to the time of ancient sages and philosophers such as Bhudda, Socrates, Confucius, Aristotle, Plato, Epicurus, Mencius, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, and religious figures like Jesus, Abraham, Moses, and the prophet Muhammad – all of whom theorized about the purpose and [[meaning of life]], the definition of happiness, and how to achieve it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Gross global happiness and the first UN high-level meeting on happiness and wellbeing==
On April 2, 2012, the United Nations hosted the first high-level meeting on happiness and wellbeing: Defining A New Economic Paradigm. At this meeting of heads of state, ministers and high-level delegates from over thirty countries and intergovernmental organizations like the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki moon stated in pertinent that:

“We need a new economic paradigm that recognizes the parity between the three pillars of sustainable development. Social, economic and environmental well-being are indivisible. Together they define gross global happiness,” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41685#.VtgmD8ovpMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

This UN resolution marked the modern historical milestone of globalizing the Happiness Development Movement that started in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/happiness-economics/happiness-economics-gnh-timeline-history-milestones.htm  "Happiness Economics - Well-Being Economics - Historical Milestone - GNH Institute"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150320070110/http://gnh.institute/happiness-economics/happiness-economics-gnh-timeline-history-milestones.htm |date=20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution also celebrates a modern legal and constitutional history of humankind which recognizes happiness as a human right and goal.

'''''Kinesis''''' was a magazine published from 1974 to 2001, by Vancouver Status of Women,&lt;ref name="UBCDigital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinesis|website=http://digitalcollections.library.ubc.ca/cdm/landingpage/collection/kinesis|publisher=UBC Library Digital Collections|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Subtitled "news about women that's not in the dailies", it was published 10 times each year and carried news with a social change and [[feminist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="UBCDigital" /&gt; It acted as a forum for queer, immigrant, anti-classist, anti-ablecentrist voices.

It was edited by 
* Emma Kivisild (1984–1986)
* Esther Shannon (1986–1988)
* Nancy Pollak (1988–1992)
* Fatima Jaffer (1992–1994)&lt;ref name="AltMedia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kozalanka, Mazepa, and Skinner, eds.|title=Alternative Media in Canada|date=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774821643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding issues (Vancouver Status of Women was funded in part by government grants) and changes in editorial direction led to the shuttering of the magazine in 2001.&lt;ref name="AltMedia" /&gt;

Many issues of ''Kinesis'' are accessible online in the [[University of British Columbia Library]]'s Digital Collections.

The '''Land Suitability Classification''' is a [[soil]] [[evaluation]] method, developed by [[FAO]].
FAO stated that Land suitability is the fitness of a given type of land for a defined use. The land may be considered in its present condition or after improvements. The process of land suitability classification is the appraisal and grouping of specific areas of land in terms of their suitability for defined uses. &lt;ref&gt;FAO. Chapter 3. http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5310E/x5310e04.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Each category retains its basic meaning within the context of the different classifications and as applied to different kinds of land use. Pour categories of decreasing generalization are recognized:

*I. Land Suitability Orders: reflecting kinds of suitability.
*II. Land Suitability Classes: reflecting degrees of suitability within Orders.
*III. Land Suitability Subclasses: reflecting kinds of limitation, or main kinds of improvement measures required, within Classes.
*IV. Land Suitability Units: reflecting minor differences in required management within Subclasses
 
===Land Suitability Orders===
Land suitability Orders indicate whether land is assessed as suitable or not suitable for the use under consideration. There are two orders represented in maps, tables, etc. by the symbols S and N respectively.
* Order S: '''Suitable'''. Land on which sustained use of the kind under consideration is expected to yield benefits which justify the inputs, without unacceptable risk of damage to land resources.
* Order N: '''Not Suitable'''. Land which has qualities that appear to preclude sustained use of the kind under consideration.

Land may be classed as Not Suitable for a given use for a number of reasons. It may be that the proposed use is technically impracticable, such as the irrigation of rocky steep land, or that it would cause severe environmental degradation, such as the cultivation of steep slopes. Frequently, however, the reason is economic: that the value of the expected benefits does not justify the expected costs of the inputs that would be required.

===Land Suitability Classes===
Land suitability Classes reflect degrees of suitability. The classes are numbered consecutively, by Arabic numbers, in sequence of decreasing degrees of suitability within the Order. Within the Order Suitable the number of classes is not specified. There might, for example, be only two, S1 and S2. The number of classes recognized should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet interpretative aims; five should probably be the most ever used.

If three Classes are recognized within the Order Suitable, as can often be recommended, the following names and definitions may be appropriate in a qualitative classification:
*Class S1 '''Highly Suitable''': Land having no significant limitations to sustained application of a given use, or only minor limitations that will not significantly reduce productivity or benefits and will not raise inputs above an acceptable level.
*Class S2 '''Moderately Suitable''': Land having limitations which in aggregate are moderately severe for sustained application of a given use; the limitations will reduce productivity or benefits and increase required inputs to the extent that the overall advantage to be gained from the use, although still attractive, will be appreciably inferior to that expected on Class S1 land.
*Class S3 '''Marginally Suitable''': Land having limitations which in aggregate are severe for sustained application of a given use and will so reduce productivity or benefits, or increase required inputs, that this expenditure will be only marginally justified.
 
Within the Order Not Suitable, there are normally two Classes:
*Class N1 '''Currently Not Suitable''': Land having limitations which may be surmountable in time but which cannot be corrected with existing knowledge at currently acceptable cost; the limitations are so severe as to preclude successful sustained use of the land in the given manner.
*Class N2 '''Permanently Not Suitable''': Land having limitations which appear so severe as to preclude any possibilities Of successful sustained use of the land in the given manner.

[[Image:Golovin-Sivtsev Table.svg|thumb|right|[[Golovin-Sivtsev Table]]]]
A '''Landolt C''', also known as a '''Landolt ring''', '''Landolt broken ring''' or Japanese vision test, is an [[optotype]], i.e. a standardized symbol used for testing vision.  It was developed by the Swiss-born [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Edmund Landolt]].

The Landolt C consists of a ring that has a gap, thus looking similar to the letter C. The gap can be at various positions (usually left, right, bottom, top and the 45° positions in between) and the task of the tested person is to decide on which side the gap is. The size of the C and its gap are reduced until the subject makes a specified rate of errors. The minimum perceivable angle of the gap is taken as measure of the visual acuity. It is generally practised in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stroke width is 1/5 of the diameter, and the gap width is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danilova MV, Bondarko VM |title=Foveal contour interactions and crowding effects at the resolution limit of the visual system |journal=J Vis |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=25.1–18 |year=2007 |pmid=18217840 |pmc=2652120 |doi=10.1167/7.2.25 |url=http://www.journalofvision.org/7/2/25/article.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is identical to the letter C from a [[Snellen chart]]. The Landolt C is the standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries. It was standardized, together with measurement procedures, by the German [[DIN]], as DIN 58220 (now EN ISO 8596).

Although accepted as a 'gold standard', this optotype has its own inherent problems, possibly due to higher brain function where the gap will appear closed near the limit of resolution, especially when the gap is at the 6 o'clock position. This is not due to the structure of the cornea or lens, nor is it due to astigmatic errors.
&lt;ref&gt;The visual resolution of Landolt-C optotypes in human subjects depends on their orientation: the ’gap-down‘ effect

==Systematic treatment selection==

[[Systematic treatment selection]] (STS) is an empirically derived approach to the practice of psychotherapy.  It revolves around the use of an [[expert system]] to guide the clinician's thinking about how best to approach a particular case.  The STS model has been demonstrated to improve treatment outcomes significantly compared to treatment as usual.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite book | title= Prescriptive Psychotherapy | first=Larry | last=Beutler| year=2004| publisher=Oxford University | location=London | isbn=0195136691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maldivian Red Crescent''' (MRC) (Dhivehi: ދިވެހި ރެޑް ކްރެސެންޓް, Dhivehi Red Crescent) is an independent, volunteer, non-profit, humanitarian organization established in the [[Maldives]] by virture of the Maldivian Red Crescent Act (Dhivehi: ދިވެހި ރެޑް ކްރެސެންޓްގެ ޤާނޫން, Dhivehi Red Crescent'ge Gaanoonu) Law No: 7/2009 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://redcrescent.org.mv/nf/1/file/MRC%20Bill_Ratified_29_04_2009.pdf|title = Maldivian Red Crescent Law [Official, Dhivehi]|accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://redcrescent.org.mv/nf/1/file/MRC%20ACT_UNOFFICAL_english%20translation_29_04_2009.pdf|title = Maldivian Red Crescent Law [Unofficial, English]|accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the birth of the national society in the Maldives, all activities in the last quarter of 2009 was focused on its formation (developing its structures, capacities and programmes) and recognition within the community (be responsive to national vulnerabilities). Initially the community engagement was limited as activities implemented were mostly process oriented.

== Guiding Ethos ==

The vision of the Maldivian Red Crescent is "'''to be a model National Society contributing to overcome humanitarian challenges'''". The mission statement of the national society is "'''to volunteer, participate and partner in delivering humanitarian service to the most vulnerable'''".

As mandated by the Maldivian Red Crescent Law&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the Statutes of the National Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://redcrescent.org.mv/nf/1/file/Statutes_Dhivehi.PDF|title = Statutes of MRC [Dhivehi]|accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://redcrescent.org.mv/nf/1/file/Statutes.PDF|title = Statutes of MRC [English]|accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary objective of the MRC is "'''to prevent and alleviate suffering with complete impartiality, making no discrimination'''".

In addition, the volunteers, members and staff of the national society follow the [[Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Fundamental Principles]] of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement;
* Humanity
* Impartiality
* Neutrality
* Independence
* Voluntary Service
* Unity
* Universality

== Formation ==

Maldivian communities were first introduced to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004]] which brought unprecedented devastation to the countries of the region including the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maldivian Red Crescent officially joins the IFRC at the 18th General Assembly - IFRC|url = http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/maldives/maldivian-red-crescent-formally-recognized-at-ifrcs-general-assembly/|website = www.ifrc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ifrc.org/ International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies] (IFRC) along with National Societies from numerous countries were some of the first international responders in the Maldives. Their assistance in the immediate relief and recovery stages of the disaster as well as long term recovery and rehabilitation projects helped numerous Maldivian communities to overcome the effects of the disaster.

Local individuals realized the importance and the need for having Maldives’ own national society and volunteered for its establishment. With this in mind, the volunteers, with the support of the Government of the Maldives started the process that led to the eventual formation of the Maldivian Red Crescent. This group of volunteers, with assistance from IFRC and partner national societies in the Maldives at the time began formulating the necessary documentation and legal framework for the new national society.

The Maldivian Red Crescent was officially formed with the holding of its inaugural General Assembly on 16 August 2009. The assembly elected the first governing board of MRC and adopted the National Society’s Statutes and Rules of Procedures.

The elected governing board approved MRC’s interim development plan and straight after the General Assembly, implementation of the plan took place with hiring of key management and  programme staff. This led to an induction of the National Society’s governing board, management team, national advisory council members and programme staff as part of their capacity building. Formation of island units and atoll branches followed.

The MRC became the 187th member of the Movement at the 18th Federation General Assembly held in Geneva on 23 November 2011, having fulfilled all the conditions necessary, to be recognized as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maldivian Red Crescent formally recognised as world’s 187th  National Society - IFRC|url = http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/asia-pacific/maldives/maldivian-red-crescent-formally-recognised-as-worlds-187th--national-society/|website = www.ifrc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal-base ==

The legal foundation and ratification of the MRC Law by the Maldivian President took place in early May 2009. The law gave the legal right for a humanitarian organization – by the name Maldivian Red Crescent – to be established and undertake humanitarian work in the Maldives. As stipulated in the law, the objectives of the national society are;
* to provide humanitarian aid to civilian and military victims, and those suffering at times of war, conflict and peace;
* to protect and assist the victims including preservation of the physical integrity and dignity of the victims at times of war, conflict and peace;
* to contribute to the improvement of the conditions of the weak and the vulnerable; in times of ill health, in prevention of diseases, and in response to all humanitarian emergencies;
* to provide support to Government Organizations assisting the victims and those effected by disaster and natural causes.

In addition, the Law recognizes the role of the MRC as an auxiliary to the public authorities in the humanitarian field. The Law stipulates the exclusive usage of the "red crescent' emblem by the MRC.

== Structure ==

The Maldivian Red Crescent is a membership driven organization. The members of the national society are registered at the branch level (typically in [[atoll]]s), whereas activities and volunteers are active at Unit level (typically [[Island]]s). Members of the society form the governance structure, with unit boards and branch boards being elected. Each year representatives of the branches convene to hold the national General Assembly, which is the highest decision making authority of the society. In between the Assemblies, the society is governed by the Governing Board, which is elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maldivian Red Crescent|url = http://redcrescent.org.mv/p36/governing-board|website = redcrescent.org.mv|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medical Council of New Zealand''' is the peak national standards and assessment body for medical education and training. It is responsible for the registration of doctors and has the power to suspend or remove the right to practise medicine in New Zealand. Its responsibilities are defined by the [[Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003]] and it is funded by practitioner fees paid by all practising doctors in New Zealand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8418">'''Mental health in Southeast Africa''' is a concern, where mental illness is prevalent. [[Mental health]] issues in Africa are often viewed as the "silent crisis" since they are often given lower priority in a region of Africa where international aid is focused on communicable diseases and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Gureje, O., &amp; Alem, A. (2000). Mental health policy development in Africa. ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization,'' 78(4), 475-482. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each country in [[Southeast Africa]] is consistently confronted with barriers that make mental health policies a challenge to implement, including the lack of policy, social and cultural barriers, the role of traditional medicine, [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV/AIDS]], and the stigma surrounding mental health issues.

== Priority of mental health ==
Professor Anyang' Nyong'o wrote a letter on June 23, 2011 to the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights, stating, "Currently there is a very big gap existing between the mental health needs of Kenyans and the existing mental health services at all levels of the health care services delivery system."&lt;ref&gt;Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. (2011). ''Silenced minds: The systemic neglect of the mental health system in Kenya.'' Nairobi: Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

Although there is a lack of attention to mental health in the healthcare systems, it is a major issue in Southeast African countries. Efforts have been made in some countries to allocate funding to mental health initiatives. [[Uganda]]'s policies are a prime example of a successful effort to improve mental health in [[Southeast Africa]]. In 2006–2007, after undertaking an initial situational analysis of Uganda's mental health system, a new mental health policy was created.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ssebunnya | first1 = J. | last2 = Kigozi | first2 = F. | last3 = Ndyanabangi | first3 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Developing a national mental health policy: A case study from Uganda | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 10 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision for the project in Uganda is to eliminate, mental health issues, neurological disorders, and substance use from the population. From this vision, guiding principles were implemented, key priority areas were identified, policy objectives were selected, and the Uganda Ministry of Health began to make mental health a priority.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) continues to work with the developing nations of Africa to implement strategies to improve mental health situations and treatment in these countries. The few countries that have mental health policies in place, were created prior to 1990, and are in dire need of updating.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders &amp; Uganda National Academy of Sciences Forum on Health and Nutrition (2010). ''Mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa: Reducing the treatment gap, improving quality of care.'' Washington D.C.: National Academies Press. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53436/&lt;/ref&gt;  Uganda had achieved great success with their new mental health policies and is working in close cooperation with the WHO to finalize their health-care policy. The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward.

== Perspectives ==
The Southeast [[African Great Lakes]] region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness.  According to Vikram Patel, a [[global mental health]] expert and professor at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anthea Gordon |url=http://thinkafricapress.com/health/mental-health-remains-invisible-problem-africa |title=Mental Health Remains An Invisible Problem in Africa |publisher=Think Africa Press |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005149/http://thinkafricapress.com/health/mental-health-remains-invisible-problem-africa |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For an example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.&lt;ref&gt;Omonzejele, F. P. (2004). Mental health care in African traditional medicine and society: A philosophical appraisal. ''Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics'', 14, 165-169. Retrieved from http://www.eubios.info/EJ145/ej145d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[CNN]] series, ''African Voices'', leading psychiatrist Frank Njenga, states that when a patient has some form of illness such as depression or schizophrenia, community members and traditional healers often look at it as being possessed by demons or witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian, L., McKenzie, D., &amp; Ellis, J. (2012, January 31). Kenya doctor fights mental health stigma in 'traumatized continent'. CNN. Retrieved from http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/31/health/frank-njenga-mental-health&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of mental illnesses ==
Some mental illnesses have been linked to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate. If these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not properly transmit through the brain, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, defects in or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions.

Many socioeconomic factors may contribute to mental health. Such as, disease, political unrest, violence, and any kind of addiction. These may all play a role in the high incident of mental illness in Southeast Africa. Adequate care may not be available to sufferers, due to the stigma that surrounds people dealing with mental illness. The reversal of this stigma, is due to the lack of educational resources .&lt;ref&gt;Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. (2011).

== Education and career ==
Schultz graduated from [[Clear Creek High School (League City, Texas)|Clear Creek High School]] in [[League City, Texas]] in 1985 and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Rice University]] in 1990.  She earned a Master's Certificate in [[Project Management]] (MCPM) from the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="LinkedIn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;

After receiving her [[engineering degree]], Schultz thought she would find work in the [[Texas Medical Center]] since her primary interest was [[biomedical engineering]], but then decided that she did not want to spend a great deal of time commuting from her suburban home into [[Houston]], and investigated employment with NASA and aerospace companies instead.  From 1990 to 1998, Schultz worked for [[Rockwell International|Rockwell Space Operations Company]] providing engineering support to the Astronaut Office on [[Space Shuttle]] payloads.  In 1998, Monika accepted a position with [[Astrotech Corporation|Spacehab, Inc.]] to provide science mission management for their [[Astrotech Corporation#SpaceHab|Spacehab]] module mission on the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref name="LinkedIn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;

From 1999 to 2010, Schultz returned to work for United Space Alliance (formerly Rockwell) and the Astronaut Office.  She created and managed the Astronaut Expeditionary Training Project, which prepared potential [[International Space Station]] [[astronaut]]s for the unique personal and interpersonal aspects of long duration space flight.  Schultz worked with many different people to arrange classroom training, backpacking courses in summer and winter, and [[NEEMO]] missions for astronauts.&lt;ref name="LinkedIn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;  In August 2001, the crew of [[STS-107]], who were killed the following year in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]], took part in an expeditionary training exercise in the [[Wind River Mountains]] in [[Wyoming]].  Schultz was quoted at the time as saying that interpersonal skills became more important as space flights became longer, saying, "Over time, the little things that didn't bug you before now become more apparent."&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/30/local/me-19079|title=NASA Focusing on Personal Space|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Wright|first=Elisabeth A.|date=December 30, 2001|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2010, Schultz served as International Space Station Crew Support Lead.&lt;ref name="LinkedIn"/&gt;

In April 2005, Schultz became an [[aquanaut]] through her participation in the joint NASA-[[NOAA]], [[NEEMO#NEEMO 8: April 20–22, 2005|NEEMO 8]] (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) project, an exploration research mission held in [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]], the world's only [[Underwater habitat|undersea research laboratory]].  Schultz and her crewmates lived and worked underwater for three days.&lt;ref name="eight1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eight2"/&gt;  Schultz commented in a blog entry during NEEMO 8, "It was an awesome feeling to stand in the wetporch when we first came in and realize that I would be staying here for a while rather than just dropping in for a quick visit."&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nurc.net/blog/april-2005-saturation/mission-journal-1-%E2%80%94-monika-schultz-mission-day-1-wednesday-april-20th-2005|title=Mission Blog - Mission &amp; Project Info - NOAA's Aquarius Undersea Laboratory|last=Schultz|first=Monika|date=April 20, 2005|publisher=[[National Undersea Research Center]]|accessdate=February 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221215318/http://www.nurc.net/blog/april-2005-saturation/mission-journal-1-%E2%80%94-monika-schultz-mission-day-1-wednesday-april-20th-2005|archivedate=February 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schultz was a member of the topside support teams for multiple NEEMO missions.&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO12/topside_journal_1.html|title=NASA - NEEMO 12 Topside Journal|author=NEEMO 12 Topside Team|date=May 6, 2007|publisher=NASA|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO15/support.html|title=NASA - Meet the NEEMO 15 Support Team|author=NASA|date=October 3, 2011|publisher=NASA|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schultz worked as a Test Safety Officer for Anadarko Industries in 2011, performing risk evaluations of spacecraft systems.  In November 2011, she began working as a manager for [[Intertek]], a global inspection, product testing and certification company, leading the development of coaching products and services offered to Intertek's clients.&lt;ref name="LinkedIn"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Schultz is married to Sven Eric Schultz and they have one son.  She enjoys biking, hiking, sailing, diving, reading, and [[zymurgy]].&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;  Schultz is a certified [[PADI]] [[Rescue Diver]] and has made over 100 open water dives.

'''Multiplicity''' is the use of multiple [[personality style]]s by a person.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}   For example, a woman may adopt a kind, nurturing personality when dealing with her children but change to a more aggressive, forceful personality when going to work as a high-flying executive as her responsibilities change.&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

Rita Carter says evidence for multiplicity abounds and is found in history, and that when an individual states that they have been taken over by a spirit, soul, or ghost, they are saying that they are experiencing another personality. She says that feeling happy and carefree while in the company of your friends, but less so at home with family, is an example of multiple personality styles.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Rita|title=Multiplicity: The New Science of Personality, Identity, and the Self,|date=March 2008|publisher=Little, Brown,|isbn=9780316115384}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Jung]] proposed: "The many ''contains'' the unity of the one ''without losing'' the possibilities of the many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Multiplicity |title=The Cambridge Companion to Jung |author=Michael Vannoy Adams |page=115 |isbn=9780521685009 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plato described the soul ("psyche") as having three parts, calling them Logos (rationality), Eros (erotic love), and Thymus (desire).&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}} According to Carter, Shakespeare showed examples of this in his works of literature; characters like Hamlet and Macbeth had distinct personalities that differed throughout their respective works.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}} Carter says that Freud supported the notion of different personalities when he came up with the Id, Ego, and Superego, arguing that there is a split in the conscious and unconscious mind.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

Carter says that Italian psychologist [[Roberto Assagioli]] developed an approach to psychology called [[psychosynthesis]], and thought many personalities that an individual is not consciously aware of may be present.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}} American psychologist [[John G. Watkins]] used hypnosis to bring out different personalities, as a method to study those personalities.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

From 1991-2005 he was known in the United States for several causes célèbres involving his patients.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref name=Skeptic /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;[[Unsolved Mysteries]], Season 11, [http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/unsolved-mysteries-season-11-episode-2-episode-444-205601 Episode 2 (#444)], April 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; One of his books is classified as [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[extremism|extreme]] and banned in Russia.&lt;ref name=extremmat /&gt; He was a leader of a public organisation "''Renaissance. The Golden Age''" which is considered a [[destructive cult]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=iriney /&gt;

== Biography ==
Nicolai Levashov was born in 1961 in [[Kislovodsk]]. After his graduation from the department of theoretical radiophysics, [[University of Kharkiv]], he spent a couple of years in the [[Soviet Army]]. Levashov died on June 11, 2012. According to his website:

"19-06-2012 – On Monday, June 11, 2012 Nicolai Levashov, a prominent Russian scientist and writer, kind and honourable man, left this world in his Moscow flat. His physical body did not die of old age, illness or any "comforts" of our civilization. He was just 51 and in robust good health. He perished on the battle field fighting the Universal Evil, just as Svetlana, his beloved wife, comrade-in-arms and one of his few true friends, did one and a half years ago."

Toward the end of 1980s Levashov started his public activities. According to his autobiography "''The mirror of my soul''", by the summer of 1988 he had begun practicing healing. Having married for a second time, to a [[psychic]], Mzia, he assisted in her stage performances of [[mentalism]] and [[hypnosis]]. With [[Allan Chumak]] and other healers, Levashov was trying to establish a state-run ''Foundation of Alternative Medicine'' asking the Soviet Ministry of Navy for support.&lt;ref name=shane /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoMS&gt;N. Levashov, ''The mirror of my soul'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Levashov propagated his ideas in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Scott Shane, an American journalist with ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' in Russia, writes&lt;ref name=shane&gt;S. Shane, ''Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union'', 1994. {{ISBN|978-1-56663-099-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Levashov claimed he could speak with dolphins, clean polluted city air by his mental power, heal by phone, see internal organs through the skin etc. Shane met Levashov at a briefing in the Ministry concerning the [[Angolan Civil War]], although "''Nikolai Levashov modestly explained that he knew nothing about international relations''". Scott Shane believes that the proliferation of pseudoscientists such as Chumak and Levashov was a negative underside of the relaxation of [[censorship in the Soviet Union]].

In July 1990 [[Soviet Central Television]] broadcast a film about the Levashov couple. It was based on assertions by Mzia and Nicolai and on a trial involving four journalists. The trial was carried out in the Institute of Human Brain, a scientific organization,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} but controversial for its interest in [[extrasensory perception]]. Among the four people tested, M. Dekhta was a friend of Levashov,&lt;ref name=MoMS /&gt; and Ruben Isahakyan was another healer who later founded an [[alternative medicine]] company, ''Altimed''.

The story of the Levashovs was published in the magazine ''Television and Radio'' as well.

By the time of the broadcast, Nicolai and Mzia were already divorced. In 1990—1991 Levashov performed on tour in Russian cities, practicing faith healing.

=== In the United States ===
In 1991 Nicolai Levashov and his third wife Svetlana (née Serëgina or Žymantienė) visited the United States and settled in [[California]] for 15 years.

Nicolai started his healing practice in the ''American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine'', which consisted of two employees in three rooms. He made acquaintance with an Armenian family of Soviet descent, the Orbelians. George Orbelian and his wife Marcia Paulsen-Orbelian supported Levashov, spoke about him on the local TV and translated his books from Russian into English. Levashov was also broadcast on ''Russian Voice Radio''&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Voice Radio'', interview with N. Levashov, Dec 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ([[San Francisco]]).

Levashov is mentioned in books and articles by [[astrologer]] Jeanne Avery,&lt;ref&gt;J. Avery, ''A Soul’s Journey'', Boru Books, 1996. {{ISBN|1-887161-12-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "distance healer" Robert Ginsburg,&lt;ref&gt;N. Tobert, ''Interview with Robert Ginsburg''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] therapist Richard Blasband&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Blasband, ''Studies with Nicolai Levashov'', International Journal of Healing and Caring, 2002. Also published as: R. A. Blasband, ''Studies with Nicolai Levashov'', Bridges Magazine, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[alternative medicine]] clinic ''Center For Functional Research'', and "healer" Todd Telford.&lt;ref&gt;T. Telford, ''From lawyer to healer'', New age journal, '''13''', 1996, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Koopman (M.D., Ph.D. in [[geriatrics]]), who studies mental healing phenomenon, says that Levashov considers understanding the [[Anisotropy#Physics|anisotropy]] of the [[Shape of the universe|universe]] necessary for creation or dissolution of matter for healing purposes.&lt;ref name=koopman&gt;B. G. Koopman, [http://www.issseem.org/storejournals_detail.cfm?articleid=187 Psychic Healing and the Anisotropic Universe], Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine, '''14'''(2), 2005, and other papers, listed in the bibliography of the former article&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific skeptic]]s have written about Levashov and his healing practice. [[Michael Shermer]] published an article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]''&lt;ref name=Skeptic&gt;[[Michael Shermer|M. Shermer]], [http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/msgddb5.htm Another Alt Med Tragedy], [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic Mag]] Hotline, 01 Feb 1999&lt;/ref&gt; saying that B. Koopman trusted Levashov because he allegedly cured her friend, actress [[Susan Strasberg]], who had [[cancer]]. Nonetheless, in January 1999 Strasberg died of cancer.

Another case is that of [[Elisabeth Targ]]'s death. A well-known psychologist who believed in psychics, she was diagnosed with [[glioblastoma multiforme]] in her 40s; [[radiation therapy]] was prescribed. Targ consulted practitioners of [[alternative medicine]] including Levashov. As [[Po Bronson]] writes,&lt;ref name=wired&gt;[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], [[Po Bronson]], [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/prayer.html A Prayer Before Dying], 10.12, 2002, pp. 175—223&lt;/ref&gt; “''her bedroom turned into a circus. Healers from everywhere showed up… There was a Lakota sun dancer who burned sage; Nicolai Levashov, a Russian psychic who waved his hands; an acupuncturist with rare Chinese herbs; an energy worker who used methods of the Miwok peoples''”. Levashov claimed he cured the cancer and persuaded Targ to stop radiation therapy. She became worse, but Levashov insisted it was not the cancer but some [[necrosis|necrotic tissues]]. In three weeks Targ died from glioblastoma. This story was published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and was used in an article by [[Victor J. Stenger|Vic Stenger]] for the ''[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Skeptical Briefs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor J. Stenger|V. Stenger]], [http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Briefs/Targ.pdf The Tragic Story of Elisabeth Targ], March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Russia ===
In 2006, Levashov returned to Russia, where he increased his public activity: he published many books and was invited on TV and radio, including [[REN TV]], [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]], [[TV-3 (Russia)|TV-3]], [[Russia 1]] and others. One of his most common claims was that the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer]] [[heat waves]] were the result of a US "Climate Change Weapon", and he said he saved Russia from that weapon. Levashov is a supporter of the [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program#Conspiracy theories|HAARP conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Argumenty i Fakty|АиФ]], В. Якубовская, [http://www.aif.ru/techno/article/39044 Климатическая война. Зачем американские ученые создали ураган «Катрина»?] (''Climate War. Why did American scientists make hurricane Katrina?''), #46, Nov 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Russland-Aktuell|Russland-Aktuell]], [http://www.russland-aktuell.de/russland/panorama/hitzewelle_in_russland_die_amis_sind_an_allem_schuld_3159.html Hitzewelle in Russland: Die Amis sind an allem schuld] (''Heat wave in Russia: Yankees are responsible for everything''), 18.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the authenticity of the [[Book of Veles]], the [[space colonization|extraterrestrial colonization]] of Earth, a [[Pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] theory close to the [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]] (although Levashov does not mention [[Anatoly Fomenko]]), and the existence of the "vanished continent" of [[Atlantis]]. Some of his statements are similar to ideas from the ''Slavic-Arian Vedas'' (a hoax book of [[Slavic Neopaganism]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} He [[Vaccine controversy|opposed vaccination]] and [[Genetically modified food controversies|genetically modified foods]]. Levashov was an atheist, and aggressively objected to [[Christianity]], although his views were far from [[materialism]].

Some television hosts and newspapers present Levashov as a professional physicist or meteorologist while others criticize him and call him a "[[pseudoscientist]]".&lt;ref name=stoliza&gt;[[:ru:Столица (телеканал)|Столица]] (Stolitsa, a Moscow TV channel), "''Разговор с Александром Мягченковым''" (''Talk with Alexander Myagchenkov''), Jul 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Levashov wrote some half dozen books available in print and online; 50,000 copies have been printed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} One of the books, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] "''Russian History Viewed through Distorted Mirrors''", was prohibited from being published or distributed in Russia by the Court of [[Kaluga Region]] due to its [[extremism]].&lt;ref name=extremmat&gt;[[Federal List of Extremist Materials]], [http://www.minjust.ru/ru/activity/nko/fedspisok/ published] by the Russian Ministry of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known Russian [[illusionist]] Yuri Gorny (a former psychic who is now a devoted skeptic) says Levashov  picks only the most suggestible people from the audience for his psychic tricks.

In May 2007 Levashov founded a public organization "''Renaissance. The Golden Age''" ({{lang-ru|Возрождение. Золотой век}}) which is considered a [[destructive cult]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=iriney&gt;[[Russian Orthodox Church]], St. Irenaeus Center for problems of modern religious movements, sects and cults (headed by Prof. [[Alexander Dvorkin]], Ph.D.), [http://www.iriney.ru/sects/others/news042.htm Article] reprinted from ''Православие на Северной земле''&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has headquarters in [[Moscow]], 18 branches in Russia, and four branches abroad, in [[Kiev]], [[Chişinău]], [[Minsk]], and [[Kharkiv]]. It is not registered with the Ministry of Justice.

The members of "''Renaissance. The Golden Age''" disseminate Levashov's statements. They organize [[Political rally|rallies]] supporting Levashov and opposing genetically modified foods and vaccination in many Russian cities, advertise Levashov's books on the Internet and in the press. They conduct seminars in schools and universities popularizing ideas of Levashov and other pseudoscientific theories such as [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]]. In [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] they converted a schoolteacher, O. Shepetovskaya, to their organization; Levashov's ideas were then taught at her school #45.&lt;ref&gt;''Вечерние вести Петропавловска'' (Evening News of [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]]), [http://www.vestipk.ru/?id=13782 На Камчатке школьники будут раздавать в магазинах листовки об опасности ГМО-продуктов] (''[[Kamchatka]] pupils to hand out flyers on GMO danger''), May 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicotine poisoning''' describes the symptoms of the toxic effects of [[nicotine]] following ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. Nicotine poisoning can potentially be deadly, though serious or fatal overdoses are rare.&lt;ref name="Lavoie"/&gt; Historically, most cases of nicotine poisoning have been the result of use of nicotine as an [[insecticide]].&lt;ref name="McNally"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNally WD |title=A report of five cases of poisoning by nicotine |journal=Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine |volume=5 |issue= |pages=213–217 |year=1920 |month= |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNally WD |title=A report of seven cases of nicotine poisoning |journal=Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine |volume=8 |issue= |pages=83–85 |year=1923 |month= |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of [[Green Tobacco Sickness]], or due to unintended ingestion of [[tobacco]] or tobacco products or consumption of nicotine-containing plants.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smolinske"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furer V, Hersch M, Silvetzki N, Breuer GS, Zevin S |title=Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) intoxication—two cases in one family |journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=47–51 |date=March 2011 |pmid=20652661 |doi=10.1007/s13181-010-0102-x |pmc=3614112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicology==
The {{LD50}} of nicotine is 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[rat]]s and 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[mouse|mice]]. 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/kg can be a lethal dosage for adult humans, and 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for children.&lt;ref name=INCHEM&gt;[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/nicotine.htm#PartTitle:7.%20TOXICOLOGY IPCS INCHEM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb00316.x |vauthors=Okamoto M, Kita T, Okuda H, Tanaka T, Nakashima T |title=Effects of aging on acute toxicity of nicotine in rats |journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=Jul 1994 |pmid=7971729}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the widely used human LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; estimate of 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/kg was questioned in a 2013 review, in light of several documented cases of humans surviving much higher doses; the 2013 review suggests that the lower limit causing fatal outcomes is 500–1000&amp;nbsp;mg of ingested nicotine, corresponding to 6.5–13&amp;nbsp;mg/kg orally.&lt;ref name=MayerNewLethalDose2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mayer B | title = How much nicotine kills a human?

It is unlikely that a person would overdose on nicotine through smoking alone.

The recent rise in the use of [[electronic cigarette]]s, many forms of which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing "e-liquid" supplied in small plastic bottles, has renewed interest in nicotine overdoses, especially in the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.&lt;ref name=McNeill2015/&gt; A 2015  [[Public Health England]] report noted an "unconfirmed newspaper report of a fatal poisoning of a two-year old child" and two published case reports of children of similar age who had recovered after ingesting e-liquid and vomiting.&lt;ref name=McNeill2015/&gt; They also noted case reports of suicides by nicotine. Where adults drank liquid containing up to 1,500&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine they recovered (helped by vomiting), but an ingestion apparently of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg was fatal, as was an injection.&lt;ref name=McNeill2015/&gt; They commented that "Serious nicotine poisoning seems normally prevented by the fact that relatively low doses of nicotine cause nausea and vomiting, which stops users from further intake."&lt;ref name=McNeill2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNeill|first1=A|last2=Brose|first2=LS|last3=Calder|first3=R|last4=Hitchman|first4=SC|last5=Hajek|first5=P|last6= McRobbie|first6=H|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/454516/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England.pdf|title=E-cigarettes: an evidence update|p=63|location=UK|publisher=Public Health England|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four adults died in the US and Europe, after intentionally ingesting liquid.&lt;ref name=HuaTalbot2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=My|last2=Talbot|first2=Prue|title=Potential health effects of electronic cigarettes: A systematic review of case reports|journal=Preventive Medicine Reports|volume=4|year=2016|pages=169–178|issn=2211-3355|doi=10.1016/j.pmedr.2016.06.002|pmc=4929082|pmid=27413679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two children, one in the US in 2014 and another in Israel in 2013, died after ingesting liquid nicotine.&lt;ref name=Biyani2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biyani|first1=S|last2=Derkay|first2=CS|title=E-cigarettes: Considerations for the otolaryngologist.|journal=International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology|date=28 April 2015|volume=79|pages=1180–3|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.04.032|pmid=25998217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the discrepancy between the historically stated 60-mg dose and published cases of nicotine intoxication has been noted previously (Matsushima et al. 1995; Metzler et al. 2005), but nonetheless, this value is still erroneously accepted without scrutiny and taken as the basis for worldwide safety regulations of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products (like the recent EU wide [[Tobacco Products Directive|TPD]], set at an insufficient 20mg maximum - which is not enough to wean off the average 'pack-a-day' smoker, only light/occasional smokers). Nicotine is a toxic compound that should be handled with care, but the frequent exaggerated warnings of potential fatalities caused by ingestion of small amounts of tobacco products or diluted nicotine-containing solutions are fear mongering and unjustified and need to be revised in light of overwhelming data indicating that more than 0.5 g (that's 500mg) of oral nicotine is required to kill an average adult.

Nicotine poisoning tends to produce symptoms that follow a biphasic pattern.

From September 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014, there were at least 5,970 e-cigarette calls to US poison control centers.&lt;ref name=Chatham-StephensLaw2016/&gt; During the same period, the ten most frequent adverse effects to e-cigarettes and e-liquid reported to US poison control centers were vomiting (40.4%), eye irritation or pain (20.3%), nausea (16.8%), red eye or conjunctivitis (10.5%), dizziness (7.5%), tachycardia (7.1%), drowsiness (7.1%), agitation (6.3%), headache (4.8%), and cough (4.5%).&lt;ref name=Chatham-StephensLaw2016/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The symptoms of nicotine poisoning are caused by excessive stimulation of nicotinic [[Cholinergic|cholinergic neuron]]s. Nicotine is an [[agonist]] at [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] which are present in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[autonomic nervous system]]s, and the [[neuromuscular junction]]. At low doses nicotine causes stimulatory effects on these receptors, however, higher doses or more sustained exposures can cause inhibitory effects leading to [[neuromuscular blockade]].&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zevin S, Gourlay SG, Benowitz NL |title=Clinical pharmacology of nicotine |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=557–64 |year=1998 |pmid=9787965 |doi=10.1016/s0738-081x(98)00038-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes reported that people poisoned by [[organophosphate]] insecticides experience the same symptoms as nicotine poisoning. Organophosphates inhibit an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, causing a buildup of acetylcholine, excessive stimulation of all types of [[Cholinergic|cholinergic neuron]]s, and a wide range of symptoms. Nicotine is specific for nicotinic cholinergic receptors only and has some, but not all of the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning.

==Diagnosis==
Increased nicotine or [[cotinine]] (the nicotine [[metabolite]]) is detected in urine or blood, or serum nicotine concentrations increase.

==Treatment==
The initial treatment of nicotine  poisoning may include the administration of [[activated charcoal]] to try to reduce gastrointestinal absorption. Treatment is mainly supportive and further care can include control of [[seizure]]s with the administration of a [[benzodiazepine]], intravenous fluids for hypotension, and administration of [[atropine]] for bradycardia. Respiratory failure may necessitate respiratory support with [[rapid sequence induction]] and [[mechanical ventilation]]. [[Hemodialysis]], [[hemoperfusion]] or other [[extracorporeal]] techniques do not remove nicotine from the blood and are therefore not useful in [[Poison#Enhanced excretion|enhancing elimination]].&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt; Acidifying the urine could theoretically enhance nicotine excretion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenberg J, Benowitz NL, Jacob P, Wilson KM |title=Disposition kinetics and effects of intravenous nicotine |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=517–22 |date=October 1980 |pmid=7408411 |doi=10.1038/clpt.1980.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not recommended as it may cause complications of [[metabolic acidosis]].&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is typically good when medical care is provided and patients adequately treated are unlikely to have any long-term [[sequela]]e. However, severely affected patients with prolonged seizures or respiratory failure may have ongoing impairments secondary to the [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogers AJ, Denk LD, Wax PM |title=Catastrophic brain injury after nicotine insecticide ingestion |journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=169–72 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14980338 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2003.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that if a patient survives nicotine poisoning during the first 4 hours, they usually recover completely.&lt;ref name="Saxena"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxena K, Scheman A |title=Suicide plan by nicotine poisoning: a review of nicotine toxicity |journal=Veterinary and Human Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=495–7 |date=December 1985 |pmid=4082460}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least at "normal" levels, as nicotine in the human body is broken down, it has an approximate [[biological half-life]] of 1–2&amp;nbsp;hours.

'''Nicotine withdrawal''' is a group of symptoms that occur in the first few weeks upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake of [[nicotine]]. Symptoms include intense cravings for nicotine, anger/irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], impatience, [[insomnia|trouble sleeping]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[hunger]] or [[weight gain]], and difficulty concentrating.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000953.htm | publisher = Medline Plus | author =Linda J. Vorvick | date = 2013-08-29 | accessdate = 2015-05-21 | title = Nicotine and Tobacco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smoking cessation program may improve one’s chance for success in quitting nicotine.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Nicotine withdrawal is recognized in both the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the WHO International Classification of Diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most documented symptoms are cravings for nicotine, anger/irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], impatience, [[Insomnia|trouble sleeping]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[hunger]] or [[weight gain]], and difficulty concentrating.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Symptoms are usually strongest for the first few days and then dissipate over 2-4 weeks.&lt;ref name=HughesS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=JR|title=Effects of abstinence from tobacco: valid symptoms and time course|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=315–27|pmid=17365764|doi=10.1080/14622200701188919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawal symptoms make it harder to quit nicotine products and most methods for [[quitting smoking]] involve reducing nicotine withdrawal.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; The most common symptoms are irritability, anxiety and difficulty concentrating. Depression and insomnia are the least common. Other withdrawal symptoms may include constipation, cough, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, impulsivity, fatigue, flu symptoms, mood swings, mouth ulcers, and increased dreaming.&lt;ref name=HughesS/&gt; Cessation of nicotine usually increases eating and weight, decreases memory, decreases the ability to pay attention and concentrate on tasks, and decreases heart rate. Cessation of tobacco can also require changes in levels of various medications.

==Definition==
The effect that nicotine-dependent individuals experience after they discontinue or decrease nicotine use. Nicotine is an addictive substance found most commonly in [[tobacco]] and tobacco products including [[cigarette]]s, [[cigars]], [[chewing tobacco]], [[pipe tobacco]], [[snus]], [[Snuff_(tobacco)|snuff]], nicotine gum and e-liquid. Withdrawal is the body’s reaction to not having the nicotine it had become accustomed to. Withdrawal is most common and intense in cigarette smokers{{citation needed|reason=Logic and experience tells me that nicotine withdrawal is far more intense for users of snus, because of the far higher amounts of nicotine they consume.|date=February 2016}} and intermediate in smokeless users. The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal usually appear 2-3 hours after last intake of nicotine and peak in 2-3 days.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; In a minority of smokers, cravings may last for years. Nicotine withdrawal causes few physical signs and is not life-threatening but associated cravings can be as severe as withdrawal from other drugs. There is some evidence that stopping nicotine may make a prior psychiatric problem worse but this is uncertain. After the initial withdrawal period, anxiety, depression, and quality of life generally improve such that former smokers are better off than continuing smokers.

==Causes==
Various causes have been proposed to explain the causes of nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine binds to nicotinic receptors in the brain that, in turn, cause an increase in [[dopamine]]. Dopamine is the major chemical that stimulates reward centers in the brain. The brain recruits an opposing force to dampen the effects of nicotine and this causes tolerance (the reduction in the effect of nicotine). The onset of this opposing force and the fact that the brain becomes used to and dependent on nicotine to function normally is known as [[physical dependence]]. When nicotine intake is decreased, the brain's opposing force is now unopposed and this causes withdrawal symptoms. It also appears that opiate, serotonergic, glutamic, cannabinoid, and corticotrophin receptors may play a role in nicotine withdrawal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Treatment==
Gradually reducing nicotine intake causes less withdrawal than abruptly stopping.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Another way to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms is to provide the body with an alternative source of nicotine ([[nicotine replacement therapy]]) for a temporary period and then taper this new nicotine intake. Other medication used for quitting smoking include [[bupropion]], [[varenicline]], [[cytisine]], [[nortriptyline]], and [[clonidine]]. Treatments other than medication, such as increased exercise, can also reduce nicotine withdrawal. Many behavior changes such as avoiding situations where one usually smoked, planning ahead to deal with temptations, and seeking the support of friends and family are effective in helping people quit smoking, but whether this is due to reduced withdrawal is unclear.

==Epidemiology==
Most nicotine users have at least one of the above withdrawal symptoms when they try to stop. These effects are much milder to those who use isolated nicotine over tobacco.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=JR|title=Review: Effects of abstinence from tobacco: Etiology, animal models, epidemiology, and significance: A subjective review|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=329–339|pmid=17365765|doi=10.1080/14622200701188927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawal can occur in less frequent  users, but heavier users and those with a past or current psychiatric disorder tend to have more severe withdrawal. Genetics also influence the severity of withdrawal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2355">'''North American Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH) week''' is held every year during the first full week of May to raise awareness about occupational safety, health and the environment (SH&amp;E) in an effort to prevent work injuries and illnesses. The [[American Society of Safety Engineers]] (ASSE) partners with the [[Canadian Society of Safety Engineering]] (CSSE) to raise public awareness about safety in the workplace in North America during NAOSH week. This is one of the major tools that ASSE and its 34,000{{cn|date=May 2015}} occupational safety, health and environmental professional members use throughout the year to increase attention to the importance of keeping all employees injury and illness free in the workplace.

Several organizations and government agencies partner with ASSE to support NAOSH Week, including the Department of Labor’s [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and their alliance partners.

ASSE members host various classes, symposiums and work safety fairs, and distribute information on such subjects as catastrophe preparedness, roadway crash prevention and teen worker safety. In addition, ASSE assists charities, provides teen worker safety programs, and donates personal protective equipment (PPE) as part of NAOSH Week.

During the months leading up to NAOSH Week, ASSE holds its popular children's "safety-on-the-job" poster contest (ages 5–14) which supports Society members, and educates children on the importance of workplace safety. The contest runs annually from September 19 through February 14.

Each year provinces and states, cities and counties support NAOSH week and local ASSE members by sponsoring and passing proclamations and resolutions in support of occupational SH&amp;E practitioners who work to prevent accidents, injuries and occupational diseases, create safer work and leisure environments and develop safer products. 

ASSE honors its members who have gone above and beyond in supporting NAOSH week and the profession with the annual ASSE North American Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH) Week Champion. The awards are presented each year at the ASSE Professional Development Conference.

Professor '''Oliver Murray Wrong''' (7 February 1925 – 24 February 2012) was an eminent academic [[nephrologist]] ([[kidney]] specialist) and one of the founders of the speciality in the United Kingdom. From a background as a "salt and water" [[physician]], he made detailed clinical observations and scientifically imaginative connections which were the basis of numerous advances in the [[molecular biology]] of the human kidney. Wrong himself contributed to much of the molecular work after his own "retirement". He dictated amendments to his final paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khositseth|first=S|author2=Bruce LJ |author3=Walsh SB |title=Tropical distal renal tubular acidosis: clinical and epidemiological studies in 78 patients|journal=QJM|year=2012|volume=105|issue=9|pages=861–877|doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcs139|pmid=22919024|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his final illness in his own teaching hospital, [[University College Hospital]] (UCH), London. Though academic in his leanings, he was a compassionate physician who established a warm rapport with patients, a link he regarded as the keystone of his research.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} He belonged to a generation of idealistic young doctors responsible for the establishment of the UK's [[National Health Service]] in the post-War years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Background ==

Wrong was born in [[Magdalen College]], [[Oxford]], and was one of six children of [[Edward Murray Wrong]] and Rosalind Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Oliver Wrong|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article3351520.ece|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Wrong was a history lecturer and later vice-president of Magdalen, and his own father was the historian [[George MacKinnon Wrong]], head of the department of history at [[University of Toronto]]. Rosalind, herself a historian, was the daughter of the Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], A.L. Smith. Murray died of heart disease at the age of 38 and Oliver wrote an account of his father's illness, including consultations with [[Sir William Osler]], in a vignette "Osler and my father".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=Oliver|title=Osler and my father|journal=J R Soc Med|year=2003|volume=96|issue=9|pages=462–464|doi=10.1258/jrsm.96.9.462|pmid=12949207|pmc=539606}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father's early death and the [[Great Depression]] led to a split in the upbringing of the six children. Oliver was sent to [[Toronto]] with two of his sisters and was raised by his grandfather, George MacKinnon Wrong. Another sister was [[Rosalind Mitchison]].

== Education ==

Oliver Wrong studied Medicine at Magdalen and completed his clinical studies at the Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford. His ‘National Service’ – military conscription - was spent with the Royal Army
Medical Corps in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. This was a geographical region to which he would return
several times in his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Oliver Wrong|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article3351520.ece|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After internships in Toronto and at Massachusetts General
Hospital with [[Alexander Leaf]], he was appointed University Tutor in Medicine at Manchester Royal
Infirmary. Leaf was a formative influence and an important paper was jointly produced on the role of
Anti-Diuretic Hormone and the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leaf|first=A|author2=Bartter FC |author3=Santos RF |author4=Wrong O |title=Evidence in man that urinary electrolyte loss induced by pitressin is a function of water retention|journal=J Clin Invest|year=1953|volume=32|issue=9|pages=868–878|doi=10.1172/jci102805 |pmid=13084753 |pmc=438416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and academic appointments ==

It was at Manchester with Dr. [[H.E.F. Davies]], in 1959, that Wrong wrote a ground-breaking paper
on the mechanisms leading to the excretion of acid in human [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=O|author2=Davies HE|title=The excretion of acid in renal disease|journal=Q J Med|year=1959|volume=28|issue=110|pages=259–313|pmid=13658353}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clinical analysis of this
process and the impact of [[kidney disease]] made this paper a ‘Citation Classic’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=O|title=This Week's Citation Classic|journal=Current Contents|year=1978|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing his time at Manchester, Wrong noted: ‘I realise what an excellent education [my years at Manchester]
provided by giving me time to tackle my own problems under a benign yet critical supervision.
Because of earlier marriage and the rigidity of our postgraduate medical training programme, few of our present graduates feel able to afford such self indulgence’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=O|title=This Week's Citation Classic|journal=Current Contents|year=1978|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an appointment at UCH,
Wrong became senior lecturer in medicine at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]]. This was followed by
appointment to the Chair of Medicine at [[Dundee University]] in 1969 and a return to UCH in 1972 to
succeed Professor [[Charles Enrique Dent|Charles Dent]] F.R.S. as a Professor of Medicine.

At UCH over the following years, and following retirement in 1990, Wrong developed major insights
into the physiology and pathophysiology of the human kidney. Wrong had a parallel interest in the
role of the [[large intestine]] in salt and water balance and developed much of his own experimental
work into a short monograph published in 1981. However, it was his renal work, based initially on the
urine acidification test which he developed with Davies, for which Wrong is best known.

== Research highlights ==

The original paper by Wrong and Davies examined the effect of the ‘short ammonium chloride loading test’ on acid excretion by the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=O|author2=Davies HE|title=The excretion of acid in renal disease|journal=Q J Med|year=1959|volume=28|issue=110|pages=259–313|pmid=13658353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=RJ|title=Back to the future: renal tubular acidosis then and now|journal=QJM|year=2012|volume=105|issue=9|pages=915–916|doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcs134|pmid=22855286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key insight was that in the group of diseases termed ‘Renal Tubular Acidosis’ (RTA), urinary excretion of [[ammonium]] was relatively well preserved. This was unlike the situation in chronic renal failure. Furthermore, the paper identified a subset of patients with ‘incomplete’ RTA. In large part due to Wrong’s work, it is now recognized that classical ‘distal’ or ‘Type 1 RTA’, due to the disease of the distal tubule, is only one form of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=AC|author2=Karet FE|title=Inherited renal acidoses|journal=Physiology|year=2007|volume=22|issue=3|pages=202–211|doi=10.1152/physiol.00044.2006|pmid=17557941}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Proximal’ or ‘Type 2 RTA’ is another.

The identification of several hereditary forms of RTA was developed by Wrong and co-workers and forms the basis of many of the advances of [[molecular genetics]] in this area. By rigorous phenotypic classification, Wrong and other workers showed that ‘Type 1 RTA’ could have either [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] (SCL4A1 mutation) or [[recessive]] inheritance. It was further shown that there were three forms of recessive RTA distinguished clinically and on the basis of molecular generics divided into disease due to SLC4A1 mutation and either the B1 or a4 subunits of the kidney H+-ATPase due to mutation of the ATP6V1B1 andATP6V0A4 genes respectively. Hereditary ‘Proximal’ or ‘Type 2 RTA’ may be caused by mutation of the SLC4A4 gene and yet a further ‘Type 3 RTA’ with combined features of proximal and distal RTA is due to mutation in the CA2 gene for carbonic anhydrase II. These developments in the [[molecular biology]] of the kidney may be traced back in large part, though not exclusively, to Wrong’s original 1959 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=AC|author2=Karet FE|title=Inherited renal acidoses|journal=Physiology|year=2007|volume=22|issue=3|pages=202–211|doi=10.1152/physiol.00044.2006|pmid=17557941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nephrocalcinosis]] was a subject on which Wrong was an international expert and he wrote the relevant chapter on this subject for one of the standard nephrology textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Textbook of Clinical Nephrology|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=1257–1280|author=Oliver Wrong|authorlink=Nephrocalcinosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summary of his experience of this finding based on almost his entire professional life.

Wrong was unusual in the breadth of his medical interests. His 1981 reference book, The Large Intestine: Its role in Mammalian Nutrition and Homeostasis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrong|first=Oliver M.|title=The large intestine : its role in mammalian nutrition and homeostasis|year=1981|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780470271674|author2=CJ Edmonds |author3=VS Chadwick }}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised research into a part of the human anatomy he felt was neglected due to unprofessional squeamishness on the part of the scientific establishment. "There is a curious reluctance in the medical profession to handle faeces," he said. He began a 1965 paper on the electrolyte content of human waste with the characteristically playful: "Stool is the Cinderella of electrolyte studies."

A great believer in self-experimentation, Wrong invented the "Wrong bags", which allow precious "in vivo" insights into the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]’s hidden workings. These were rolled-up ribbons of semi-permeable tubing which could be eaten at breakfast and examined on retrieval distended with faecal fluid allowing comparison of gastrointestinal solute transport in normal subjects and those with [[renal failure]]. Wrong manufactured 5,000 of these "bags" in his laboratory, and while colleagues and family members were recruited as experimental subjects, he swallowed most of them himself.

[[File:Stool Dialysis.jpg|thumb|Stool Dialysis]]
In a major medical insight, Wrong realised that a number of the patients he was seeing in one of his clinics at UCH had an apparently [[hereditary]] clinical syndrome very similar to that reported some 20 years earlier by Dent (his predecessor as Professor of Medicine at UCH) and Friedman in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=OM|author2=Norden AG |author3=Feest TG |title=Dent's disease; a familial proximal renal tubular syndrome with low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, metabolic bone disease, progressive renal failure and a marked male predominance|journal=QJM|year=1994|volume=87|issue=8|pages=473–493|pmid=7922301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dent and Friedman originally reported two unrelated patients with the condition they termed ‘Hypercalcuric Rickets’ without identifying any hereditary component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dent|first=CE|author2=Friedman M|title=Hypercalcuric Rickets Associated With Renal Tubular Damage|journal=Arch Dis Child|year=1964|volume=39|issue=205|pages=240–249|doi=10.1136/adc.39.205.240|pmid=14169453|pmc=2019188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrong, based on his own additional clinical work, discovered that this was a new hereditary disease and with his co-workers Norden and Feest reported it as a form of the renal ‘Fanconi Syndrome’.

A very similar hereditary clinical syndrome was reported by Scheinman and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frymoyer|first=PA|author2=Scheinman SJ |author3=Dunham PB |author4=Jones DB |author5=Hueber P |author6=Schroeder ET |title=X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis with renal failure|journal=N Engl J Med|year=1991|volume=325|issue=10|pages=681–686|doi=10.1056/nejm199109053251003|pmid=1908057}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clinical work was put on a very firm basis by Thakker, Scheinman and Wrong and colleagues who determined that mutation of the chloride channel gene CLCN5 was the cause of many, though not all, of these disorders including one of the two original patients described by Dent and Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=SE|author2=Pearce SH |author3=Fisher SE |title=A common molecular basis for three inherited kidney stone diseases|journal=Nature|year=1996|volume=379|pages=445–449|doi=10.1038/379445a0 |issue=6564 |pmid=8559248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrong had already been ‘retired’ for 6 years when this was published. It became clear that several similar clinical conditions were, on the basis of genetic analysis, the same as that which Wrong had originally termed ‘Dent’s Disease’ in honour of his late mentor. This disease is variously termed [[Dent's disease|Dent’s disease]] or Dent disease. Wrong’s insights, which made this previously relatively neglected disease well-known, have prompted the suggestion that the disease should more properly be termed ‘Dent-Wrong’ disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Oliver Wrong|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article3351520.ece|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrong’s identification of Dent and Friedman’s second patient as having ‘clinical’ Dent Disease was expanded when, in 2005, Scheinman’s group identified this patient and his family as having mutations not in CLCN5, the gene mutated in most of the families with Dent disease originally identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrong|first=OM|author2=Norden AG |author3=Feest TG |title=Dent's disease; a familial proximal renal tubular syndrome with low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, metabolic bone disease, progressive renal failure and a marked male predominance|journal=QJM|year=1994|volume=87|issue=8|pages=473–493|pmid=7922301}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a quite different gene OCRL1. This gene had been identified earlier as mutated
in patients with ‘Lowe Syndrome’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoopes|first=RR, Jr.|author2=Shrimpton AE |author3=Knohl SJ |title=Dent Disease with mutations in OCRL1|journal=Am J Hum Genet|year=2005|volume=76|issue=2|pages=260–267|doi=10.1086/427887 |pmid=15627218 |pmc=1196371|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrong’s discoveries had led to the identification of two new ‘new’ hereditary diseases, each based on one of Dent and Friedman’s original patients, and one ‘Dent Disease Type 1’ due to CLCN5 mutation and the other, ‘Dent Disease Type 2’ due to OCRL1
mutation.

Wrong, who had been diagnosed with idiopathic [[pulmonary fibrosis]] seven years earlier, was working on his final paper when admitted to Intensive Care Unit at UCH, the hospital at which he had spent most of his professional life. The paper, published posthumously, describes a variant of autosomal dominant distal RTA, due to SLC4A1 mutations, originally found in SE Asia. In that final paper, Wrong presented a novel hypothesis to explain the frequency of the mutations in the tropics despite their adverse clinical effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khositseth|first=S|author2=Bruce LJ |author3=Walsh SB |title=Tropical distal renal tubular acidosis: clinical and epidemiological studies in 78 patients|journal=QJM|year=2012|volume=105|issue=9|pages=861–877|doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcs139|pmid=22919024|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that changes in red cell metabolism might protect against malaria, a major killer in the region.

Professor Wrong's papers are stored at the Wellcome Trust Library, 183
Euston Road, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wellcome Library Western Manuscripts and Archives|url=http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27oliver%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27wrong%27%29%29|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paroxysmal Nonkinesigenic Dyskinesia''' ('''PNKD''') is an [[episodic movement disorder]] first described by Mount and Reback in 1940 under the name "Familial paroxysmal choreoathetosis".&lt;ref&gt;Mount, L. A.; Reback, S. : 
Familial paroxysmal choreoathetosis: preliminary report on a hitherto undescribed clinical syndrome. Arch. Neurol. Psychiat. 44: 841-847, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a rare hereditary disease that affects various [[Muscular system|muscular]] and [[nervous system]]s in the body, passing to roughly fifty percent of the offspring.

==Symptoms==
The condition manifests itself as attacks lasting from a few minutes to several hours.  Episodes only happen when the individual is awake, and they remain conscious throughout the attack. Symptoms are most severe in youth and lessen with age. Sufferers can have multiple attacks on a daily basis or may have periods of weeks or months between attacks. Symptoms experienced during attacks can vary and include [[dystonia]], [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], [[athetosis]], [[ballismus]], or a combination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&amp;part=pnknd NCBI Bookshelf -- GeneReviews -- Familial Paroxysmal Nonkinesigenic Dyskinesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triggers ==
While not the same in all people, there are several common triggers that can precipitate an attack:&lt;ref name="archneurol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/medical/mount_reback_syndrome.htm WrongDiagnosis.com - Mount-Reback syndrome]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moderate to high consumption of [[stimulants]], such as [[alcohol]], [[caffeine]], or [[nicotine]].
* Low amounts of energy due to [[hunger]], [[sleep deprivation|lack of sleep]], [[illness]], or [[Fatigue (medical)|physical fatigue]].
* Moderate to high presence of [[Stress (biological)|stress]].
* [[Menstruation]] and [[ovulation]].
==Genetics==
It has been mapped to [[chromosome 2]]q31-36.&lt;ref name="archneurol"&gt;[http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/56/6/721 Archives of Neurology - Familial Paroxysmal Dystonic Choreoathetosis]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been associated with [[PNKD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|118800}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}

==Treatment==
Most [[pharmacological]] treatments work poorly, but the best treatment is a low dosage of [[clonazepam]], a [[muscle relaxant]].  Patients may also benefit from other [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[phenobarbital]], and other [[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[valproic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdvu.org/library/disease/dyskinesias/pdys_tre.asp Dyskinesias (Paroxysmal) - Treatment]&lt;/ref&gt; Affected individuals have reported [[garlic]] to be effective for softening the attacks, but no studies have been done on this.&lt;ref name="archneurol"/&gt;

The '''Platzspitz park''' is a park in [[Zurich]], located next to the [[Swiss National Museum]]. 

==Biography==
History of the park goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Positioned between the [[Sihl]] and [[Limmat]] rivers, it was originally used as a hunting and shooting ground in the 14th century, and by the end of the 18th century the park was also adorned with beautiful [[Baroque architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-_und_erlebnisraeume/park-_und_gruenanlagen/platzspitz.html Platzpitz - City of Zurich official site] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, [[heroin]] addicts would frequently gather at the park, and attempts to disperse them merely resulted in them regrouping elsewhere. Thus in 1987 the authorities chose to allow illegal drug use and sales at the park, in an effort to contain Zurich's growing drug problem. Police were not allowed to enter the park or make arrests. Clean needles were given out to addicts as part of the Zurich Intervention Pilot Project, or ZIPP-AIDS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=New|first1=Mitya|title=Switzerland Unwrapped: Exposing the Myths|year=1997|isbn=978-1860643002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lack of control over what went on in the park caused a multitude of problems. Drug dealers and users arrived from all over Europe, and crime became rampant as dealers fought for control and addicts (who numbered up to 20,000) stole to support their habit. The once-beautiful gardens had degraded into a mess of mud and used needles, and the emergency services were overwhelmed with the number of overdoses, which were almost nightly. Platzspitz, or Needle Park as it was then known, became a source of embarrassment to the Swiss government and in 1992, police moved in to clear up the park.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/11/world/amid-growing-crime-zurich-closes-a-park-it-reserved-for-drug-addicts.html New York Times - Amid Growing Crime, Zurich Closes A Park It Reserved for Drug Addicts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Platzspitz has been cleaned up and restored, and is presented by the authorities as a peaceful, family-friendly garden.

==National Exhibition Vestige==
One structure that stands out is the [[gazebo]] that stands just behind the Swiss National Museum. It is very close to Zurich's main railway station. The Gazebo is a vestige of the first Switzerland's National Exhibition of 1883. It was first built to be a musical pavilion, a function it still serves to this day.&lt;ref name="Platzspitz Park"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazebo un Platzspitz Park - Zürich, Switzerland|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDRXD_Gazebo_un_Platzspitz_Park_Zrich_Switzerland|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc.|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">The '''Pocock boundary''' is a method for determining whether to stop a [[clinical trial]] prematurely. The typical [[clinical trial]] compares two groups of patients. One group are given a [[placebo]] or conventional treatment, while the other group of patients are given the treatment that is being tested. The investigators running the clinical trial will wish to stop the trial early for ethical reasons if the treatment group clearly shows evidence of benefit.  In other words, "when early results proved so promising it was no longer fair to keep patients on the older drugs for comparison, without giving them the opportunity to change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hall C|title=Heart attacks may be cut by half|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=5 September 2005|page=1|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1497648/Heart-attacks-may-be-cut-by-half.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was introduced by the medical statistician [[Stuart Pocock]] in 1977. The many reasons underlying when to stop a clinical trial for benefit were discussed in his editorial from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.294.17.2228|author=Pocock S|authorlink=Stuart Pocock|title=When (not) to stop a clinical trial for benefit|journal=JAMA|year=2005|volume=294|issue=17|pages=2228&amp;ndash;2230|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/294/17/2228|pmid=16264167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Pocock boundary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/biomet/64.2.191 |author=Pocock SJ |authorlink=Stuart Pocock |title=Group sequential methods in the design and analysis of clinical trials |journal=Biometrika |year=1977 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=191&amp;ndash;9 |jstor=2335684}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a [[p-value|''p''-value]] threshold for each interim analysis which guides the data monitoring committee on whether to stop the trial.  The boundary used depends on the number of interim analyses.

|}

The Pocock boundary is simple to use in that the ''p''-value threshold is  the same at each interim analysis.  The disadvantages are that the number of interim analyses must be fixed at the start and it is not possible under this scheme to add analyses after the trial has started.  Another disadvantage is that investigators and readers frequently do not understand how the ''p''-values are reported: for example, if there are five interim analyses planned, but the trial is stopped after the third interim analysis because the ''p''-value was 0.01, then the overall ''p''-value for the trial is still reported as &amp;lt;0.05 and not as 0.01.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9471 |pages=1657&amp;ndash;1661

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2944">'''Shared care''' involves the establishment of partnerships between professionals and laymen in which they share a common goal. Examples are an improvement in the health of a patient where there is [[patient empowerment]] to take a major degree of responsibility care and arrangements in which the life of a disadvantaged person is improved by the joint efforts of a [[social service]] and an outside lay provider. In truly shared care, the partnership is a genuinely equal one with neither partner being subservient or superior.

Shared care is a term largely used in [[health care]] and [[social care]] in [[Great Britain]].

==In general health care==
In a more mainstream health-orientated context, the term can be used for the schemes involving [[patient empowerment]] that are targeted at medical problems as [[substance abuse]] and [[diabetes]]. While generally welcomed, shared care approaches can raise concerns about what is expected from different individuals and, for healthcare professionals, the consequent legal implications of changes in liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholls JA, Potts HW, Coleman B, Patterson DL | title = Legal and professional implications of shared care: a case study in oral anticoagulation stroke prevention therapy | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 93 | date = 10 March 2015 | doi = 10.1186/s12913-015-0756-9 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/15/93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In complementary medicine==
In [[complementary medicine]], the term can be used for such therapies as [[hypnosis]] or [[Alexander Technique]] in which the therapist is an enabler rather than a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] prescriber (Alexander Technique practitioners even call themselves "teachers").

==In social care of children==
Shared care is used in a social context to describe the activities of organisations that provide short breaks for disadvantaged children or those helping to enlist families for short term fostering. In each case, there is significant input from the nonprofessional supervised by the professional.&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham Council Social Services Department - http://www.birmingham.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widespread with examples throughout the country of this usage, with clients from all age groups and types of disabilities or social problems.

The [[Child Support Agency]] uses the term for a very specific purpose: "it refers to each of the separated parents having the children with them part of the time, so that direct expenditure is shared too."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.childsupportanalysis.co.uk/analysis_and_opinion/shared_care/shared_care_summary.htm Child support &amp; Shared Care - overview].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19450">A '''smokeasy''' (also spelled '''smoke-easy''' or '''smokeeasy''') is a business, especially a bar or drinking venue, which  allows smoking despite a [[smoking ban]] enacted as a [[criminal law]] or an [[occupational safety and health]] regulation. The term is also used to describe locations and events promoted by tobacco companies to avoid or evade bans on smoking.&lt;ref name="urlPeter Stuyvesant’s Adelaide Smokeasy | The Enthusiast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theenthusiast.com.au/archives/2009/peter-stuyvesants-adelaide-smokeasy/|title=Peter Stuyvesant’s Adelaide Smokeasy &amp;#124; The Enthusiast|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506084848/http://www.theenthusiast.com.au/archives/2009/peter-stuyvesants-adelaide-smokeasy/|archivedate=2010-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was added to the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;"New Words," ''Chicago Tribune'', June 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; although it was used as early as 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Beck, "No Smoking," ''Newsweek'', October 2, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/smoke-easy.asp Wordspy: Smoke-easy]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[smoking]]'' and ''[[speakeasy]]''.

==Background==
Smoking bans have been pejoratively described as a type of [[sumptuary law]], a law that attempts to regulate habits of consumption, like the [[prohibition of alcohol]] and [[prohibition (drugs)|drug prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v. International Ass'n of Machinists, Local Lodge 1609'', 621 F.2d 756, 760 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|5th Cir.]] 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''People v. King'', 102 A.D.2d 710, 712 ([[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|N.Y. App. Div. 1st. Dept.]] 1984) (Carro, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Fox, "An assessment of the current legal climate concerning smoking in the workplace," 13 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 591, 623-624 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William de Wiveleslie Abney]], ''Colour Vision'', p. 140 (Wood: 1895)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher]], ''Principles of Political Economy'', p. 248 (New York, Holt: 1878)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman F. Selvin, ''The University of California and California Law and Lawyers, 1920-1978'', transcript of interview by Anne Brower, p. 35 (1976 and 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Summary," ''The American Architect'', Vol. XCII, No. 1650, p. 2 (Aug. 10, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harvey W. Wiley]], in H.S. Gray, "The Boy and the Cigarette Habit," ''Education'', Vol. XXX, No. 5, p. 298 (Jan. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]], "Notebook: Social hygiene" ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', July 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Amiel]], "Good luck if you've got nasty underclass tastes," ''[[Maclean's]]'', September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster: 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such prohibitions tend to trigger [[underground economy|underground economies]].&lt;ref name="bykofsky"&gt;[[Stu Bykofsky]], "'Smoke-easys' ignore the tobacco ban", ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', March 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devilspicnic"&gt;Taras Grescoe, ''The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Search of Forbidden Fruit'' (Bloomsbury USA: 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlesmokers"&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/272211_smokeeasy31.html "Smokers find refuge in secret nicotine dens"], ''Seattlepi.com'', May 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ashtoria"&gt;"Cig-ban Scofflaws light up Ash-Toria," ''The [[New York Post]]'', May 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For, when a sector of the population is prohibited by law from consuming a certain good, or consuming a certain good in a certain way, inevitably, some will flout that prohibition and provide the good or the means of consuming the good in a black-market fashion.&lt;ref name="devilspicnic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ashtoria"/&gt; Thus, just as [[prohibition in the United States]] led to the [[speakeasy]] (an establishment in which alcohol was sold in contravention of the law), so too have smoking bans led to the smokeasy.&lt;ref name="bykofsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devilspicnic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlesmokers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ashtoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolinger|first1=Patricia|title=Smokeeasy Crackdown Gets Serious|url=http://www.ecig-reviews.equinoxbeestudio.com|publisher=Denise J. Logan|accessdate=24 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Some smokeasy operators simply operate openly, calculating that the fines they will pay are merely a cost of doing business. Others employ stealth tactics; for example, in [[Philadelphia]], where it is illegal to have an [[ashtray]] in the workplace, smokeasy [[bartender]]s sometimes will use cups filled with some water to serve as ashtrays.&lt;ref name="bykofsky"/&gt; A visit from the city inspector then merely requires getting customers to extinguish their smoking materials and disposing of the [[cigarette]] butts.&lt;ref name="seattlesmokers"/&gt;

Because smokeasies are breaking the law, usually locations are spread by word-of-mouth; they even may involve the swearing of secrecy.&lt;ref name="seattlesmokers"/&gt; Although some smokeasies are [[underground restaurant|underground establishments]],&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1271792006 "Warning over 'smoke-easy' lock-ins"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', August 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; others are ordinary bars that covertly permit smoking in the evening.&lt;ref name="seattlesmokers"/&gt;

Sometimes businesses choose to openly defy existing smoking bans due to loss of business. There are cases in which establishments risk closure and heavy fines to draw attention to the issue, which includes being documented in the press as a smokeasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khon2.com/home/ticker/5425396.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725165328/http://www.khon2.com/home/ticker/5425396.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco companies and smokeasies==

Tobacco companies have used a variety of tactics to encourage the sale and consumption of cigarettes in the presence of smoking bans, and the term smokeasy has commonly been used to describe events and establishments of this kind. [[Imperial Tobacco]] hires public venues to promote its Peter Stuyvesant brand.&lt;ref name="urlPeter Stuyvesant’s Adelaide Smokeasy | The Enthusiast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlAdelaideNow... Secret smokes party for VIPs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25290946-2682,00.html |title=AdelaideNow... Secret smokes party for VIPs |work= Sunday Mail (SA)|accessdate= | first=Petra | last=Starke | date=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago, [[RJ Reynolds]] established an "upscale smoking lounge" serving alcohol and food, but classified as a retail tobacco store.&lt;ref name="urlChicagos (Legal) Smokeasy - Hit &amp; Run : Reason Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/blog/2006/01/19/chicagos-legal-smokeasy |title=Chicago's (Legal) Smokeasy - Hit &amp; Run : Reason Magazine |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===New York City===
Within one month of the passage of [[New York City]]'s smoking ban in 2003, smokeasies were quickly predicted.&lt;ref name="vanharken"&gt;[http://www.vanharken.com/smokingban/profile/profile-28days.html Smoking Ban NYC Profile - 28 days].&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, some bartenders began to hear word of smokeasies and theorized that some former regulars who were smokers had switched to the smokeasies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevillager.com/villager_9/sidewalksoakings.html "Sidewalk Soakings,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210212/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_9/sidewalksoakings.html |date=2007-09-27 }} ''The Villager'', June 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both covert and overt smokeasies exist throughout New York City and the whole state of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cig ban? What cig ban? City hot spots smoking again," ''The New York Post'', May 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://funkypundit.blogspot.com/2007/04/empire-state-smokeasies.html Empire State Smokeasies], ''Funkypundit Blog'', April 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/nyregion/04SMOK.html?ex=1388552400&amp;en=00adcfb68b653f75&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND "Waiting to inhale"], ''The New York Times'', January 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lighting-up time: Big Apple meets Big Smoke," ''[[The Times]]'', April 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gangsters will be the real winners in smoking ban," ''Scottish [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', January 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Smoked out?"

===Hawaii===
In [[Hawaii]], a large number of establishments openly defy the statewide smoking ban, one of America's strictest, which went into effect on November 16, 2006.&lt;ref name="honoluluweekly"&gt;Dean Carrico, "Thank you for [not] smoking: Bartenders and bar owners continue to ignore smoking ban," ''[[Honolulu Weekly]]'', June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Niesse, "Smoking ban openly defied by some bars," ''[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]'', February 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Au, "Smoking-ban rules, enforcement coming: Bar owners OK with patrons defying smoking ban," ''The [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'', June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Several bars have disclosed their defiance in local newspapers and have invited television stations to film the unlawful smoking.&lt;ref name="hawaiibans"&gt;[http://pacific.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2007/02/19/story2.html?b=1171861200%5E1419319 "What smoking ban? Some bars defy new law,"] ''Pacific Business Journal'', February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, no bar has been fined, and open defiance continues.&lt;ref name="hawaiibans"/&gt; Up to half of the bar owners in [[Honolulu]] have signed statements claiming losses averaging 30% and expressed open concern at the anti-smoking lobby claim that it would not affect business, a claim that was later reinforced by the Hawaii Department of Health's air quality study and Honolulu Liquor Commission sales data.&lt;ref name="honoluluweekly"/&gt; As a result, proposals currently are before the [[Hawaii Legislature]] to exempt bars from the statewide smoking ban by creating a new type of liquor license which permits the licensee to allow smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Niesse, "Bill would allow smoking in bars: Some establishments ignore the ban and are going unpunished," ''The Honolulu Star-Bulletin'', February 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
With the passing of a 2008 smoking ban, many Dutch cafes had become smokeasies despite facing fines up to 18,500 [[Euros]]. The Dutch pub owners viewed their defiance as necessary to stay in business, with the group [[Save the Small Cafe Owners]] stating the ban has cost them 1/3 of their business. The same groups also organized a 1500-5000 owner strong public protest of the ban in November, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ibVE6grha5qJ3su-g3vkNyxnWHAg]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two years of continued opposition by bar and cafe owners, in the fall of 2010 the Dutch government repealed the ban for smaller bars and cafes which had complained loudly about loss of business.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39992553/ns/world_news-europe/&lt;/ref&gt;

The system started in 1999 with the merger of the Providence Health System and the St. John Health System into the St. John Health System due to the merger of the two systems' respective Roman Catholic congregation sponsors, the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]] and the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]], into [[Ascension Health]].&lt;ref name=Greenehospitals&gt;Greene, Jay.

===Predecessor systems===
In 1910 the Providence Hospital opened in [[Detroit]]. The Sisters of St. Joseph built St. John Hospital in 1952,&lt;ref name=Greenehospitals/&gt; with 250 beds and 70 employees on Moross Road at the old Beaupre farm in a section called the “widow’s dower.” Work on the hospital began immediately following the groundbreaking ceremony on March 8, 1948, the feast of St. John of God (who in 1540 established a house to harbor poor and sick persons). Four-and-a-half year old Brenda Kay Earle was the hospital’s first patient on May 15, 1952. Also in that year, Randall John Stewart was the first baby born there.  In 2006, there were 4,900 employees and a 700-member medical staff. The hospital’s Emergency Room treated 8,287 patients during 1956, its first year.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Fr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5076">'''Willy Angerer''' (c. 1905 – July 21, 1936) was an Austrian mountaineer. He was one of four mountaineers who died in the [[1936 Eiger north face climbing disaster]], along with [[Toni Kurz]], [[Andreas Hinterstoisser]] and [[Eduard Rainer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Grindelwald: The Eiger |pages=1, 3 |publisher=Jungfrau Region Marketing AG |date= |url=http://jungfrauregion.ch/cmsfiles/the_eiger_jungfrau_region_e.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523110749/http://jungfrauregion.ch/cmsfiles/the_eiger_jungfrau_region_e.pdf |archivedate=2016-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At twenty-seven Angerer was the oldest of the four climbers who died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Willis |first=Clint |title=The Boys of Everest: The Tragic Story of Climbing's Greatest Generation |publisher=Pavilion Books |year=8 December 2014 |location=New York |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1DACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62  |isbn=978-1-91023-219-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1930s the mile-high [[North face (Eiger)|north-face of the Eiger]], that in the 1930s was considered to be the ''last great Alpine problem''.&lt;ref name="mountain names"&gt;{{cite book |last=Julyan |first=Robert Hixson |title=Mountain Names |publisher=[[The Mountaineers (club)|The Mountaineers]] |date=1984 |location=Seattle |page=84 |isbn=0-89886-054-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1935 two Bavarian climbers died attempting the climb despite a rescue attempt. Four climbers, two [[Austrian people|Austrians]] and two [[German people|Germans]], arrived in [[Alpiglen]], a settlement of [[Grindelwald]], in July 1936, intending to climb independently.&lt;ref name="extreme eiger"/&gt;

==The climb==
[[File:Eiger Nordwand - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|North face of the Eiger where Angerer and his colleagues died]]
The two Austrians, Angerer and Rainer, reconnoitered the route for a good line on July 6 because the previous attempt by [[Karl Mehringer]] and [[Max Sedlmeyer]] had taken two days to climb the first 700 meters and their conditions were not good, so retreated. On 18 July Angerer and Rainer returned to the mountain to restart their attempt.&lt;ref name="extreme eiger"/&gt; A rock fall injured Angerer in the head on 20 July 1936, forcing them to descend. However, when they reached the very difficult ''Hinterstoisser traverse'', now ice covered due to the worsening weather conditions, from which the rope had been removed on the way up, they were unable to retreat through to safety and were forced to descend straight down. They were hit by an avalanche which carried Hinterstoisser away, while Angerer was violently crushed against the wall and strangled to death by the rope around his neck. Rainer, being pressed against the rock wall with the rope tight around his waist, froze to death. The only survivor, Toni Kurz, died the next day, within a few meters above his rescuers, but inaccessible.&lt;ref name="extreme eiger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillman |first=Peter |author2=Gillman, Leni |title=Extreme Eiger: The Race to Climb the Direct Route up the North Face of the Eiger |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |date=4 June 2015 |location=London |pages=35–36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sa2dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP35 |isbn=978-1-47113-460-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurz was the last to die, hanging in his harness a few meters from a tunnel opening where a rescue team tried in vain to help him. With the mounting deaths on the Eiger's north face, the German press name "Nordwand" (North wall) was soon punned in sensational reports as "Mordwand" that translates in English as "murder wall".&lt;ref name="mountain names"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Angerer and his fellow alpinists' tragedy became well known after the publication of [[Heinrich Harrer]]'s classic 1960 book ''[[The White Spider]].''&lt;ref name="uk-climbing"/&gt; The [[Edward Whymper]] disaster, during which four alpinists died, on the [[first ascent of the Matterhorn]] seventy-one years before, had formerly been the most publicised Alpine disaster.&lt;ref name="extreme eiger"/&gt; The 1936 event was covered by [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]'s 2007 book (and [[International Emmy Awards|Emmy]]-winning TV documentary), ''[[The Beckoning Silence]]'', as well as in the 2008 German dramatic movie ''[[North Face (film)|North Face]]''.&lt;ref name="uk-climbing"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Kate |title=The Eiger Nordwand Revealed: Rainer Rettner Interview |publisher=UK Climbing |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=1004 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0844457|title=North Face}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

WGNRR was founded at the fourth International Women and Health Meeting in 1984.&lt;ref name="cccg.umontreal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estrada-Claudio|first=Sylvia|title=THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN AND HEALTH MEETINGS:  CATALYST AND END PRODUCT OF THE  GLOBAL FEMINIST HEALTH MOVEMENT|date=April 26, 2006|url=http://www.cccg.umontreal.ca/pdf/Sylvia%20Estrada-Claudio_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was themed "No to Population Control... Women Decide!" and saw the formation of other important international networks including Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and Latin American Women and Health Network.&lt;ref name="cccg.umontreal" /&gt; In 1987, at another IWHM conference, WGNRR partnered with the Latin America and Caribbean Women’s Health Network to launch a campaign addressing maternal mortality and declared May 28 the International Day of Action for Women's Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Portugal|first=Ana Maria|title=Highlights of the Latin American and Caribbean Women's Health Movement|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MDX/is_2-3_2004/ai_n27847398/|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using human rights to improve maternal and neonatal health: history, connections and a proposed practical approach|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/8/07-050500/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR was an active participant in the International Conference “Reinforcing Reproductive Rights”, held in Madras, India in 1993. It was this year that WGNRR began campaigning for safe and legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="wgnrr"&gt;{{cite web|title=WGNRR: History|url=http://www.wgnrr.org/history|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR's position on abortion was critical during the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in 1994. According to their website, "WGNRR was part of a coalition – the Women’s Alliance – to ensure that women’s voices were heard and represented at the conference. that protested the population control theories that abounded at the time. WGNRR was also involved in workshops protesting the use of anti-fertility “vaccines”.  WGNRR’s support of the ICPD’s inclusion of right to access of safe abortion was still tempered by its concern over the language and the fear of the misuse of such a document by proponents of coerced population control."&lt;ref name="wgnrr" /&gt; In 1995, WGNRR undertook campaigns to address the [[feminisation of poverty]] and was an active participant in the development of the [[Programme of Action]] for the Women’s World Conference in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pad.305 | volume=24 | title=Interpreting reproductive rights: institutional responses to the agenda in the 1990s | journal=Public Administration and Development | pages=41–50 | last1 = Xiaoquan Zhang | first1 = Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Cairo Consensus, WGNRR held a 1996 Regional Members' Meeting in Amsterdam. Between 2003 to 2007, WGNRR collaborated with the People’s Health Movement on the Women’s Access to Health campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Access to Health Campaign|url=http://www.phmovement.org/en/campaigns/33/page|publisher=People's Health Movement|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WGNRR then relocated its main office to the Global South and by 2009, the main office was transferred from the [[Netherlands]] to the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="wgnrr" /&gt;

WGNRR has facilitated several international campaigns on a wide range of issues including [[maternal mortality]] and morbidity, poverty, [[forced sterilization]] and the sexual and [[reproductive rights]] of youth. Since its inception, WGNRR has used "Calls for Action" to mobilize members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humble|first=Morag|title=Window on the World: Reproductive Rights and Health Movements|journal=Development|year=2005|volume=48|issue=4|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100196|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/development/journal/v48/n4/full/1100196a.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WGNRR's two primary campaigns are the International Day of Action for Women's Health (May 28) and the International Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion (September 28).

=== Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion ===
September 28 was chosen as the date for the Latin American and Caribbean Campaign for the Decriminalization of Abortion in 1990.&lt;ref name="wgnrr_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgnrr.org/current-campaigns|title=WGNRR: Current Campaigns|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the name of the day was changed to [[International Safe Abortion Day]] in an attempt to have a simpler, easier to remember name and to advocate for the day to become an official UN day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/international-safe-abortion-day/&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Funders ==
WGNRR works in partnership with and has received recent funding from [[Oxfam Novib]] and The Safe Abortion Action Fund (SAAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wgnrr.org/funders/|title=Funders {{!}} WGNRR|website=wgnrr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
