[[File:1956 Dodge La Femme fenderR.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Rear view of a car|[[Car tailfin|Tailfins]] gave a [[Space Age]] look to cars, and along with extensive use of chrome became commonplace by the end of the decade.]]
'''1950s American automobile culture''' has had an enduring influence on the [[culture of the United States]], as reflected in popular music, major trends from the 1950s and mainstream acceptance of the "[[hot rod]]" culture. The American manufacturing economy switched from producing [[War economy|war-related items]] to [[consumer goods]] at the end of [[World War II]], and by the end of the 1950s, one in six working Americans were employed either directly or indirectly in the [[automotive industry]]. The United States became the world's largest manufacturer of [[automobile]]s, and [[Henry Ford]]'s goal of 30 years earlier—that any man with a good job should be able to afford an automobile—was achieved.{{sfnp|Weiss|2003|p=34}} A new generation of service businesses focusing on customers with their automobiles sprang up during the decade, including [[drive-through]] or [[drive-in]] restaurants and more [[drive-in theater]]s (cinemas).

The decade began with 25 million [[Vehicle register|registered]] automobiles on the road, most of which predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to [[Rationing#United States|rationing]] and restrictions. By 1950, most factories had made the transition to a consumer-based economy, and more than 8 million cars were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 million cars registered in the United States, more than twice the number at the start of the decade.{{r|natpetnews}}

As part of the U.S. national defenses, to support military transport, the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across many parts of the United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no [[stoplight]]s on the way. The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous [[billboard]]s showing advertisements.

The dawning of the [[Space Age]] and [[Space Race#Early Space Race: 1950s|Space Race]] were reflected in contemporary American automotive styling. Large [[Car tailfin|tailfins]],{{sfnp|Gunnell|2004|p=15}} flowing designs reminiscent of [[V-2|rockets]], and [[Antenna (radio)|radio antennas]] that imitated [[Sputnik 1]] were common, owing to the efforts of design pioneers such as [[Harley Earl]].{{r|century2}}

==Interstate Highway System==
[[File:Interstate Highway plan September 1955.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map|The proposed [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1955]]
{{main|Interstate Highway System}}

The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly called the Interstate system or simply the Interstate) is a network of [[freeway]]s that forms a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] of the United States. While serving as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in Europe during World War II, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] had gained an appreciation of the German [[German autobahns|Autobahn]] network as an essential component of a national defense system, providing transport routes for military supplies and troop deployments.{{r|Petroski}} Construction was authorized by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]], and the original portion was completed 35 years later.  The system has contributed in shaping the United States into a world economic superpower and a highly industrialized nation.{{r|Genie}}

The Interstate grew quickly, along with the automobile industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom,{{r|hofstra}} and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.{{r|siedu}}

==Suburbanization==
The United States' investment in infrastructure such as highways and bridges coincided with the increasing availability of cars more suited to the higher speeds that better roads made possible, allowing people to live beyond the confines of major cities, and instead commute to and from work.{{r|Magazines1958}}

[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Levittown, Pennsylvania|Levittown]] c.&amp;nbsp;1959]]
After World War II, land developers began to buy land just outside the city limits of larger cities to build mass quantities of inexpensive [[Tract housing|tract houses]].{{r|historychannel}} One of the first examples of planned suburbanization is [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]], which was developed by [[William Levitt]] beginning in 1951 as a suburb of [[Philadelphia]].{{r|natpetnews}} The promise of their own [[Single-family detached home|single-family]] home on their own land,{{r|waltermartin}} together with a free college education and low-interest loans given to returning soldiers to purchase homes under the [[G.I. Bill]], drove demand for new homes to an unprecedented level. Additionally, 4 million babies were born every year during the 1950s. By the end of the baby boom era in 1964, almost 77 million "baby boomers" had been born,{{r|historychannel}} fueling the need for more suburban housing, and automobiles to commute them to and from the city centers for work and shopping.

By the end of the 1950s, one-third of Americans lived in the suburbs. Eleven of the United States's twelve largest cities recorded a declining population during the decade, with a consequent loss in tax revenues and city culture. Only [[Los Angeles]], a center for the car culture, gained population.{{r|schmoop}} Economist Richard Porter commented that "The automobile made suburbia possible, and the suburbs made the automobile essential."{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}}

{{clear}}

===Decline of the inner city===
More people joined the [[middle class]] in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the availability of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile.{{r|historychannel}} Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales.{{r|hofstra}} Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour,{{r|siedu}} and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the [[inner city|inner cities]]. The 1950s saw the beginning of [[white flight]] and [[urban sprawl]], driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.{{r|siedu2}}

[[File:Car of the Future 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|Science and Mechanics magazine cover, The Car of the Future|Auto-related magazines became common in the 1950s]]
As more middle-class and affluent people fled the city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population.{{r|GreenbergWatts2008}} At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from [[The New Deal]] forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629&amp;nbsp;percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20&amp;nbsp;percent more employees to serve the ever [[shrinking cities]].{{r|GreenbergWatts2008}} More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs.{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}} At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, [[Detroit]], the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents,{{r|detroit1950}} had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010,{{r|PopEstCities}} a reduction of 62 percent.

In some instances, the automotive industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation.{{sfnp|Dauvergne|2008|p=38}} The [[Great American streetcar scandal]] saw GM, [[Firestone Tire]], [[Standard Oil of California]], [[Phillips Petroleum]], [[Mack Trucks]] and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90&amp;nbsp;percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued that this was a deliberate destruction of streetcars as part of a larger strategy to push the United States into [[automobile dependency]].{{r|Snell1974}} In ''United States v. National City Lines, Inc.'', many were found guilty of antitrust violations.{{r|seventhcircuit}} The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', ''[[Taken for a Ride (film)|Taken for a Ride]]'' and ''[[The End of Suburbia]]''.

==Women's rights==
The automobile unions played a leading role in advancing the cause of [[women's rights]]. In 1955, the [[UAW|United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies.{{r|womenuaw}} In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Division of Transport Personnel]] had in 1943 instructed [[Teamsters Union]] officials that women should be allowed full employment as [[truck driver]]s. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure,{{r|vosko}} but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.{{r|umichwomen}}

==Motorsports==

===Hot rodding===
{{main|Hot rod}}

The increasing popularity of hot rodding cars (modifying them to increase performance) is reflected in part by the creation of special-interest magazines catering to this culture. ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' is the oldest such magazine, with first editor [[Wally Parks]]{{r|hotrodmag3}}, and founded by [[Robert E. Petersen]] in 1948, with original publication by his Petersen Publishing Company.{{r|hotrodmag3}} ''Hot Rod'' has licensed affiliation with [[Universal Technical Institute]].{{r|hotrodmag4}}

[[File:Hot Rods 2 db.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hot rod]]]]
The relative abundance and inexpensive nature of the [[Ford Model T]] and other cars from the 1920s to 1940s helped fuel the hot rod culture that developed, which was focused on getting the most linear speed out of these older automobiles. The origin of the term "hot rod" is unclear, but the culture blossomed in the post-war culture of the 1950s.{{sfnp|Genat|Cox|Parks|2003|p=41}}

''Hot Rod'' magazine's November 1950 cover announced the first hot rod to exceed 200&amp;nbsp;mph. The hand-crafted car used an Edelbrock-built [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] flathead V8 and set the record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]].{{r|hotrodmag2}} This {{convert|30000|acre|sqmi|adj=on}} region{{r|flats}} has been called the "Holy Grail of American Hot Rodding", and is often used for [[Land speed record|land speed racing]], a tradition that grew rapidly in the 1950s and continues today.{{r|flats2}}

Hot rodding was about more than raw power. [[Kustom Kulture]] started in the 1950s,{{r|kustom}} when artists such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]] transformed automobile [[pin striping]] from a seldom-used accent that followed the lines of the car into a freestyle art form. Von Dutch was as famous for his "flying eyeball"{{r|kustom}} as he was for his intricate spider-web designs.{{r|pinstripe}} As the decade began, hand-drawn pin striping was almost unheard of, but by 1958 it had become a popular method of customizing the looks of the hot rod.{{r|pinstripe}}  As the decade progressed, hot rodding became a popular hobby for a growing number of teenagers as the sport literally came to Main Street.{{r|hotrod2}}{{Clear}}

===Drag racing===
[[Drag racing]] has existed since the first cars, but it was not until the 1950s that it started to become mainstream, beginning with [[Santa Ana Drags]], the first [[Dragstrip|drag strip]] in the United States.{{r|nhra}} The strip was founded by C. J. "Pappy" Hart, Creighton Hunter and Frank Stillwell at the [[John Wayne Airport|Orange County Airport]] auxiliary runway in southern [[California]], and was operational from 1950 until June 21, 1959.{{r|wedidit}}

''Hot Rod'' editor Wally Parks created the [[National Hot Rod Association]] in 1951, and it is still the largest governing body in the popular sport.{{r|nhra}} {{as of|2012|10}}, there are at least 139 professional drag strips operational in the United States.{{r|dragtimes}} One of the most powerful racing fuels ever developed is [[nitromethane]], which dramatically debuted as a racing fuel in 1950, and continues as the primary component used in [[Top Fuel]] drag racing today.{{r|dragtimes2}}

===NASCAR===
[[File:Tim FlockFabulousHudsonHornet.jpg|thumb|alt=NASCAR winner "The Fabulous Hudson Hornet"|[[NASCAR]] winner "The Fabulous Hudson Hornet"]]
{{main|NASCAR}}
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the second most popular spectator sports in the United States behind the [[National Football League]] (NFL).{{r|forbes}} It was incorporated on February 21, 1948, by [[Bill France, Sr.]] and built its roots in the 1950s.{{r|nascar}} Two years later in 1950 the first asphalt "superspeedway", [[Darlington Speedway]], was opened in South Carolina, and the sport saw dramatic growth during the 1950s.{{r|nascar}} Because of the tremendous success of Darlington, construction began of a 2.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway near Daytona Beach, which is still in use.{{r|nascar}}

The [[NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] was started in 1949, with [[Jim Roper]] winning the first series.{{r|nascar}} By 2008, the most prestigious race in the series, the [[Daytona 500]] had attracted more than 17 million television viewers.{{r|jayski}} Dynasties were born in the 1950s with racers like [[Lee Petty]] (father of [[Richard Petty]], grandfather of [[Kyle Petty]]) and [[Buck Baker]] (father of [[Buddy Baker]]).

NASCAR, and stock car racing in general, has its roots in [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] during [[Prohibition]].{{r|bootleg}} [[Junior Johnson]] was one of many bootleggers who took part in the sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for operating his father's [[moonshine]] [[distillery|still]] as he is for his racing success.{{r|esquire}} He ended up spending a year in an Ohio prison,{{sfnp|Menzer|2001|p=59}} but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.{{r|bootleg}}

==New business models==
{{See also|Drive-through}}

===Faster food===
[[File:DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NARA - 547855.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drive-in restaurant menu board|[[Drive-in]]s take orders over an intercom system, with a [[carhop]] accepting payment and delivering the order on a tray that attaches to the car window.]]
As more Americans began driving cars, entirely new categories of businesses came into being to allow them to enjoy their products and services without having to leave their cars. This includes the [[drive-in]] restaurant, and later the drive-through window. Even into the 2010s, the [[Sonic Drive-In]] restaurant chain has provided primarily drive-in service by [[carhop]] in {{formatnum:3561}} restaurants within 43 [[U.S. state]]s, serving approximately 3 million customers per day.{{r|10K}}{{r|bg909}} Known for its use of carhops on [[roller skates]], the company annually hosts a competition to determine the top skating carhop in its system.{{r|vegassun}}

A number of other successful "drive up" businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including [[McDonald's]] (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and walk up to the window, taking their order "to go". Automation and the lack of dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the "Speedee Service System".{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|pp=19–20}} They redesigned their sign specifically to make it easier to see from the road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|p=20}} Businessman [[Ray Kroc]] joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.{{r|mcdonalds}}

Other chains were created to serve the increasingly mobile patron. [[Carl Karcher]] opened his first [[Carl's Jr.]] in 1956, and rapidly expanded, locating his restaurants near California's new freeway off-ramps.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|pp=21–22}} These restaurant models initially relied on the new and ubiquitous ownership of automobiles, and the willingness of patrons to dine in their automobiles. {{as of|2013}}, drive-through service account for 65&amp;nbsp;percent of their profits.{{r|slate}}

===Drive-in movies===
{{main|Drive-in theater}}

The drive-in theater is a form of [[movie theater|cinema]] structure consisting of a large outdoor [[movie screen]], a projection booth, a [[concession stand]] and a large [[parking lot|parking area]] for automobiles, where patrons view the movie from the comfort of their cars and listen via an electric speaker placed at each parking spot.

[[File:ForkUnionDriveIn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View of screen from back row|[[Drive-in theater]] just before the movie starts]]
Although drive-in movies first appeared in 1933,{{sfnp|Sanders|Sanders|2003|p=162}} it was not until well after the post-war era that they became popular, enjoying their greatest success in the 1950s, reaching a peak of more than 4,000 theaters in the United States alone.{{r|cnbcdrive}}{{r|tropes}} Drive-in theaters have been romanticized in popular culture with the movie ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and the television series ''[[Happy Days]]''. They developed a reputation for showing [[B movie]]s, typically monster or horror films, and as "passion pits", a place for teenagers to [[making out|make out]].{{r|tropes}} While drive-in theaters are rarer today with only 366 remaining{{r|cnbcdrive}} and no longer unique to America, they are still associated as part of the 1950s' American car culture.{{sfnp|Sanders|Sanders|2003|p=4}} Drive-in movies have seen somewhat of a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century, due in part to [[baby boomers|baby boomer]] nostalgia.{{r|tropes}}{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=April 2015}}

[[Robert Schuller]] started the nation's first drive-in church in 1955 in [[Garden Grove, California]]. After his regular 9:30&amp;nbsp;am service in the chapel four miles away, he would travel to the drive-in for a second Sunday service.{{r|penner1992}}  Worshipers listened to his sermon from the comfort of their cars, using the movie theater's speaker boxes.{{sfnp|Schlosser|2001|p=19}}{{Clear}}

===Malls===
[[File:2009-0611-003-Southdale.jpg|thumb|alt=interior, center courtyard and stairs|[[Southdale Center]] in 2009]]
The first modern shopping malls were built in the 1950s,{{r|newmall}} such as [[The Outlets at Bergen Town Center|Bergen Mall]], which was the first to use the term "mall" to describe the business model.  Other early malls moved retailing away from the dense, commercial downtowns into the largely residential suburbs. [[Northgate Mall (Seattle)|Northgate]] in [[Seattle]] is credited as being the first modern mall design, with two rows of businesses facing each other and a walkway separating them. It opened in 1950.  [[Shopper's World]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], was the two-story mall, and opened a year later.{{r|newmall}} The design was modified again in 1954 when [[Northland Center]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], used a centralized design with an anchor store in the middle of the mall, ringed by other stores. This was the first mall to have the parking lot completely surrounding the shopping center, and to provide [[HVAC|central heat and air-conditioning]].{{r|newmall}}

In 1956, [[Southdale Center]] opened in [[Edina, Minnesota]], just outside [[Minneapolis]].  It was the first to combine all these modern elements, being enclosed with a two-story design, central heat and air-conditioning plus a comfortable common area. It also featured two large department stores as anchors. Most industry professionals consider Southdale Center to be the first modern regional mall.{{r|newmall}}

This formula (enclosed space with stores attached, away from downtown and accessible only by automobile) became a popular way to build [[retail]] across the world. [[Victor Gruen]], one of the pioneers in mall design,{{r|victormall}} came to abhor this effect of his new design; he decried the creation of enormous "land wasting seas of parking" and the spread of suburban sprawl.{{r|deadmall}}

===Aftermarket===
The 1950s jump started an industry of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. The oldest aftermarket wheel company, [[American Racing]], started in 1956 and still builds "mag wheels" ([[alloy wheel]]s) for almost every car made.{{r|amracing}}  [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford offered in the 1957 Ford Thunderbird,{{r|holley}} and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. [[Edelbrock]] started during the [[Great Depression]] and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats.{{r|Edelbrock}} Owners were no longer restricted to the original equipment provided by manufacturers, helping not only create the hot rod culture{{sfnp|Lucsko|2008|p=105}} but also the foundation for cosmetic modifications. The creation and rapid expansion of the aftermarket made it possible for enthusiasts to personalize their automobiles.{{sfnp|Dregni|Williams|2010|p=35}}

===Distribution===
[[File:1949 Crosley Hotshot &amp; Appliance Display.jpg|thumb|alt=White car and refrigerator on display|[[Crosley]] autos were sold in a number of appliance stores in the early 1950s.]]
Most new cars were sold through [[Car dealership|automobile dealerships]] in the 1950s, but [[Crosley]] automobiles were still on sale at any number of appliance or department stores,{{r|crosleyapp}}{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2007|p=164}} and [[Allstate (automobile)|Allstate]] (a rebadged [[Henry J]]) could be ordered at any [[Sears|Sears and Roebuck]] in 1952 and 1953.{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2007|p=165}} By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.

Starting in the mid-1950s, new car introductions in the fall once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the [[Car model|models]] for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, the primary source of information on new models was the dealer.{{r|tstar}} The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by [[President of the United States|President]] Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.{{r|tstar}}

During the decade, many smaller manufacturers could not compete with the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] and either went out of business{{r|outofbiz}} or merged. In 1954, [[American Motors]] was formed when [[Hudson (automobile)|Hudson]] merged with [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation]] in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in United States history at that time.{{r|amcstart}}

===Muscle cars===
The [[muscle car|muscle-car]] era is deeply rooted in the 1950s,{{r|dealership}} although there is some debate as to the exact beginning. The 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88, created in response to public interest in speed and power, is often cited as the first muscle car. It featured America's first high-compression overhead valve V8 in the smaller, lighter Oldsmobile 76/Chevy body for six-cylinder engines (as opposed to bigger Olds 98 luxury body).&lt;ref&gt;Auto editors ofConsumer Guide (16 January 2007). "The Birth of Muscle Cars". musclecars.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved 18 January 2016. Dulcich, Steve (August 2007). "Rocket Man". Popular Hot Rodding. Retrieved 18 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Old Cars Weekly'' claims it started with the introduction of the original Chrysler [[Chrysler Hemi engine#331|"Firepower" hemi]] V8 engine in 1951,{{r|Weekly2010}} while others such as ''Hot Rod'' magazine consider the first overhead valve engine by Chevrolet, the 265 cid V8, as the "heir apparent to Ford flathead's position as the staple of racing", in 1955.{{r|hotrodmag}} The "[[Chevrolet small-block engine|small block Chevy]]" itself developed its own subculture that exists today.{{r|Mueller2005}} Other contenders include the 1949 [[Oldsmobile V8 engine]], the first in a long line of such powerful V8 engines,{{r|Mueller2004}}{{r|AmbrogioLuckerman2006}} as well as the [[Cadillac V8 engine#OHV|Cadillac V8]] of the same year.{{r|amercar}}

Regardless how it is credited, the [[horsepower]] race centered around the V8 engine{{r|dealership}}{{r|time}} and the muscle-car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s. This in turn opened up new opportunities for aftermarket manufacturers like Edelbrock.{{r|hotrodmag}} Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower,{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2007|p=7}} providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models. Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, in the name of "planned obsolescence"{{r|planned}}{{r|planned2}} and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes and cruise control, in an effort to make the previous models seem outdated and facilitate the long drive from the suburbs.{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2007|p=7}} Record sales made the decade arguably the "golden era" of automobile manufacturing.{{r|century3}}

Harley Earl and Bill France Sr. popularized the saying "Race on Sunday, sell on Monday",{{r|century}} a mantra still heard today in motorsports, particularly within NASCAR. During the muscle-car era, manufacturers not only sponsored the drivers, but designed [[Stock car racing|stock cars]] specifically to compete in the fast-growing and highly popular sport.{{r|dealership}}

==Songs celebrating the automobile==
As the automobile became more and more an extension of the individual, it was natural for this to be reflected in popular culture. America's love affair with the automobile was most evident in the music of the era.

*"[[Rocket 88]]" was first recorded in 1951 and originally credited to [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats, although it was later discovered to be the work of [[Ike Turner]]'s [[Kings of Rhythm]]. It is often credited as the first [[rock and roll]] song ever produced{{r|jahl}} and has been covered by other artists.
*"[[Hot Rod Lincoln]]" was first recorded in 1955 by Charlie Ryan,{{r|charlie}}{{r|charlie2}} and has since been recorded by [[Roger Miller]] and others.{{r|rmiller}} The 1960 [[Johnny Bond]] version charted at number 26 on Billboard Hot 100. Comedian [[Jim Varney]] produced a version with [[Ricky Skaggs]] for the motion picture ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.{{r|varney}} The song is still a popular live song for artists such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]]{{r|allmusicasleep}} and [[Junior Brown]].{{r|hotrodjr}}
*"[[Maybellene]]", released by [[Chuck Berry]] in 1955, is an uptempo rocker describing a hot rod race between a jilted lover and his unfaithful girlfriend. It was a #5 hit and was described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as the starting point of rock and roll guitar.{{r|rs-maybellene}}
*"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]" recorded by [[The Everly Brothers]], reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Pop chart, despite having been [[Banned in Boston|banned]] from Boston radio stations for lyrics about elaborating "our reputation is shot" because the narrator and his date slept through a drive-through movie date and missed their [[curfew]] by six hours.{{r|rstone}}
*"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]]" was released in 1959 and initially met with resistance by radio stations because of its dark message about a young girl who dies in an automobile/train accident.

Other songs recorded during the decade also reflect the automobile's place in American culture, such as "[[Brand New Cadillac]]", [[Sonny Burgess]]'s "Thunderbird" and [[Bo Diddley]]'s "Cadillac". A 1955 Oldsmobile was celebrated in the nostalgic "[[Ol' '55]]" by [[Tom Waits]] (1973).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3226">'''Abbamele''' (also known as '''abbattu''' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]) is a [[honey]]-based product from the [[rural culture]] of [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). It is also sometimes called "abbathu", "abazu" or "honey sapa".

According to the traditional methods of preparation, honeycombs are crushed, and the balls of wax containing 20-30% of honey are collected in generic containers. In the days immediately after all the honey extract has settled, the remaining combs containing honey and [[pollen]] are dipped in hot water (~ 50&amp;nbsp;°C), so that the water dissolves all the honey still present in the combs. At this point, any remaining lumps of wax and pollen are broken up through the use of a suitable mixer or by hand. The remaining wax is then pressed further to squeeze out any remaining liquid and is then stored in appropriate containers. The remaining liquid from the previous step is filtered, for example with a linen cloth, at least twice, and then placed in a suitable high-capacity boiler (sometimes made of [[copper]]) where it is boiled and concentrated via [[decoction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gourmetsardinia.com/s_abbamele.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202092233/http://www.gourmetsardinia.com/s_abbamele.html |archivedate=2012-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this concentration process, finely cut [[lemon]] or [[orange (fruit)|orange]] rinds are added, and any impurities on the surface of the liquid are removed. The content of the boiler becomes gradually syrupy and must be kept in constant motion to prevent the product from sticking on the bottom and developing a smokey flavour. The liquid also becomes caramelized, becoming dark like [[molasses]] but much more complex, with a toasty flavour that has hints of [[coffee]] and [[caramel]]. When the liquid assumes a consistency similar to that of honey, the heating is interrupted, and the boiler is deposited in a secluded place and allowed to cool before the abbamele is drained.

The resulting abbamele has a concentrated honey flavour, and can be eaten with [[cheese]], for example salted or smoked Sardinian ricotta cheese, with fresh [[fruit]], or even with [[pasta]] or [[vegetables]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zingermans.com/product.aspx?productid=p-abb&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American University of Malta''' ('''AUM''') is a [[private university|private]], American-style [[liberal arts college]] in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]]. The establishment of the educational institution was announced in May 2015, and the project is meant to regenerate the South of Malta and give said area an economic and social boost.&lt;ref name=opm-presentation/&gt; Since the proposal was announced, Dock 1 in Cospicua was chosen for the head campus, while extensions are being planned for other sites in Cospicua and Żonqor, [[Marsaskala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Mounting opposition to use of ODZ land|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=14 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233523/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially established on 16 September 2016,&lt;ref name="ourbeginnings"/&gt; and it opened in September 2017.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"/&gt;

==Planning and Opening==
On 5 May 2015, the [[Jordan]]ian contracting company Sadeen Group and the [[Government of Malta]] signed an agreement at [[Auberge de Castille]] for the former to set up a private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in [[Spain]], but Prime Minister of Malta [[Joseph Muscat]] persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|title=Heads of agreement for 4,000-student American university expected on Tuesday - timesofmalta.com|date=2015-09-12|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912200657/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|archivedate=2015-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time all campuses are complete, it is to have schools of business, architecture and design, engineering, arts, sciences, and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|title=AUM - American University of Malta|date=2018-01-06|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002945/http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|archivedate=2018-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original curricula of the AUM are provided by the [[DePaul University]]. The latter did not commit any financial resources for the construction of the AUM, and it was not involved in any discussions with the Government of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DePaul University denies involvement in site selection for proposed American University of Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=8 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913161255/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|archivedate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Kristin Claes|title=Faculty create curricula for American University of Malta|url=http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|work=DePaul Newsline|date=13 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520003229/http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|archivedate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of campus and use of ODZ land===
[[File:Site for the future American Institute of Malta.jpeg|thumb|Żonqor Point, where part of the university campus is to be built]]

When the university project was announced in May 2015, the government offered the Sadeen Group {{convert|90000|m2|abbr=on}} of Outside Development Zone (ODZ) land near Żonqor Point in [[Marsaskala]] on which to build the university. A natural park, partially funded by the university, would be set up nearby. The proposal to use ODZ land raised concerns among environmentalists, including the NGOs [[Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar]], [[Friends of the Earth]] Malta, Ramblers Association, [[Din l-Art Ħelwa]], NatureTrust Malta, [[Birdlife]] Malta, Malta Organic Agriculture Movement and Greenhouse. The Malta Developers Association also stated that a better site should be found,&lt;ref name=times2015-05-05&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort San Leonardo may be incorporated in new university campus|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=5 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928173056/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Church criticized the process used to select the land for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Church slams government’s handling of university bid|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=21 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220213628/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, residents of Marsaskala and southern Malta supported the university project by signing a petition in its favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tan-nofsinhar jiġbru petizzjoni favur il-proġett tal-università|url=http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|work=iNews Malta|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618014128/http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|archivedate=18 June 2015|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government initially planned to include the 19th-century [[Fort Leonardo]] within the university campus. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat also stated that constructing the university in Marsaskala would pressure the owners of the former [[Jerma Palace Hotel]] to redevelop the site, which has fallen into disrepair since being closed down in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalli|first1=Kim|title=University plan ‘puts pressure on Jerma site’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929031031/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|archivedate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2015, the Front Ħarsien ODZ ([[Maltese language|Maltese]] for ''Front for the Protection of ODZ'') was set up in response to the proposed development at Żonqor Point. The group aims to protect all ODZ land in Malta, and it includes then-[[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour]] MP, turned Democratic Party (PD) members, [[Marlene Farrugia]], [[Whip (politics)|government whip]] Godfrey Farrugia and former [[Alternattiva Demokratika]] politician, turned Nationalist Party (PN) member, [[Michael Briguglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Neil|title=Godfrey, Marlene Farrugia join 'Front Harsien ODZ,' group says Zonqor project can be stopped|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=23 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811133750/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|archivedate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June, the front held a protest in [[Valletta]] against the development, and it was attended by 3000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces reduced university plans for Zonqor|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_#.VncO4PkrLIV|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=20 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010090820/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_|archivedate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, Muscat announced that the government had reached an agreement with the Sadeen Group that the campus be split between the former [[Malta Dockyard|Dock No. 1]] in [[Cospicua]] and a reduced site at Żonqor Point. The campus at Żonqor is much smaller than the one originally planned, and it will occupy the site of the water polo pitch and {{convert|18000|m2|abbr=on}} of adjoining ODZ fields. This campus is to consist of three faculties and student dormitories, with a maximum height of five stories. A new water polo pitch is also to be built to replace the one that will be demolished to make way for the university. The campus at Cospicua will occupy two former [[warehouse]]s at Dock No. 1 which were built during [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] and [[British Empire|British]] rule. Additional buildings are to be constructed, but they are to keep with the architectural style of the area.&lt;ref name=times2015-08-20&gt;{{cite news|title='American' University to occupy Dock 1 buildings and reduced Zonqor site|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150820/local/update-3-american-university-to-occupy-dock-1-buildings-and-reduced.581335|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911141423/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150820/local/update-3-american-university-to-occupy-dock-1-buildings-and-reduced.581335|archivedate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restoration project is bringing an otherwise run down Dock no. 1 back on its feet, which had been abandoned with the end of the rule of the British.

===Accreditation and licensing===
In December 2015, Leader of the Opposition [[Simon Busuttil]] stated that since the AUM applied for the licence of a "Higher Education Institution", its marketing of itself as a "University" is illegal.&lt;ref name=times2015-12-15/&gt; In January 2016, the National Commission for Further and Higher Education announced that Sadeen Education Investment Ltd had been given a licence to operate a Higher Education Institution under the name ''American Institute of Malta''.

However, on 11 March 2016, Sadeen Education Investment Ltd was notified by a judicial letter that licensed higher education institutions are prohibited from using the word "university" in their advertising and publicity, unless they have been granted that status formally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vella|first1=Matthew|title=Watchdog fines Sadeen for marketing unlicensed 'university'|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63682/watchdog_fines_sadeen_over_aum_logo|work=Malta Today|date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2016, Economy Minister [[Christian Cardona]] said that he had "no doubt that this will be a University and not an institute.

The National Commission for Higher Education officially accredited the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month process which included financial and academic evaluations.

===Criticism===
Some questions have been raised by Maltese media about whether AUM is actually American. This is especially due to the company behind the project being Jordanian. In response to this, AUM's provost John Ryder stated that the university is "not a brand or offshoot, or run by any American university ...

A spokesperson for DePaul University issued a statement, qualifying the officiality of AUM’s curricula, saying that; "Faculty designed degree programs in areas that were requested, with the dual goals of being academically well-designed and meeting regulatory requirements in Malta. Individual faculty members were selected with the help of teams -- composed of associate deans, school directors and department chairs -- in the relevant colleges. Faculty then were asked to design the curriculum, and they were compensated for their work," also adding; "[t]he right to use our name (DePaul University) is specifically in connection to the curriculum.

Muscat was accused of a lack of transparency with regards to how agreements on the AUM were made, but he responded by saying that the public was informed on the first occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘I can’t see how I can be more transparent’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150517/interview/i-cant-see-how-i-can-be-more-transparent.568415|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=17 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220212411/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150517/interview/i-cant-see-how-i-can-be-more-transparent.568415|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs have called for the publication of the agreement between the government and Sadeen Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NGOs urge publication of Sadeen deal for university|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151103/local/ngos-urge-publication-of-sadeen-deal-for-university.590697|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=3 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220214744/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151103/local/ngos-urge-publication-of-sadeen-deal-for-university.590697|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUM has also generated controversy with regard to the practicality of having another university in the small country of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayo|first1=Peter|title=Of Universities, Monopolies, and Public Goods|journal=Think|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|publisher=[[University of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220183841/http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government stated that the AUM would end the monopoly that the [[University of Malta]] has on higher education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=David|title=Government seeking to end University of Malta’s ‘monopoly’|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=3 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807015710/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|archivedate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, lecturers at the University of Malta disagreed with the use of the term "monopoly", stating that the university already competes with other institutions such as [[MCAST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lecturers rubbish PM's claim of university monopoly|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522183824/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|archivedate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AUM's early phase, low student intake and initial refusals to release the official enrollment figures became flashpoints of controversy. An early promotional video presented the new university's plan to admit 1,000 students in its first year, eventually reaching a total enrollment of 4,000 students by its fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Y01mF8p13tk|title=AUM Promo Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AUM officially began offering classes on Tuesday September 12, 2017, rather than Monday September 11, to avoid association with the [[September 11 attacks]] anniversary.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM Opens its Doors to the First Batch of Students|url=http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/page.aspx?rid=8697&amp;preview=1&amp;c=95493AB4B36E9D8D6637317593DB929F7C5700C8&amp;k=-534249962|work=maltachamber.org.mt|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how many students the AUM admitted for the Fall semester, Provost John Ryder would only say that student recruitment was “proving to be challenging." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM student enrolment is 'proving challenging', provost says|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170906/local/aum-student-enrolment-is-proving-challenging-provost-says.657269|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the [[Times of Malta]] reported that the AUM's revised plan was to enroll 330 students in its first semester, but the "university managed to attract 15 students"&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM firing staff after failing to attract students|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171112/local/aum-firing-staff-after-failing-to-attract-students.662834|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was denied by university officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schembri Orland|first1=Kevin|title=AUM says it has more than 15 students, but still doesn't divulge number|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-11-19/local-news/AUM-says-it-has-more-than-15-students-but-still-doesn-t-divulge-number-6736181619|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Ryder acknowledged in a [[Television Malta]] interview that the AUM student body numbered 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM rector says original targets were not realistic but is confident for the future|url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/aum-rector-says-original-targets-were-not-realistic-but-is-confident-for-the-future/|work=[[Television Malta]]|date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUM personnel decisions have also generated controversy, raising concerns about the legality of the new institution's employment policies and practices. Within a period of 7 months, 10 university employees were terminated, either by [[dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] or resignation: (1) Deputy (Construction Project) Manager (dismissal), (2) Admissions Director (dismissal), (3) Marketing and Public Relations Director (dismissal), (4) Vice President for Administrative Affairs (dismissal), (5) IT Technician (dismissal), (6) Webmaster (resignation), (7) Admissions Counselor (resignation), (8) Human Resources Director (dismissal), (9) Professor of Finance (dismissal) and (10) Dean of Student Affairs (resignation).&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=This is What the American University of Malta Looks Like Two Years Later|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking/this-is-what-the-american-university-of-malta-looks-like-two-years-later|work=lovinmalta.com|date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismissed deputy manager filed a judicial protest against Sadeen Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta deputy manager says claims against him were fabricated|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170523/local/american-university-deputy-manager-says-claims-against-him-were.648810|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former admissions director sued the university for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple file judicial protest claiming unfair dismissal by Sadeen Education Investment Ltd|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-10-20/local-news/Couple-file-judicial-protest-claiming-unfair-dismissal-by-Sadeen-Education-Investment-Ltd-6736180457|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2018, Provost John Ryder informed the twelve remaining AUM faculty members by e-mail that their employment with the university had been terminated without cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=BREAKING: American University of Malta Has Sacked All Its Faculty|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking-american-university-of-malta-has-sacked-it's-faculty|work=lovinmalta.com|date=4 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Attard|first1=Rachel|title=AUM full time lecturers said to have been 'dismissed by email'|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-01-04/local-news/AUM-full-time-lectures-said-to-have-been-dismissed-by-email-6736183231|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the university's small student body, high employee turnover and growing legal troubles, Malta's Education Minister [[Evarist Bartolo]] insisted that the AUM is not a  “garage operation” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grech|first1=Helena|title=Minister would rather see the American University of Malta 'start small, grow gradually'|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-11-13/local-news/Education-Minister-would-rather-see-AUM-start-small-grow-gradually-6736181366|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources of controversy include allegations of legal and ethical wrongdoing by members of the AUM's board of trustees.

In the [[Philippines]], a '''baklâ''' ({{IPA-tl|bɐkˈlaʔ|pron}}), '''bayot''' ([[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]) or  '''agi''' ([[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]) is a person who was assigned male at birth, but usually, have adopted feminine mannerisms and usually [[transvestism|dress as women]].&lt;ref name="Tan2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Michael L.|title=Survival Through Pluralism: Emerging Gay Communities in the Philippines|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2001|volume=40|issue=3/4|page=117|doi=10.1300/j082v40n03_07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often considered a [[third gender]].&lt;ref name="Aggleton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Men who sell sex: international perspectives on male prostitution and HIV/AIDS |last=Aggleton |first=Peter |year=1999 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=1-56639-669-7 |page=246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WYZ0wNpZfIC&amp;lpg=RA3-PA241&amp;pg=RA3-PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=bakla |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bakla are exclusively [[sexual attraction|attracted]] to men, but are not necessarily [[Male homosexuality|gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getrealphilippines.com/blog/2017/07/being-bakla-is-not-the-same-as-being-gay/|title=Being ‘bakla’ is NOT the same as being gay|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Get Real Post|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[trans woman|self-identify as women]].

Bakla are socially and economically integrated into [[Filipino society]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} However, some Filipinos disapprove or reject of baklas, usually on [[Religion in the Philippines|religious]] grounds or related social and political reasons. The stereotype of a baklâ is a ''parlorista''–a flamboyant, [[camp (style)|camp]] cross-dresser who works in a [[beauty salon]].&lt;ref name="Benedicto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benedicto |first=Bobby |year=2008 |title=The Haunting of Gay Manila: Global Space-Time and the specter of Kabaklaan |journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies |volume=14 |issue=2-3 |pages=317–338 |doi=10.1215/10642684-2007-035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[Same-sex marriage]] is not recognised in the Philippines, preventing many baklâs from getting married. Legislation attempting to legalise same-sex marriage in the Philippines has been presented to [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congress]], but none have passed thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workers.org/world/2005/npa_0224/ |title=New Peoples Army recognizes same-sex marriage |author=LeiLani Dowell |date=2005-02-17 |publisher=Workers World Party |accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{see also|Religion in the Philippines}}
The Philippines is predominantly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christian]], with over 80% of Filipinos belonging to the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35425.htm|quote=Over 81 percent of citizens claim membership in the Roman Catholic Church, according to the official 2000 census data on religious preference.|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2004|title=Philippines|publisher=U.S. Department of State|year=2004|accessdate=11 July 2010| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100713201326/http%3A//www%2Estate%2Egov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35425%2Ehtm| archivedate= 13 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church doctrine officially tolerates persons with such orientations but condemns homosexual activity as "intrinsically disordered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Catechism|part=p3|section=s2|chapter=c2|article=a6|div=#2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condemnation of homosexuality presents a problem for baklâ because of potential discrimination in a Catholic-dominated society. As a result, baklâ youth in particular are at a higher risk for suicide, depression and substance abuse than their heterosexual peers, with risk increasing as parental acceptance decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes|first1=Mark|title=Perceived Parental Support as a Protective Factor Against Suicidal Ideation of Self-identified Lesbian and Gay Filipino Adolescents|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|date=2015|volume=17|issue=2|pages=245–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a significant minority, baklâ adherents of [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestantism]] face varying degrees of acceptance based on the denomination to which they belong. The [[Philippine Independent Church]], which is in [[full communion]] with the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], officially does not endorse homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anglican Communion Q&amp;A|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/145156/Anglican-Communion-QA-2015.pdf|website=Anglican Communion Home Page|publisher=Anglican Communion Office|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Evangelical]] churches and the [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]] are more [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] in doctrine, and thus strongly condemn homosexual acts and suppress such identities within their congregations.

Non-Christian Filipinos who profess [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and other faiths also present a wide range of doctrinal views.

===History===
In [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Pre-colonial Philippines]], the bakla, especially those who crossdress (''asog'', ''bayoc'' or ''bayoquin'' in Spanish sources), were commonly shamans (''[[babaylan]]''), a role usually taken by women. ''Babaylan'' were highly respected members of the community who functioned as healers, keepers of oral histories, sorcerers, and as [[spirit medium]]s for communicating with ancestral and nature spirits (''[[anito]]'').&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose S.

==Etymology==
In [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], the term "baklâ" means "homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = baklà|last = Wolff|first = John U. |encyclopedia = A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan|year = 1972|url = http://seapdatapapers.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=seap&amp;cc=seap&amp;idno=seap085a&amp;node=seap085a%3A11&amp;view=image&amp;seq=110&amp;size=200|page = 86|volume = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Filipino language|Filipino]], it can mean either "effeminate man" or "homosexual"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/cgi-bin/search.pl?s=bakla |title=bakla |year=2004 |work=Tagalog Dictionary |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the word itself has been used for centuries, albeit in different contexts. The [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] poet [[Francisco Balagtas]] used the word "bacla" in reference to "a temporary lack of resolve", as seen in his popular works ''[[Florante at Laura]]'' and ''Orosman at Zafira''.&lt;ref name="Garcia2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garcia |first1=J. Neil C. |year=2008 |title=Philippine Gay Culture: Binabae to Bakla, Silahis to MSM |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93lag7tXriIC |location=Manila, Philippines |publisher=UP Press |isbn=9715425771 |accessdate=18 November 2013 |quote="Also, another semantic space that bakla occupies refers to a state of mental confusion and undecidedness.  This may be used to bear a linguistic affinity to the way Tagalog poet Francisco Balagtas used the word bakla in the context of a temporary lack of resolve, an emotional wavering in several scenes in at least two of his best known works, the romance Florante at Laura and the play Orosman at Zafira; later, prewar Tagalog writers used bakla to mean fearful and weakened.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also called '''[[wikt:bayot|bayot]]''' in Cebuano{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and '''[[wikt:agi#Hiligaynon|agi]]''' in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon/Ilonggo]].

In narrating the [[Agony in the Garden]], the traditional religious [[epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Pasyon|Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa]]'' (The History of the Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that Surely Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth), which is often [[Pabasa|chanted]] during [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]], has a passage that reads ''Si Cristo'y nabacla'' ("Christ was confused"). During Balagtas' time, when the Philippines was a Spanish colony, homosexual men were called "binabae" or "bayogin" like Alejandro Penunuri.&lt;ref name="Katipunan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/41CEF311DF0F4E4/1003/history-may-bakla-nga-ba-na-kasapi-sa-katipunan |title=HISTORY: MAY BAKLA NGA BA NA KASAPI SA KATIPUNAN? |last1=de Veyra |first1=Lourd |date=24 October 2013 |website=News5 Everywhere |accessdate=17 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305101402/http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/41CEF311DF0F4E4/1003/history-may-bakla-nga-ba-na-kasapi-sa-katipunan |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-[[World War II]] Tagalog meanwhile used ''baklâ'' to mean "fearful" or "weakened".&lt;ref name="Garcia2" /&gt;

Baklâ is commonly believed to be a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[wikt:babae#Tagalog|babae]], meaning woman, and [[wikt:lalaki#Talagog|lalaki]], meaning man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manalansan|first1=Martin|title=Global Divas: Filipino Gay Men in the Diaspora|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|page=25|edition=illustrated|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Bakla generally dress and act like women, grow their hair long, have [[breast implant]]s, take hormone pills and make other changes to look more feminine. Some go so far as to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]], but this is uncommon.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garcia |first=J. Nelia C. |year=2000 |title=Performativity, the bakla and the orienting gaze |journal=Inter-Asia Cultural Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=265–281 |doi=10.1080/14649370050141140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baklâ are often considered a [[third gender]].&lt;ref name="Aggleton"/&gt; J. Neil C. García recalls a children's rhyme that begins by listing four distinct genders: "girl, boy, baklâ, [[tomboy]]."&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; (In the Philippines, tomboy explicitly refers to a [[lesbian]].)

Nowadays, in almost every city and town in the Philippines there is at least one baklâ (in general many baklâs) living a normal life, accepted (at least by some) as a member of the third sex. This general acceptance of the baklâ sexuality does not, however, imply that they are considered equal to the other genders.{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} García states that the ordering "girl, boy, baklâ, tomboy" implies "[The differing gender's] hierarchical positioning relative to each other".&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; Although Filipino society is surprisingly tolerant of baklâ, there is an implied superiority of the "traditional" sexes over the other two.

Despite this supposed "hierarchy of the sexes," baklâ have become recognized and accepted by most of society; they have become an integral part it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} There are successful ones, such as some ''parlorista'' who own or work at beauty salons and are considered more meticulous and detail-oriented than female peers. A few prominent social icons are also baklâ, such as television personality [[Boy Abunda]], hairdresser and entrepreneur [[Ricky Reyes (hairdresser)|Ricky Reyes]], actor-comedian [[Vice Ganda]], Filipino fashion designer [[Michael Cinco]] and the world's first LGBT political party called [[Ladlad]] which means "coming out".

==Culture==
In the second edition of the now-defunct gay lifestyle magazine ''Icon Magazine'', editor Richie Villarin quoted one of the magazine's advertisers as saying "We cannot remain oblivious to your market".&lt;ref name="Benedicto"/&gt;

Baklâs have been instrumental in the opening of badong clubs in the Philippines&lt;ref name="Benedicto"/&gt; and can also be found in service, retail, and both sexual and non-sexual entertainment industries. Despite their high visibility, acceptance of baklâs is limited, especially for gay professionals.&lt;ref name="Tan2001"/&gt;

===Beauty pageants===
Baklâ communities are renowned for beauty pageants,&lt;ref name="Benedicto" /&gt; with [[Miss Gay Philippines]] being a national beauty pageant for baklâs. The participants model swimsuits and dresses, as in other beauty pageants worldwide.

===Swardspeak===
{{Main|Swardspeak}}
Baklâs have an [[argot]], or secret language, called ''[[swardspeak]]''. It is used by both masculine and feminine baklâs and incorporates elements from Filipino, [[Philippine English]] and [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], spoken with a hyper-feminised [[inflection]].&lt;ref name="Benedicto"/&gt;  It was widespread and popular until the 1990s, but is now considered unfashionable in most parts of [[Manila]].&lt;ref name="Benedicto"/&gt; It has been argued that it is more appropriate to call modern swardspeak "gayspeak" instead; despite being strongly identifiable as gay lingo, it is also used by heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alba|first1=Reinerio A.|title=In Focus: The Filipino Gayspeak (Filipino Gay Lingo)|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/in-focus/the-filipino-gayspeak-filipino-gay-lingo/|website=In Focus: The Filipino Gayspeak (Filipino Gay Lingo)|publisher=Republic of the Philippines National Commission for Culture and the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1735">The '''Basketo people''' are an [[Omotic languages|Omotic-speaking]] ethnic group whose homeland lies in the southern part of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region]] (SNNPR) of [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Basketo special woreda]] is named after this ethnic group. According to the 2007 Ethiopian national census, this ethnic group has 78,284 members, of whom 99.3% live in the SNNPR.&lt;ref name=2007-census&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf 2007 Ethiopian census, first draft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305000000/http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf |date=March 5, 2009 }}, Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (accessed 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basketo cultivate [[ensete]] and, additionally, tuber roots, [[maize]], [[millet]] and vegetables. They also keep domestic animals in small numbers.

Traditionally, the Basketo were organized as a segmentary clan society headed by a divine king, the ''kati''. The ethnic religion of the Basketo knew a duality of the sky-god Tsosii and the earth-mother Qacharunde. Under Ethiopian rule many of them converted to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]].

The Basketo were conquered for the Ethiopian empire by [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Welde Giyorgis]] in 1893.

==History and characteristic features==

It is hard to ascertain when the earliest features of a characteristic Bosnian type of [[Cyrillic script]] had begun to appear, but paleographers consider the [[Humac tablet]] (a tablet written in Bosnian Cyrillic&lt;ref name="dzaja-lovrenovic-polemic-vjenac"&gt;{{cite web |title=Srećko M. Džaja vs. Ivan Lovrenović – polemika o kulturnom identitetu BiH Ivan Lovrenović |url=http://ivanlovrenovic.com/2015/06/srecko-m-dzaja-vs-ivan-lovrenovic-polemika-o-kulturnom-identitetu-bih/ |website=ivanlovrenovic.com |publisher=Polemics appeared between [[Srećko M. Džaja]] &amp; [[Ivan Lovrenović]] in Zagreb's biweekly "Vijenac", later in whole published in Journal of Franciscan theology in Sarajevo, "Bosna franciscana" No.42 |accessdate=6 June 2018 |language=hr |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to be the first document of this type of script and is believed&lt;ref name="dzaja-lovrenovic-polemic-vjenac"/&gt; to date from the 10th or 11th century&lt;ref name="dzaja-lovrenovic-polemic-vjenac"/&gt;. Bosnian Cyrillic was used continuously until the 18th century, with sporadic usage even taking place in the 20th century.

Historically, Bosnian Cyrillic is prominent in the following areas:

*Passages from the [[Bible]] in documents of [[Bosnian Church]] adherents, 13th and 15th century.
*Numerous legal and commercial documents (charters, letters, donations) of nobles and royalty from medieval Bosnian state in correspondence with the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and various cities in [[Dalmatia]] (''e.g.'' the [[Charter of Ban Kulin]]{{Dubious |reason=Charter of Ban Kulin was not written in fast-written ("brzopisni") type of Cyrillic which is the type used by Bosančica. Also, "brzopisni" type of Cyrillic, Bosančica, was used in Bosnia from 13th or 14th century, not before, according to linguist from Dubrovnik, Milan Rešetar"|date=November 2017}}), beginning in the 12th and 13th centuries, and reaching its peak in the 14th and 15th centuries.
*[[Stecci|Tombstone inscriptions]] on marbles in medieval [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], chiefly between 11th and 15th centuries.
*Legal documents in central [[Dalmatia]], like the [[Poljica Statute]] (1440) and other numerous charters from this area; Poljica and neighbourhood Roman Catholic church books used this alphabet until the late 19th century.
*The "Supetar fragment" from the 12th century was found in [[Sveti Petar u Šumi]] in central [[Istria]], among the stones of a collapsed southern monastery wall. Until the 15th century it was a Benedictine monastery and later a Pauline monastery. This finding could indicate that Bosančica spread all the way to Istria and [[Kvarner Gulf]].{{Dubious |reason=No reference. According to Istrarska Encikplopedija, it is just a Cyrillic, not particulary Bosančica Cyrillic, and in Croatian Glagolic written text|date=November 2017}}
*The Roman Catholic diocese in [[Omiš]] had a [[seminary]] (called ''arvacki šeminarij'', "Croat seminary") active in the 19th century, in which ''arvatica'' letters were used.
*Liturgical works (missals, breviaries, lectionaries) of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from Dubrovnik, 15th and 16th century - the most famous is a printed breviary from 1512&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7U0PvCMl-5gC&amp;pg=PA275 | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | title = Orthographies in Early Modern Europe | page = 275 | quote = [...] the first printed book in Cyrillic (or, to be more precise, in ''Bosančica'') [...] (''Dubrovnik Breviary'' of 1512; cf.

*The comprehensive body of Bosnian literacy, mainly associated with the [[Franciscans|Franciscan order]], from the 16th to mid-18th century and early 19th century. This is by far the most abundant corpus of works written in Bosnian Cyrillic, covering various genres, but belonging to the [[liturgy|liturgical]] literature: numerous polemical tractates in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]], popular tales from the [[Bible]], [[catechism]]s, [[breviary|breviaries]], historical [[chronicle]]s, local church histories, religious poetry and didactic works. Among the most important writings of this circle are works of [[Matija Divković]], [[Stjepan Matijević]] and [[Pavao Posilović]].
*After the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|Ottoman conquest]], Bosnian Cyrillic was used, along with [[Arebica]], by the Bosnian Muslim nobility, chiefly in correspondence, mainly from the 15th to 17th centuries (hence, the script has also been called ''begovica'', "[[bey]]'s script"). Isolated families and individuals could write in it even in the 20th century.

In conclusion, main traits of Bosnian Cyrillic include:

*It was a form of Cyrillic script mainly in use in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], central [[Dalmatia]] and [[Dubrovnik]].
*Its earliest monuments are from the 11th century, but the golden epoch covered the period from the 14th to 17th centuries. From the late 18th century it rather speedily fell into disuse to be replaced by the Latin script.
*Its primary characteristics (scriptory, morphological, orthographical) show strong connection with the [[Glagolitic]] script, unlike the standard [[Church Slavonic]] form of [[Cyrillic script]] associated with [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref name="ijors.net"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ILIEV|first1=IVAN G.|title=SHORT HISTORY OF THE CYRILLIC ALPHABET {{!}} IVAN G.

*It had been in use, in ecclesiastical works, mainly in [[Bosnian Church]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] in historical lands of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Dubrovnik]]. Also, it was a widespread script in Bosnian Muslim circles, which, however, preferred modified Arabic ''[[aljamiado]]'' script. [[Serbian Orthodox]] clergy and adherents used mainly the standard [[Serbian Cyrillic]] of the Resava orthography.&lt;ref name="ijors.net"/&gt;
*The form of Bosnian Cyrillic has passed through a few phases, so although culturally it is correct to speak about one script, it is evident that features present in Bosnian Franciscan documents in the 1650s differ from the charters from [[Brač]] island in [[Dalmatia]] in the 1250s.

==Controversies and polemic==

The polemic about "ethnic affiliation" of Bosnian Cyrillic started in the 19th century, then reappeared in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Kamusella2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tomasz Kamusella|title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzEqAQAAIAAJ|date=15 January 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-55070-4|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without going into nuances and details, the polemic about attribution and affiliation of Bosnian Cyrillic texts seems to rest on further arguments:

*Serbian scholars claim that it is just a variant of [[Serbian Cyrillic]]; actually, a "minuscle", or Italic (cursive) script devised at the court of Serbian king [[Stefan Dragutin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ILIEV|first1=IVAN G.|title=SHORT HISTORY OF THE CYRILLIC ALPHABET {{!}} IVAN G. ILIEV {{!}} IJORS International Journal of Russian Studies|url=http://www.ijors.net/issue2_2_2013/articles/iliev.html|website=www.ijors.net|publisher=INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN STUDIES|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Bosnian Cyrillic texts also belong to the Serbian literary corpus. Some consider that a strong argument in favour of the Serbian side is the fact that there are a lot of mentions of Bosnian Cyrillic as "Serbian letters"&lt;ref name = "Franc Mikloshich"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "Serbian characters"&lt;ref&gt;http://novi.ba/clanak/72326/vuk-bacanovic-srpski-bosanski-i-bosnjacki-for-dummies&lt;/ref&gt; among Catholics (in Bosnia and Dubrovnik) and Muslims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The main Serbian authorities in the field are Jorjo Tadić, [[Vladimir Ćorović]], Petar Kolendić, Petar Đorđić, Vera Jerković, Irena Grickat, [[Pavle Ivić]] and Aleksandar Mladenović.
*The Croatian side is split. One school of paleography basically challenges the letters being Serbian. It claims that majority of the most important documents of Bosnian Cyrillic had been written either before any innovations devised at the Serbian royal court happened, or did not have any historical connection with it whatsoever- that the Serbian claims on the origin of Bosnian Cyrillic are unfounded, and the script, since belonging to the Croatian cultural sphere should be called not Bosnian, but Croatian Cyrillic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another school of Croatian philologists acknowledges that "Serbian connection", as exemplified in variants present at the Serbian court of king Dragutin, did influence Bosnian Cyrillic- but, they aver, it was just one strand, since scriptory innovations have been happening both before and after the mentioned one. First school insists that all Bosnian Cyrillic texts belong to the corpus of Croatian literacy, and the second school that all texts from [[Croatia]] and only a part from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are to be placed into Croatian literary canon (they exclude c. half of Bosnian Christian texts, but include all Franciscan and the majority of legal and commercial documents). Also, the second school generally uses the name Western Cyrillic instead of Croatian Cyrillic (or Bosnian Cyrillic, for that matter). Both schools mention that various sources, both Croatian and other European (German, Italian,..) call this script "Croatian letters" or "Croatian script". The main Croatian authorities in the field are [[Vatroslav Jagić]], Mate Tentor, [[Ćiro Truhelka]], Vladimir Vrana, [[Jaroslav Šidak]], [[Herta Kuna]], [[Tomislav Raukar]], [[Eduard Hercigonja]] and [[Benedikta Zelić-Bučan]].
*Bosniak scholars unisonally dismiss any claims of Croat or Serb affiliation, instead maintaining the Bosnian Cyrillic as ethnically Bosnian and, consequently, Bosniak, in legacy of medieval Bosnia and the native [[Bosnian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jahić|first1=Dževad|last2=Halilović|first2=Senahid|last3=Palić|first3=Ismail|title=Gramatika bosanskoga jezika|date=2000|publisher=Dom štampe|location=Zenica|isbn=9789958420467|page=49|url=http://bih.fi/pub/pdf/gramatika-bosanskoga-jezika.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Yugoslav Serbian scholars concluded that ''Bosančica'' was a term introduced through Austro-Hungarian propaganda. They regarded it a type of cursive Cyrillic script,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|volume=22–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USA_AQAAIAAJ|year=1956|publisher=Državna štamparija|location=Belgrade|p=308|quote=&lt;!--...можемо без резерве репи да ]е „босанчица" само термин ко^и ]е у нашу науку успела да убаци аустро-угарска пропаганда.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; without specifics that would warrant an "isolation from Cyrillic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Književnost i jezik|volume=14|issue=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJtiAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|pp=298–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Russian philologist {{ill|A. I. Sobolevsky||Соболевский, Алексей Иванович|ru}} (1856–1929) regarded it Serbian.&lt;ref name="И.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Соболевский А. И.|title=Славяно-русская палеография|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-iWBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Directmedia|isbn=978-5-4460-2375-2|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irony of the contemporary status of Bosnian Cyrillic is as follows: scholars are still trying to prove that Bosnian Cyrillic is ethnically their own, while simultaneously relegating the corpus of Bosnian Cyrillic written texts to the periphery of national culture. This extinct form of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] is peripheral to Croatian paleography which focuses on [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script corpora.

==Legacy==
In 2015, a group of artists started a project called "I write to you in Bosancica" which involved art and graphic design students from [[Banja Luka]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Široki Brijeg]], and [[Trebinje]].  Exhibitions of the submitted artworks will be held in [[Sarajevo]], [[Trebinje]], [[Široki Brijeg]], [[Zagreb]], and [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnian-designers-save-ancient-font-from-oblivion-12-09-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the project was to resurrect the ancient script and show the "common cultural past" of all the groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first phase of the project was to reconstruct all of the ancient characters by using ancient, handwritten documents.

'''Brazilian Sign Language''' (BSL) is the [[sign language]] used by [[Deaf communities]] of urban [[Brazil]].
It is also known as "Libras" ({{IPA-pt|ˈlibɾɐs}}, from "'''Lí'''ngua '''Bra'''sileira de '''S'''inais" {{IPA-pt|ˈlĩɡwɐ bɾaziˈlejɾɐ dʒi siˈnajs|}}) and variously abbreviated as LSB, LGB or LSCB (Brazilian Cities Sign Language).&lt;ref name="Brito Langevin"&gt;Ferreira-Brito, Lucinda and Langevin, Rémi (1994), The Sublexical Structure of a Sign Language, ''Mathématiques, Informatique et Sciences Humaines'' 32:125, 1994, pp. 17–40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and status==
Brazilian Sign Language is well-established; several dictionaries, instructional videos and a number of articles on the linguistic features of the language have been published. It has dialects across Brazil reflecting regional and sociocultural differences.

A strong [[legal recognition of sign languages|sign language law]] was passed by the [[National Congress of Brazil]] on April 24, 2002, and (in 2005) is in the process of being implemented.&lt;ref name="LIBRAS law"&gt;[http://www.libras.org.br/leilibras.htm LIBRAS law (in Portuguese)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426151659/http://www.libras.org.br/leilibras.htm |date=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law mandates the use of Brazilian Sign Language in education and government services.
[[File:Escola Estadual de Educação Especial Dr. Reinaldo Fernando Cóser 02.jpg|thumb|Signwriting used on outside of school for deaf in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul]]

Educational approaches have evolved from [[oralism]] to [[Total Communication]] and [[Bilingual-bicultural education|bilingualism]].

==Alphabet==
BSL [[fingerspelling]] uses a [[one-handed manual alphabet]] similar to that used by the [[French Sign Language]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libras.org.br/Thumbnails/FrameSet.htm LIBRAS manual alphabet]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 44 distinct [[handshape]]s used in the language.&lt;ref name="Brito Langevin" /&gt;

==Writing==
[[Sutton SignWriting]] is the dominant writing system in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=Edivaldo da Silva|date=2018|title=Tendências atuais da pesquisa em escrita de sinais no Brasil|journal=Revista Diálogos (RevDia)|volume=6|issue=1|pages=23-41|issn=2319-0825}}&lt;/ref&gt; A master's in linguistics dissertation titled [https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/177791 "A arte de escrever em Libras"] by Gabriela Otaviani Barbosa found that SignWriting is used in 18 Federal Universities and in 12 public schools in Brazil. The History of SignWriting in Brazil appeared on TV INES in 2017: [http://tvines.ines.gov.br/?p=16704 "A Vida em Libras – SignWriting – Escrita de Sinais"].  

Historical efforts were commonly transcribed using Portuguese words, written in upper case, to stand for each equivalent BSL morpheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paiva|first1=Francisco Aulísio dos Santos|last2=De Martino|first2=José Mario|last3=Barbosa|first3=Plínio Almeida|last4=Benetti|first4=Ângelo|last5=Silva|first5=Ivani Rodrigues|date=2016|title=Um sistema de transcrição para língua de sinais brasileira: o caso de um avatar|journal=Revista do GEL|volume=13|issue=3|pages=13, 21-24|doi=10.21165/gel.v13i3.1440}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Transcription of BSL signs using [[SignWriting]] has been in place since at least 1997 with the SignNet Project in Porto Alegre and Fernando Capovilla's dictionaries in São Paulo. The University of Santa Catarina at Florianopolis (UFSC) has required courses in SignWriting as the preferred form of LIBRAS transcription.

SignWriting is cited as being useful in the pedagogy of young children. http://www.signwriting.org/archive/docs6/sw0580_BR_Aquisicao_Escrita_Sinais_2007.pdf

The Federal University of Santa Catarina has accepted a dissertation written in Brazilian Sign Language using Sutton SignWriting for a master's degree in linguistics.  The dissertation "[https://repositorio.ufsc.br/bitstream/handle/123456789/180688/351070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The Writing of Grammatical Non-Manual Expressions in Sentences in LIBRAS Using the SignWriting System]" by João Paulo Ampessan states that "the data indicate the need for [non-manual expressions] usage in writing sign language".

==Deaf and sign language organizations==

The most important deaf organization is FENEIS, the ''Federação Nacional de Educação e Integração dos Surdos'' (National Federation of Deaf Education and Integration). There are a number of regional organizations in [[Curitiba]], [[Caxias do Sul]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]].

==Classification==
Wittmann (1991)&lt;ref name="nou-la.org"&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Brazilian Sign Language is a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through [[stimulus diffusion]] from an existing sign language, likely [[Portuguese Sign Language]] and/or [[French Sign Language]].

'''Candoshi-Shapra''' (also known as Candoshi, Candoxi, Kandoshi, and Murato) is an indigenous American [[language isolate]], spoken by several thousand people in western South America along the Chapuli, Huitoyacu, Pastaza, and Morona river valleys. There are two dialects, Chapara (also spelled Shapra) and Kandoashi. It is an official language of [[Peru]], like other native languages in the areas in which they are spoken and are the predominant language in use. Around 88.5 percent of the speakers are bilingual with [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The literacy rate in Candoshi-Shapra is 10 to 30 percent and 15 to 25 percent in the second language Spanish. There is a Candoshi-Shapra dictionary, and grammar rules have been codified.

==Classification==
Candoshi is not closely related to any living language. It may be related to the extinct and poorly attested language [[Chirino language|Chirino]]. Four words of Chirino are mentioned in ''Relación de la tierra de Jaén'' (1586), and they resemble words in modern Candoshi. A somewhat longer list of words is given in the same document for [[Rabona language|Rabona]], across the modern border in [[Ecuador]] and include some names of plants that resemble Candoshi, but such words can easily be borrowed.

Among modern languages, Loukotka (1968), followed by Tovar (1984), connected Candoshi with [[Taushiro language|Taushiro]] (Pinche). [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (1994) tentatively proposed a ''Kandoshi–Omurano–Taushiro'' language family, with Candoshi the most distant of the trio. However, Kaufman (2007) placed Omurano and Taushiro but not Candoshi in [[Saparo–Yawan languages|Saparo–Yawan]].

David Payne (1981) proposes that Candoshi is related to [[Jivaroan languages|Jivaroan]], which Payne calls Shuar. Together, Shuar and Candoshi make up a putative Shuar-Candoshi family, for which Payne (1981) provides a tentative reconstruction of Proto-Shuar-Candoshi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">The '''Chinese American Food Society''' (CAFS) is an [[United States|American]]-based [[organization]] founded in 1974 to develop relationships among [[China|Chinese]]-born [[food science|food scientists]] in [[academia]], [[government]], and [[industry]]. Its current president is [[Fur-Chi Chen]], a professor at [[Tennessee State University]].

Founded at the 1974 [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT) annual meeting in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the organization was first called the "IFT-Chinese Association," then changed to "The Association of Chinese Food Scientists in America" before changing to its current name in 1983. The first award was issued in 1983 and it was awarded to [[Stephen S. Chang]] who received the Professional Achievement Award. A Distinguished Service Award was established in 1987, and awards for graduate students and high school students were also created in 1983 and 2002, respectively.

The CAFS is partnered with the IFT and its International division, and also publishes an online newsletter two to four times a year. They are currently headquartered in [[Ashton, Maryland]].

In 2004, CAFS was a main supporter of the Food Summit in China event held jointly with the IFT and the [[Chinese Institute of Food Science and Technology]] (CIFST) that was held in [[Beijing]] on November 7–10 of that year.

At the 2007 IFT Annual Meeting in [[Chicago, Illinois]], they hosted a [[symposium]] on Chinese health food involving food science and technology issues on July 27–28.

==Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia==
{{main|Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia}}
Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia occurs when editors use Wikipedia to advance the interests of their external roles or relationships. The type of COI editing of most concern on Wikipedia is paid editing for [[public relations]] (PR) purposes.&lt;ref name="wmfpressrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url={{fullurl:foundation:Press releases/Sue Gardner statement paid advocacy editing|oldid=94021}} |title=Press releases/Sue Gardner statement paid advocacy editing |last=Gardner |first=Sue |authorlink=Sue Gardner |date=24 October 2013 |website=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] |format=PHP |id=94021 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026082010/https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Sue_Gardner_statement_paid_advocacy_editing |archivedate=26 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[WP:PG|Wikipedia policies and guidelines]] exist to combat [[conflict of interest]] editing, including [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]] and [[Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure]].

Controversies reported by the media include United States [[United States Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia|congressional staff editing articles]] about members of Congress in 2006; Microsoft offering a [[software engineer]] money to edit articles on competing code standards in 2007; the PR firm [[Bell Pottinger]] editing articles about its clients in 2011; and the discovery in 2012 that British MPs or their staff had removed criticism from articles about those MPs. The media has also written about COI editing by [[BP]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Diebold]], [[Portland Communications]], [[Sony]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and several others.

The accession of the '''Serbian monarch''' was legitimized by '''[[coronation]] ceremony'''. The coronation was carried out by church officials.

==Ceremony==
===Middle Ages===
The ritual of crowning a new ruler (royal [[enthronement]]) is attested in the 12th century.{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=17}} The coronation of Serbian monarchs took place in the most prominent of churches in the country.{{sfn|Kalić|1998}} The coronation of the Grand Princes of Serbia was likely held at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, Ras|church in Ras]].{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=17}} The successors of Stefan Nemanja adopted Byzantine ideas on [[Autokrator|self-rule]] and acts on the ruler's [[Anointing|anointment]] and coronation.{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=13}} The church official (archbishop, patriarch) anointed and crowned the ruler in the same ceremony.{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=13}} Through the [[archiereus]], with the act of crowning, God's grace transits to the ruler.{{sfn|Kalić|1998}}

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The ritual of crowning a new ruler is attested in the 12th century.{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=17}} The coronation of Serbian monarchs took place in the most prominent of churches in the country.{{sfn|Kalić|1998}} [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan]] (r. 1196–1228), the son of Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]], was crowned with a crown sent by Pope [[Honorius III]] in 1217.{{sfn|Kalić|1998}}{{sfn|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=336}} According to [[Fine Jr.]], he was crowned by a papal legate.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=107}} It is unknown where the coronation took place.{{sfn|Kalić|1998|p=77}} [[J. Kalić]] believes that it was [[Peter's Church, Ras]].{{sfn|Kalić|1998|p=84}} It has been assumed that Stefan was crowned a second time by Archbishop [[Saint Sava|Sava]], his brother.{{sfn|Marjanović-Dušanić|Ćirković|1994|p=126}} In the second charter to the [[Žiča]] monastery dated to ca. 1224, King Stefan ordered for all future kings to be crowned at that monastery.{{sfn|Kalić|1998|p=77}} His contemporaries and successors called him "the First-Crowned King".{{sfn|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=322}}

===Modern===

[[Serbia]]'s last and only modern coronation was in 1904, when King [[Peter I Karađorđević|Peter I]] was crowned in an [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] ceremony at the Cathedral of the Host of Holy Archangels in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos73.htm |title=The Serbian Revolution of 1903 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tboyle.net/Royalty/Serbia_Coronation.html The Coronation of King Peter I of Serbia]. Retrieved 2009-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia became a part of the state of [[Yugoslavia]] after World War I, but Peter did not hold a second coronation and neither of his two successors, the Yugoslav monarchs [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] and [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], were crowned. This was due to the religious diversity of the new state.

==Regalia==
{{main|Regalia of Serbia}}

===Middle Ages===
Stefan's crown was called "the holy wreath" (''sveti venac'') by Domentijan.{{sfn|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=336}} Later, it was called "the god-gifted wreath of the Serbian kingdom" (''bogodarovani venac kraljevstva srpskog'').{{sfn|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=336}}

===Modern===

Modern Serbian regalia were created in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellers in 1904 for coronation of king Peter I Karađorđević,  and consisted of a [[royal crown]], [[Globus cruciger|orb]], [[sceptre]], [[Mantle (royal garment)|mantle]], and mantle [[buckle]]. The crown, known as the "[[Karađorđević]] Crown", was partially made out of a cannon that [[Karađorđe]] had used during the [[First Serbian Uprising]], and was adorned with details such as the [[Serbian eagle]] and [[Serbian cross]]. The crown, scepter, and orb were decorated with gemstones extracted in Serbia and enameled in the [[Serbian national colours]] (red, blue, and white). The mantle was made out of [[purple]] [[velvet]], embroidered with gold and lined with [[ermine]] fur.

==Symbolism==

The sacredness of the Serbian throne is frequently stressed in medieval sources.{{sfn|Marjanović-Dušanić|Ćirković|1994|p=26}} Apart from the throne, the crown was one of the most important royal insignia in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Veselinović|Ljušić|2008|p=17}}

'''Crime in the United Kingdom''' describes acts of [[violent crime]] and non-violent [[crime]] that take place within the [[United Kingdom]]. Courts and police systems are separated into three sections, based on the different [[judicial system]]s of [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]].

Responsibility for crime in England and Wales is split between the [[Home Office]], the government department responsible for reducing and preventing crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/index.html |title=Crime and Victims |work=homeoffice.gov.uk|publisher=The Home Office |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[law enforcement in the United Kingdom]]; and the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], which runs the Justice system, including its [[court]]s and [[prison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/about.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Ministry for Justice |year=2009 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123140725/http://www.justice.gov.uk/about.htm |archivedate=23 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, this responsibility falls on the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], which acts as the sole public prosecutor in Scotland, and is therefore responsible for the prosecution of crime in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/About|title=Guide to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service |publisher=Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
{{Main|Courts of England and Wales#Criminal cases}}
[[File:CrimeinUK.png|thumb|300px|Crime in England and Wales from the [[Crime Survey for England and Wales|Crime Survey]] (in 000s of crimes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdec2016 |title=Crime in England and Wales: year ending Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Crime Survey for England and Wales]] 2015 figures show that crime in England and Wales is currently at its lowest level since the CSEW began in 1981, having decreased dramatically from its peak in 1995 and by 31% in the past five years alone.&lt;ref name=CSEWstats&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdecember2015 |title=Bulletin Tables - Crime in England and Wales, Year Ending December 2015 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 1.32 million violent crimes were counted in 2014/2015 compared to 4.2 million in 1994/95. By contrast, official police statistics are unreliable, due to widespread and inconsistent practices of "[[no criming]]", with 19% of reported overall crimes not recorded by police, one quarter of sexual crimes and one third of violent crimes.&lt;ref name="hmic-victims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/news/news-feed/victims-let-down-by-poor-crime-recording/|title=Victims let down by poor crime-recording|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/crime-recording-making-the-victim-count/|title=Crime-recording: making the victim count|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejusticegap.com/2014/11/whistleblowers-diary-criming-stats/|title=Whistleblowers' diary: 'no criming' the stats  - The Justice Gap|date=18 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two kinds of criminal trial in England and Wales: 'summary' and 'on indictment'. For an adult, summary trials take place in a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]], while trials on [[indictment]] take place in the [[Crown Court]]. Despite the possibility of two venues for trial, almost all criminal cases, however serious, commence in the magistrates' courts.
Offences may also be deemed 'either way', depending on the seriousness of the individual offence. This means they may be tried in either the Magistrates or Crown Court depending on the circumstances. A person may even be convicted by the Magistrates court and sent to the Crown for sentence (where the magistrates feel they do not have adequate sentencing powers). Further more, even if the Magistrates retain the jurisdiction of an offence, the defendant has the right to elect for a Crown Court trial by jury. The jury is selected independently of the prosecution and the defence.

Rural crime has increased in England and Wales, criminals have become more organized and more sophisticated while budget cuts have reduced the effectiveness of police response.  Expensive agricultural equipment is stolen and taken out of the country or used in ram raids, also livestock is stolen.  It is suspected stolen livestock is slaughtered illegally outside licensed slaughterhouses and then illegally enters the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/06/farmers-using-medieval-methods-to-combat-rural Farmers using medieval methods to combat rural crime] ''[[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime in London]] was the highest in England and Wales in 2009 (111 per 1000 of the population), followed by [[Greater Manchester]] (101 per 1000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/22/uk-crime-rates-police-force | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | title=Crime rates where you live | author=Simon Rogers | date=22 April 2010 | accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crime by women in London is usually caused by poverty, drug or alcohol addiction or psychiatric illness.  Other types of intervention are frequently more effective than prison at preventing women reoffending.  Specialist centres can help women avoid offending or reoffending. Prison has disastrous effects on the women's children and after their release makes it harder for the women to find work and lead honest lives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/24/police-need-to-offer-female-offenders-support-not-prison Police 'need to offer female offenders support not prison'] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
{{Main|Courts of Scotland#Criminal courts}}
The [[Sheriff Court]] is the main criminal court; this sits locally. The procedure followed may either be solemn, where the Sheriff sits with a jury of 15; or summary, where the Sheriff sits alone. From 10 December 2007, the maximum penalty that may be imposed in summary cases is 12 months' imprisonment or a £10,000 fine, in solemn cases 5 years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine.&lt;ref&gt;Part III of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The highest criminal court in Scotland is the [[High Court of Justiciary]].

==Northern Ireland==
{{Main|Courts of Northern Ireland#Subordinate courts}}
In Northern Ireland, [[Courts of Northern Ireland#Subordinate courts|magistrates' courts]] hear less-serious criminal cases and conduct preliminary hearings in more serious criminal cases. The Crown Court in Northern Ireland hears more serious criminal cases. These are indictable offences and "either way" offences which are committed for trial in the Crown Court rather than the magistrates' courts.

==Extent of crime==
{{main|Crime statistics in the United Kingdom}}
{{main|Crime in Northern Ireland}}

In England and Wales, there were 618,000 recorded "violence against the person" crimes which caused an injury in 2015. Other areas of crime included [[robbery]] (124,000), burglary (713,000) and vehicle theft (874,000).&lt;ref name=CSEWstats/&gt; England and Wales has a prison population of over 80,000 (2007 estimate), equivalent to 149 people per 100,000. This is considerably less than the USA (762) but more than the Republic of Ireland (76). and a little more than the EU average (123).&lt;ref name="abstract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=94 |title=Annual Abstract of Statistics |publisher=National Office of Statistics |year=2009 |accessdate= 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007&amp;ndash;8, there were 114 homicide victims in Scotland,&lt;ref name="scotland"&gt;{{cite web|title=High Level Summary of Statistics data for Crime and Justice trends |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice/TrendData |author=The Scottish Government |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate= 23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a slight decrease on the previous year. In the third quarter of 2009, there were a little over 17,000 [[full time equivalent]] serving police officers. There were around 375,000 crimes in 2008&amp;ndash;9, a fall of 2% on the previous year. These included around 12,500 non-sexual violent acts, 168,000 crimes of dishonesty (housebreaking, theft and shoplifting are included in this category) and 110,000 acts of [[Wilful fire raising|fire-raising]] and [[vandalism]]. In the 2008&amp;ndash;9 period, there was a [[United Kingdom prison population|prison population]] in Scotland of about 7,300,&lt;ref name="scotland"/&gt; equating to 142 people per 100,000 population, very similar to England and Wales.&lt;ref name="abstract"/&gt;

Between April 2008 and 2009, there were just over 110,000 crimes recorded by the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], an increase of 1.5% on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psni.police.uk/psni_08_09_stats_press_release.pdf |title=The PSNI’s Statistical Report |year=2009 |publisher= Police Service of Northern Ireland |accessdate=25 January 2010 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Ireland has around 7,500 serving full-time equivalent police positions, and a prison population of 1,500, 83 per 100,000 of the population, lower than the rest of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="abstract"/&gt;

Recorded crime rose 11% in the year to March 2018 while sexual offenses rose 24%, 5% of sex offenses and 3% of rape cases lead to a charge or summons.  Crime detection rates are falling from 15% in 2015 to 9% recently.  75% of theft cases and 57% of robberies including muggings were closed without a suspect identified.  Homicides rose 12% during the year to March 2018.  Reduction in the numbers of police officers could be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44884113 No-one charged in 9 out of 10 crimes - Home Office] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Police officer numbers fell to 122,404 in England and Wales, the lowest since comparable records began in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-crime-rise-robbery-murder-knife-statistics-ons-police-england-wales-a8454081.html Long-term fall in crime is over as statistics show spike in robbery and murder] ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real crime stories==
In [[Early Modern Britain]], real crime stories were a popular form of entertainment. These stories were written about in [[pamphlets]], [[broadside (printing)|broadside]]s, and [[chapbooks]], such as ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]''.  These real crime stories were the subject of popular gossip and discussion of the day.  While only a few people may have been able to attend a trial or an execution, these stories allowed for the entertainment of such events to be extended to a much greater population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/107/1/144.pdf|title=“LAST DYING SPEECHES”: RELIGION, IDEOLOGY AND PUBLIC EXECUTION IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND"*|first=J. A.|last=Sharpe|date=1 May 1985|publisher=|journal=Past and Present|volume=107|issue=1|pages=144–167|doi=10.1093/past/107.1.144}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crime stories depicted the gruesome details of criminal acts, trials and executions with the intent to  "articulate a particular set of values, inculcate a certain behavioral model and bolster a social order perceived as threatened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/107/1/144.pdf|title=“LAST DYING SPEECHES”: RELIGION, IDEOLOGY AND PUBLIC EXECUTION IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND"*|first=J.

The publication of these stories was done in order for the larger population to learn from the mistakes of their fellow Englishmen. They stressed the idea of learning from others wrongdoings to the extent that they would place warnings within the [[epitaphs]] of executed criminals.  For example, in the epitaph of John Smith, a highway thief and murderer, said, "thereto remain, a Terrour to affright All wicked Men that do in Sins delight...this is the Reason, and the Cause that they May Warning take."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/fulltext?SOURCE=var_spell.cfg&amp;ACTION=ByID&amp;ID=D00000130002240000&amp;WARN=N&amp;SIZE=3&amp;FILE=../session/1268715656_9237&amp;SEARCHSCREEN=CITATIONS&amp;DISPLAY=AUTHOR&amp;ECCO=N |title=An epitaph on Mr. John Smith, alias Ashburnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph ends with the Latin phrase "Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum” which means “fortunate the man who learns caution from the perils of others."

The '''Cuebo language''' (also spelled '''Cuevo''') is the language spoken by the [[Cubeo people]] in the [[Vaupés Department]], the Cuduyari and Querarí Rivers and their tributaries in [[Colombia]], and in [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; It is a member of the central branch of the [[Tucanoan languages]]. Cubeo has borrowed a number of words from the [[Nadahup languages]], and its grammar has apparently been influenced by [[Arawak languages]]. The language has been variously described as having a [[subject–object–verb]]&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; or an [[object–verb–subject]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_cub WALS summary]&lt;/ref&gt; word order, the latter quite rare. It is sometimes called ''Pamiwa'', the ethnic group's autonym, but it is not to be confused with the [[Pamigua language]], sometimes called Pamiwa.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are six oral vowels and six [[nasal vowels]]. {{IPAslink|ɨ}} is pronounced as in ''ros'''e'''s.

|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|o}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|õ}}
|}

===Consonants===

!colspan=2|
![[Labial consonant|Labial]]
![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
![[Velar consonant|Velar]]

|}

Unusually, Cubeo has a velar fricative /x/ but no strident fricative /s/. When older Cubeos use Spanish loans with /s/, they pronounce it as {{IPA|/tʃ/}} before vowels. The /s/ deletes in word-final position in loans as in {{IPA|[xeˈtʃu]}} &lt; Sp. Jesús {{IPA|[xeˈsus]}} 'Jesus' (c.f. [[Colombian Spanish]] {{IPA|[heˈsu]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Morse &amp; Maxwell 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress ===
The stressed [[syllable]] is the first syllable with high tone in the phonological word (usually the second syllable of the word). Stress (and by extension, the position of the first high-tone syllable) is contrastive.&lt;ref&gt;Morse &amp; Maxwell 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nasality ===
Most morphemes belong to one of three categories:
# Nasal (many roots, as well as suffixes like ''-xã'' 'associative')
# Oral (many roots, as well as suffixes like ''-pe'' 'similarity', ''-du'' 'frustrative')
# Unmarked (only suffixes, e.g. -''RE'' 'in/direct object')

No root is unmarked with respect to this nasal/oral division, but some roots are partially oral and nasal, {{IPA|/bãˈkaxa-/}} {{IPA|[mãˈkaxa-]}} 'to defecate'.&lt;ref&gt;Morse &amp; Maxwell 1999, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffixes that begin with consonants without nasal allophones may be only nasal or oral, not unmarked, but suffixes that begin with consonants that have nasal allophones ({{IPA|/b, d, j, w, x, r/}}) may belong to any of the three classes above. It is impossible to predict the class to which a nasalizable consonant-initial suffix may belong.

There are some suffixes that are partially oral and partially nasal, like -kebã 'suppose'.&lt;ref&gt;Morse &amp; Maxwell 1999, pp. 7, 43&lt;/ref&gt; There is no case in modern Cubeo in which -kebã is divided into separate oral and nasal suffixes.

==== Nasal assimilation ====
Nasality spreads rightward from the nasal vowel, nasalizing all oral vowels within a word if they are not nasal and all intervening consonants can be nasalized ({{IPA|/b, d, j, w, x, r/}})

: bu-bI-ko
: {{IPA|/buˈe-bi-ko/}}
: {{IPA|[buˈebiko]}}
: 'She recently studied.'

Unlike the previous example, in the next one, nasality spreads from the initial vowel to the following one, but it is blocked from the third syllable by a non-nasalizable {{IPA|/k/}}:

: dĩ-bI-ko
: {{IPA|/dĩ-bĩ-ko/}}
: {{IPA|[nĩmĩko]}}
: 'She recently went.'

Nasal spreading is blocked by underlyingly oral suffixes or vowels that are underlyingly oral in a nasal/oral morpheme.

'''Cyber flashing''' is a crime which involves sending obscene pictures to strangers through [[AirDrop]].&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gallagher |first1=Sophie |date=15 August 2017 |title=New ‘Cyber-Flashing’ Trend Going Unreported Because Victims Aren’t Coming Forward |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/cyber-flashing-uk-reports-hidden-problem_uk_5992d291e4b08a24727728fe |accessdate=4 July 2018 |publisher=[[HuffPo]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704212908/https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/cyber-flashing-uk-reports-hidden-problem_uk_5992d291e4b08a24727728fe |archive-date=2018-07-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1st Case"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bell |first1=Sarah |date=13 August 2015 |title=Police investigate 'first cyber-flashing' case |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33889225 |accessdate=4 July 2018 |publisher=[[BBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717133234/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33889225 |archive-date=2018-07-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also apply to the same action carried out entirely through [[Bluetooth]].

==Initial usage==

The mainstream initial usage of the term occurred around the 13th August 2015, after a female commuter was AirDropped two pictures of a penis. The case was reported to the [[British Transport Police]] who indicated that as the pictures were declined insufficient data was recorded by the receiving phone to provide suitable evidence.&lt;ref name="1st Case"/&gt; 

==Methodology and prevention==

AirDrop is a hybrid communication method of Bluetooth and [[Wifi]]. Bluetooth passes communication via use of [[UHF|UHF radio waves]]. AirDrop seeks out potential communication partners by use of Bluetooth and then uses it to establish a secure peer-to-peer "Wifi channel" over which the actual information is passed - usually photographs, documents and videos.&lt;ref name="WhatIsIt?"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512|title=What is AirDrop?|last=Nations|first=Daniel|date=23 June 2018|publisher=[[Lifewire]]|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704213351/https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512|archive-date=2018-07-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appropriately equipped device can seek out any active peers within about 10 metres.&lt;ref name="WhatIsIt?"/&gt; The harassing individual can make an initial connection with any device that is open to all users. A photo can then be sent with a preview of the photo being shown to the device's owner at the same time as a request to allow connection. Therefore the harassment (The "flashing") can occur before a specific connection is authorised.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iphone-cyber-flashing-what-it-how-stop-it-happening-you-1515440|title=iPhone cyber-flashing: What is it and how to stop it happening to you|last=Charlton|first=Alistair|date=14 August 2015|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705004107/https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iphone-cyber-flashing-what-it-how-stop-it-happening-you-1515440|archive-date=2018-07-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention requires reverting to the iPhone's default conditions - either turn AirDrop off or set it only to allow connections with contacts. Police forces have suggested pushing AirDrop to program an automatic reversion to this condition after a set time of configured open access.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; 

If harassing photographs are received then keeping them allows the victim to provide a much greater set of information to cyber crime units with the police. This does cause the issue that the most effective methods of catching the cyber-flashers risks causing additional harassment and pain to the victims. 

==Additional incidents==

Frequency of the crime has been difficult to assess with significantly stronger anecdotal evidence than indicated by crime figures. 

On August 13, 2017, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that at least two women were sent nude pictures while commuting.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/12/airdropping-dick-pics-is-the-latest-horrifying-subway-trend/|title=AirDropping penis pics is the latest horrifying subway trend|last=Licea|first=Melkorka|date=12 August 2017|publisher=[[New York Post]]|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704182808/https://nypost.com/2017/08/12/airdropping-dick-pics-is-the-latest-horrifying-subway-trend/|archive-date=2018-07-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Huffington Post reporter in the UK was also sent more than a 100 sexual pictures while commuting. This case was reported to the British Transport Police and when these news stories were published a number of women indicated to the publications that they had suffered similar harassment.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt; However UK police forces indicates very few complaints for these actions despite "a growing awareness" of it occurring. This indicates a wide-level of under-reporting and thus few arrests and prosecutions.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt;

In Australia, May 2018, it was reporting that cyber-flashing was increasingly common as a prank used by children, popular due to its ease to target multiple individuals very rapidly in a fairly unidentifiable fashion.&lt;ref name="News.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/school-kids-putting-themselves-at-risk-pranking-strangers-with-airdrop-porn/news-story/8f65a97dbb9bc70709a18a6b64ee5320|title=School kids putting themselves at risk ‘pranking’ strangers with AirDrop porn|last=Livingstone|first=Tom|date=14 May 2018|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705010725/https://www.news.com.au/technology/school-kids-putting-themselves-at-risk-pranking-strangers-with-airdrop-porn/news-story/8f65a97dbb9bc70709a18a6b64ee5320|archive-date=2018-07-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

As with other technological-based abuses, such as [[deepfake|Deepfake pornography]], [[revenge porn]] and [[upskirting]] there was no specific pre-existing law designed to criminalise and prevent cyber-flashing. This means that many police forces were and are required to fallback on more generalised crimes such as harassment and [[outraging public decency]].&lt;ref name="HuffPo2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Sara |date=14 June 2018 |title='Deepfake Porn' And 'Cyber-Flashing': The Other Abuses Not Included In New Upskirting Laws |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/upskirting-bill-should-cover-deepfake-porn-and-cyber-flashing-too_uk_5b2b9e70e4b0321a01ce6ed8 |accessdate=4 July 2018 |publisher=[[HuffPo]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003638/https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/upskirting-bill-should-cover-deepfake-porn-and-cyber-flashing-too_uk_5b2b9e70e4b0321a01ce6ed8 |archive-date=2018-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[New South Wales]], Australia, [[The Crimes Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2017]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crimes Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2017 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/Pages/bill-details.aspx?pk=3396 |website=www.parliament.nsw.gov.au |publisher=Legislative Assembly |accessdate=4 July 2018 |language=en-AU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612021438/https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/Pages/bill-details.aspx?pk=3396 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was implemented to make it an offence to "intentionally record or distribute, or threaten to record or distribute, an intimate image of a person without their consent".&lt;ref name="CWD"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Michael |date=29 August 2017 |title=THAT’S THE LAW: Criminalising revenge porn unlikely to act as true deterrent |url=https://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/4880799/thats-the-law-criminalising-revenge-porn-unlikely-to-act-as-true-deterrent/ |accessdate=4 July 2018 |publisher=[[Central Western Daily]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003647/https://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/4880799/thats-the-law-criminalising-revenge-porn-unlikely-to-act-as-true-deterrent/ |archive-date=2018-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation would cover cyber-flashing by its prohibition on distributing intimate images without consent.

In the UK there has been criticism that "upskirting laws" under consideration would not cover cyber-flashing, as well as other forms of image-based abuse, such as revenge porn. The proposed laws also have a stronger intent prohibition, and it is unclear whether it would cover non-harassment circumstances as well as issues where the receiver of the images has not consented but the "image subject" has.&lt;ref name="HuffPo2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6198">{{about|a subgroup of the Yoruba people in western Nigeria|European Gaming and Betting Association|EGBA}}
{{confuse|Igbo people}}The '''Egba people''' are a subgroup of the [[Yoruba people]], an ethnic group of western [[Nigeria]], majorly from the central part of [[Ogun State]] that is Ogun central senatorial district.

Ogun Central Senitorial district comprises six local government in Ogun state which includes [[Abeokuta North]], [[Abeokuta South]], [[Ewekoro]], [[Ifo]], [[Obafemi Owode]] and [[Odeda]] Local governments.

== History ==
The Egba group originally under the [[Oyo Empire]] became independent following the spectacular collapse of Oyo in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://litcaf.com/egba-people/|title=Egba People|last=|first=|date=|website=LitCaf Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wars with the Dahomey, in which the Egbas were successful partly due to the protection afforded by the Olumo Rock, led to the founding of the city of Abeokuta, which literally means "under the rock".

The Egba nation is made up of the following sub-divisions - the [[Egba Alake|Ake]], [[Owu kingdom|Owu]], Oke Ona and Gbagura each with its own king (historically, the Egba nation is made up of four divisions; Ibara, though geographically located in Abeokuta, is part of Yewaland). During colonial rule the British recognised the Alake (or King of Ake) as the paramount ruler of the whole clan and their territory, and so, his successor is referred to as the Alake of Egbaland now. The titles of the kings of the aforementioned sub-divisions are therefore ''Alake of Egbaland'', ''Oshile of Oke Ona'',''Agura of Gbagura", and "Olowu of Owu'' in order of settlement and seniority in Egba nation (the Olubara is not an Egba king; he is a Yewa king although his domain is located geographically within the present day Abeokuta). It is worthy of note that the original town and settlement of the Egba nation was under and around Olumo rock, which is in Ikija/Ikereku area of the Egba Oke Ona.  The Jagunna of Itoko, is the Chief Priest of Olumo.  The area in Ikija, which is Oke Ona, is only an amusement park created as an entrance to the park.  The entire Olumo Rock is in the territory of, and under the control of the Itokos.  Another reference name for Abeokuta by the founding fathers is Oko Adagba (Adagba's Farm or Bush) in reference to the hunter that founded / discovered Olumo rock.  Adagba went hunting in search of game animal / food from the Obantoko township where his fellow Itoko citizens were stationed while wandering for a settlement.  
Egbaland was not only where [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Henry Townsend]] lived but also boasted of being the home of the first newspaper in Nigeria ("Iwe Irohin"). Its people serve as the first of the many Nigerian nations (until recently, the only of them) to have had an anthem.

== Egba Anthem ==
Lori oke o'un petele
Ibe l'agbe bi mi o
Ibe l'agbe to mi d'agba oo

'''Chorus''': Maa yo, maa yo, maa yo o; l'Ori Olumo; Maa yo, maa yo, maa yo o; l'Ori Olumo

'''Chorus''': Maa yo, maa yo, maa yo o; l'Ori Olumo; Maa yo, maa yo, maa yo o; l'Ori Olumo

There are some other songs that the egba people sing, here is one of them:

Egba ile ibe nigbagbo ti se wa, Egba ile ibe nigbagbo ti se wa

Awa Egba lo ni jesu o

Here goes another short one

Awa lo mo abeokuta, ilu rere ilu olola

{{Euthanasia}}
{{Life in the Netherlands}}

'''Euthanasia in the Netherlands''' is regulated by the "Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act" which was passed in 2001&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; and took effect in 2002. It states that [[euthanasia]] and [[physician-assisted suicide]] are not punishable if the [[attending physician]] acts in accordance with criteria of [[standard of care|due care]].&lt;ref name="Buiting-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buiting H, van Delden J, Onwuteaka-Philpsen B |title=Reporting of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands: descriptive study |journal=BMC Med Ethics |volume=10 |issue= |pages=18 |year=2009 |pmid=19860873 |pmc=2781018 |doi=10.1186/1472-6939-10-18|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's [[suffering]] (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.&lt;ref name="Buiting-2009"/&gt; To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee.&lt;ref name="Buiting-2009"/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The legal debate concerning euthanasia in the Netherlands took off with the "Postma case" in 1973, concerning a physician who had facilitated the death of her mother following repeated explicit requests for euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rietjens JA, van der Maas PJ, Onwuteaka-Philipsen BD, van Delden JJ, van der Heide A |title=Two Decades of Research on Euthanasia from the Netherlands. What Have We Learnt and What Questions Remain? |journal=J Bioeth Inq |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=271–283 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19718271 |pmc=2733179 |doi=10.1007/s11673-009-9172-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the physician was convicted, the court's judgment set out criteria when a doctor would not be required to keep a patient alive contrary to their will. This set of criteria was formalised in the course of a number of court cases during the 1980s.

''Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act'' was passed in April 2001&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dutch 'mercy killing law' passed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1269682.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took effect on 1 April 2002. It legalises euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The New Regulation of Voluntary Euthanasia and Medically Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands |first=André |last=Janssen |journal=Int J Law Policy Family |year=2002 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=260–269 |doi=10.1093/lawfam/16.2.260 |pmid=16848072}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was proposed by [[Els Borst]], the [[D'66|D66]] [[Ministry of Public Health (Netherlands)|minister of Health]]. The procedures codified in the law had been a convention of the Dutch medical community for over twenty years.

The law allows medical review board to suspend prosecution of doctors who performed euthanasia when each of the following conditions are fulfilled:
* the patient's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement
* the patient's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time (the request cannot be granted when under the influence of others, psychological illness or drugs)
* the patient must be fully aware of his/her condition, prospects, and options
* there must be consultation with at least one other independent doctor who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above
* the death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient, and the doctor must be present
* the patient is at least 12 years old (patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents)

The doctor must also report the cause of death to the municipal [[coroner]] in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Burial and Cremation Act. A regional review committee assesses whether a case of termination of life on request or assisted suicide complies with the due care criteria. Depending on its findings, the case will either be closed or, if the conditions are not met, brought to the attention of the Public Prosecutor. Finally, the legislation offers an explicit recognition of the validity of [[living will|a written declaration of will]] of the patient regarding euthanasia (a "euthanasia directive"). Such declarations can be used when a patient is in a [[coma]] or otherwise unable to state if they wish to be euthanised.

Euthanasia remains a criminal offense in cases not meeting the law's specific conditions, with the exception of several situations that are not subject to the restrictions of the law at all, because they are not considered euthanasia but normal medical practice:
* stopping or not starting a medically useless (futile) treatment
* stopping or not starting a treatment at the patient's request
* speeding up death as a [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]] of treatment necessary for alleviating serious suffering

[[Child euthanasia|Euthanasia of children]] under the age of 12 remains technically illegal; however, Dr. [[Eduard Verhagen]] has documented several cases and, together with colleagues and prosecutors, has developed a protocol to be followed in those cases. Prosecutors will refrain from pressing charges if this [[Groningen Protocol]] is followed.

==Practice==
In 2016 the number of official cases of euthanasia in the Netherlands was 6,091 which was 4% of total deaths in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Number of official cases of euthanasia rise 10% in the Netherlands|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/04/number-of-official-cases-of-euthanasia-rise-10-in-the-netherlands/|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the number had been 4,050, and according to research done by the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University Medical Center Utrecht]] and [[Statistics Netherlands]], and published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', that was not more than before the "Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act" took effect in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Onwuteaka-Philipsen|first=Bregje D.|last2=Brinkman-Stoppelenburg|first2=Arianne|last3=Penning|first3=Corine|last4=de Jong-Krul|first4=Gwen J. F.|last5=van Delden|first5=Johannes J. M.|last6=van der Heide|first6=Agnes|date=2012-09-08|title=Trends in end-of-life practices before and after the enactment of the euthanasia law in the Netherlands from 1990 to 2010: a repeated cross-sectional survey|journal=Lancet|volume=380|issue=9845|pages=908–915|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61034-4|issn=1474-547X|pmid=22789501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the study concluded that In effect, the legislation did not lead to more cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Euthanasiewet leidde niet tot meer euthanasie|language=Dutch|url= http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2856077/euthanasiewet-leidde-niet-meer-euthanasie.html|trans-title=Euthanasia Law did not lead to more euthanasia|newspaper= nl.nl|date= 10 July 2012|accessdate= 11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in the Netherlands, 1,626 cases were officially reported of euthanasia in the sense of a physician assisting the death (1.2% of all deaths). Usually the [[sedative]] [[sodium thiopental]] is [[intravenous]]ly administered to induce a [[coma]]. Once it is certain that the patient is in a deep coma, typically after less than a minute, [[pancuronium]] is administered to stop [[breath]]ing and cause death.

Officially reported were also 148 cases of physician-assisted dying (0.14% of all deaths), usually by drinking a strong (10g) [[barbiturate]] [[potion]]. The doctor is required to be present for two reasons:
* to make sure the potion is not taken by a different person, by accident (or, theoretically, for "unauthorised" suicide or perhaps even murder)

In two cases the doctor was reprimanded for not being present while the patient drank the potion. They said they had not realised that this was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{URL|1=http://www.recht.nl/exit.html?id=31233&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minvws.nl%2Fimages%2FIBE-2486121B2_tcm10-50636.pdf|2=Regionale toetsingscommissies euthanasie Jaarverslag 2003 (PDF)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-one cases were reported to combine the two procedures: usually in these cases the patient drinks the potion, but this does not cause death. After a few hours, or earlier in the case of [[vomiting]], the muscle relaxant is administered to cause death.

By far, most reported cases concerned [[cancer]] patients. Also, in most cases the procedure was applied at home.

A study in 2000 found that Dutch physicians who intend to provide assistance with suicide sometimes end up administering a lethal medication themselves because of the patient's inability to take the medication or because of problems with the completion of physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="Groenewoud-2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Groenewoud | first1 = JH. | last2 = van der Heide | first2 = A. | last3 = Onwuteaka-Philipsen | first3 = BD. | last4 = Willems | first4 = DL. | last5 = van der Maas | first5 = PJ. | last6 = van der Wal | first6 = G. | title = Clinical problems with the performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in The Netherlands. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 342 | issue = 8 | pages = 551–6 |date=Feb 2000 | doi =  10.1056/NEJM200002243420805| pmid = 10684914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 there were 3,136 cases reported of a physician assisting the death of a patient. When categorised there were, 2,910 cases of "end of life on request", 182 cases of assisted suicide, and in 44 cases it was a combination. The evaluation commissions decided that in 9 cases the procedures were not according to protocol and referred the cases to the [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]] and the [[Health Care Inspectorate]].&lt;ref name="nu.nl"&gt;{{cite news |title= Aantal euthanasiegevallen weer gestegen|language=Dutch|url= http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2605623/aantal-euthanasiegevallen-weer-gestegen.html|trans-title=Number of Euthanasia cases risen again|newspaper= nu.nl|date= 2 September 2011|accessdate= 11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reported cases was rising by 8% each year. In 2017, the number of reported euthanasias had increased to 6,585; 99.8% of them being performed carefully.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nos.nl/artikel/2221012-opnieuw-meer-meldingen-van-euthanasie.html NOS: Opnieuw meer meldingen van euthanasie &amp;#91;again more reported euthanasia cases&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this rise is not clear.&lt;ref name="nu.nl"/&gt;

==Further developments==
Under current Dutch law, euthanasia by doctors is only legal in cases of ''"hopeless and unbearable"'' suffering. In practice this means that it is limited to those suffering from serious medical conditions like severe pain, exhaustion or [[asphyxia]]. Sometimes, psychiatric patients that have proven to be untreatable, can get euthanasia. There is much discussion about people with early dementia who have previously stated in a written will that if they ever got dementia, they would want to get euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medischcontact.nl/nieuws/laatste-nieuws/artikel/artsen-steunen-euthanasie-bij-dementie.htm Medisch Contact june, 30, 2011: Artsen steunen euthanasie bij dementie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 a citizens' initiative called ''Out of Free Will'' further demanded that all Dutch people over 70 who feel tired of life should have the right to professional help in ending it. The organisation started collecting signatures in support of this proposed change in Dutch legislation. A number of prominent Dutch citizens supported the initiative, including former ministers and artists, legal scholars and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/right-die-elderly-back-centre-dutch-debate "'Right to die' for elderly back at centre of Dutch debate"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2478619.ece/Citizens_group_argues_right_to_die " Citizens group argues 'right to die' - A citizens action group wants to legalise assisted suicide for all people over 70"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this initiative has never been legalised.

In 2016, the Dutch Health Minister of the [[Second Rutte cabinet]] announced plans to draft a law that would allow assisted suicide in cases without a terminal illness, if the person feels they have completed life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/europe/dutch-law-would-allow-euthanasia-for-healthy-elderly-people.html|title=Dutch Law Would Allow Assisted Suicide for Healthy Older People|last=|first=|date=2016-10-13|work=The New York Times|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign views==

In 2012, United States Republican presidential candidate [[Rick Santorum]] falsely claimed that forced euthanasia accounted for 5% of all deaths in the Netherlands and that elderly Dutch people wear a bracelet reading “Do not euthanize me.” This claim was mocked by various Dutch sources and prompted the Dutch embassy to respond with relevant statistics disproving Santorum's claim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dutch-puzzled-by-santorums-false-claim-they-practise-forced-euthanasia/?_r=0|title=Dutch Puzzled by Santorum’s False Claim of Forced Euthanasia|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|first=Robert|last=Mackey|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/02/18/rick-santorum-gedwongen-euthanasie-in-nederland/|title=Rick Santorum denkt Nederland te kennen: grootschalige bejaardenmoord|publisher=''NRC Handelsblad''|last=Posthumus|first=Niels|date=2012-02-18|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the lack of a formal statement by Dutch officials angered Dutch politician [[Frans Timmermans]], who demanded minister of foreign affairs [[Uri Rosenthal]] to take a public stance against such assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/dutch-official-is-pressed-to-respond-to-santorums-scandalous-accusations/|title=Dutch Official Is Pressed to Respond to Santorum’s ‘Scandalous Accusations’|publisher=''The New York Times''|last=Mackey|first=Robert|date=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-verkiezingen-in-de-verenigde-staten/timmermans-wil-actie-rosenthal-om-schandalige-euthanasie-beschuldigingen-santorum~a3198000/|title=Timmermans wil actie Rosenthal om 'schandalige euthanasie-beschuldigingen' Santorum|publisher=''de Volkskrant''|date=2012-02-23|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Police Investigative Directorate''' ('''IPID'''), formerly the '''Independent Complaints Directorate''' ('''ICD'''), is an agency of the [[South Africa]]n [[Government of South Africa|government]] responsible for investigating complaints against the [[South African Police Service]] and [[municipal police]] services.

The IPID was created in April 1997 as part of the post-[[apartheid]] reform of the [[South African Police]]. It investigates [[deaths in custody]], crimes allegedly committed by police officers, violations of SAPS policy, and dissatisfaction with the service provided by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icd.gov.za/about/index.html |title=About the ICD |accessdate=2009-03-30 |publisher=ICD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208174049/http://www.icd.gov.za/about/index.html |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''internal conflict''' is the occurring within a character's mind. Things such as the character views for, but can't quite reach. As opposed to external conflict, in which a character is grappling some force outside of him or herself, such as wars or a chain breaking off a bike, or not being able to get past a road block. The dilemma posed by an internal conflict is usually some [[ethics|ethical]] or emotional question. Indicators of internal conflict would be a character's hesitation or self-posing questions like "what was it I did wrong?".&lt;s/Weitman/Conflict.ppt |archivedate=2008-12-02 |accessdate=16 September 2013}} {{unreliable source?|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal conflict can also be a decision-making issue.

The term "internal conflict" is also widely used to describe a military conflict within a nation, such as a [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1375&amp;context=djcil THE &amp;#91;United Nations&amp;#93; SECURITY COUNCIL, PEACEKEEPING AND INTERNAL CONFLICT AFTER THE COLD WAR, MATS R. BERDAL]. Example of "internal conflict" for a civil war.&lt;/ref&gt; An internal conflict is a non-international conflict. It can be because of political, economic or religious causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18902">'''International Archives for the Women's Movement''' ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded in Amsterdam in 1935, as a repository to collect and preserve the cultural heritage of women and make the documents of the movement available for study. The entire [[archive|collection]] was stolen by the Nazis in 1940 and only small portions were recovered after the war. In 1988, the part of the archival collection which had not been [[Nazi plunder|looted by the Nazis]] became the foundational collection of the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement. A substantial portion of the archive was discovered in Moscow in 1992 and returned to Amsterdam in 2003. In 2013, the institution which houses the collection was renamed as the [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history|Atria Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History]]

==History==
[[File:RosaManus.jpg|thumb|Rosa Manus]]
The International Archives for the Women's Movement was founded in 1935 by three Dutch feminists, [[Rosa Manus]], [[Johanna Naber]] and [[Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]].{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Manus was a conference organizer for the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), a secretary of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) and was involved with many of the leading feminists of her day, including [[Aletta Jacobs]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. When Jacobs died in 1929, her books and papers were bequeathed to Manus.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=150-151}} Naber was one of the founders of the IWSA and a historian dedicated to writing about the history of the women's movement, including writing biographies of prominent women. As a member of the [[Dutch Women's Council|National Dutch Women's Council]] {{lang-nl|Nationale Vrouwenraad van Nederland (NVN)}}, Naber had begun to collect publications on feminism and create an archive for the NVN and by 1921, had urged creation of a resource for other women to study.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=149}} Posthumus-van der Goot was an economist and after she attended a 1934 conference arranged by the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship (DAWIEC) to study government policies on paid employment for women, she realized that there was inadequate information on the history of women working.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=151}}

The three women's different skill-sets and ages, which constituted three-generations of the Dutch women's movement, combined to persuade the founders of the newly established [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISH) (which included Posthumus-van der Goot's husband) to give them two rooms in their building at [[Keizersgracht]] 264 for their project. On 3 December 1935, the International Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IAV)}}) was founded with Manus as president and Posthumus-van der Goot as the secretary.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=152}} Within a year, the official opening of the IAV was held and by 1937 they had established a multi-lingual Yearbook to confirm the international nature of collecting and studying documents about women. The international advisory board, included such members as [[Margery Corbett Ashby]], British feminist and IWSA president from 1926-1946; [[Cécile Brunschvicg]], French feminist, [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) member and IWSA delegate; [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], American founder of the IWSA; [[Dorothy Heneker]], Canadian feminist, lawyer and Secretary of the Women's International Organizations' Peace and Disarmament Committee; [[Bertha Lutz]], Brazilian feminist and IWSA board member; [[Marthe de Kerchove de Denterghem|Baroness Marthe Boël]], Belgian feminist and president of ICW between 1936 and 1947; and [[Elsie Zimmern]], British feminist and ICW general secretary from 1925.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=153}}[[File:Johanna Naber omstreeks 1898 8105.tif|thumb|Johanna Naber]]

The women corresponded with women's groups in English, French and German, encouraging them to forward articles, books, brochures, periodicals and the like for inclusion in the archive. They also had reciprocity agreements with other women's facilities, like the [[Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand]] in [[Paris]] and [[Fawcett library|The Fawcett Library]] of [[London]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=154-155}} By the end of the 1930s, the archive contained approximately 4500 books and brochures, as well as a collection of around 150 periodicals from twenty countries. Most of these journals were contemporary publications, though there was a complete collection of the ''Tribunes des femmes'' from 1833. Several [[first edition]] books were part of the archive, including ''A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest'' (1694) by [[Mary Astell]] and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. There were original documents by [[Jane Austen]] and a manuscript copy of {{ill|Cécile de Jong van Beek en Donk|nl}}'s novel, ''Hilda van Suylenburg'' (1897).{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}}

==Nazi intervention==
[[File:WillemijnPosthumusvanderGoot.jpg|thumb|Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This proved to be a costly miscalculation, as when the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazis invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]] confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=156}} The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], head of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} [[Francisca de Haan]] a professor of [[gender studies]] at [[Budapest]]'s [[Central European University]],{{sfn|Polak|2010}} believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to do with the facts that Manus, the president was [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish]], both an international feminist and [[pacifist]], and suspected of [[Communist]] leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities;{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=157-158}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Manus would later be executed at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] in 1943.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}}

The confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin,{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=31}} and then later were moved to [[Sudetenland]] for security reasons. At the end of the war, the [[Red Army]] took the documents from [[Prague Offensive|German-occupied Czechoslovakia]]{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=41}} and in 1945-46, stored them in the [[KGB]]'s {{ill|Osobyi Archive|de|Sonderarchiv Moskau}} ({{lang-ru|Особый архив}}), meaning special archive, which was housed in [[Moscow]].{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} In 1947, Posthumus-van der Goot, the only one of the founders who survived the war, became president of the IAV and reopened the archive.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} She immediately began making inquiries as to what had happened to their stolen collection, following the lead that women's groups in Berlin had wanted them. {{ill|Gerda Walther|de}}, a German philosopher living in [[Munich]] wrote her that it was unlikely that any German women, except possibly Scholtz-Klink had any interest in obtaining the materials.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=157}} In 1947, Dirk Graswinckel, a member of the committee to recover and repatriate [[Nazi plunder]], returned a few boxes, representing about 1/10th of IAV's pre-war holdings. Then in 1966, a librarian from [[Hradec Králové]], [[Czechoslovakia]] found four books stamped by the IAV and returned them.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=159}} In the 1960s, the organization filed for reparations under the [[Wiedergutmachung]] program and assumed its remaining holdings were lost.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Second-wave feminism rejuvenation==
The period of actively acquiring materials ceased effectively in 1939 and through the 1970s no efforts were made to expand the collection beyond what had been retrieved, unless an individual or organization donated materials.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=32}} Though some minor works were published in the 1950s and 1960s by IAV, and they moved several times, little effort was made to reach those beyond Posthumus-van der Goot's circle.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|pp=159-160}} In the 1970s during the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave of feminism]] institutions and organizations began to flourish again. Women's history groups at several Dutch universities began seeking out records on women and re-discovered IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}}{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}} Growing interest in preserving women's records and specifically evaluating the history of ordinary women, led to the decision to begin acquiring documents again in the early 1980s, with the specific focus of obtaining journals, letters and diaries from working class women, instead of just women's movement elites.{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} The Dutch government began to subsidize the collection efforts, causing the archive to exponentially expand.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

Wanting better access to the materials, the first professional [[inventory]] was completed in 1980{{sfn|de Haan|Mevis|2008|p=34}} and the following year, having outgrown their space, IAV moved to Keizersgracht 10 in Amsterdam, sharing offices with three other women's organizations: the Documentation Centre for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Informatie en Documentatie Centrum (IDC)}}), the journal ''Lover'', and the Foundation of Women in the Visual Arts ({{lang-nl|Stichting Vrouwen in de Beeldende Kunst (SVBK)}}). In 1988, the IAV, IDC and ''Lover'' organizations were merged to form the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement ({{lang-nl|Internationaal Informatiecentrum en Archief voor de Vrouwenbeweging (IIAV)}}) with the IAV archival collection underpinning the new institution's holdings.{{sfn|Mevis|2012}}

==Subsequent recoveries==
In 1992, a report which appeared in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', a major Dutch newspaper, written by historian Marc Jansen, noted that some of IAV's materials had been located in Russia. He reported that the Russians were willing to return more than thirty collections, including those of the IAV.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=2}} Almost immediately the state archivists of both countries met in Moscow and signed an agreement to return the twenty-five boxes of IAV's documents found in Russia, but there were delays{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} because the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian Parliament]] refused to ratify the agreement. In 1993, Heleen Massee of the photograph division of IIAV was allowed to go to Moscow and take notes on the content of six boxes.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=160}}

In the spirit of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] policy reforms, historian Mineke Bosch and a colleague, Myriam Everard, went to Moscow in 1994 to try to discover what records were held in the Osobyi Archive. Bosch discovered a leather bound volume of newspaper clippings, photographs and translations which had been prepared by Hungarian women for a visit by Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, following the [[Third Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|1906 Copenhagen Conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The Hungarians had invited Catt to visit in October, and advised her to bring a German-speaking companion, who was not German to assist her. To commemorate the visit, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] had helped them bind the volume marked with the inscription "1906 October 12–14". Upon finding the booklet, Bosch brought it to Everard and they approached the director and asked if they could return it to Amsterdam. Though sympathetic, the director denied their request, claiming that all items had to be counted before they could be returned.{{sfn|Bosch|2003|pp=1-3}}

Bosch and Everard spent four days in Moscow and inventoried 203 dossiers containing 28,051 documents,{{sfn|Bosch|2003|p=3}}{{sfn|Everard|Bosch|1994|p=194}} discovering hundreds of pictures dated to the 1890s. They found a large portion of Manus' documents but also noted that the collection did not represent the entirety of the stolen artifacts,{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}} as most of the 150 periodicals and all of the 4,500 books of the pre-war IAV were absent.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=162}} When the delays caused concern that the IAV archives might not be returned quickly, the International Institute for Social History microfilmed 14 reels of 33,663 individual images, making the documents accessible once again.{{sfn|Mevis|2004}} Though officials continued to press for the return of the documents bureaucracy delayed any action until an announced 2001 visit by [[Queen Beatrix]] to Russia. Finally in January 2002, twenty-two boxes of materials were returned to the Netherlands. Nine boxes, including some of the IAV records were retained because they had not been properly processed. In March 2003, the final nine boxes were sent, and rejoined the archival collection in May.{{sfn|de Haan|2004|p=161}}

In December 2015, nine books, including ''Beroepsarbeid der gehuwde vrouw'' (Occupational work of the married woman, 1921) by Betsy Bakker-Nort were returned from the [[Berlin Central and Regional Library]], bearing the stamp of IAV or Rosa Manus.{{sfn|Atria|2015}}

Since the mid-2000s, the term '''''kkonminam''''' ({{ko-hhrm|꽃미남|꽃美男||}}; {{audio|Ko-Kkomminam.ogg|listen}} ''kkot/n'' [꽃] = flower, ''minam'' [미남] = handsome man) has been commonly used in South Korea to refer to young men with a great sense of personal style and fashion, popularized by [[South Korean idols|pop idols]], who may seem effeminate, in part because they are often shown with make-up, such as eye-liner or lip gloss. Another cause may be that as most of them are in their late teens to early twenties they look rather boyish. Although they are sometimes regarded as Korean [[bishōnen]], their gender is not commonly questioned, nor their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seoulbeats.com/2012/10/the-king-and-the-clowns-love-story|title=The King And The Clown’s Love Story.|publisher=newsen|year=2012|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Hwarang]]'', or "flower youths"/"flowering knights/gentlemen" were an elite group of male warriors in Silla, an ancient Korean kingdom.

The [[National_Security_Act_(South_Korea)|National Security Act]] affected South Korea in the 1990s as there were regulations placed on international imports. Due to The National Security Act, Korea experienced a lack of television programming. This allowed television companies to turn to [[K-pop]] by establishing channels such as [[Mnet_(TV_channel)|Mnet]]. Mnet is a South Korean pay television music channel which has a variety of programs through talk, game, and live music shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Taylor |first=Constance |date=2007 |title=Kkonminam: An Exploration of Representations of Masculine Identities in the K-pop Industry |publisher=University for the Creative Arts|url=http://www.academia.edu/34120903/Constance_Taylor_Dissertation_EFPI6006_Kkonminam_An_Exploration_of_Representations_of_Masculine_Identities_in_the_K-pop_Industry |access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Kkonminam images became notable in the Korean entertainment industry. There came the glorification of pretty boys, with smooth, fair skin, silky hair, and a feminine manner. This replaced the previous images of tough and aggressive Korean men in television commercials, dramas, and on billboards.&lt;ref name=Sun2010 /&gt;The kkonminam phenomenon is existent in many of Korean popular culture.

[[File:140120 Minho Lee c.jpg|thumb|Lee Min Ho as the arrogant Gu Jun-pyo in ''Boys over Flowers.'']]
In 2009, [[Boys_Over_Flowers_(TV_series)|''Boys over Flowers'']] a Korean television series based on a Japanese ''[[Shōjo_manga|shojo]]'' manga ''Hana yori dango'' which gained much popularity in South Korea and across Asia. The series and manga is about an average high school girl who gets involved in the lives of an arrogant rich boy and his friends. In ''Boys over Flowers'', the male leads bear childlike and boyish features with contrast of muscular and strong bodies. Due to its broadcast the drama influenced South Korean Men to take their appearances more seriously. This led to an increase in South Korean males wearing cosmetics, preppy and cruise like outfits, and sporting traditionally more feminine looks, colors, and prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee Hyo-won|title=Men, Be Beautiful for Spring, Summer|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/01/199_39427.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2018|date=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan Reception==
Crystal S. Anderson, a Research Scholar of Cultural Studies at [[Longwood_University|Longwood University]], found the variety of ways of which global fans talked about masculinities of male K-pop groups. One respondent wrote, “I am also really curious about flower boys and the varying expressions of masculinity in Korean boy bands.” Another respondent noted, “The first thing that attracted me when I was small is that Korean artists are exceptionally handsome/beautiful and possessed unique style, both in their music and fashion,” linking appearance to a certain style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Crystal S. |editor1-last=Kuwahara |editor1-first=Yasue |title=The Korean wave : Korean popular culture in global context |date=2014 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, New York |isbn=978-1-349-46832-4 |pages=118 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137350282_7#citeas |accessdate=23 October 2018 |language=en |chapter=That’s My Man! Overlapping Masculinities in Korean Popular Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid Bands===
Korean boy bands that have appeared to adopt forms of this phenomenon are [[2PM]], [[Highlight_(band)|B2ST]], and [[MBLAQ]].&lt;ref name="Leung2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=KimSoyoung&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kim |first1=Soyoung |title=Men in K-Pop: From “Flower Boys” to “Beast-dols” {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/column/k-pop-generation/article/2013/10/22/Kpop_Men_Gender_Roles_Soy/ |website=www.thecrimson.com |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These Korean boy bands draw on elements of "gangster" and [[Hip_hop|hip-hop]] themes in their performances. The hybridized aspects are made to appeal to other audiences and their taste based on these elemental features. Scholars that have analyzed these boys bands note that the Korean boy bands display masculinity of both [[Kawaii|kawaii]] and kkonminam elements.&lt;ref name="KimSoyoung" /&gt;These boy bands emphasize stereotypical masculinity in their performances. 

Due to their display and maximization of the tough masculine image 2PM has been nicknamed by local Korean media and [[Netizen|netizens]] as Jimseungdol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=Sun |title=Korean masculinities and transcultural consumption : Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop idols |date=2011 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=978-988-8053-63-6 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xcrmm |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2PM, in their on-stage performances showcase total wildness and manliness. In the various end performances of ''Heartbeat'', the title song of their first full-length album, the hyper masculine beast- like performance is displayed. In the performances [[Ok_Taec-yeon|Taecyeon]] tears off his shirt off;  [[Nichkhun]] rips out Taecyeon’s heart out, symbolically and in a brutal manner; while [[Hwang_Chan-sung|Chan-Sung]] breathes fiercely while lifting  Nichkhun over his head.&lt;ref name="Leung2012" /&gt;

'''Kosovar civil society''' has had many incarnations since the early 1990s. It is a product of the occupation of the Kosovo province by the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] through 1999, then expanded when the Republic of Kosovo was under [[UNMIK]] and [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] control, and now how it has evolved since the unilateral declaration of independence on February 17, 2008.  It consists of the former civil society organizations from before the 1999 conflict, the local NGOs that came about post conflict, and the international NGOs that have either dispersed money or opened local branches within Kosovo.

It has a majority ethnic Albanian population, while having a minority Serbian, Roma, Ashkali, Egyptian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, and Croatian population.  Prior to 2008, the government functions were administered by UNMIK and it was protected by KFOR.  UNMIK and KFOR started their missions in 1999 after the NATO-led bombing of Yugoslavia and Serbian positions.

== History of Modern Kosovo ==

=== Kosovo under Yugoslavia ===
The province of Kosovo was a part of Yugoslavia since its creation in 1943.  After the 1974 Yugoslavian constitution, it was made an autonomous province that had status similar to the other Yugoslavian republics without giving it full rights.  This lasted until [[Slobodan Milošević]] came into power in 1988, when he changed the legal status of the province and started a campaign to purge Albanians from the government and education system.  The response was the creation of parallel societies in Kosovo, one controlled from Belgrade and one created by the local Albanian population.  A few of these organizations still exist, but all were focused on providing basic services, such as education and healthcare.

=== Civil society directly before the war ===
This period of time is characterized by a legal environment that severely restricted the amount of NGOs and their effectiveness.  In addition to the legal constrictions, there were also security concerns that limited the number of NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cso-ks.org/?page=2,16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mother Teresa Society was one such organization that provided health care services;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nenatereze.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms collected and recorded information about human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.oneworld.net/contact/company/view/360&lt;/ref&gt; These NGOs lasted through the war and are still active in the community to date.

=== Civil society directly after the war ===
This period is characterized by the increased effectiveness of NGOs due to changes in the legal and security situation in Kosovo. The focus of the NGOs was on reconstruction, of infrastructure and residences, and humanitarian aid.

Directly after the war, there was a large surge in international NGOs and money donated into the post-conflict area.  After the NATO-led intervention and the signing of Regulation 1999/22 &lt;ref&gt;http://d4d-ks.org/about-us/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; on May 9, 2000, the legal and security situation surrounding NGOs vastly improved.  This allowed the international NGOs that had rushed into the country to operate with local counterparts;  it also permitted the establishment and regulation of Kosovo-based NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cso-ks.org/?page=2,16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil society since 2008 ===
With the 5th anniversary of Kosovo, the focus of the civil society in Kosovo has shifted from reconstruction to governance and nation building.  There has also been a shift in focus towards the protection of minority rights, specifically women, Roma, and Serbs.

As Kosovo has moved past the initial reconstruction phase, there has also been a decrease in the amount of available funds and donors.  It is estimated that there are only approximately 500 "active" NGOs, from the 4882 registered;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/1999/re99_22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the others have been deemed either dormant or do not have the 
capacity to have any sort of meaningful effect on the country.

== Civil society in Kosovo ==

=== Who ===
The civil society of Kosovo is generally made up of ethnic Albanians.  After the NATO-led intervention, the influx of international NGOs changed the demographics of the civil society.  There were a large amount of internationals from NATO member countries especially, that were based in Kosovo.  Since the declaration of independence, there has been a shift to include the minorities into the process of building a democratic society.

Due to the Republic of Kosovo's young population and high unemployment rates, there have been few instances of a shortage in engaging with the local population.  However, NGOs cannot sustain large numbers of employees, most have between three and five employees and very few have more than 10, so while there are plenty, they are unable to provide employment for large 
portions of the population.

=== What ===
The civil society in the 1990s was focused on education, health care, women's rights, and the recording of human rights violations.  Post-conflict Kosovo civil society was again focused on health care, women's rights, community development, and human rights;  there were additional focuses on reconstruction of infrastructure and residences and humanitarian aid. Since the declaration of independence, the focus has been on the legal system, especially the judiciary and rule of law, community development, and [[good governance]].  Majority of the NGOs are focused on transparency in both the legal system and governance.

=== Types&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usig.org/countryinfo/kosovo.asp#Types&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Kosovo recognizes two types of domestic organization, associations and foundations. Both organizations can apply for Public Beneficiary Status, though both types are still responsible for VAT, with minor exceptions.

==== Associations ====
An association is a membership organization established by at least three domestic or foreign legal or natural persons.  At least one member must reside in the Republic of Kosovo.

==== Foundations ====
A foundation is an organization without members, whose main function is to manage property or assets.  It would be created by at least one legal or natural, foreign or domestic person.  It can be created by a will.  There has to be at least one agent who has residence in Kosovo.

=== Impact on development ===

The NGOs have been the major agents of change throughout Kosovo since before the war.  They were able to provide basic services during the 1990s and help UNMIK rebuild the country after the 1999 conflict.  According to [[UNDP|UNDP's Human Development Report]] in 2008, every fourth Kosovar family has had their life impacted by a civil society activity and that there are more people benefiting from the system than those who are participating in the system.  This latter aspect is seen more with other minorities and seen least among Kosovar-Serbs, the report states;  however it does mention that Kosovar Serbs answered "don't know" when surveyed, so there could be confusion about the benefits and if they are receiving more than they know.

The report also states that assistance with housing is the most common form of benefit, followed by infrastructure, education, and health care respectively.

The structure of the civil society has affected the impact tremendously. There are, generally, strong organizational features of the civil society of Kosovo.  However, there are areas of improvement, especially in the implementation aspect.  It also states that while democratization and transparency are emphasized in internal documents and memorandums, it does not consistently translate into practice.&lt;ref&gt;http://civilsocietyindex.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/a-civil-society-success-story-from-kosovo/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
There are only five local grant making organizations, so a vast majority of the money has been from international donors.  86% of that money comes from United States donors while the other 14% comes from the European Union.  There has been little movement towards fundraising from local businesses, due to a lack of need and tax policies that do not encourage donation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/1999/re99_22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society’s relationship with the government of Kosovo ==
Since 1999,  NGOs have had to deal with a two-tiered system of government.  They were regulated by the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|PISG]] and UNMIK.  This has created problems, as UNMIK has been unresponsive to local level civil society activities compounded by the seeming distrust between civil society and PISG.

Since 2002, the international community has been reducing the amount of money flowing into Kosovo to ensure that the PISG and NGOs would be forced to work together.  However, this has not happened to a large extent.  Only with international pressure does the PISG really consult with NGOs on the formation of new laws and regulations, with the notable exception of the National Action Plan for Gender Equality between politicians and women's civil society organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo.undp.org/repository/docs/HDR_final_eng_small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This happened over 10 weeks in 2003.

Normal interactions between the government and NGOs are done through personal contacts.  There are no institutional mechanisms in place to facilitate or require cooperation between the two entities.

It has been speculated that the PISG still has views of the civil society as a supportive role from the pre-war era, while also viewing NGOs as competitors for the ever-shrinking international monetary fund.  The reverse is the traditional Kosovar suspicion of government authorities.  This cycle has impaired the process of state building, reconstruction, and development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo.undp.org/repository/docs/HDR_final_eng_small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society’s coordination in Kosovo ==
Majority of the funding for NGOs is project-based and generally has individual donating bodies.  There is still a good amount of money that comes from [[UNDP]], [[EULEX]], and [[OSCE]].  UNDP focuses on projects and proposals that will affect the development of Kosovo, from infrastructure to education.  EULEX focuses on projects and proposals that will increase the effectiveness of rule of law in Kosovo.  OSCE works with elections and ethnic relations.  They try and increase government accountability, transparency, and good governance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo.undp.org/repository/docs/HDR_final_eng_small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society organizations ==
'''Think Tanks or Research Institutes''':

'''Lester Lawrence Lessig III''' (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic, attorney, and [[political activist]]. He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]] and the former director of the [[Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10519/Lessig/|title=Harvard Law School Faculty Lawrence Lessig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig was a [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|candidate]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nomination for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], but withdrew before the primaries.

Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], [[trademark]], and [[radio frequency]] spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]], where he founded the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]], and at the [[University of Chicago]]. He is a former board member of the [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[Software Freedom Law Center]]; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups [[Public Knowledge]] and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]]; and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.

As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a [[Second Constitutional Convention of the United States|Second Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref name=twsNovQ11&gt;{{cite news |author=Alesh Houdek |title=Has a Harvard Professor Mapped Out the Next Step for Occupy Wall Street? |work=The Atlantic |quote=Lawrence Lessig's call for state-based activism on behalf of a Constitutional Convention could provide the uprooted movement with a political project for winter |date=November 16, 2011 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/has-a-harvard-professor-mapped-out-the-next-step-for-occupy-wall-street/247561/ |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded [[political action committee]] which he termed [[Mayday PAC]] with the purpose of electing candidates to [[United States Congress|Congress]] who would pass [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref&gt;Naureen Khan, May 2, 2014, Al Jazeera, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/2/a-super-pac-to-endallsuperpacs.html May Day PAC wants to end all Super PACs], Accessed May 7, 2014, "kick-start May Day PAC, which, if successful, will help elect enough like-minded lawmakers to Congress in 2014 and 2016 to pass campaign finance reform&amp;nbsp;... 'Yes, we want to spend big money to end the influence of big money,' Lessig said"&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig is also the co-founder of [[Rootstrikers]], and is on the boards of [[MapLight]] and [[Represent.Us]].&lt;ref&gt;Maplight.

In August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for President of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/harvard-professor-hits-dollar1m-benchmark-for-white-house-bid/ar-AAe0WvJ?ocid=ansmsnnews11|title=Harvard professor hits $1M benchmark for White House bid|work=msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="why"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/lawrence-lessig-running-for-president-20150811 | title=Why Exactly Is Lawrence Lessig Considering Running for President? | work=[[National Journal]] | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Foran, Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|to become a candidate]] for the 2016 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016|presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Hayley|title=Harvard Professor Larry Lessig Says He's Running for President|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harvard-professor-larry-lessig-running-president/story?id=33568066|accessdate=September 6, 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig has described his candidacy as a referendum on [[campaign finance reform]] and [[electoral reform]] legislation.

==Academic career==
Lessig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in economics and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in management ([[Wharton School]]) from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]) in England, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1989. After graduating from law school, he [[Law clerk|clerked]] for a year for Judge [[Richard Posner]], at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and another year for Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707013742/http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |archivedate=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig started his academic career at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] draft a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/951207/georgia.shtml|title=Center helps Eastern European countries shape constitutions|publisher=|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2000, he was at [[Harvard Law School]], holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; He subsequently joined [[Stanford Law School]], where he established the school's [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref name="short-bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Short Biography |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/bio// |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722035945/http://www.lessig.org/info/bio/ |archivedate=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics.&lt;ref name="hl-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence Lessig named professor of law at HLS, director of Harvard's Edmond J.

===In popular culture===
Lessig was portrayed by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in "[[The Wake Up Call]]", during season 6 of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/02/09/lessig-portrayed-on.html|title=Lessig portrayed on tonight's West Wing|work=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
[[File:Jonathan Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig (Google DC, March 20 2008).jpg|thumbnail|Lessig speaking with Harvard internet law professor [[Jonathan Zittrain]]]]
Lessig has been politically [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential [[Conservatism|conservative]] judges, Judge [[Richard Posner]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him for his supposed "brilliance" rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the "token liberal" on their staffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-how-political-is-it/|title=Supreme Court Clerk Hiring: Is It Becoming More Political?|work=Above the Law|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|author=Steven Levy|date=October 1, 2002|work=WIRED|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of [[Teenage Republicans]], served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the [[YMCA Youth and Government]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymcapa.org/ |title=YMCA Youth and Government Pennsylvania (PA State YMCA) |publisher=Ymcapa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978, and almost pursued a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political career.

What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the [[Eastern Bloc]], where he acquired a lifelong interest in [[Eastern Europe]]an law and politics.

Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the [[John McCain]] campaign for discussing [[fair use]] rights in a letter to [[YouTube]] where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |title=McCain/Palin to YouTube: Get real (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070933/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and computer activism==
[[File:Lawrence lessig, joi ito.jpg|thumbnail|Lessig with fellow Creative Commons board member [[Joi Ito]]]]

==="Code is law"===
In computer science, "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the [[source code]]). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute [[statutory law]]. In his 1999 book ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'', Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for [[social control]], leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'' in December 2006.

===Remix culture===
Lessig has been a proponent of the [[remix culture]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/lessig.htm |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2016-02-27 |title=Remix Is a Cultural Right, Lessig Says |publisher=law.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2008 book [[Remix (book)|''Remix'']]&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix Remix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060619/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix |date=April 2, 2016 }} on [[scribd.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix Culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, "read/write" culture and the hybrid economy.

According to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of [[Prohibition]], both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely [[Creative Commons license]]s, as a remedy to maintain "rule of law" while combating plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778455386|title=The social media reader|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|publisher=New York University Press|others=Mandiberg, Michael,|year=2012|isbn=9780814764077|location=New York|pages=155–169|chapter=REMIX: How Creativity is Being Strangled by the Law|oclc=778455386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's board of directors.&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/about/leadership.html |title=Leadership – Free Software Foundation |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of "[[Free-culture movement|free culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/ |title=free_culture |publisher=Randomfoo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports [[free and open-source software]] and [[open spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/ |title=Spectrum Policy: Property or Commons? |publisher=Cyberlaw.stanford.edu |date=2003-03-02 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his free culture keynote at the [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention]] 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about [[software patent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/|title=free_culture|work=randomfoo.net}} Lessig discusses software patents from time 17:38 to 20:38 of the audio recording&lt;/ref&gt; which he views as a rising threat to [[free software]], [[open source software]] and innovation.

In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the [[Digital Universe]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&amp;EDATE= |title=Digital Universe Adds Leading Internet Expert Lawrence Lessig to Board of Advisors |location=California |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 [[Wikimania]] conference. In December 2006, his lecture '' On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code'' was one of the highlights at [[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons |title=commons |year=2011 |id=google video docid=7661663613180520595 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Lawrence Lessig |title=Colbert Nation |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |publisher=Comedy Central |date=January 8, 2009 |time=2:16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreword to the [[Freesouls]] book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have&amp;nbsp;... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freesouls.cc/essays/00-foreword-lawrence-lessig.html|title=Freesouls - Foreword by Lawrence Lessig|work=freesouls.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is also a well-known critic of [[copyright term]] extensions.

===Net neutrality===
[[File:Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg|thumb|Lessig and [[Jimmy Wales]] at the iCommons iSummit07 in [[Dubrovnik]]]]
Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of [[net neutrality]]. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify [[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]]'s four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."&lt;ref&gt;CBC NEWS. Google accused of turning its back on net neutrality. December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative reform===
Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Clark. Software Freedom Fighters. ''The National Journal'' 33(30), July 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," "My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Mills. Domain games: Internet leaves the U.S. nest. ''InfoWorld Daily News''. October 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}{{See also|Eldred v. Ashcroft}}
From 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. Working with the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/10/lessig-3/|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the [[Public domain in the United States|public domain]] and a large number of ''[[Amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]].

In March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig Backs Away From Copy Fights In Courts, Congress.

In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song "[[Lisztomania (song)|Lisztomania]]" by the band [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]], whom Liberation Music represents.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/document/lessig-v-liberation-music-complaint |title=Lessig v.

===''Killswitch''===
{{Main|Killswitch (film)}}
In October 2014, ''Killswitch'', a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as [[Aaron Swartz]], [[Tim Wu]], and [[Edward Snowden]] received its World Premiere at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |last1=von Busack |first1=Richard |title=Breaking the Internet: Killswitch Screens at Cinequest |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/cinequest-2015/Killswitch-Edward-Snowden.html |date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |publisher=Metro Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swegles |first1=Fred |title=Battle for Internet Control Fuels O.C. -produced Movie |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/film-657978-internet-big.html/ |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, ''Killswitch'' was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman [[Alan Grayson]]. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [[Net Neutrality]]. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and [[Free Press (organization)]] CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.&lt;ref name="house1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grayson |first1=Alan |title=Grayson Screen Award Winning "Killswitch" Documentary |url=http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |publisher=Congressman Grayson's House of Rep Official Web Page |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227162553/http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |archivedate=February 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price That You Pay for Rocking The Boat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/aaron-swartz-killswitch_b_6957576.html |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is "One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.".&lt;ref name="house1"/&gt; [[Richard von Busack]] of the [[Metro Silicon Valley]], writes of ''Killswitch'', "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café".&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Fred Swegles of the [[Orange County Register]], remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by ''Killswitch'', a gripping and fast-paced documentary."&lt;ref name="ocreg"/&gt; Kathy Gill of [[GeekWire]] asserts that "''Killswitch'' is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz."&lt;ref name="geekwire.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gill|first1=Kathy|title=Lawrence Lessig at 'Killswitch' Seattle Premiere: Money, Politics, and the Battle for the Internet|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/lawrence-lessig-seattle-money-politics-battle-internet/|accessdate=June 5, 2015|agency=GeekWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Electors Trust===

[[File:Jack Abramoff and Lawrence Lessig at "In the Dock" 2011 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig having a discussion with former lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]]]]
At the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on [[political corruption]] instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with [[Aaron Swartz]], a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |title=Required Reading: the next 10 years (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116071137/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new work was partially facilitated through his [[wiki]], Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |title=Lessig's blog July 29, 2007 11:55pm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015180516/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |archivedate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig criticized the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] and have become beholden to special interests.&lt;ref name=twsDecM9009&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Lessig |title=How to Get Our Democracy Back

In February 2008, a [[Facebook]] group formed by law professor [[John Palfrey]] encouraged him to run for Congress from [[California's 12th congressional district]], the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative [[Tom Lantos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://draftlessig.org/ |title=Draft Lessig – Change Congress |publisher=Draftlessig.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |title=On why I am not running (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116042748/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootstrikers===
{{Main|Rootstrikers}}
Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning" /&gt; To this end, he worked with political consultant [[Joe Trippi]] to launch a web based project called "[[Change Congress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/stanford-law-pr.html |title=Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig Bets 'Wikipedia' Approach Will Transform Congress &amp;#124; Threat Level from Wired.com |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visualwebcaster.com/event.asp?id=46510 |title=Sunlight Foundation Webcast |publisher=Visualwebcaster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a board member of [[MAPLight.org]], a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.

===New Hampshire Rebellion===
The [[Coalition for Open Democracy|New Hampshire Rebellion]] is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014"&gt;Lawrence Lessig, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-were-marching-across-new-hampshire-to-honor-aaron-swartz/282962/ "Why We're Marching Across New Hampshire to Honor Aaron Swartz"], ''The Atlantic'', January 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harper, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/inside-the-beltway-self-awareness-and-the-science-/?page=all "Restless grassroots: New Hampshire 'Rebellion' declares their state is not for sale"] (Inside the Beltway column), ''Washington Times'', December 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;John Koziol, [http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150118/NEWS06/150119165 "NH Rebellion Marching Its Way to Concord for Reform"], ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', January 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist [[Jeff Kurzon]], marched from [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire]] to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling "the systemic corruption in Washington".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Lessig chose this language over the related term "campaign finance reform," commenting that "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The walk was to continue the work of NH Native [[Doris Haddock|Doris "Granny D" Haddock]], and in honor of deceased activist [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014" /&gt; The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast.&lt;ref name="vasseur"&gt;Flore Vasseur, [https://medium.com/backchannel/larry-lessigs-long-walk-b96d80d34972 "The New Hampshire Rebellion: Larry Lessig's Long Walk"], ''The Medium'', December 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial "New Hampshire primaries", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.&lt;ref name="vasseur" /&gt;

==2016 presidential candidacy==
{{main|Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016}}
Lessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.
On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|nomination]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name="why"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exploring"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/larry-lessig-presidential-campaign-exploration/index.html | title=Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig is exploring a long shot presidential bid | publisher=CNN.com | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Merica, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]] 2015.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Kristin (August 11, 2015) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/08/11/harvard-law-professor-exploring-presidential-run/lNQdSFZzDpMzCh0Uinz2aO/story.html "Harvard law professor wants to be president—for one day"], [[Boston.com]]. Retrieved August 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was focused on a single issue: [[The Citizen Equality Act]], a proposal that couples [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] with other laws aimed at curbing [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering]] and ensuring [[Voter suppression in the United States|voting access]].&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;

He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/2016-election/384828/|title=The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet|last=Graham|first=David|date=2 November 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral College Reform==
In 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the [[Plurality voting system|winner-take-all]] [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote allocation in the various states, called ''Equal Votes''.&lt;ref name="to171005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Douglas|title=Electoral-college reform would have defeated Donald Trump; now some Republicans back effort, seek action before 2020|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2017/10/electoral-college_reform_would.html|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=The Oregonian|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig is counsel for plaintiffs in ''[[Nemanich v. Williams]]'', an electoral law case in Colorado.

==Awards and honors==
In 2002, Lessig received the [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] from the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF).&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"/&gt; He also received the [[Scientific American|Scientific American 50 Award]] for having "argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scientific-american-5-2002-11-11/|title=The Scientific American 50 Award|work=Scientific American|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, Lessig was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/april26/aaas-042606.html |title=Eight scholars elected to academy of arts and sciences |publisher=News-service.stanford.edu |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lessig was born in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], the son of Patricia, who sold real estate, and Lester L. "Jack" Lessig, an engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Wired 10.10: Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/newmedia/n146.xml|title=Lessig, Lawrence|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].

In May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced [[sexual abuse]] by the director at the [[American Boychoir School]], which he had attended as an adolescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heilemann |first=John |url=http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html |title=Lawrence Lessig and John Hardwicke Fight Sexual Abuse and the American Boychoir School |publisher=Newyorkmetro.com |date=2005-05-21 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109184450/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2005/05/living_with_ghosts.html |title=living with ghosts (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116200950/http://lessig.org/blog/2005/05/living_with_ghosts.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] to restrict the scope of immunity radically, which had protected nonprofits that failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability.&lt;ref name="Hardwicke v. American Boychoir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/decisions/supreme/a-17-04.doc.html |title=Hardwicke v. American Boychoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is married to Bettina Neuefeind, a German-born Harvard University colleague. The two married in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2000-03-05/the-paul-revere-of-the-web&lt;/ref&gt; He and Neuefeind have three children: Willem, Teo, and Tess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hyperink.com/Personal-Life-b1404a12|title=Personal Life - Lawrence Lessig: A Biography|publisher=Hyperink.com|date=|accessdate=2015-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032036/http://www.hyperink.com/Personal-Life-b1404a12|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lebanese people in Iran''' refers to [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] living in [[Iran]] or Iranians of Lebanese descent. The Lebanese populate various regions and cities, but historically the religious city of [[Qom]] (apart from the modern capital [[Tehran]] and previous capitals) has been a principal area of settlement.

Lebanese are known to have been steadily migrating to the contemporary and [[Russo-Persian Wars|former]] [[Ottoman-Persian Wars|territories]] of Iran since the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]]-era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiites-in-lebanon ''SHIʿITES IN LEBANON''] retrieved 7 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lebanese are known to have been migrating to contemporary Iran since the time of the Safavids (1501-1736). Nur-al-Din Karaki Ameli, a principal Lebanese Shia [[scholar]], played a pivotal role at the Safavid court in opening a new way in the relations between [[secular]] rulers and Shi'ite clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiites-in-lebanon ''SHIʿITES IN LEBANON''] retrieved 7 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Karaki furthermore played a crucial role in inaugurating a movement of emigration of Lebanese Shia scholars from [[Jabal Amel]] (then in [[Ottoman Syria]]) to Safavid Iran during the reign of the first two Safavid kings (''[[shahs]]''), namely [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501-24) and [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524-76), who were at pains [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|to introduce Shi'ism on the state-level]] throughout their vast dominions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiites-in-lebanon ''SHIʿITES IN LEBANON''] retrieved 7 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the Safavid era, Twelver Shi'ism was imported into Iran largely from [[Mount Lebanon]] and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Floor|editor-first1=Willem|editor-last2=Herzig|editor-first2=Edmund|title=Iran and the World in the Safavid Age|date=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1780769905|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZNpBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=safavids+imported+lebanon&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moldovan referendum of 2010''' was a nationwide [[referendum]] in [[Moldova]] held on 5 September on whether or not the country should amend the [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)|Constitution of Moldova]] to return to [[direct popular election]] of the president. Since 2001, the president had been indirectly elected by Parliament, with a supermajority of 61 seats (three-fifths of the membership) required for election..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rferl.org/content/Moldovans_To_Go_To_Referendum_Early_Polls_In_The_Fall/2061327.html&lt;/ref&gt; The voters are asked to answer the following question ''"Would you agree with the Constitutional amendment, which would allow the election of the [[President of the Republic of Moldova]] by the entire population?"'', voting for one of the proposed options: “Yes (for)” or “No (against)”. Of those who had cast their vote, 87.83% chose "Yes".&lt;ref name="e-democracy.md"/&gt; However, the referendum did not pass because only 30.29% of voters turned out, short of the necessary 33% for the referendum to be considered valid.&lt;ref name="e-democracy.md"&gt;[http://www.e-democracy.md/en/elections/referendum/2010/ Republican Constitutional Referendum of September 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As the constitution cannot be changed by parliamentary vote against the will of the opposition [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist Party]] (PCRM), which holds enough seats to block any constitutional changes by parliamentary vote, the ruling coalition decided to bypass it by holding a referendum on the question.&lt;ref name="RefA"&gt;[http://www.mdinto.biz/news.php?nid=4664 Mihai Ghimpu: We will not have early elections] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906151657/http://www.mdinto.biz/news.php?nid=4664 |date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Constitution was initially adopted by the [[Parliament of Moldova|Parliament]] by 50+1 votes. A national referendum was then approved by a simple majority in parliament for the people to express their opinion on the new Constitution.&lt;ref name="RefA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Moldovan-govt-proposes-Sept-5-referendum-date-2010-07-02T181130Z]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal also changed the name of the state language from "[[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]" to "Romanian." According to Ghimpu, the [[Romanian language]] must be the official language of Moldova.&lt;ref  name="RefA" /&gt;

The [[Venice Commission]] of the [[Council of Europe]] reacted initially favorably to a proposed constitutional reform, in particular to revise the existing procedure of electing president of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/7875 Venice Commission in favor of constitutional reform in Moldova]&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a plenary meeting in March 2010, the Commission suggested to hold early parliamentary elections instead of conducting a constitutional referendum. The Commission also stressed that the current parliament should be dissolved after adopting the proposal for constitutional reform and that this proposal should take effect for the next parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249046708.html CE Venice Commission recommends Moldova to hold early parliamentary elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323173650/http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249046708.html |date=2010-03-23 }}, 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2010, the four leaders of the [[Alliance for European Integration]] (AEI) decided to organize the referendum before June 16, 2010 in order to adopt the [[Constitution of Moldova (2010)|2010 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/9857 AEI decided: new constitution through referendum, without early elections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moldpres.md/ Moldovan constitution to be amended per stages, with European partners' approval - PM]&lt;/ref&gt; Ghimpu stated that he was not going to dissolve the Parliament in case of defeat on September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.europarussia.com/posts/1617 Moldova. Grandi manovre in vista del referendum costituzionale] EuropaRussia, August 19th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] (PCRM) suggested to lower the validity threshold for future presidential elections from 61 to 51, a simple majority. However, the communists insisted that this change would be in force only after the next parliamentary elections, whereas the ruling coalition wanted to introduce the changes before such elections. After negotiations with the communists have failed, the AEI used its simple majority advantage in the parliament on 7 July 2010 to pass the referendum proposal. In addition, the electoral code was amended by lowering the necessary voter turnout from 60% to 33%, reducing the effectiveness of a boycott&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Cabacenco: [http://digest.electionguide.org/2010/09/01/cabacenco-moldova-on-the-threshold-of-change-2/ Moldova, On the Threshold of Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215204920/http://digest.electionguide.org/2010/09/01/cabacenco-moldova-on-the-threshold-of-change-2/ |date=2010-12-15 }}, 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCRM together with several other parties urged the voters to boycott the referendum, hoping to push the turnout below the 33% necessary for validation of the referendum’s result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36793&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=27&amp;cHash=fc3480732b Moldovan Referendum: Suffers Governing Alliance Crushing Defeat], by [[Vladimir Socor]], [[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] Volume: 7 Issue: 159.  9 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldovan citizens living abroad were allowed to participate in the referendum. The deputy prime minister, [[Iurie Leancă]], said that 130,000 ballot papers were requested for the 78 polling stations which opened abroad, 1,600 for each of them.&lt;ref name="portal.moldpres.md"&gt;[http://portal.moldpres.md/default.asp?Lang=en&amp;ID=138357 Eleven states consent to open polling stations for Moldova's referendum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==
According to the [[Chişinău]]-based Institute of Marketing and Polls IMAS-INC, a poll held between July 26 and August 12 showed that 91% of the people will vote "yes" (for) and that about 73% of Moldova's population was ready to take part in the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/13325 Over 90% of the people will vote “in favor” at the referendum, poll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.europalibera.org/content/article/2135527.html IMAS - referendumul susținut de 73% din respondenți]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Political parties were not registered as electoral contestants in the referendum, but they could register as participants in the referendum, with the [[Central Election Commission of Moldova]] having required them to declare their position via two options: “yes (for)” or “no (against)”.&lt;ref name="e-democracy.md"/&gt;

==International observers==
"The [[Council of Europe]] and a [[Delegation of the European Union to Moldova|European Union delegation]] financed 20 teams of observers on behalf of [[NGO]]s from Moldova, which went abroad.

The head of the observer mission from the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], Andreas Gross, praised the referendum as being well organised and corresponding to democratic standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-tUIjp-X5OW1jhMcskoGaI6n3vg Moldova faces new crisis after referendum debacle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Prime Minister [[Vlad Filat]] suggested that the referendum's failure was due not only to the boycott called by the Communists, but also to splits within the [[Alliance for European Integration|governing alliance]].&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;[[Al-Jazeera]]: [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/09/201095235158153738.html "Moldova referendum scuttled"], 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It is currently estimated that there are as many as 2,500 Nepalis currently living in [[Italy]] and their number is increasing. There has been increase in the number of Nepalese arriving in Italy with different motives and objectives during the last few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrn.org.np/medianewsdetail.php?id=1867 Non Resident Nepali Association: NRNA- NCC formed in Italy and South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many Nepalis coming to Italy from other European countries. Most Nepalis in Italy work in private sector factories and restaurants but some of them have also started their own business like small shops and Nepalese restaurants. There are also a few involved in academic works like research and teaching.

'''Philip Alston''' (Feb. 18, 1740 or 1741 – after 1799) was an 18th-century [[coin counterfeiting|counterfeiter]], both before and after the [[American Revolution]]. He operated in [[Virginia]] and the [[Carolinas]] before the war, and in [[Kentucky]] and [[Illinois]] afterward. He was associated with [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-in-Rock]] and his son, outlaw [[Peter Alston]], and counterfeiter [[John Duff (counterfeiter)|John Duff]]. He was an early American settler in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], as well as in the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Red River (Tennessee-Kentucky)|Red River]] valleys in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].

==Early life in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia==
Philip Alston was born Feb. 18, 1740 or 1741, the son of Solomon Alston and Sarah Ann "Nancy" Hinton. He had at least one brother named John.&lt;ref&gt;Linda F. Harris. Sept. 1999. "Descendents of Solomon Alston". http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~digginforroots/alston/solomonpi.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alston was probably born in the British Royal colony of the [[Province of South Carolina]], where the Alston family first settled in North America. The Alston surname was very common in this colony. His family moved to the [[Province of North Carolina]] when he was quite young.&lt;ref name="Finley 18"/&gt; 

Alston was believed to have married in 1765 in North Carolina to a woman named either Temperance Smith, granddaughter of Captain Nicholas Smith and great-great granddaughter of [[Robert Bell (Speaker of the House of Commons)|Robert Bell]], or Mary Molly Temple. He may have married again to Mildred McCoy, after whom his second son received his middle name.

Philip Alston and his wife were known to have had five surviving children:

* Frances Alston, born about 1766, who married James D. Dromgoole (1758–1818) in 1782.
* John McCoy Alston, born in 1767, likely the John Alston that proved the 1799 deed.  
* Philip Alston, Jr., who was deeded numerous slaves by the 1799 deed. 
* Elizabeth Elise Alston, married John Gilbert.
* [[Peter Alston]], known as a counterfeiter and [[river pirate]]. He was said to be [[Little Harpe]]'s partner in the murder of pirate and outlaw leader [[Samuel Mason]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

It is not known when the senior Philip Alston learned and started [[counterfeiting]]. In 1770–1771 he and his brother John Alston were wanted by the law for counterfeiting activities in North Carolina and in 1773 in the colony of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott. 1957. "Counterfeiting in Colonial North Carolina." ''North Carolina Historical Review''. 34:467–482. http://www.ah.dcr.state.nc.us/sections/hp/colonial/Nchr/Subjects/Scott.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; As authorities were targeting counterfeiters in North Carolina, as well as the neighboring colonies of Virginia and South Carolina, the Alston brothers fled in 1772 or 1773 to Natchez, [[British West Florida]], on the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex C. Finley. 1876, Reprint c. 2000. ''The History of Russellville and Logan County, Ky.'' Reprint: Russellville, Ky.: A. B. Willhite. 18 (number from reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; This former French colonial city was located about 200 miles upriver from [[New Orleans]].

Upon arriving in the [[Natchez District]] of [[British West Florida]], in 1772 or 1773, Alston became "a [[prosperity|prosperous]] land [[speculator]] and wealthy [[Plantations in the American South|planter]], and, in 1776, possessed some of the finest [[palatial]] [[mansions]] in that gay city."&lt;ref name="Finley 18"&gt;Finley 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 22, 1781, under the overall leadership of John Blommart, Alston, his brother John, and other pro-British [[Loyalist]] settlers formed the "Natchez Volunteers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rlist/rlist.htm Natchez Volunteers - The On-Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with allied [[Choctaw]] Indians, they led an uprising in 1783 against [[Spanish West Florida|Spanish authorities]], who officially took possession of British territory in this area of North America that year, under the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Soon after they captured [[Fort Rosalie|Fort Panmure]], the rebels split into pro-American and pro-British factions.  Alston, his brother, and John Turner wanted to execute the Spanish garrison and raise the American flag. Led by Blommart and Thomas Hutchins, the other side won the argument and sent the garrison away. 

Meanwhile, Spanish forces defeated a British attack on [[Pensacola]], which had been intended to  relieve the settlers at Natchez. On June 23, 1783, Spanish soldiers retook Fort Panmure without firing a shot, capturing Blommart and John Alston. Other leaders had fled, Hutchins to the Carolinas and Philip Alston to the [[Cumberland Valley|Cumberland River]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], where he had already established a second home.&lt;ref&gt;Albert James Pickett. 1851.

On May 13, 1780, Philip Alston was a [[signature|signatory]], with other settlers, on the [[Cumberland Compact]], a forerunner of the [[Tennessee State Constitution]], at [[Fort Nashborough]], Virginia (now [[Nashville, Tennessee]]). This was the first governing document for settlers of the Cumberland Valley. Alston may have been living at [[Mansker's Station]], now [[Goodlettsville]], [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Will T.

==Tennessee, Kentucky, and Cave-In-Rock==
Around 1783 or, at least, by the summer of 1784, Alston moved northwest from Natchez. He settled in what is now [[Logan County, Kentucky]], in the western part of the state, where he built Alston's Station, or fort, near the [[Red River (Tennessee-Kentucky)|Red River]]. It was downstream of the mouth of the Big Whippoorwill. He farmed in the summer of 1784 and manufactured salt at Moate's Lick that autumn, assisted by old John Stuart. "He traded his salt for skins and then traded the skins off at Natchez or the Eastern States for goods, and he also, became the first merchant. Shortly afterwards, he and James Dromgoole did business together". In 1795, the settlers around Alston's Station included Jesse and William Green, Dromgoole (also spelled Drumgole), and Stuart and Matthew McClean.&lt;ref name="Finley 21–23, 25, 42"&gt;Finley 21–23, 25, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Finley, in his book ''The History of Russellville and Logan County, Ky'' (1876), described Alston and his activities: "He fled from Natchez to Kentucky and settled in Logan County, where he established a salt works and store at Moat's Lick. While running these he managed the Cedar House, a tavern near Russellville. He also farmed, preached, and taught school, and incidentally "flooded the country with spurious money." Thus he became, not only the first farmer, manufacturer, and exchange, but he established the first depot of exchange and the first bank, and also the first mint in western Kentucky."&lt;ref name="Finley 21–23, 25, 42"/&gt;

In 1786, Alston began counterfeiting again.&lt;ref name="Finley 42"&gt;Finley 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Alston and Drumgole celebrated Independence Day that year by stealing his former slave King, who had been sold by Spanish authorities from Alston's estate after he fled Natchez earlier in the decade. Spanish records from Natchez listed Alston as the "robber".

Alston got into trouble for counterfeiting in Logan County, Kentucky, and was banished.&lt;ref name="Finley 21–23, 25, 42"/&gt; In 1789, he moved to the area of Alston's Creek, in northern Logan County but, did not remain there long. Fearing for his safety, Alston moved around often over the next two years.  First, he went to Alston's Lick, now in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], and shortly thereafter, to [[Livingston County, Kentucky|Livingston County]] and finally, to [[Henderson County, Kentucky|Henderson County]], all in western [[Kentucky]]. In 1790 he crossed the [[Ohio River]] to the north into [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Finley 42"/&gt;

In 1790, Alston was at [[Cave-in-Rock State Park|Cave-in-Rock]], Illinois, then a part of [[Knox County, Indiana|Knox County]], [[Northwest Territory]], with Duff. Finley wrote that Alston became a "fast friend and disciple of the notorious counterfeiter, [[Sturdivant Gang|Sturdevant]]".&lt;ref&gt;Finley 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; But historian Otto A. Rothert said that Roswell or "Bloody Jack" Sturdivant did not arrive at Cave-in-Rock for at least another generation.&lt;ref&gt;Otto A. Rothert, ''The Outlaws of Cave-In-Rock''. Cleveland: Otto A. Rothert, 1924; reprint 1996, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Duff the Counterfeiter", considered notorious during the 1790s, is believed to be the same man who was associated with Alston. According to Finley, Alston soon moved back to Tennessee and from there to Natchez, picking up with former associates. 

==Natchez, Spanish West Florida, Mississippi Territory; New Madrid, Spanish Louisiana Territory, and Stack Island==
{{Main|Louisiana (New Spain)|Empresario|Yazoo land scandal}}

Alston was appointed as an [[empresario]] in [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], by the governor of the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana Territory]]. He was responsible for administering land grants and recruiting new settlers. He died there. &lt;ref&gt;Finley, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1790, Alston was working with James O'Fallon in the [[Yazoo land scandal]], which was intended to settle Americans in southern Mississippi, who would have been aligned with the Spanish. On September 16, 1790, O'Fallon had organized the Yazoo Battalion, a militia to secure the land. Both Alston and Drumgold (Drumgoole) were listed as captains, and John Alston, Philip's brother, was a lieutenant of infantry riflemen.&lt;ref&gt;Ginny Walker Bush, coordinator. 2000. "Yazoo Land Companies 1789." Mississippi state site. American Local History Network. http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ms/state/yazoolandfraud.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alston fades out of American records in the 1790s. On January 22, 1793, he sold goods to his son-in-law, John Gilbert in Logan County, Kentucky. He was recorded in county records on October 22, 1799, to prove another deed involving Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Finley 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhlenberg Co., Kentucky, Deed Book 1. 13. Transcribed at http://files.usgwarchives.net/ky/muhlenberg/court/g4160001.txt.&lt;/ref&gt; One account notes that Alston and his son, [[Peter Alston|Peter]] conducted their counterfeiting operation at [[Stack Island (Mississippi River)|Stack Island]], in the lower [[Mississippi River]] valley about 170 miles upriver from Natchez. This would have been around 1799, at the same time that river pirates were operating from there under the leadership of [[Samuel Mason]], who had been at Cave-in-Rock.&lt;ref&gt;T.

{{expert-subject|Mythology|date=December 2009}}
'''Pkharmat''' ({{lang-ce|Пхьармат, Pẋarmat}}, Creator of the nation, language or land) is a legendary hero of the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] people who brought fire to mankind and was chained to the [[Mount Kazbek]]. This allowed them to forge metal, cook and illuminate their houses. As a result of this, the people united and became a nation.&lt;ref name="ilyasov"&gt;Lecha Ilyasov. ''The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present.'' {{ISBN|978-5-904549-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pkharmat is the Vainakh equivalent of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] hero [[Prometheus]] and the [[Georgian mythology]] hero [[Amirani]], among others.

==Tale==
[[File:Jan Cossiers - Prometheus Carrying Fire.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Prometheus Carrying Fire by Jan Cossiers]]
Pkharmat was a [[demi-god]], or [[Nart]], who loved and pitied his people, for they had no fire. The fire was kept by the cruel god Sela in his realm &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tchetchenes.Mariel Tsaroïeva {{ISBN|2-7068-1792-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to show the Narts his strength and power and to suppress them. Sela, the god of the stars, thunder and lightning, drove his fire-chariot about the heavens and criss-crossed the Sky, making a terrible noise. With his bow he fired bolts of lightning down to earth.

Because they had no fire, Narts ate raw food and cold milk, and had no agriculture. For a long time the Narts led a miserable life. Sela knew it and was glad to see them so miserable as all the other gods were except Sela's wife ''Sata''. Sata cared for Narts, but she was afraid of her husband.

One day, there appeared a brave hero, Pkharmat. Pkharmat knew of the fire in hell ({{lang-ce|Жуьжг1ати, Djuejghati}}) on the top of [[Mount Kazbek|Mount Bashlam]], thought to be a [[volcano]]. One day he decided to steal it. He [[Cold working|forged without heat]] for his journey a coat, a sword and a shield out of [[Bronze]]. He mounted his horse ''Turpal'' and began his journey.

Sata took bird's form and alighted upon the mount's summit. She spoke to Pkharmat with a human voice: ''"O powerful Nart, you have not reached the summit of [[Mount Kazbek|Bashlam]] by chance. You have come to fetch Fire."'' Pkharmat answered ''"The people are in need of heat, of light. I shall only return to Earth to bring back Fire!"''. Having seen how strong the Nart and his horse were, Sata promised to help him in his quest for Fire. She advised him how to go about obtaining some, and warned him of the possible danger and of Sela's cruelty.

Pkharmat also received help from his older brother, who Pkharmat informed of his quest. He gave his dear younger brother the ''carz'', a reed-like plant with a soft-inner core, with a piece of coal in it. The coal was very much attracted to the fire, and it burned, and with its sparks boring into the ''carz'', eventually boring eight holes of different length. Finally, the ''carz'' had been made into the reedpipe, which could make music, formerly unknown to the Narts. It was eventually given to the Narts.

Pkharmat leaped over hell and seized a burning piece of wood. Sela was angered that a Nart acted against his will and tried to catch him. Because he was unable to reach him, he untied his skein in which he kept night. Pkharmat quickly lost his way in the darkness, but ''Sata'' came to help, guiding him in bird form. Sela saw Pkharmat escaping and untied two skeins in which he kept storm and terrible cold. Pkharmat overcome these difficulties and struggled to the great cave in all Narts were gathered together for protection from cold, storm and darkness. He gave them the fire and told ''"Here is Fire for you! Multiply and become a great tribe. Warm yourselves; illuminate your homes, the caves, the towers; cook, prepare food from now on. Rejoice!"''

After that Sela sent his servant cyclops ''Uja'' to punish the unfaithful Pkharmat. ''Uja'' chained Pkharmat to the peak of Mount Bashlam with chains of bronze. The falcon ''Ida'' comes to Pkharmat every morning. According to the will of Sela, it sits upon Pkharmat's knees and tears at his liver with his beak.&lt;ref name="chechhand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaimoukha|first=Amjad M.|title=The Chechens: a handbook|publisher=Routledge|date=2005-03-01|edition=1st|pages=111|isbn=978-0-415-32328-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=Deela-Malkh#v=onepage&amp;q=Deela-Malkh&amp;f=false|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helping Characters==

===Turpal===
''Turpal'' was a legendary horse capable of outrunning lightning, which always roamed free, grazing among seven mountains, and drinking sea-water. Pkharmat wanted Turpal as his horse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Not even Sela's lightning bolts allowed Pkharmat to catch Turpal, which forced him to untie his skeins. Another miracle of ''Turpal'''s miracles was leaping over burning hell on Bashlam's peak when Pkharmat took fire. ''Turpal'' means ''Hero'' in [[Nakh languages]] and is used as a male name.[[File:Kasbeghi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mount Bashlam]]

== Mount Bashlam ==
{{Main|Mount Kazbek}}

Bashlam is known to most of the world as Mount [[Kazbek]]. Nowadays frozen Mount Bashlam is the place on top of which Sela's burning hell was placed. Bashlam is a dormant [[stratovolcano]] and one of the chief [[mountain]]s of the [[Caucasus]] located in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Events occurring in the legend may be memories of the chaos reigned in those days. Bashlam is the Nakh name of the Mount Kazbek, translated as Molten Mount. Bashlam has always been a sacred site for the Nakh and home of the Akkhi and Nart-Orsxtoi [[Tukkhum]]s.

==Equivalents of Pkharmat in other traditions and their significance==

Pkharmat is usually identified as the Vainakh equivalent of similar figures in various other traditions (Greek, Armenian, Circassian, Abkhaz, Georgian, Ossete, Roman and so on).

===Comparisons===
There are notable differences between the different versions of the so-called "Prometheus".

====Nature of god opposed by hero====
In all versions, the "Prometheus" figure fights against a powerful god who has denied humanity fire. However, other characteristics of this god vary:

'''Greek version- Prometheus and Zeus'''
In the Greek version, the god Prometheus confronts is in fact the main head of the patriarchal pantheon, Zeus, who is almost always viewed in a positive light, as the loving All-Father, as the wise ruler of all, etc. The tale of Prometheus is one of the few instances where he is viewed negatively. Zeus guards the fire to keep humanity down, because he knows that once humanity has fire, it can make weapons, and progress, leading eventually to an ability to overthrow his rule. In some versions he also reasons that humanity is better off in ignorance and backwardness, without fire, often symbolized by its destructive nature contrasting its use for industry.

'''Greek version- Kronos and Ouranos'''
In another Greek tale, [[Ouranos]], Zeus' grandfather was originally the ruler of the universe. He ruled with an iron fist and had a paranoid fear of being overthrown, leading him to oppress his own children, the First Generation Titans (6 males-including [[Cronus|Kronos]], the youngest- and 6 females). This tale did not involve any stealing of fire, but, rather, the overthrow of Ouranos by Kronos (Uranus by Saturn in the highly similar Latin version) brought the knowledge of agriculture to humankind. For Greeks and other Indo-Europeans, agriculture did not require fire, so the tales of how humankind acquired them are separate.

'''Vainakh version'''
For the most part, the Vainakh version is extremely similar to the Greek version of Prometheus. However, rather than the head of the pantheon, as Zeus is, Sela is a major god, but he is not the head of the pantheon (which would be Dela). Like Zeus, Sela owns thunder and lightning and uses lightning as a weapon. However, he shares certain characteristics with the Greek [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]: he is the god of stars and the sky. Sela's personality also resembles that of Uranus.

====Nature of Pkharmat/hero====
The Pkharmat-character is variously a god, a demigod or a mortal.

====Gifts given to man and significance====
'''Vainakh Version'''
Humankind attains both fire and agriculture as a result of the conflict between Pkharmat and Sela. Humankind also attains its first instrument- the reedpipe - from the affair, and with it, music, which in Vainakh culture is considered very important and was thought to have mystical properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shamsali.org/taj/chechnat.html#ethic&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to fire, agriculture, the reedpipe, and music, the origin of coal (given to Pkharmat while inside the ''carz'') and how man obtains it is also explained.

'''Greek Version'''
Humankind is only given fire- with which it can make tools. This exemplifies the importance of the forge in Indo-European culture.

====Pkharmat-character's Punishment (or lack of)====

====People saved by Pkharmat-character====
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Relevance to the debate about the homeland of the Indo-European language family===
All the indigenous religious traditions with a figure equivalent to Pkharmat were practiced by [[peoples of the Caucasus]] and some Indo-European peoples (who sometimes resided in the Caucasus, as is the case with the [[Armenians]] and [[Ossetes]], but often didn't, as is the case with the Greeks, Latins, Celtic peoples, etc.). This seems to support the [[Urheimat hypothesis|hypothesis]] that the original homeland of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] lay to the immediate north of the Caucasus touching both the Black and Caspian Seas and possibly extending north along the Volga some length as well as somewhat west into Ukraine. This hypothesis is now the most widely accepted, rather than the hypotheses that the Indo-European languages originated in the Anatolian plains, in the Armenian highland, India, Balkans or the ancestral [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] homelands, or that they were a sprachbund. Comparison of the various versions of the stories also support that the original Indo-Europeans probably had more intense cultural exchange with the North Caucasus than the South Caucasus- the forms most close to the Indo-European versions of the tale are, in fact, the [[Circassians|Circassian]] version and the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] version. The Circassian and Abkhaz name for the hero is [[Batraz|Pataraz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circassianworld.com/colarusso_4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524131405/http://www.circassianworld.com/colarusso_4.html |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which shows very noticeable similarity to the Greek name Prometheus, which is similar to most other Indo-European versions; comparing these two, it is also possible to note Pkharmat's similarity. It is possible that Pataraz, Prometheus, Pkharmat and possibly others are all roots from the same original name.

'''Prarthana Samaj''', or "Prayer Society" in Sanskrit, was a movement for religious and social reform in Bombay based on earlier  [[reform movement]]s. Prarthana Samaj was founded by Atmaram Pandurang in 1867 when Kesab Chandra sen visited Maharashtra, with an aim to make people believe in one God and worship only one God. It became popular after [[Mahadev Govind Ranade]] joined. The main reformers were the intellectuals who advocated reforms of the social system of the Hindus.It was spread to south India by Telugu reformer,Viresalingam.

The movement was started as a movement for religious and social reform in Maharashtra and can be seen much more alike [[Brahmo Samaj]]{{fact|date=December 2016}}. The precursor of the Prarthana Samaj in Mumbai was the [[Paramahansa Mandali|Paramahamsa Sabha]], a secret society for the furtherance of liberal ideas by Ram Balkrishna Jaykar and others in Mumbai.  It was secret in order to avoid the wrath of the powerful and orthodox elements of

== Religious reforms ==
{{Hinduism}}
By comparison with the parallel [[Brahmo Samaj]] of [[Bengal]], and the ideals of [[rationalism|rational]] or [[theism|theistic]] belief and [[social reform]], the Prarthana Samaj(ists) were followers of the great religious tradition of the [[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[Sant Mat]] like [[Namdev]], [[Tukaram]]. The Brahmo Samaj founders examined many world religions, including ancient [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts, which subsequently were not accepted to be infallible or divine. Although the adherents of Prarthana Samaj were devoted [[theists]], they also did not regard the Vedas as divine or infallible.  They drew their nourishment from the Hindu scriptures and used the hymns of the old Marathi [[Sant Mat|"poet-saints"]] in their  prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121022220550/http://www.ibiblio.org/jainism/database/ARTICLE/rajendra.doc  B. N. Luniya, "Rajendra Suri: A Reformer and Revivalist".]&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideas trace back to the devotional poems of the [[Vitthala]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/vitt.html   Vitthalas (Varkari Panth), PHILTAR, St. Martin's College.]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Vaishnava]] [[bhakti]] [[devotional movements]] of the thirteenth century in southern Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/prarth.html  "Prarthana Samaj", PHILTAR, St. Martin's College.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Marathi poets had inspired a movement of resistance to the [[Mughals]]. But, beyond religious concerns, the primary focus of the Prarthana Samaj was on social and cultural reform.

== Social reforms ==

Prarthana Samaj critically examined the relations between contemporary social and cultural systems and religious beliefs and gave priority to social reform as compared with the political changes already initiated by the British government.  Their comprehensive reform movement has led many impressive projects of [[culture theory|cultural change]] and [[History of Maharashtra#Social reform movement|social reform in Western India]], such as the improvement of the lot of women and depressed classes, an end to the [[caste system]], abolition of child marriages and infanticide, educational opportunities for women, and remarriage of widows.  Its success was guided by [[Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar|Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar]], a noted Sanskrit scholar, Dr. Atmaram Pandurang, [[Narayan Chandavarkar]], and [[Mahadev Govind Ranade|Justice Mahadev Govinda Ranade]].  Ranade emphasized that "the reformer must attempt to deal with the whole man and not to carry out reform on one side only".

'''Regina "Rega" Ullmann''' (14 December 1884 – 6 January 1961) was a Swiss poet and writer.

== Life ==
Ullmann was the second daughter of a Jewish-Austrian embroidery businessman, Richard Ullmann, and his German wife Hedwig. She was born in the Swiss town of [[St. Gallen]], but in 1902, following her father's death in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;Katharina M Wilson, ''An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers'', vol. 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; she and her mother moved to [[Munich]], where she first read such influential poets such [[Ina Seidel]], [[Hans Carossa]], [[Ludwig Derleth]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. She began a correspondence with Rilke, who became a major supporter and mentor; the two met for the first time in 1912.

In January 1906, Ullmann gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, Gerta, in [[Vienna]]. The father was the economist [[Hanns Dorn]]. A second child, Camilla, followed in 1908 following a relationship with psychoanalyst [[Otto Gross]].&lt;ref&gt;David Holbrook, ''Where DH Lawrence was Wrong about Women'', 1992, {{ISBN|0838752071}}, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Ullmann left both children to grow up with foster parents, though she visited them regularly and oversaw their education.

Ullmann converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1911, after which her work was characterised by a more "pious" attention to what she perceived as the religious mystery inherent in everyday life.

Unmarried and without work, Ullmann suffered from severe depression, exacerbated by her mother's suicide by [[hanging]]. With her first collection of short stories, however – ''Die Landstraße'' – she gradually became better known. With Rilke's help, she acquired some financial support for her writing, first from her publisher and later from Swiss patrons and Catholic aid agencies.

The Nazis expelled her from the German Writers Association in 1935 because of her Jewish ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Flavorwire, [http://flavorwire.com/500575/the-forgotten-modernist-the-country-road-by-regina-ullmann "The Forgotten Novelist"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year she left Germany, moving to Austria where her mother died in 1938. Following the [[Anschluss]], she returned to [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], where she remained and worked for some twenty years, until shortly before her death. In the final months of her life, she returned to Germany and stayed in a nursing home under the care of her daughter Camilla. She died on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] 1961 in [[Ebersberg]].

'''Richard William Huckle''' (born 14 May 1986) is a convicted British serial [[sex offender]]. He was arrested by Britain's [[National Crime Agency]] after a tip-off from Australian Police and convicted of 71 counts of serious sexual assaults against children while posing as a teacher, photographer and devout [[Christian]] in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle filmed himself abusing children and shared videos and pictures with fellow paedophiles on the Dark Web.|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1705318/prolific-paedophile-raped-babies-and-toddlers|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckle has been described as one of Britain's worst ever [[paedophiles]], placing him alongside [[Robert Black (serial killer)|Robert Black]], [[Sidney Cooke]],  [[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)|Ian Watkins]] and [[Jimmy Savile]], despite being only 28 years old at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name=TelegraphBritainsWorst&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's worst paedophile Richard Huckle who targeted poverty-stricken children faces life in prison after admitting scores of offences|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/01/britains-worst-paedophile-who-targeted-poverty-stricken-children/|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2harecourtstatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2harecourt.com/2016/06/03/brian-oneill-qc-prosecutes-britains-worst-ever-paedophile/|title=Brian O’Neill QC prosecutes ‘Britain’s worst ever paedophile’- London Barristers Chambers|date=3 June 2016|website=2harecourt.com|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skynewsjune3prosecution&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile Huckle Blames Abuse On 'Immaturity'|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1706394/paedophile-huckle-blames-abuse-on-immaturity|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2016, he was given 22 life sentences with a minimum prison term of 25 years before being eligible to apply for parole.&lt;ref name=skynewsresultofsentencing /&gt;

== Early life ==
Huckle was born into a middle-class family in [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Kent]], on 14 May 1986. He was educated at [[the Harvey Grammar School]], [[Folkestone]], where he was described as "a bit of a loner, but nothing out of the ordinary" by friends. At the age of 16, he took part in a month-long expedition to visit a school in [[Namibia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huckle Tried To Cash In On Child Abuse Pics|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1705161/huckle-tried-to-cash-in-on-child-abuse-pics|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before leaving the Harvey Grammar School to study at the nearby [[South Kent College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grammar school boy who became Britain's worst paedophile|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3620004/Britain-s-worst-paedophile-Richard-Huckle-admits-scores-attack-children.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckle was a regular worshipper at Ashford Baptist Church, where he was described as a quiet man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle's church minister reveals all on paedophile|url=http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/Richard-Huckle-s-church-minister-reveals/story-29352228-detail/story.html|publisher=Folkestone Herald ([[KM Group]])|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of a church in [[London]], which he continued to attend up until the time of his re-arrest in January 2015.&lt;ref name=skynewsvideo&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle : Portrait of a paedophile|url=http://news.sky.com/video/1705530/huckle-portrait-of-a-paedophile|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time in Malaysia ==
After leaving education, Huckle spent a gap year in [[Malaysia]] from 2005 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle one of UK's worst ever paedophiles|url=http://www.dover-express.co.uk/Richard-Huckle-UK-s-worst-paedophiles/story-29348170-detail/story.html|publisher=Dover Express ([[KM Group]])|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned regularly, helping out at local churches and among local communities, before moving there permanently in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Huckle enrolled onto a short [[CELTA]] course with the [[British Council]]&lt;ref name=smith2008&gt;{{cite news|title=Statement on the Richard Huckle Case|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/organisation/press/british-council-statement-richard-huckle-case|publisher=[[British Council]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before starting work as a freelance photographer working in local communities around [[Kuala Lumpur]]. He also enrolled onto an IT course with a local university, hoping to further his career and status within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile who bragged about horrific sex crimes on 'dark web' facing life|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/paedophile-who-bragged-about-horrific-sex-crimes-on-dark-web-facing-life-34765029.html|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Malaysia, where all of the crimes he was convicted of occurred, and [[Cambodia]], which was also mentioned in the trial, Huckle travelled extensively around south-east Asia to countries including [[Singapore]], [[Laos]] and [[India]]. It has been revealed that, while in India, he persuaded a pastor to invite him to an orphanage in [[Bangalore]] to take photos and make videos with the children, posing as a teacher in order to gain trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Can I visit your orphanage to meet the children... and bring my camera?'

== Sexual offences ==

=== Initial arrest ===
On 19 December 2014, following an earlier tip-off from [[Task Force Argos]], a highly specialised branch of Australia's [[Queensland Police Service]] responsible for the investigation of on-line child exploitation and abuse, Huckle was arrested by officers from Britain's National Crime Agency at London's [[Gatwick Airport]] and questioned on suspicion of a number of serious offences against children.&lt;ref name=howhucklecaught&gt;{{cite news|title=How child abuser Richard Huckle was caught|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36437856|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially refused to answer officers' questions and was bailed under the condition that he stay at his parents' house, while his camera, laptop and [[hard drives]] were seized.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Background of arrest ===
Police officers from Task Force Argos had been aware of a network of paedophiles operating on a [[dark web]] network called The Love Zone (TLZ) for some time. They noticed one member who always made posts using the unusual greeting "hiyas" and had a distinctive freckle on one of his fingers.&lt;ref name=howhucklecaught /&gt; Officers explored the Internet and social media, and eventually found a [[Facebook]] page matching the profile of the individual they were looking for, including the greeting and freckle. The profile was fake but photos of a vehicle led police to Shannon McCoole, a care worker from Adelaide. A warrant was issued for the arrest of McCoole. Upon entering his house, police discovered that McCoole, who was subsequently sentenced to 35 years in prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Childcare worker who raped children in his care and filmed it for a global paedophile web ring says his urges were NOT his fault|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3465228/I-thought-passing-thing-Childcare-worker-raped-children-care-filmed-global-paedophile-web-ring-says-urges-NOT-fault-never-considered-caught.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was actually online and running his dark website at the time.&lt;ref name=howhucklecaught /&gt;

Police assumed the identity of McCoole and ran his site, which has since been closed down, in an unusual move in order to catch other paedophiles.  In running the site, police rescued 85 children from ongoing abuse and arrested hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/13/shining-a-light-on-the-dark-web-how-the-police-ended-up-running-a-paedophile-site|date = 13 July 2016|accessdate = 13 July 2016|title = The takeover: how police ended up running a paedophile site|last = Safi|first = M.|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One member that stuck out was Huckle, due to the number of children he had abused and the attitude of his posts. After discovering his real identity, and exploring the open Internet, they discovered that he was due to return to the United Kingdom shortly to spend Christmas with his family and then immediately alerted the National Crime Agency, who arrested him when he arrived in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How ‘Britain’s worst paedophile’ Richard Huckle was caught|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/02/how-britains-worst-paedophile-richard-huckle-was-caught-5920818/|publisher=[[Metro (British Newspaper)]]|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family confession and re-arrest===

{{BLP sources section|date=February 2018}}

Huckle had been granted bail under the conditions that he live at his parents' address whilst investigations were ongoing. Huckle had no criminal record and was in no positions of responsibility concerning minors. The police therefore after interviewing him released him temporarily, as it would take time to analyse and retrieve evidence from seized computer equipment. In his initial police interview, Huckle made [[no comment]] throughout. When out on bail, he was confronted by his parents about the allegations, to which he claimed his innocence. Huckle later admitted to the allegations, at which point his parents refused to allow him to remain in the house and he returned to police custody.&lt;ref name="kentonline" /&gt;

=== Remand and trial ===

After leaving his parents' house Huckle was re-arrested and charged with 91 counts including creation and possession of child pornography, rape of a child under the age of 12, [[digital penetration]], child abuse, and facilitating the commission of child sexual offences by creating a paedophile manual. He was denied bail by the police and remanded to court where his latest application for bail was also denied, Huckle was now in prison custody, initially at [[HMP Lewes]] before, due to the severity of the charges, being transferred to [[HMP Belmarsh]] in London to await trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile's Parents Begged Police To Take Him|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1705800/paedophiles-parents-begged-police-to-take-him|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an initial hearing at the [[Old Bailey]], in January 2016, Huckle pleaded not guilty to all 91 charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile's Parents Begged Police To Take Him|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-06-01/british-paedophile-who-abused-up-to-200-victims-set-to-spend-rest-of-life-behind-bars/|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took over an hour to read in court, and prosecutors started to prepare three separate trials as they did not believe a jury should be subjected to all of the graphic evidence that would be presented in a single trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prolific Paedophile Raped Babies And Toddlers|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1705318/prolific-paedophile-raped-babies-and-toddlers|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, during a preliminary trial hearing, Huckle pleaded guilty to 71 of the 91 charges he was facing after a particularly disturbing request to watch all of the evidence against him in court.&lt;ref name=TelegraphBritainsWorst /&gt; As a result of his confession, prosecutors decided not to pursue a prosecution against the remaining 20 charges, and asked that they lie on file, in order to spare a jury the horror of having to watch graphic images and videos of child abuse since the 71 charges which Huckle admitted to would be sufficient for a lengthy sentence.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

During the hearings, the full scale of Huckle's crimes became apparent for the first time. Prosecutors, led by Brian O'Neill QC,&lt;ref name=2harecourtstatement /&gt; showed evidence of a long line of horrific crimes that started during Huckle's gap year in 2006 and continued for eight to nine years until he was apprehended in 2014. They included rape of children under the age of 12, possession and distribution of child pornography, creation of child pornography, child abuse, creating a paedophile manual entitled "Paedophiles And Poverty: Child Lover Guide", digital penetration of a child under the age of 12, and raising money for his activities via a crowd-funding website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle: Paedophile faces multiple life sentences for abusing ‘up to 200 children’ in Malaysia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/richard-huckle-paedophile-faces-multiple-life-sentences-at-old-bailey-for-abusing-children-in-a7060306.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His victims ranged in age from 6 months to 12 years old; one was abused while wearing a [[Diaper|nappy]], and another was abused for a number of years between the ages of 5 and 12. Huckle belonged to a website called The Love Zone on the dark web, which is obscured from general discovery and only accessible by anonymised means. On the site, he shared photos of his crimes with other members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's worst paedophile faces 22 life sentences for abusing 200 children in Malaysia|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/richard-huckle-britains-worst-paedophile-faces-22-life-sentences-abusing-200-children-malaysia-1563195|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He boasted about his crimes to other paedophiles, posting such comments as "Hit the jackpot, a three-year-old girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care" and "impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle, 'Britain's worst pedophile', facing life in jail|url=http://www.9news.com.au/world/2016/06/02/13/55/richard-huckle-britains-worst-pedophile-facing-life-in-jail|publisher=[[Nine News]]|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, prosecutors unveiled 29 victims and over 20,000 photos, but believe there could be up to 200 victims all over [[Southeast Asia]] and thousands more photos in encrypted areas of Huckle's laptop, which authorities have so far been unable to access.&lt;ref name=guardianthrewout&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle's parents 'threw him out when he admitted child abuse'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/02/richard-huckle-parents-threw-him-out-court-told|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings revealed some of the stratagems Huckle employed to procure victims, such as taking children out on day trips from orphanages and escorting them home from their own birthday party. Huckle had even talked about marrying one of his young victims so that he could set up a foster home and abuse "a cycle of children" who would pass through his home and turn paedophilia into a full-time job.&lt;ref name=guardianthrewout /&gt; Huckle also created a ledger of his abuses and where he scored the scale of abuse each victim suffered.&lt;ref name="kentonline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile Richard Huckle facing life in jail|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/prolific-paedophile-96746/|publisher=Kent Online ([[KM Group]])|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this ledger that the estimated number of children abused, 200, was gained, although so far authorities have only discovered photographic evidence of the abuse of 29 children due to Huckle refusing to give officers the passwords for encrypted areas of his hard drives.

=== Extraterritorial jurisdiction ===
Huckle was prosecuted under Section 72 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], which allows British nationals to be tried and convicted in the United Kingdom for child sex crimes committed while overseas in an effort to prevent [[child sex tourism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/72|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]], a move welcomed by child protection charities.&lt;ref name=TelegraphBritainsWorst /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpat.org.uk/media/wake-call-needed-over-abuse-children-abroad-ecpat-uk-warns|title=Wake-up call needed over abuse of children abroad, ECPAT UK warns - ECPAT UK  - Protecting Children Everywhere|website=Ecpat.org.uk|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a rarely used section of the Act: while no official tally is kept, it is believed that Huckle is only the seventh person to be prosecuted under the measure, and that his crimes are the most serious to be prosecuted under it.&lt;ref name=skynewsvideo /&gt;&lt;ref name=sentencingnewsyoutube&gt;{{cite news|title=Sky news live broadcast after sentencing of Richard Huckle (uploaded to YouTube by a 3rd party)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08fsUs-GWig|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentencing ==
Huckle's sentencing hearing began at the Old Bailey on 1 June 2016 and lasted until 3 June 2016, with the sentence itself being passed on 6 June 2016. At the start of the hearing, the judge stated that Huckle should expect to go to prison for a very long time, as he was considering multiple life sentences due to the gravity of the offences committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paedophile Richard Huckle, Who Targeted Poor Malaysian Children, Faces Life In Prison|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/paedophile-richard-huckle-targeted-poor-malaysian-children-faces-life-in-prison_uk_574f35a9e4b040e3e818ea49|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sentencing hearing, Huckle's lawyer, Philip Sapsford QC, read a statement from Huckle where he blamed his crimes on his immaturity:&lt;ref name=skynewsjune3prosecution /&gt;

{{quote|I really understand and acknowledge the true scale of damage it caused to the Malaysian community. I had hoped to escape this mundane life of solitude in the UK yet was overwhelmed by the attention I received in Malaysia. I completely misjudged the affections I received from these children. My low self-esteem and lack of confidence with women was no excuse for me to use these children as an outlet. I am open and eager to rehabilitate from this offending behaviour. I don't want to become a martyr to sex tourism in Malaysia. This was all my doing as a consequence of my immaturity and I'm truly remorseful.|author=Richard Huckle|source=A statement read on his behalf by his defence team.&lt;ref name=skynewsjune3prosecution /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle 'deeply remorseful' for child sex abuse, court told|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/03/richard-huckle-deeply-remorseful-for-child-abuse-crimes-court-told|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Sapsford continued by asking the judge to take into consideration his client's young age, his claims of remorse, and the fact that he has no previous convictions. He also quoted from a psychiatric report that said Huckle had limited sexual experience with women and suffered depression as a teenager. He also stated that, despite the mitigating circumstances, this is the most extensive case of child sex crimes that he has ever been involved in.&lt;ref name=skynewsjune3prosecution /&gt;

It was also noted during the hearing, in a statement made by the prosecution, how convictions were only sought against crimes for which there was complete photographic evidence. It was noted how Huckle's ledger contained details of 200 children that had been abused but that they have been unable to access certain encrypted sections of his hard drive in order to obtain evidence.&lt;ref name=skynewsjune3prosecution /&gt;

At the Old Bailey on 6 June 2016, Judge Peter Rook QC sentenced Huckle to life imprisonment on 22 counts with a minimum prison term of 25 years before being eligible to apply for parole.&lt;ref name=sentencingnewsyoutube /&gt; He will be first eligible for parole in 2041, assuming good behaviour and a belief by the [[Parole Board for England and Wales]] that he no longer poses a risk to children or the public at that time. However, he could be first eligible for parole in 2040 if time served on remand while awaiting trial is taken into account. Before passing down the sentence, the judge stated that Huckle carried out a campaign of rape and was driven by his own sexual gratification:&lt;ref name=skynewsresultofsentencing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Huckle given 22 life sentences for abusing Malaysian children|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/06/richard-huckle-given-23-life-sentences-for-abusing-malaysian-children|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You have pleaded guilty to as many as 71 sexual offences. It is very rare indeed that a judge has to sentence sexual offending by one person on such a scale as this. In my view, you may well harbour feelings of regret but there is no feeling of genuine remorse in this case.|author=Judge Peter Rook QC|source=6 June 2016}}
Huckle stood in prayer as he was sentenced. As he was sent down, a woman in the public gallery shouted, "1,000 deaths is too good for you".&lt;ref name=skynewsresultofsentencing /&gt;

== Aftermath and criticism ==
The National Crime Agency received criticism from the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian Government]], as well as a number of child protection charities in Malaysia, for their handling of the case. Officers from the NCA travelled to Malaysia to engage local charities, who performed child protection workshops in the community where Huckle lived, but they were kept in the dark about the gravity of his crimes. The Malaysian Government stated that they would like further details of the victims so they can offer counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women’s ministry to probe Huckle case, sets up info hotline|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/womens-ministry-to-probe-huckle-case-sets-up-info-hotline|publisher=[[Malay Mail]]|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2016, the [[Attorney General of Malaysia]], Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, stated that he was in the process of contacting his counterpart in the UK, and the British High Commissioner in [[Kuala Lumpur]], in order to obtain information about the case, which would help his investigation into the crimes and his efforts to help Huckle's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In bid for information, AG to contact British counterpart on Richard Huckle|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/in-bid-for-information-ag-to-contact-british-counterpart-on-richard-huckle|publisher=[[Malay Mail]]|date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Crime Agency responded to the comments from the Malaysian authorities, stating that they revealed enough details to be able to help the charities but were unable to provide full details until the prosecution was completed. For the same reason, severe media restrictions were put in place, which prevented anybody from reporting the story until the British Government had taken steps to ensure that all of Huckle's material had been taken down and that steps had been taken to protect his victims from other predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK paedophile admits string of sex attacks on Malaysian children|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/uk-paedophile-admits-string-of-sex-attacks-on-malaysian-children/news-story/85d11fecb09522879f41f15c210875b2|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2016, however, the National Crime Agency referred itself to the police watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]], due to the fact that they were aware of Huckle's continued attendance at two churches in the UK up until the time of his re-arrest in January 2015 but did not contact them until sentencing had already begun. The IPCC will look into whether the NCA had acted appropriately and whether more could have been done to determine whether Huckle abused any children in the UK through his relationship with the churches.&lt;ref name=sentencingnewsyoutube /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's worst paedophile Richard Huckle jailed for life for abusing up to 200 children in Malaysia|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-worst-paedophile-richard-huckle-8122982|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}

The British Council issued a statement saying that they had reviewed their dealings with Huckle:

{{quote|Richard Huckle completed a Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (CELTA) course in 2008 which provides training to individuals to teach adult learners. Following the course, we have no records to indicate he was ever engaged as a teacher in Malaysia with us, either for adult students or children.|author=British Council Press Office|source=a statement issued 1 June 2016&lt;ref name=smith2008 /&gt;}}

They also stated that procedures would be reviewed, but that pre-employment checks are the responsibility of future employers not their education provider.&lt;ref name=smith2008 /&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}

After the gravity of Huckle's crimes became known, the Malaysian Government set up a telephone hotline for people to call if they have any information about Huckle or if they were abused themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotline set up for info on British paedophile Richard Huckle|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/06/02/hotline-set-up-for-info-on-british-paedophile-richard-huckle/|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]], [[Najib Razak]], added that he was angered and saddened by Huckle's sexual violation of Malaysian children and called for all parties involved to ensure that children are not exposed to situations where irresponsible people can take advantage of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Najib: Heed lessons from Richard Huckle case|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/06/08/najib-heed-lessons-from-richard-huckle-case/|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, in response to the criticism following the Huckle case, Najib Razak announced that a special task force had been set up to investigate how Malaysia's child protection laws could be redrafted to take into account the new ways that child sexual predators such as Huckle were preying on Malaysian children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PMO sets up task force to review child protection laws|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/pmo-sets-up-task-force-to-review-child-protection-laws|publisher=[[Malay Mail]]|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of having a new version ready by the end of the year.{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}

Following the discovery of Huckle's crimes, the Malaysian Government came under fire from child protection charities for their lack of laws against child abuse and child pornography. James Nayagam, chairman of Suriana Welfare Society for Children, was particularly critical of his government's relaxed nature in dealing with such crimes:&lt;ref name=starmalaysiacriticism&gt;{{cite news|title=Have laws on child porn or another Richard Huckle|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/06/03/have-laws-on-child-pornography-or-another-richard-huckle/|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Malaysia should make child pornography and child sexual abuse a severe crime with heavy penalties. We should also issue a severe warning at the point of entering the country about our strong stance. Huckle got away with it. He knew the relaxed atmosphere in this country. We Asians fall head over heels with foreigners. He had people fall into his trap. But regardless of where people come from, we must have that check and balance.|author=James Nayagam|source=A newspaper article &lt;ref name=starmalaysiacriticism /&gt;}}

In the article, Nayagam continued by pointing out that Section 292 of the Penal Code only deals with sale and distribution of obscene material.&lt;ref name=starmalaysiacriticism /&gt;

While the media in the UK were largely supportive of Huckle's sentencing, the Malaysian press widely stated that the punishment was not severe enough, with statements such as "a thousand years is not enough", "We are horrified that the sex fiend [Huckle] will be eligible to appear before a parole board after 23 years", and "this monster could be out in 24 years" appearing in the days after his sentence was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysians say harsher sentence needed for Britain's 'worst paedophile' Richard Huckle|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/07/malaysians-say-harsher-sentence-needed-for-britains-worst-paedop/ |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘1,000 years not enough’ for jailed pedophile Richard Huckle – Malaysian media|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/345669-huckle-prison-malaysia-abuse/|publisher=[[RT (TV Network)]]|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">'''Rural Solidarity''' (full name ''Independent Self-governing Trade Union of Individual Farmers "Solidarity"'') is a trade union of [[Poland|Polish]] farmers, established in late 1980 as part of the growing [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Its legalization became possible on February 19, 1981, when officials of the government of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] signed the so-called ''[[Rzeszów]] - [[Ustrzyki Dolne]] Agreement'' with striking farmers. Previously, Communist government had refused farmers’ right to self-organize, which caused widespread strikes, with the biggest wave taking place in January 1981. The Rural Solidarity was officially recognized on May 12, 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id111.htm The Eighties Club. The Politics and Pop Culture of the 1980s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=516700 NBC Evening News for Tuesday, May 12, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; and, strongly backed by the Catholic Church of Poland, it claimed to represent at least half of Poland's 3.2 million smallholders.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ro-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=rural+solidarity#PPA371,M1 R.J. Crampton, Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century, page 372]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
After World War II, Poland became a [[Communism|communist]] country, a satellite of the Soviet Union. Since [[collective farming]] is a key component of communist notion of agriculture, in June 1948, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] decided to begin the process. From the very beginning, compulsory collectivization faced strong resistance of Polish farmers, who did not want to give up their land. Despite using different methods of persuasion, the progress was slow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_raT7Fst6zkC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Collectivization+Poland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fxTXJkftfE&amp;sig=xubbODdSTc7bZeePqahuSSn36Go&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WD12SfvZGqSoNaf9sYYH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Agrarian Policies in Communist Europe, page 63]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, only 1% of arable land was collectivized, with some 23 000 farmers working there.  Altogether, in that year there were some 2200 collective farms. Most of them were located in western and northern Poland, in the [[Recovered Territories]], where population consisted of people resettled from [[Kresy|former eastern borderlands of Poland]]. 

After the [[Polish October]], [[Władysław Gomułka]] officially declared that private farms were part of the so-called "Polish road to Socialism" and the government gradually changed its stance. In the late 1950s, number of collective farms fell to 1 800, and Poland was the only country of the [[Soviet Bloc]] which tolerated private ownership of the arable land. In 1958, Moscow ordered the resumption of collectivization, but unlike her neighbors, Poland refused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dK44ciNfx6MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA156&amp;lpg=RA1-PA156&amp;dq=Collectivization+Poland&amp;source=web&amp;ots=49fg1zIBk6&amp;sig=Z2mCc9UVNcpbRb8OcC5yCBdFYVw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzx2SabUBJy6MpjigBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result Ivan T. Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, page 156]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960, collectivization in Poland was ended, never to be resumed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QDgaX6q9tycC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Collectivization+Poland&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BBE67F2k1N&amp;sig=N9BBAPi1on6dm9qs8CwThS_-OCE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5j12SZbWHJjeM5i-oBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result The history of Poland, page 139]&lt;/ref&gt; and Engels' opinion that peasants would spontaneously create collective forms of agricultural production because of the threat of the big landed estates was not confirmed in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119855962/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Sociologia Ruralis, volume 22, Issue 3-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation of individual agriculture was a key factor in future events. Nevertheless, forced collectivization of farmland had disastrous consequences, as Poland, traditionally a grain exporter, had to import food, including grain, to prevent famine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/poland194869.html History of Poland, People's Republic, 1948-1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the Rural Solidarity ==
In August 1980, workers of the [[Vladimir Lenin]] [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] began a strike, which resulted in creation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (see: [[History of Solidarity]]). After this event, a group of farmers, gathered in the Farmers Self-Defence Committees decided to set up their own, parallel union called Rural Solidarity.&lt;ref name="UER87BmsC p8"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=93eUER87BmsC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Rural+Solidarity+1981&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aE_faKVvp8&amp;sig=0UDsI8BQ3iBuNzbiIjXOrAhKSH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uj52ScLlB4z-Mt26hBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result US Intelligence and the Confrontation in Poland, page 92]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, other similar farmers organizations emerged, such as Peasants Solidarity and Union of Agricultural Producers Solidarity. Their objectives were:

On September 24, 1980, representatives of Polish individual farmers submitted documents to the Warsaw Provincial Court for registration as Rural Solidarity. However, after one month, at the end of October, the court ruled that private farmers were self-employed and as such, were not entitled to organize their own labor union. The disappointed farmers turned to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="UER87BmsC p8"/&gt;

On November 30,  Deputy Minister of Agriculture [[Andrzej Kacala]] met with a group of 30 representatives of farmers' unions founding committees from the [[Warsaw]], [[Lublin]], [[Siedlce]], [[Skierniewice]], and [[Wałbrzych]] Voivodeships, as well as from the [[Września]]&amp;ndash;[[Konin]], [[Golub-Dobrzyń]]&amp;ndash;[[Kujawy]], and the [[Holy Cross Mountains]] regions. The representatives informally called themselves Rural Solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-2-143.shtml Poland: A Chronology of Events November 1980 - February 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by [[Lech Wałęsa]] and the factory workers, the farmers organized on December 14, 1980, the founding congress of Rural Solidarity in Warsaw. It was attended by 1000 delegates, who represented around 600 000 private farmers. Among their demands, there was a call for formal registration of their independent union. However, on December 30, 1980, the Supreme Court announced that its ruling on Rural Solidarity had been postponed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aFSwrUcuDWsC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Rural+Solidarity+Supreme+Court+1981&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ovYFO9zZco&amp;sig=irvkfE_9TG64vSysc39yVUlHMZI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pER2SfnjIYzaNKyq8Rs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine, page 172]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, tensions rose rise between the peasants and local governments across the country.

== Creation of the organization ==
Southeastern part of Poland was the area in which individual farmers were very numerous and where position of the Roman Catholic Church was the strongest. Therefore, in early 1981, main center of farmers’ protests was established in the city of [[Rzeszów]], where the strike and the sit-in began on January 5, 1981 and where the center of the movement was established.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; As [[Time magazine]] reported on Monday, February 2, 1981, members of Solidarity and Rural Solidarity occupied "Headquarters of the old official trade union" (in fact, it was The House of the Railroad Worker&lt;ref name="bankier.pl"&gt;[http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/25-rocznica-podpisania-Porozumien-Rzeszowsko-Ustrzyckich-1402074.html 25th Anniversary of the Rzeszow - Ustrzyki Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;), where they placed a sign which said: "SOLIDARITY IS MORE THAN JUST A NAME". The united front of both organizations demanded negotiations toward legitimizing the farmers' union.&lt;ref name="TIME, Monday, February 02, 1981"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920969,00.html, TIME, Monday, February 02, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other centers of farmers protests were also located in southeastern Poland, in the towns of [[Ustrzyki Dolne]] and [[Nowy Sącz]], but Solidarity members had been evicted from occupied buildings there. It must be noticed that the Solidarity trade union, and its leaders, such as [[Lech Wałęsa]], fully supported demands of it the peasants. As one Solidarity official said, "We got in touch with our people in all of the major factories around here and let them know that if the police interfered here there would be a general strike without further notice".&lt;ref name="TIME, Monday, February 02, 1981"/&gt;

== Rzeszów-Ustrzyki Agreement ==
At the beginning of 1981, peasants striking in Rzeszów joined forces with their comrades from [[Ustrzyki Dolne]], who had been on strike since December 28, 1980, occupying the local government office. The strike in Ustrzyki became known across the country. In different locations in Poland, several strikes broke out (including a hunger strike in [[Świdnica]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/history/research/cee_pdfs/WP17v3.pdf Ewa Nalewajko, Political Parties and Agriculture in Poland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524022518/http://www.liv.ac.uk/history/research/cee_pdfs/WP17v3.pdf |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and on February 18, 1981, negotiations began. The peasants were helped by such personalities, as [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Andrzej Gwiazda]], [[Andrzej Stelmachowski]] and [[Jadwiga Staniszkis]].&lt;ref name="bankier.pl"/&gt; Also, among supporters of the peasants, was Primate [[Stefan Wyszyński]], who on February 6, 1981, confirmed "the right of the farmers to found freely their own associations".&lt;ref name="AgKmojv_uoEC page 141"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgKmojv_uoEC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Rzeszow+-+Ustrzyki+Agreement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dVG7scj6UZ&amp;sig=TROHE2cocdEhFO6n9eikZTIjRVU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qXd_SdriKozQMfPOscAG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result The Polish Revolution By Timothy Garton Ash, page 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rzeszów-Ustrzyki Agreement was signed in the night of February 18/19 (in Ustrzyki) and February 20 (in Rzeszów). The government, represented by Minister of Agriculture [[Andrzej Kacala]], did not give permission to creation of a free trade union of the peasants, but legal protection of inheritance of land was confirmed. Other concessions included permission to construct more churches in the countryside and promise of equal treatment of individual farmers. Another concession won by the farmers was the government's promise to reduce its "pleasure lands" and reduce the number of facilities selling alcohol.&lt;ref name="AgKmojv_uoEC page 141"/&gt; Nevertheless, the state refused to register the organization, stating that the farmers were not wage earners and therefore could not be unonized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OVtKS9DCN0kC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=rural+solidarity] [[A Force More Powerful]] By [[Peter Ackerman]], [[Jack DuVall]], page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agreement was signed by Minister Kacala, who represented the Government, and [[Jozef Slisz]], [[Jan Kulaj]], [[Antoni Kopaczewski]], [[Bogdan Lis]] and [[Lech Wałęsa]]. Due to its significance, it is sometimes called the "Constitution of the Polish Countryside".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacjakos.pl/projekty/wywiady/nowacki_wienczyslaw.pdf Last victims of Stalinism in Poland, interview with Wieńczysław Nowacki]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legalization of Rural Solidarity ==
However, Rural Solidarity was not legalized until May 12, 1981, after another farmers strike, this time in [[Bydgoszcz]], where it [[Bydgoszcz events|resulted in a major incident]], which sparked off the [[1981 warning strike in Poland]]. Its first leader became [[Jan Kulaj]], and the union was banned on December 13, 1981 (see: [[Martial Law in Poland]]). Among those who supported restoration of the Rural Solidarity, was Pope [[John Paul II]], who called for it during his 1987 visit to Poland, saying: "A Pope cannot remain quiet about this even if he were not a Pole".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED6113AF932A25755C0A961948260&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss RESTORE RURAL SOLIDARITY, POPE SAYS]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rural Solidarity returned in 1989 (see: [[Polish Round Table Agreement]]), and has existed since then. Among its leaders, there are [[Gabriel Janowski]], [[Artur Balazs]], [[Roman Bartoszcze]], and [[Roman Wierzbicki]].

Ryukyuans are not a recognized [[minority group]] in Japan, as Japanese authorities consider them just a subgroup of the [[Japanese people]], akin to the [[Yamato people]] and [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest [[Ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. There is also a considerable [[Ryukyuan diaspora]]. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; mostly in [[Hawaii]]{{sfn|Noguchi|2001|p=69}} and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable [[Japanese diaspora]]. In the majority of countries, the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable [[statistics]] for the former.

Recent genetic and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the [[Ainu people]] and share the ancestry with the indigenous prehistoric [[Jōmon period]] (pre 10,000–1,000 BCE) people, who arrived from [[Southeast Asia]], and with the Yamato people who are mostly an admixture of the [[Yayoi period]] (1,000 BCE–300 CE) migrants from [[East Asia]] (specifically [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).&lt;ref name="YukaSuzuki"/&gt;{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=65}}{{sfn|Serafim|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html|title=日本人はるかな旅展|access-date=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421054014/http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-14.html|archivedate=2015-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trussel.com/prehist/news111.htm|title=Yayoi linked to Yangtze area|website=www.trussel.com|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Ann.

The population lived on the islands in isolation for many centuries, and in the 14th century from the three divided [[Sanzan period|Okinawan political polities]] emerged the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] (1429–1879) which continued the [[maritime trade]] and [[Tribute|tributary]] relations started in 1372 with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasty [[China]].&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt; In 1609 the kingdom was invaded by [[Satsuma Domain]] which allowed its independence being in [[Vassal state|vassal]] status because the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] Japan was [[Haijin|prohibited]] to trade with China, being in dual subordinate status between both China and Japan.{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1–2}}

During the [[Meiji period]], the kingdom became [[Ryukyu Domain]] (1872–1879), after which it was politically [[Annexation|annexed]] by the [[Empire of Japan]].

==Etymology==
Their usual ethnic name derives from the Chinese name for the islands, "[[Liuqiu]]" (also spelled as Loo Choo, Lew Chew, Luchu, and more&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt;), which in the [[Japanese language]] is pronounced "Ryukyu". The indigenous term for the island of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] is ''Uchinaa'', the people ''Uchinaanchu'', and their language ''Uchinaaguchi''. These terms are rarely used, and are politicized markers of a distinct culture.{{sfn|Obermiller|2006|p=17, 119}}{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Origins==
According to the recent genetic studies, the Ryukyuan people share more [[alleles]] with the [[Jōmon period]] (16,000–3,000 years ago) [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[Ainu people]] than the [[Yamato people|Yamato Japanese]], have smaller genetic contributions from Asian continental populations, which supports the dual-structure model of K.

According to archaeological evidence, there's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the Northern Ryukyu Islands ([[Amami Islands]] and [[Okinawa Islands]]) and the Southern Ryukyu Islands ([[Miyako Islands]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]]). The genome-wide differentiation was pronounced, especially between Okinawa and Miyako.

The research on the contemporary Okinawan male Y chromosome showed, in 2006; 55.6% of haplogroup [[Haplogroup D-M55|D-P37.1]], 22.2% [[Haplogroup O-P31|O-P31]], 15.6% [[Haplogroup O-M122|O-M122]], 4.4% [[Haplogroup C-M8|C-M8]], and 2.2% others.&lt;ref name="Hammer2006"/&gt; It is considered that the Y haplogroups expanded in a [[demic diffusion]].

The haplogroup O began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago, and thus the haplogroups D1b and C1 belong to the Jomon's male lineage, and haplogroup O belongs to the Yayoi's male lineage. Haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M12]] is considered as mitochondrial counterpart of Y chromosome D lineage. This rare haplogroup was detected only in Yamato Japanese, Koreans, and Tibetans, with the highest frequency and diversity in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Hammer2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OverviewSato2014"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Ryukyu Islands}}

===Early history===
{{Main|Jōmon period||}}
The Ryukyu Islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=37}} but their fate and relation with contemporary Ryukyuan people is uncertain.{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=27}} During the [[Jōmon period]] (i.e., Kaizuka) or so-called [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Okinawa Midden Culture|shell midden period]] (6,700-1,000 [[Before Present|YBP]]) of the Northern Ryukyus,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=27}} the population lived in a hunter-gatherer society, with similar mainland [[Jōmon pottery]].&lt;ref name="TakeshiroSato2014"/&gt; In the latter part of Jōmon period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishery.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} It is considered that from the latter half of Jōmon period, the Ryukyu Islands developed their own culture.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} Some scholars consider that the language and cultural influence was more far-reaching than blending of race and physical types.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The Yayoi culture, traditionally dated from 3rd century BCE and recently from around 1000 BCE,{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=26}} is notable for the introduction of Yayoi-type pottery, metal tools and cultivation of rice, however although some [[Yayoi pottery]] and tools were excavated on the Okinawa Islands, the rice was not cultivated before the 12th century CE, nor the Yayoi and the following [[Kofun period]] (250–538 CE) culture expanded into the Ryukyus.{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=27}} The Southern Ryukyus culture was isolated from the Northern, and its Shimotabaru period (4,500–3,000 YBP) was characterized by a specific style of pottery, and the Aceramic period (2,500–800 YBP), during which no pottery was produced in this region.{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=27}}&lt;ref name="TakeshiroSato2014"/&gt; Their prehistoric [[Yaeyama Islands|Yaeyama]] culture showed some intermingled affinities with southern Indonesian and Melanesian cultures, broadly, that the [[Sakishima Islands]] have some traces similar to the Southeast Asian and South Pacific cultures. The [[Amami Islands]] seem to be the islands with the most mainland Japanese influence.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} However, both north and south Ryukyus were culturally unified in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="TakeshiroSato2014"/&gt;

The finding of ancient Chinese [[knife money]] near [[Naha]] in Okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient Chinese state [[Yan (state)|Yan]] as early as the 3rd century BCE. According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shan Hai Jing]]'', the Yan had relations with the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] (dwarf, short) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuan people.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The futile search for the elixir of immortality by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the founder of [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC–206 BC), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with "happy immortals" who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} There's lack of evidence that the missions by [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) reached the islands, however as the Japanese did reach Han's [[Luoyang|capital]], notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of "hundred kingdoms" in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan's women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and [[Atayal people]] in Taiwan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} [[Cao Wei]] (220–265) and Han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE - they were of small stature, bred [[oxen]] and [[swine]], as well were ruled by women, with special influence of women sorceresses, which is related to the Ryukyuan [[Noro (priestess)|Noro]] priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient [[Matriarchy|matriarchal system]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

The first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the "Land of Happy Immortals". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named [[Liuqiu]], would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat [[Ono no Imoko]] arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of [[Yakushima|Yaku]] south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the "Southern Islands people", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and [[Tanu Province|Tanu]]. According to ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the [[Tanegashima|Tane-jima]], Yakushima, [[Amami Islands|Amami]], [[Tokunoshima]] and other islands.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} ''Nihongi'' recorded that the [[Hayato people]] in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and [[Tokara Islands|Tokara]], in 714 Shingaki and [[Kume Island|Kume]], in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

===Gusuku period===
[[Image:Nakijinjyousi2.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[gusuku]]'' fortification are on the [[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]] UNESCO's list.]]

The lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the "[[divine right of kings|divine right]]" of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa ''shōguns'' from [[Minamoto clan]] who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Tenson Dynasty|Tenson Dynasty]] was a descendant of goddess [[Amamikyu]], and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by [[Shunten]] (1187 – 1237), lord of [[Urasoe Castle|Urasoe]]. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (''[[Aji (Ryukyu)|anji]]'') daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered [[Minamoto no Tametomo]], while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated [[Taira clan]] who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Shunten Dynasty|Shunten Dynasty]] made two additional chieftains, [[Shunbajunki]] (1237-1248) and [[Gihon (Ryukyu)|Gihon]] (1248–1259). As Gihon abdicated, his [[sessei]] [[Eiso (Ryukyu)|Eiso]] (1260–1299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Eiso Dynasty|Eiso Dynasty]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

During the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku period|Gusuku period]] (c. 1187–1314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE,{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Robbeets|2015|p=28}} Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many ''[[gusuku]]'', castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}} This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, [[millet]] and the overseas trading of these goods,{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=38}}&lt;ref name="Hammer2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinoda2013"/&gt; as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese [[kana]] writing system in its older and simple phonetic form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami Oshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of [[Buddhism]] into Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

===Sanzan period===
{{Main|Sanzan period|Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China}}
[[Image:Ryukyu Kingdoms of Sanzan era.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Okinawa Island]], showing the [[Sanzan period]] polities.]]
During the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, [[Tamagusuku]] (1314–1336), Okinawa became divided into three [[polities]] and began the so-called [[Sanzan period]] (1314–1429). The north and largest [[Hokuzan]] polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central [[Chūzan]] polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle [[town]]s and harbor facilities. The south [[Nanzan]] polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

In this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the [[Satto]]'s reign, Chūzan made [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary relations]] with China's [[Ming dynasty]] in 1374 as the [Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Chūzan made nine [[Ryukyuan missions to Imperial China|official missions]] to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see [[Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong [[autonomy]].{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=939}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1}} In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive [[Ryukyuan missions to Joseon|missions]] to the Korean [[Joseon]] kingdom. In 1403, Chūzan made formal relations with the Japanese [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and an [[embassy]] was sent to [[Thailand]] in 1409.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like [[Palembang]] in 1428, [[Java]] in 1430, [[Malacca]] and [[Sumatra]] in 1463.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}}

As in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy ([[Haijin]]) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as [[intermediary]] in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, [[sulphur]] and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood ([[sappanwood]]), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to [[Hakata Bay]] from where swords, silver and gold were brought.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=28}}

In 1392, 36 Chinese families from [[Fujian]] were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Chūzan) to settle near the port of [[Naha]] and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=39}} Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&amp;q=ryukyu%20asked%20for%20thirty%20six%20families%20fujian&amp;f=false|title=The eunuchs in the Ming dynasty|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|location=|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|page=145|accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga-5mPOr2-wC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The East Asian maritime world 1400-1800: its fabrics of power and dynamics of exchanges|author=Angela Schottenhammer|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-447-05474-4|page=xiii|accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddcV_cGegX4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=ryukyu+asked+for+thirty+six+families+fujian#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Maritime sector, institutions, and sea power of premodern China|author=Gang Deng|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|isbn=978-0-313-30712-6|page=125|accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. [[Guozijian]].{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=41}} The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

===Ryukyu Kingdom===
{{Main|Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan missions to Edo}}
[[File:Naha Shuri Castle50s3s4500.jpg|thumb|right|The castle town and [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]'s capital [[Shuri Castle]].]]

Between 1416 and 1429, Chūzan chieftain [[Shō Hashi]] successfully unified the principalities into the [[Ryukyuan Kingdom]] (1429–1879) with the [[castle town]] [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] as royal capital, founded the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Shō Dynasty|First Shō Dynasty]], and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="MasamiIto2009"/&gt; The period of [[Shō Shin]]'s (1477–1526) rule, descendant from the [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#The First Shō Dynasty|Second Shō Dynasty]], is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to [[Kikaijima]], [[Miyako-jima]] and [[Yaeyama Islands]] (1465–1524),{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=115}} while during [[Shō Sei]] (1526-1555) to [[Amami Ōshima]] (1537).{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=42}}

After the [[Kyūshū Campaign]] (1586–1587) by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], his assistant [[Kamei Korenori]], who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper [[Hand fan|fan]] found during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] mentioning a title "Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had not any legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the [[Shimazu clan]] stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=151–152}} As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43}}&lt;ref name="MasamiIto2009"/&gt;

In the early 17th century during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1867), the first ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the ''shōgun'', the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma feudal domain]] of the Shimazu clan in [[Kyūshū]] incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu]]. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu's territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=43–45}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=3}} Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the "Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands" or "Southern Islands", although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands. Later in the 1870s this was used as a "justification" of Japan's sovereignty.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} From 1609 the [[Ryukyuan missions to Edo]] started which lasted until 1850.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=45}}

During the rule of kings [[Shō Shitsu]] (1648–1668) and [[Shō Tei]] (1669–1709) i.e. [[sessei]] [[Shō Shōken]] (1666–1673) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation, and affairs like sugarcane production, and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production. The production was encouraged because Satsuma's annual tax deprived Ryukyu's internal resources. Although the production of sweet potatoes and sugar industry grew, the peasants were not allowed to enlarge their fields. The agricultural reforms especially continued under king [[Shō Kei]] (1713–1752) and his [[sanshikan]] advisor [[Sai On]] (1728–1752) whose ''Nomucho'' (Directory of Agricultural Affairs) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46–50}} In the Sakishima Islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=51–52}} The relations with [[Qing dynasty]] improved after their second mission when the first Ryukyuan official students were sent to China in 1688.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=52–53}}

In the first half of the 19th century, French politicians like [[Jean-Baptiste Cécille]] unsuccessfully tried to conclude a French trade treaty with Ryukyu,{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=228}} with only a promise by Shuri government about the admission of Christian missionaries. However, due to extreme measures in teaching, [[Bernard Jean Bettelheim]]'s propagation of [[Protestantism]] between 1846–1854 was obscured by the government.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=52–53}}

===Modern history===

[[File:Five men wearing Ryukyuan Dress.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Five Ryukyuan men, [[Meiji period]].]]
During the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912) the ''Ryukyu shobun'' process started,{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=2}} according to which the kingdom became under jurisdiction of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] in 1871, and then became the [[Ryukyu Domain]] (1872–1879) of the Meiji Japan. However, this way of events were done to avoid Ryukyu and China revolt, and the Shuri government was not aware of their importance including when Japan decided to politically represent the Ryukyuan islanders involved in the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)]]. In 1875, the Ryukyus were forced to terminate their tribute relations with China against their wish for the status of dual subordination to China and Japan, something weakened China was unable to stop, with the proposition by U.S. 18th president [[Ulysses S. Grant]] about sovereign Okinawa and division of other islands between China and Japan rejected as the Chinese court at the last minute decided not to ratify the agreement. The king did not submit on three occasions between 1875–1879, and in 1879 the domain was formally abolished and established as [[Okinawa prefecture]], forcing the last Ryukyu king [[Shō Tai]] to move to Tokyo, with the reduced status of viscount.{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=228–230}}{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=56–57}}{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=61–62}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=1, 26–32}} The Ryukyu's aristocratic class resisted annexation for almost two decades (e.g. [[Kōchi Chōjō]], [[Rin Seikō]]),{{sfn|Obermiller|2006|p=23–24}} but after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), China's and the Ryukyus' sovereignty interests faded as China renounced its claims.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=59}}{{sfn|Dubinsky, Davies|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Loo|2014|p=32–36}} Many historians criticized the Meiji's consideration as a simple administration change rather than being Japan's first colony and inner colonialism.{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=228}}{{sfn|Gluck|2008|p=938}}

During the Meiji period, like with the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in Hokkaido, the Ryukyuans had their own culture, religion, traditions, and language suppressed by the Meiji government and faced forced assimilation.&lt;ref name="MasamiIto2009"/&gt;{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}}{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=233–245}} Since the 1880s, schools forbade display of their culture, dress, hairstyle and other considering them backward and inferior and introducing them to the Japanese culture and fashion.{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=64}} The militaristic indoctrination and emperor-centered ideology started from elementary school.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}} The ultimate goal of education was the unification into [[Yamato people]] (embodied with the myth of ethnic purity,{{sfn|Dubinsky, Davies|2013|p=3}} with on-going ideological [[Nihonjinron]] ignoring the minorities{{sfn|Liddicoat|2013|p=54}}), and often faced prejudice, work humiliation and ethnic discrimination.{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=67–70}}{{sfn|Christy|2004|p=173–185}} The local elite was divided into factions who opposed or supported the assimilation.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}} Around and especially after the Japanese annexation of Taiwan in 1895, the development was shifted away from Okinawa which resulted with famine period known as "Sotetsu-jigoku" ("[[Cycad]] hell"). In 1920–1921, the drop of sugar prices which continued until 1931 as well transfer of sugar production to Taiwan, being the poorest prefecture yet had heaviest tax burden,{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=233}} resulted with economical crisis and people were forced to find labor in Japan (often [[Osaka]] and [[Kobe]]) or abroad in Taiwan.{{sfn|Christy|2004|p=177, 180–182}}{{sfn|Obermiller|2006|p=86}} By 1935, approximately 15% of population emigrated.{{sfn|Nakasone|2002|p=17}}

During [[World War II]] and battles like the [[Battle of Okinawa]] (1945) approximately 150,000 [[civilian]] people (1/3 of population) were killed in Okinawa alone.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=63}}{{sfn|Inoue|2017|p=4}} After the World War II, the Ryukyu Islands were occupied by the [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] (1945–1950), but the U.S. maintained control even after the 1951 [[Treaty of San Francisco]], which went into effect on April 28, 1952, as was replaced by the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|USCAR]] (1950–1972) government. During this period U.S. military requisitioned private land for the building of their facilities, with the private owners put into refugee camps, and its personnel statistically committed thousands of crimes against the civilians.{{sfn|Inoue|2017|p=XIII–XV}} Only twenty years later, on 15 May 1972, Okinawa and near islands were returned to Japan.&lt;ref name="MasamiIto2009"/&gt; As the Japanese had post-war political freedom and economic prosperity, the facilities had a negative economical impact and people felt to be cheated, used for the purpose of Japanese and regional security against [[Communism|communist]] [[Red Scare|threat]], while others considered it a national disgrace.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}{{sfn|Inoue|2017|p=XIII–XIV, 4–5}} Since 1972 are held extensive plans to bring Okinawa's economy to national level, as well continued support of the local culture and revival of traditional arts started by the USCAR.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=64}}{{sfn|Inoue|2017|p=48–49, 79}}

{{main|Longevity in Okinawa}}
Ryukyuans tend to see themselves as bound together by their home island and, especially among older Ryukyuans, usually consider themselves from [[Okinawa]] first and [[Japan]] second.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=454}}&lt;ref&gt;Smits, Gregory.

The Okinawans have a very low age-adjusted mortality rate at older ages and among the lowest prevalence of cardiovascular disease and other age-associated diseases in the world. Furthermore, Okinawa has long had the highest life expectancy at older ages, as well has had among the highest prevalence of [[centenarian]]s among the 47 Japanese prefectures, also the world, since records began to be kept by the Ministry of Health in the early 1960s despite the high birth rate and expanding population of Okinawa prefecture.

As the Japanese (or [[Yamato people]]) learned to write and read a thousand years before the Ryukyuans and absorbed many Chinese language forms, the early literature which records the language of the [[Old Japanese language|Old Japanese]] imperial court show archaisms which are closer to Okinawan dialects.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The Ryukyuan language is divided into two main groups, [[Northern Ryukyuan languages]] and [[Southern Ryukyuan languages]],{{sfn|Pellard|2015|p=16–20}} and generally are considered the existence of five Ryukyuan languages; [[Amami language|Amami]], [[Okinawa language|Okinawa]], [[Miyako language|Miyako]], [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]] and [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]], while the sixth [[Kunigami language|Kunigami]] is added due to diversity. Within them and on specific islands exist local dialects, of which many vanished. Despite the use of Shuri Okinawan in the Shuri Court and its reputation, there's no standard variety. Thus, the Ryukyuan languages constitute a cluster of local dialects termed as [[Abstand and ausbau languages|unroofed abstand languages]], "unroofed" meaning without written standard.{{sfn|Heinrich, Miyara, Shimoji|2015|p=1–2}}

During the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and post-Meiji period the languages were identified as dialects of Japanese, and viewed negatively were suppressed by the Japanese government which forced assimilation and standard Japanese language.{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=14}}{{sfn|Liddicoat|2013|p=151–152, 209}} From 1907, the children were prohibited to speak Ryukyuan languages in school,{{sfn|Dubinsky, Davies|2013|p=15–16}}{{sfn|Liddicoat|2013|p=151–152}} and since the mid-1930s there existed [[dialect card]]s,{{sfn|Dubinsky, Davies|2013|p=16}} a system of punishment for the students who spoke in a non-standard language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Goebel Noguchi|author2=Sandra Fotos|title=Studies in Japanese Bilingualism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDBCqwLfp8UC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=9 June 2012|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-490-8|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elise K.

It is considered that contemporary people older than 85 exclusively use Ryukyuan, between 45 and 85 use Ryukyuan and standard Japanese depending on family or working environment, younger than 45 are able to understand Ryukyuan, while younger than 30 mainly are not able to understand and speak Ryukyuan languages.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=20}} The Ryukyuan languages are on the [[UNESCO]]'s list of endangered languages since 2009, as they could disappear by the mid-century.{{sfn|Heinrich, Miyara, Shimoji|2015|p=1}} It is unclear whether this recognition was too late, despite some positive influence by the Society of Spreading Okinawan.{{sfn|Dubinsky, Davies|2013|p=17}}

===Religion===
{{Main|Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan festivals and observances}}
[[File:Kamekoubaka.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The ''kamekōbaka'' ([[Turtleback tomb]]) is the traditional Ryukyuan family tomb.]]
Native [[Ryukyuan religion]] places strong emphasis upon the role of the women in the community, with women holding positions as [[shaman]]s and guardians of the home and hearth. The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]], until the 20th century it was often bilateral and [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], with common village endogamy.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=54–55}} [[Shisa]] statues can often be seen on or in front of houses—this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside. Godhood is mimicked with many attributes, and its in ease without any underlying symbolic order.{{sfn|Røkkum|2006|p=219}}

The village priestesses, [[Noro (priestess)|Noro]], until the 20th century used the white cloth and [[magatama]] beads. The noro's duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro's brother's female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}

The introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with [[Korean Buddhism]] influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} Buddhism and native religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when [[Confucianism]] gradually and officially became government ideology during [[Shō On]] (1795–1802), much to the dismay of [[Kumemura]].{{sfn|Smits|2004|p=240}} It was mostly important to the upper class families.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}} Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.{{sfn|Sered|1996|p=41}}

Until the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the [[Sefa-utaki]] (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the "five fruits and grains" were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuan people, was made-up by [[Shō Shōken]] in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=46}}

During the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands' state religion,{{sfn|Caprio|2014|p=66}} and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded native, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=4}} In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa's economy.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}} In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.{{sfn|Rabson|2007|p=5}}

Most Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the native religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Okinawan cuisine}}

Okinawan food is rich in [[vitamin]]s and [[minerals]] and is a good balance of [[protein]], [[fat]]s, and [[carbohydrate]]s. Although [[rice]] is a [[staple food]] ([[taco rice]] mixes it with beef), [[pork]] (''[[Pig's ear (food)#Okinawan (Japanese) cuisine|mimigaa and chiragaa]]'', dishes [[Rafute]] and [[Soki]]), [[Edible seaweed|seaweed]], rich [[miso]] (fermented [[soybean]]) pastes and soups ([[Zosui|Jūshī]]), [[sweet potato]] and [[brown sugar]] all feature prominently in native cuisine. Most famous to tourists is the ''[[Momordica charantia]]'', ''gōya'' (bitter melon), which is often mixed into representative Okinawan [[Stir frying|stir fry]] dish known as [[Chanpuru|champurū]] ([[Goya champuru]]). [[Kōrēgusu]] is a common [[hot sauce]] [[condiment]] used in various dishes including [[noodle soup]] [[Okinawa soba]]. Some specifically consumed algae include [[Caulerpa lentillifera]]. Traditional sweets include [[chinsuko]], [[hirayachi]], [[sata andagi]], and [[muchi]]. Local beverages include juice from ''[[Citrus depressa]]'', [[turmeric tea]] (''ukoncha''), and the alcoholic beverage [[awamori]].

The weight-loss [[Okinawa diet]] derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.&lt;ref name="Willcox2007"&gt;{{Citation  |last=Willcox |first=B.

===Arts===
{{main|Okinawan martial arts|Karate|Ryukyuan music|Okinawan music|}}
The techniques of [[self-defense]] and using farm tools as weapons against armed opponents—called [[Karate]] by today's martial artists—was created by Ryukyuans who probably incorporated some [[Chinese martial arts|gong fu]] and native techniques from China into a complete system of attack and defense known simply as ''Ti'' (literally meaning "hand"). These martial arts varied slightly from town to town, and were named for their towns of origin, examples being [[Naha-te]] (currently known as Goju-Ryū), [[Tomari-te]] and [[Shuri-te]].

The [[Kabura-ya (Japanese signal arrow)]] still has a ceremonial use for house, village or festival celebration in Okinawa.
{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

It is considered that the rhythms and patterns of dances, like [[Eisa (dance)|Eisa]] and [[Angama (dance)|Angama]], represent legends and prehistoric heritage.{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} [[Ryūka]] genre of songs and poetry originate from the Okinawa Islands. From the Chinese traditional instrument [[sanxian]] in the 16th century developed the Okinawan instrument [[sanshin]] from which ultimately derives [[Kankara sanshin]] and the Japanese [[shamisen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lande|first=Liv|title=Innovating musical tradition in Japan: Negotiating transmission, identity, and creativity in the Sawai Koto School|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest LCC|page=73|isbn=978-0-549-50670-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TukqhSzefPEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women frequently wore indigo tattoos known as ''hajichi'' on the backs of their hands, a sign of adulthood and talisman to protect them from evil. These tattoos were banned in 1899 by the Meiji government.&lt;ref name="MasamiIto2009"/&gt; In remote districts their ''katakashira'' off-center topknot, similar to [[Yami people|Yami]] and [[Filipinos of Malay descent]] in [[Mindanao]] and elsewhere,{{sfn|Kerr|2000}} among men and women also disappeared in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=59}}

The ''bashôfu'', literally meaning "banana-fibre cloth", is designated as a part of Ryukyu and Japan "important intangible cultural properties". The weaving using indigenous ramie was also widespread in the archipelago, both originated before the 14th century.{{sfn|Hendrickx|2007|p=27, 64}}

Originally living in [[thatching]] houses, townsmen developed architecture modeled after Japanese, Chinese and Korean structures. Other dwellings suggest a tropical origin, and some villages have high stone walls, with similar structural counterpart in Yami people at [[Orchid Island]].{{sfn|Kerr|2000}}

'''Sakhalin Koreans''' are Russian citizens and residents of Korean descent living on [[Sakhalin Island]], who trace their roots to the immigrants from the [[Gyeongsang]] and [[Jeolla]] provinces of [[Korea]] during the late 1930s and early 1940s, the latter half of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial era]]. At the time, the southern half of Sakhalin Island, then known as [[Karafuto Prefecture]], was under the control of the [[Empire of Japan]]; the Japanese government both recruited and forced Korean labourers into service and shipped them to Karafuto to fill labour shortages resulting from [[World War II]]. The [[Red Army]] invaded Karafuto days before [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]]; while all but a few Japanese there [[repatriate]]d successfully, almost one-third of the Koreans could not secure permission to depart either to Japan or their home towns in [[South Korea]]. For the next forty years, they lived in exile. In 1985, the Japanese government offered transit rights and funding for the repatriation of the original group of Sakhalin Koreans; however, only 1,500 of them returned to South Korea in the next two decades. The vast majority of Koreans of all generations chose instead to stay on Sakhalin.

Due to differing language and immigration history, Sakhalin Koreans may or may not identify themselves as [[Koryo-saram]]. The term "Koryo-saram" may be used to encompass to all Koreans in the [[Post-Soviet States|former USSR]], but typically refers to ethnic Koreans from [[Hamgyŏng]] province whose ancestors emigrated to the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century, and then were later [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deported to Central Asia]]. The issue of self-identification is complicated by the fact that many Sakhalin Koreans feel that Koreans from [[Central Asia]] look down on them.&lt;ref name=Byong&gt;{{cite news|last=Ban|first=Byung-yool|title=Koreans in Russia: Historical Perspective|date=2004-09-22|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200409/kt2004092218583111950.htm|work=Korea Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318164348/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200409/kt2004092218583111950.htm|archivedate=2005-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean immigration to Sakhalin began as early as the 1910s, when the [[Mitsui Group]] began recruiting labourers from the peninsula for their mining operations.&lt;ref name="Miki"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miki|first=Masafumi|title=戦間期樺太における朝鮮人社会の形成―『在日』朝鮮人史研究の空間性をめぐって (The formation of the Korean community in inter-war Karafuto)|journal=社会経済史学 (Socio-economic History)|volume=68|publisher=Socio-Economic History Society, Waseda University|issue=2|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, ten years after the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexation of Korea by Japan]], there were fewer than one thousand Koreans in the whole of Karafuto Prefecture, overwhelmingly male.&lt;ref name="KimGermanSakhalin"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kim, German Nikolaevich|date=2004-12-09|accessdate=2006-11-26|url=http://world.lib.ru/k/kim_o_i/str1rtf.shtml|publisher=[[Al-Farabi University]]|location=Kazakhstan|title=Корейцы на Сахалине (Koreans in Sakhalin)|authorlink=German Kim|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from an influx of refugees from the [[Primorsky Krai|Maritimes]], who escaped to [[Karafuto]] during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the number of Koreans in the province did not rise very rapidly; as late as the mid-1930s, there were fewer than 6,000 Koreans in Karafuto.&lt;ref name="Miki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-Suzuki"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris-Suzuki|first=Tessa|title=Northern Lights: The Making and Unmaking of Karafuto Identity|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|volume=60|issue=3|pages=645–671|doi=10.2307/2700105|date=August 2001|jstor=2700105|publisher=Association for Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Japan's war effort picked up, the Japanese government sought to put more people on the ground in the sparsely-populated prefecture in order to ensure their control of the territory and fill the increasing demands of the coal mines and lumber yards. Recruiters turned to sourcing workers from the Korean peninsula; at one point, over 150,000 Koreans were relocated to work on the island.&lt;ref name="LeeJinWoo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jin-woo|title=3,100 Sakhalin Koreans yearn to return home|publisher=The Korea Times|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2006-11-26|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200502/kt2005021817362210580.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102055241/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200502/kt2005021817362210580.htm|archivedate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, around 10,000 mine workers were relocated to Japan prior to the war's end; present-day Sakhalin Koreans' efforts to locate them proved futile.&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20050826"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sakhalin Koreans celebrate 60th anniversary of liberation from Japanese bondage |url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1815 |publisher=The Sakhalin Times |date=2005-08-26 |accessdate=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002750/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1815 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Parts translated from [[ja:樺太朝鮮人虐殺事件]] --&gt;
The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in Karafuto frequently used local ethnic minorities ([[Orok people|Oroks]], [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]], and [[Ainu people|Ainu]]) to conduct intelligence-gathering activities, because, as indigenous inhabitants, their presence would not arouse suspicion on the Soviet half of the island. Ethnic Koreans could also be found on both sides of the border, but the use of Koreans as spies was not common, as the Karafuto police were wary of the support for the [[Korean independence movement|independence movement]] among Koreans. Soviet suspicion towards Korean nationalism, along with fears that the Korean community might harbour Japanese spies, led to the 1937 [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deportation of Koreans]] from Soviet-controlled northern Sakhalin and the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref name="ChoeGilseong"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Choe|first=Gil-seong|title=樺太における日本人の朝鮮人虐殺 (The Japanese Massacre of Koreans in Karafuto)|booktitle=世界法史の単一性と複数性 (Unity and complexity of international legal history)|pages=289–296|publisher=Miraisha|year=2005|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet invasion and Japanese massacres====
The Soviet Union invaded the Japanese portion of Sakhalin on August 11, 1945, resulting the deaths of 20,000 civilians (see [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)]]). In the confusion that ensued, a rumour began to spread that ethnic Koreans could be serving as spies for the Soviet Union, and led to massacres of Koreans by Japanese police and civilians. Despite the generally limited amount of information about the massacres, two examples of massacres are comparatively well-known today: the incident in Kamishisuka (now Leonidovo) on August 18, 1945, and the incident in Mizuho Village (now Pozharskoye), which lasted from August 20 to August 23, 1945.

In Kamishisuka, the Japanese police arrested 19 Koreans on charges of spy activities; 18 were found shot within the police station the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aurora-net.or.jp/user/tamura/sakha2-13.htm|script-title=ja:サハリンレポートによる記事|accessdate=2006-11-27|language=ja}} Has photos.&lt;/ref&gt; The sole survivor, a Korean known only by his [[sōshi-kaimei|Japanese name]] Nakata, had survived by hiding in a toilet; he later offered testimony about the event.&lt;ref name="Hayashi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayashi|first=Eidai|title=証言・樺太(サハリン)朝鮮人虐殺事件 (Testimony: The Massacre of Karafuto/Sakhalin Koreans)|year=1992|publisher=Fubaisha|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mizuho Village, Japanese fleeing Soviet troops who had landed at Maoka (now [[Kholmsk]]) claimed that the Koreans were cooperating with the Red Army and that they were pillaging Japanese property. Though Koreans and Japanese worked alongside each other in the village on farms and construction projects, the Japanese civilians turned against their Korean neighbors, killing 27 between August 20 and 23.&lt;ref name="ChoeGilseong"/&gt;&lt;!-- end translated part --&gt; Other individual Koreans may have been killed to cover up evidence of Japanese atrocities committed during the evacuation: one woman interviewed by a US-Russian joint commission investigating the issue of Allied prisoners of war held by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[List of Japanese POW camps during World War II|camps on Sakhalin]] reported that her ethnic Korean lover had been murdered by Japanese troops after he had witnessed mass shootings of hundreds of American prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=POWs&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/tfrussia/tfrhtml/tfrsplit/tfr010.html|title=Task Force Russia -- Biweekly Report 19 December 1982 - 8 January 1993 (12th Report)|publisher=U.S.-Russian Joint Delegation on POWs/MIAs|date=1993-01-08|accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integration into the Soviet Union ===

==== Repatriation refused ====
In the years after the Soviet invasion, most of the 400,000 Japanese civilians who had not already been [[Evacuation of Karafuto and Kuriles|evacuated during the war]] left voluntarily under the auspices of the US-USSR Agreement on Repatriation of those left in the USSR, signed in December 1946. Many of the 150,000 Koreans on the island safely returned to mainland Japan, and some went to the northern half of the Korean peninsula; however, roughly 43,000 were not accepted for repatriation by Japan, and also could not be repatriated to the southern half of the Korean peninsula due to the political situation;&lt;ref name="LeeJinWoo"/&gt; The Soviet government initially had drawn up plans to repatriate the Koreans along with the Japanese, but the local administration on Sakhalin objected, arguing that incoming Russians from the mainland would not be sufficient to replace the skilled labourers who had already departed. The indecision about the ultimate fate of the Sakhalin Koreans persisted until the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], after which repatriation became a political impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|work=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=2013-08-01|accessdate=2013-08-01|title=How 25 thousand miners were marooned on a distant island|url=http://rbth.asia/blogs/2013/08/01/how_25_thausand_miners_were_marooned_on_a_distant_island_48317.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.li/20130802030734/http://rbth.asia/blogs/2013/08/01/how_25_thausand_miners_were_marooned_on_a_distant_island_48317.html|archivedate=2013-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim Stalin himself blocked their departure because he wanted to retain them as coal miners on the island.&lt;ref name="Lankov"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|work=The Korea Times|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2006-11-26|title=Stateless in Sakhalin|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200601/kt2006010516434554130.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Seoul appealed for Tokyo's assistance to secure the departure of ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin via Japan, but Tokyo took no real action on the request, and blamed Soviet intransigence for the lack of progress in resolving the issue; Japan continued its earlier policy of granting entrance only to Sakhalin Koreans who were married to Japanese citizens, or had a Japanese parent.&lt;ref name="JapanRefusedToHelpKoreans"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan refused to help Koreans leave Sakhalin|date=2000-12-19|work=Kyodo News|accessdate=2013-08-01|url=http://www.news.ch/Japan+refused+to+help+Koreans+leave+Sakhalin+island/26316/detail.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1940s, the ranks of ethnic Koreans on the island were augmented by another 8,000 North Korean expatriates, recruited by the Soviet government to work in state-owned fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/12/120_54137.html|date=2009-10-23|accessdate=2010-01-08|periodical=Korea Times|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=N. Korean Mirage Collapses in Sakhalin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to integrate the Korean labourers, who were unfamiliar with the Soviet system and unable to speak Russian, local authorities set up schools using the Korean language as the medium of instruction. However, the Sakhalin Koreans were believed to have been "infected with the Japanese spirit", and so for the most part the authorities did not trust them to run any of their own collective farms, mills, factories, schools, or hospitals. Instead, these tasks were left to several hundred [[Koryo-saram|ethnic Koreans imported from Central Asia]], who were bilingual in Russian and Korean. Resentment towards the social dominance of Koreans from Central Asia over the Sakhalin Koreans led to tensions between the two groups; the latter developed a number of disparaging terms in Korean to refer to the former.&lt;ref name=Byong/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mion.isu.ru/pub/russ-ost/diaspr/6.html|title=Актуальные проблемы корейской диаспоры в Центральной Азии (Important problems of the Korean diaspora in Central Asia)|last=Kim|first=German|author2=Khan, Valery |publisher=Kazakh State University|year=2001|accessdate=2007-04-27}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Um2"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Um|first=Hae-kyung |editor=K.

The Sakhalin government's policy towards the Sakhalin Koreans continued to shift in line with bilateral relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union. During the 1950s, [[North Korea]] demanded that the Soviets treat Sakhalin Koreans as [[Nationality Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korean citizens]], and, through their consulate, even set up study groups and other educational facilities for them (analogous to [[Chongryon]]'s similar, more successful efforts among the [[Zainichi Koreans]]). During the late 1950s, it became increasingly difficult for the Sakhalin Koreans to obtain Soviet citizenship, and a growing proportion chose instead to become North Korean citizens rather to than deal with the burdens of remaining stateless, which included severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the requirement to apply for permission from the local government in order to travel outside of Sakhalin.&lt;ref name="Lankov"/&gt; As of 1960, only 25% had been able to secure Soviet citizenship; 65% had declared North Korean citizenship, with the remaining 10% choosing to remain unaffiliated despite the difficulties this entailed.&lt;ref name="Ishikida"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ishikida|first=Miki|title=Toward Peace: War Responsibility, Postwar Compensation, and Peace Movements and Education in Japan|year=2005|publisher=Center for US-Japan Comparative Social Studies|isbn=0-595-35063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as relations between the Soviet Union and North Korea deteriorated, the authorities acted to de-emphasise Korean language education and reduce the influence of North Korea within the community; by the early 1970s, Sakhalin Koreans were once again encouraged to apply for Soviet citizenship.&lt;ref name="Lankov"/&gt;

==== Attention from the outside world ====
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the situation of the Sakhalin Koreans improved as the outside world began to pay much more attention to their situation. Starting in 1966, Park No Hak, a former Sakhalin Korean who had earlier received permission to leave Sakhalin and settle in Japan by virtue of his having a Japanese wife, petitioned the Japanese government a total of 23 times to discuss the issue of the Sakhalin Koreans with the Soviet government. His actions inspired 500,000 South Koreans to form an organisation to work towards the repatriation of their co-ethnics; in response, the South Korean began radio broadcasts targeted at the Sakhalin Koreans, in an effort to assure them that they had not been forgotten.&lt;ref name="PakHyeongju"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pak|first=Hyeong-ju|title=サハリンからのレポート―棄てられた朝鮮人の歴史と証言 (The Report From Sakhalin: History and Testimony of Discarded Koreans)|date=January 1991|publisher=Ochanomizu Shobo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Forsaken People|date=1976-01-12|accessdate=2006-11-27|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913836,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the same time, Rei Mihara, a Tokyo housewife, formed a similar pressure group in Japan, and 18 Japanese lawyers attempted to sue the Japanese government to force them to accept diplomatic and financial responsibility for the transportation of the Sakhalin Koreans and their return to South Korea.&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"/&gt;

Additionally, the Soviet government finally began to permit the Sakhalin Koreans to naturalize.&lt;ref name="Lankov"/&gt; However, as many as 10% continued to refuse both Soviet and North Korean citizenship, and demanded repatriation to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Stephan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephan|first=John J|title=Sakhalin Island: Soviet Outpost in Northeast Asia|journal=Asian Survey|volume=10|issue=12|date=December 1970|pages=1090–1100|doi=10.1525/as.1970.10.12.01p00612}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, only 2,000 more of their population had been able to obtain permission to depart from Sakhalin, but that year, the Sakhalin government made a public announcement that people seeking to emigrate to South Korea could simply show up at the Immigration Office to file an application. Within a week, they had received more than 800 such applications, including some from North Korean citizens; this caused the North Korean embassy to complain to their Soviet counterparts about the new emigration policy. The Soviet authorities in the end chose for unspecified reasons to [[refusenik (Soviet Union)|refuse to issue exit visas]] to most of those concerned, leading to the unusual case of public demonstrations about the refusals by Korean families. This level of open dissent provoked the authorities to completely reverse their liberalising stance towards the Sakhalin Koreans; they arrested more than 40 protestors, and in November 1976 deported them, but to North Korea rather than to the South as they desired. Further purges and intimidation of those seeking to emigrate also followed.&lt;ref name="PakHyeongju"/&gt; Through to the early 1980s, locally born Korean youth, increasingly interested in their heritage, were [[dual loyalty|seen as traitors]] by their Russian neighbours for wanting to know more about their ancestral land and for seeking to emigrate. The nadir of ethnic relations came after the 1983 shooting-down of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="VladivostokNews"/&gt;

=== Perestroika, glasnost, and the post-Soviet period ===

==== Improving relations with Japan ====
In 1985, Japan agreed to approve transit rights and fund the repatriation of the first generation of Sakhalin Koreans;&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20040528"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sakhalin Koreans discuss Japan strategy |publisher=The Sakhalin Times |url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=728 |date=2004-05-28 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002743/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=728 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Soviet Union also began to liberalize their emigration laws in 1987.&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Geoffrey|title=Soviet Jewish Emigration, the United States, and the Occupied Territories|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume= 19|date=Summer 1990|pages=30–45|doi=10.1525/jps.1990.19.4.00p0215c|issue= 4|jstor=2537387}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2001, Japan spends [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million a year to fund Sakhalin Koreans' visits to Seoul.

On April 18, 1990, [[Taro Nakayama]], Japan's [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], stated:

: ''"Japan is deeply sorry for the tragedy in which these (Korean) people were moved to Sakhalin not of their own free will but by the design of the Japanese government and had to remain there after the conclusion of the war"''.&lt;ref name="JapanDiet"&gt;{{cite web|title=第118回国会衆議院外務委員会議録3号 (118th National Diet Session Lower House Committee on Foreign Affairs #3) |date=1990-04-18 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |work=国会会議録検索システム (Diet Minutes Search System) |url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp |language=ja }} [http://home.att.ne.jp/sun/RUR55/E/epage16.htm Translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904030526/http://home.att.ne.jp/sun/RUR55/E/epage16.htm |date=September 4, 2004 }} in Kenichi Takagi, Rethinking Japan's Postwar Compensation: Voices of Victims. tr. by Makiko Nakano.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North and South Korean influence ====
During the 1990s, commerce, communication, and direct flights opened up between Sakhalin and [[South Korea]], and the two Koreas began to vie openly for influence among the Sakhalin Koreans. Television and radio programmes from both North and South Korea, as well as local programming, began to be broadcast on [[Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting]], the only Korean television station in all of Russia.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Lucy |title=Forgotten Prisoners |publisher=The Vladivostok News |date=1997-12-30 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/1997/ISS157/NEWS.HTM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010041134/http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/1997/ISS157/NEWS.HTM |archivedate=2006-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KimHyun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim |first=Hyun |title=Wave of dramas from homeland uplifts Sakhalin Koreans |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |publisher=Yonhap News |url=http://english.yna.co.kr/Engnews/20050708/500100000020050708120824E0.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001305/http://english.yna.co.kr/Engnews/20050708/500100000020050708120824E0.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea negotiated with Russia for closer economic relations with Sakhalin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea calls for greater relations with Sakhalin|publisher=ITAR-TASS|date=2006-11-23|accessdate=2006-11-26|url=http://news.tradingcharts.com/futures/8/7/86078878.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored an art show in [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korean Art Exhibition being held in Sakhalin |url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2922 |publisher=The Sakhalin Times |accessdate=2006-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120170329/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2922 |archivedate=2006-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also permitted delegations of Sakhalin Koreans to visit relatives in North Korea.&lt;ref name="VladivostokNews"/&gt; Scholarly studies suggest that roughly 1,000 Sakhalin Koreans have opted to repatriate to North Korea, but the rise of the South Korean economy combined with the ongoing economic and political turmoil in the North have made this option less attractive.&lt;ref name="JeanyoungLee"/&gt; Sakhalin Koreans have also provided assistance to [[North Korean defectors|refugees fleeing North Korea]], either those who illegally escaped across the border, or those who escaped North Korean labour camps in Russia itself.&lt;ref name="Yoon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Situation and Protection of North Korean Refugees in Russia|author=Yoon, Yeo-sang|publisher=Korea Political Development Research Center|url=http://www.nkhumanrights.or.kr/bbs/board2/files/57_yeo-sangyoon.doc|format=Microsoft Word|accessdate=2006-11-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104012148/http://nkhumanrights.or.kr/bbs/board2/files/57_yeo-sangyoon.doc |archivedate = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea and Japan jointly funded the building of a nursing home for elderly Sakhalin Koreans in [[Ansan]], a [[Seoul National Capital Area|suburb of Seoul]], and under the auspices of the [[Korean Red Cross]], 1,544 people had settled there and in other locations {{As of|2002|alt=by the end of 2002}}, while another 14,122 had travelled to South Korea on short-term visits at Japanese government expense.&lt;ref name="RedCross"&gt;{{cite pressrelease|title=Inter-Korean Affairs: Family Reunions|url=http://redcross.or.kr/www/eng/service.jsp?pageindex=7|accessdate=2006-11-26|publisher=The Republic of Korea National Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean investors also began to participate in the international tenders for works contracts to develop the Sakhalin Shelf, as they are interested in the potential supply of [[liquefied natural gas]]. By the year 2000, South Korean missionaries had opened several churches, and South Koreans comprised the majority of [[international students]] at the [[Sakhalin State University]].&lt;ref name="VladivostokNews"/&gt; The [[Korean Residents' Association on Sakhalin]], an ethnic representative body, is generally described as being pro-South Korean, analogous to Japan's [[Mindan]].&lt;ref name="Kyodo"&gt;{{cite news|date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |title=Sakhalin's Koreans angry over delay in cultural center |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2000_Oct_2/ai_66169200 |publisher=Kyodo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615175951/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2000_Oct_2/ai_66169200/ |archivedate=2011-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the elderly, a few younger Koreans have also chosen to move to South Korea, either to find their roots, or for economic reasons, as wages in South Korea are as much as three times those in Sakhalin. However, upon arrival, they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by the South Korean locals, despite their previous exposure to Korean culture in Sakhalin. As one returnee put it, "Sakhalin Koreans live in a different world than Sakhalin Russians but that world isn’t Korea".&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20040702"&gt;{{cite news|title=Transplanted Sakhaliner |url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=833 |publisher=The Sakhalin Times |date=2004-07-02 |accessdate=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120194431/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=833 |archivedate=2006-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, younger Sakhalin Koreans, especially those lacking fluency in the Korean language, prefer to stay on Sakhalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/30/news/adfg-khome30|title=Torn between two lands|last=Herman|first=Burt|date=2007-12-30|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,544 Koreans who repatriated to South Korea {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, nearly 10% eventually returned to Sakhalin.&lt;ref name="JeanyoungLee"/&gt; Conversely, some foreign students from Korea studying in Sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local Koreans, claiming that the latter looked down on them for being foreigners.&lt;ref name="Yong"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yong |first=Kyeong Roo |title=Sakhalin's Three Sets of Koreans |url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1610 |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120210623/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1610 |archivedate=2006-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Local interethnic relations ====
In the late 1980s, suspicions against the Sakhalin Koreans remained. With the relaxation of [[Propiska in the Soviet Union|internal migration controls]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russians began moving ''en masse'' back to the mainland, making ethnic Koreans an increasing proportion of the population; there were fears that they might become a majority of the island's population, and seek an [[Republics of Russia|autonomous republic]] or even independence.&lt;ref name="Stroev"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lgz.ru/archives/html_arch/lg122005/Polosy/20_1.htm |title=Помни имя своё |date=December 2005 |last=Stroev |first=Anatoly |work=Литературная газета (Literaturnaya Gazeta) |accessdate=2006-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726162212/http://www.lgz.ru/archives/html_arch/lg122005/Polosy/20_1.htm |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise of the regional economy and the cultural assimilation of the younger generations drove more than 95% of Koreans to stay in Sakhalin or move to the [[Russian Far East]] rather than leave for South Korea, as they have come to consider Russia their home country. The Sakhalin Koreans' family connections in South Korea have benefited even those who remained on Sakhalin with easier access to South Korean business and imports; trade with South Korea has brought the Sakhalin Koreans a [[model minority|better economic standing]] than the average resident of Sakhalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = A battle for workers in Russia's Far East |work = International Herald Tribune |date = 2002-09-02
|url = http://www.iht.com/articles/69424.htm |accessdate = 2005-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, inter-ethnic relations between Russians and Koreans had improved greatly and were generally not described as being a problem on Sakhalin. However, Sakhalin Koreans who have travelled to the mainland of Russia, or have relocated to there (a population of roughly 10,000), report that they have encountered various forms of racism.&lt;ref name="JeanyoungLee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20040120"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1610|title=Sakhalin's Koreans|date=2004-01-20|work=The Sakhalin Times|accessdate=2006-11-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120210623/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1610|archivedate=November 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Koreans who remain on Sakhalin, roughly 7,000 of the original generation of settlers survive, while their locally born descendants make up the rest of the local Korean population.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; They are highly urbanized; half live in the administrative centre of [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], where Koreans constitute nearly 12% of the population.&lt;ref name="Ansan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=918 |title=Ansan Delegation visits Sakhalin |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |work=The Sakhalin Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002815/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=918 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around thirty per cent of Sakhalin’s thirty thousand Koreans still have not taken Russian citizenship.&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20040528"/&gt;
Unlike ethnic Russians or other local minority groups, Sakhalin Koreans are exempted from [[Conscription in Russia|conscription]], but there have been calls for this exemption to be terminated.&lt;ref name="SakhalinTimes20051025"&gt;{{cite news|title=Koreans make Sakhalin multi-cultural|url=http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1982|work=The Sakhalin Times|date=2005-10-25|accessdate=2006-11-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120222445/http://www.thesakhalintimes.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1982|archivedate=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

===Personal and family names===
{{Korean names in Russian}}
{{see also|List of Korean family names|Cyrillization of Korean}}

Korean surnames, when Cyrillized, may be spelled slightly differently from the romanisations used in the US; the resulting common pronunciations also differ, as can be seen in the table at right. Furthermore, [[Korean name|Korean naming practices]] and [[Names in Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries|Russian naming practices]] conflict in several important ways.&lt;ref name="Kim-Names"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kim, German Nikolaevich, and Steven Sunwoo Lee (translator)|title=Names of Koryo-saram|publisher=[[Al-Farabi University]]|url=http://www.koryosaram.freenet.kz/update1/names.doc|accessdate=2006-11-28|format=DOC |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050306073046/http://www.koryosaram.freenet.kz/update1/names.doc |archivedate = March 6, 2005|authorlink= German Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most members of the older generations of Sakhalin Koreans used Korean names, members of the younger generations favor their Russian names. However, with the increasing exposure to South Korean pop culture, some younger Koreans have named their children after characters in [[Korean drama|Korean television dramas]].&lt;ref name="Baek"/&gt; The use of [[patronymic]]s is not widespread.

In addition to Korean names, the oldest generation of Sakhalin Koreans are often legally registered under Japanese names, which they had originally adopted due to the ''[[sōshi-kaimei]]'' policy of the Japanese colonial era. After the Soviet invasion, the Sakhalin authorities conducted name registration for the local Koreans on the basis of the Japanese identity documents issued by the old Karafuto government; as of 2006, the Russian government uniformly refused requests for re-registration under [[Korean names]].&lt;ref name="Baek"/&gt;

=== Language ===
{{see also|North–South differences in the Korean language}}
Due to their greater population density and expectation that they would one day be allowed to return to Korea, the Sakhalin Koreans have kept something of a sojourner mentality rather than a settler mentality, which influenced their relation to the surrounding society; even today, they tend to speak much better Korean than those who were deported to Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Yoon"/&gt; A weekly Korean language newspaper, the ''Saegoryeo Shinmun'' (새고려 신문), has been published since 1949, while Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting began operation in 1956.&lt;ref name="Baek"/&gt; Korean-language television programmes are broadcast locally, but typically with Russian [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]].&lt;ref name="KBS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hancinema.net/modele.php?page=voir_une_societe.php&amp;id=16&amp;news=2373#news|title="Autumn Fairy Tale" Sparks Hallyu Wave in Sakhalin|publisher=Korean Broadcasting System|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, during the Soviet era, Sakhalin Koreans were often hired to act as announcers and writers for official media aimed at the [[Koryo-saram]] in Central Asia. However, unlike the [[Koryo-saram]], the spoken [[Korean language|Korean]] of Sakhalin is not very closely related to [[Hamgyŏng dialect]] or [[Koryo-mar]], but is instead descended from [[Jeolla dialect|Jeolla]] and [[Gyeongsang dialect]]s. As a result of the diplomatic situation up until the 1980s, during which South Korea had no relations with the Soviet Union, Korean-language instructional materials were provided by North Korea or developed domestically. Oddly enough, as a result, Sakhalin Koreans' writing, like that of Koryo-saram, follows the North Korean standard, but their spoken Korean in radio broadcasts has come to resemble the [[Seoul dialect]] of South Korea.&lt;ref name="KimGermanKazakhstan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kim, German Nikolaevich|title=О родном языке корейцев Казахстана (About the native language of Koreans in Kazakhstan)|url=http://world.lib.ru/k/kim_o_i/rtg1rtf.shtml|publisher=[[Al-Farabi University]]|date=2004-12-09|accessdate=2006-11-26|authorlink=German Kim|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there has been significant growth in religious activities among the Sakhalin Koreans; the establishment of churches was noted in scholarly articles as early as 1990.&lt;ref name="YGKim"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Yong-guk|title=사할린에 한인교회 설립 (Establishment of Korean churches on Sakhalin)|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=54&amp;isid=1567&amp;arid=114035&amp;topMenu=&amp;topMenu1=|pages=3–9|date=July 1990|issn=1227-8378|accessdate=2007-01-22|journal=North Korea|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian hymns have become popular listening material, supplementing the more typical Russian, Western, and Korean pop music.&lt;ref name="Um"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Um|first=Hae-kyung|volume=9|year=2000|title=Listening patterns and identity of the Korean diaspora in the former USSR|journal=British Journal of Ethnomusicology|pages=127–144|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/music/mclayton/bje9-2finalpdf.PDF|format=PDF|issue=2|doi=10.1080/09681220008567303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean churches also broadcast religious content through Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting; a [[Baptist]] church run by ethnic Koreans sponsors a journalist there.&lt;ref name=F18&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=331|publisher=[[Forum 18]]|title=RUSSIA: Local restrictions on mission in Sakhalin region|date=2004-06-01|accessdate=2007-01-22|last=Fagan|first=Geraldine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, large-scale religious events can be subjected to restriction by the government authorities: in June 1998 the local [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and the regional administration of Sakhalin successfully pressured [[Presbyterianism in South Korea|Korean Presbyterian]] missionaries to cancel a conference of more than 100 Presbyterian and other Protestant missionaries from around the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=U.S. Department of State|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999: Russia|year=1999|url=http://www.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/statedeptrussia0909.html|accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic Koreans are numerous among the church-goers of St. James Cathedral, seat of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk]], in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Catholic missions in Kholmsk and Aniva have also a fair number of Korean parishioners.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

=== Music ===
In one survey, a third of the Sakhalin Korean population expressed a preference for traditional Korean music, a far higher proportion than in any other ethnic Korean community surveyed. However, despite their better knowledge of Korean language, the same survey showed that Korean pop music is less widespread among Sakhalin Koreans than among ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, possessing about the same degree of popularity as in Uzbekistan. Sakhalin Koreans also reported listening to Western popular and classical music at much lower rates than Koreans in the rest of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Um"/&gt; Study of traditional Korean musical instruments has also been gaining popularity across all generations. The Ethnos Arts School was established in 1991 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to teach children's classes in traditional Korean dance, piano, [[sight singing]], and the ''[[gayageum]]'', a [[zither]]-like instrument supposedly invented around the time of the [[Gaya confederacy]].&lt;ref name="Hankyoreh"&gt;{{cite news|title=사할린 고려인 학생들, 국악사랑에 흠뻑 취한 사흘: 러 사할린 에트노스예술학교 (For Sakhalin Goryeo-in, three days filled with love of Korean traditional music: Sakhalin's Ethnos Arts School)|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/music/52549.html|last=Chung|first=Sang-yeong|publisher=Hankyoreh|date=2005-07-25|accessdate=2007-01-21|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 3rd Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCMG|DL}} (26 January 1837 – 28 October 1915), commonly referred to as "Sir Fowell Buxton",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45333289 |title=Sir Fowell Bixton Ill. |newspaper=[[The Barrier Miner]] |location=Broken Hill, NSW |date=28 October 1915 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Governor of South Australia]] from 29 October 1895 until 29 March 1899. He was the grandson of [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton]], a British MP and social reformer, and the son of [[Sir Edward Buxton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edward North Buxton]], also an MP.

He attended [[Harrow School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= BKSN854TF|name=Buxton, Thomas Fowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lady [[Lady Victoria Buxton|Victoria Noel]] on 12 June 1862 and they had a total of 13 children, ten surviving infancy. She was crippled by a spinal condition in 1869.

He was elected as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|1865 general election]], but was defeated at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868 election]].&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his defeat, he stood again for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] unsuccessfully on several other occasions: in [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] at the  [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]], in [[West Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Essex]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]] and at the by-elections in [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern Norfolk]] in 1876 and 1879.&lt;ref name="craig1832-1885" /&gt; He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Norfolk]] in 1876.

When Buxton was appointed governor, the [[Premier of South Australia]], [[Charles Kingston]] was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill health of his wife.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

"'''The Heathen Chinee'''", originally published as "'''Plain Language from Truthful James'''", is a [[narrative poem]] by American writer [[Bret Harte]]. It was published for the first time in September 1870 in the ''[[Overland Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="Railton"&gt;Railton, Stephen. [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/railton/roughingit/map/chiharte.html Harte: "The Heathen Chinee"]. ''West Meets East: Depicting the Chinese, 1860–1873''. University of Virginia. URL accessed 2006-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;Henderson, Victoria. Mark Canada, editor. "[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/18661913/lit/harte.htm Bret Harte, 1836–1902] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214191749/http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/18661913/lit/harte.htm |date=2006-12-14 }}". ''All American: Literature, History, and Culture''. University of North Carolina at Pembroke. URL accessed 2006-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written as a [[parody]] of [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Atalanta in Calydon]]'' (1865),&lt;ref name="Railton" /&gt; and [[satire|satirized]] [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese sentiment]] in northern [[California]].

The poem became popular and was frequently republished. To Harte's dismay, however, the poem reinforced racism among his readers instead of challenging it as he intended. Nevertheless, he returned to the character years later. The poem also inspired or influenced several adaptations.

==Overview==
The narrative of the poem focuses on a Chinese immigrant character named Ah Sin who is playing the card game [[euchre]] with two white men on August 3 of an unspecified year. "Truthful James", one of the men who narrates the poem, observes that the other white man, Bill Nye, is cheating with a stacked deck, and with cards up his sleeve. They both seemed to think Ah Sin was childlike and did not understand the game. Nevertheless, Ah Sin plays well and soon puts down the same card that Nye had dealt to the narrator. Concluding their opponent is ''also'' cheating, Nye fights Ah Sin and discovers he has several decks hidden in his clothes.

==Composition and publication history==
[[File:Bret Harte 1871 Sarony.jpg|thumb|Bret Harte in 1871, about a year after publishing "The Heathen Chinee"]]
[[Mark Twain]] later recalled that Harte initially wrote the poem "for his own amusement", without intending to publish it. According to Twain, he "threw it aside, but being one day suddenly called upon for copy he sent that very piece in."&lt;ref name=Scharnhorst52&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 52. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing the poem, Harte echoed and, therefore, lampooned [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s 1865 verse tragedy ''Atalanta in Calydon''.&lt;ref name=Powers289&gt;Powers, Ron. ''Mark Twain: A Life''. New York: Free Press, 2005: 289. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-4899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose Bierce]] claimed Harte originally sent it to him to include in his San Francisco-based ''News Letter'', but he suggested it was better suited for Harte's own journal, the ''Overland Monthly''.&lt;ref name=Tarnoff188&gt;Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 188. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared there under its original title, "Plain Language from Truthful James" in the September 1870 issue. Its adapted name, "The [[paganism|Heathen]] Chinee", (though it echoed Harte's phrases "the heathen Chinee" and "that heathen Chinee" in the poems text) became a title in a republication in a Boston newspaper in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David. ''China and the International System, 1840-1949: Power, Presence, and Perceptions in a Century of Humiliation''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2008: 60–61. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7627-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was republished several times within a short period, including in ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'', ''[[New York Tribune]]'', ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', ''[[Providence Journal]]'', ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', and ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' (published twice). The poem was also included in a book by Harte titled ''Poems'', released in January 1871. Several periodicals and books would republish the poem with illustrations.&lt;ref name="Railton" /&gt; 

In April 1870, [[James Thomas Fields]] had published a collection of Harte's stories, ''[[The Luck of Roaring Camp]] and Other Sketches'' through the [[Ticknor and Fields|Fields, Osgood, &amp; Co.]] imprint.&lt;ref name=Powers289/&gt;After the sudden success of "The Heathen Chinee", Fields rushed a to produce a collection of Harte's poetry in time for the Christmas market. That book sold out of its first six editions in five days.&lt;ref name=Tarnoff188/&gt;

The character of Ah Sin was revived for a theatrical play co-written by Harte and Twain, ''Ah Sin''.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 241. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two writers had a rift by February 1877 just before completing a final draft. Twain took over the project and, as he wrote to [[William Dean Howells]], he "left hardly a foot-print of Harte in it".&lt;ref&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 127. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harte nevertheless attended the play's opening at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on May 7, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Nissen, Axel. ''Bret Harte: Prince and Pauper''. University Press of Mississippi, 2000: 158. {{ISBN|1-57806-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Harte used the characters of both Truthful James and Ah Sin in his poem "Free Silver at Angel's", a satirical response to the silver plank in the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 214. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, when asked about the original poem in later years, Harte called the poem "trash", and "the worst [[poem]] I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote."&lt;ref name="Scharnhorst" /&gt;

==Response==
[[File:The Heathen Chinee - Currier &amp; Ives c.1871.jpg|thumb|left|c.1871 Currier &amp; Ives lithograph]]
"Plain Language from Truthful James" (or "The Heathen Chinee") was very popular among general readers. One New York newspaper reported on the frenzy over the poem: "Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, of high and low degree, swarming about a shop-window, pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing our way through the crowd, we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'"&lt;ref name=Ott200&gt;Ott, John. ''Manufacturing the Modern Patron in Victorian California: Cultural Philanthropy, Industrial Capital, and Social Authority''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2014: 200. {{ISBN|9781409463344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem's popularity came, in part, from the ambiguity over its race-related message. The narrator implies that the cheating of the Chinese man was no worse than that of the white man,&lt;ref name=Powers289/&gt; but the irony was too subtle for general readers. The message matched one Harte had written elsewhere in exposing white people's hypocrisy. As he wrote later, the Chinese "did as the Caucasian did in all respects, and, being more patient and frugal, did it a little better".&lt;ref name=Tarnoff188/&gt; Harte repeatedly opposed anti-Asian discrimination since as early as 1863, both privately and publicly. In 1866, for example, he wrote a letter defending the "peaceable citizens" of [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]] who were "patient under abuse, and that patience, I am ashamed to say, they have to exercise continually in California".&lt;ref name=Ott200/&gt; After the discovery of a murdered woman in Chinatown, whose cause of death was uncertain, Harte wrote, "as her head was caved in it is thought by some physicians that she died of galloping Christianity of the malignant California type".&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff, Ben. ''The Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature''. New York: The Penguin Press, 2014: 187. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this vein, Harte intended "Plain Language from Truthful James" to be a satire of the prevalent prejudice among [[Irish people|Irish]] laborers in northern California against the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese immigrants]] competing for the same work. However, the predominantly [[White American|white]] [[American middle class|middle-class]] readership of the ''Overland'' and the periodicals that reprinted it interpreted and embraced the poem as mocking the Chinese. These immigrants had been drawn in by the [[California Gold Rush]] and a boom in labor jobs, but relations with  American-born citizens were tense. The more recent economic downturn in California had made tensions even worse.&lt;ref name=Powers289/&gt; Readers took certain phrases of the poem out of context, including "we are ruined by Chinese cheap labor!", and used the poem to reinforce their own racism.&lt;ref name=Ott201&gt;Ott, John. ''Manufacturing the Modern Patron in Victorian California: Cultural Philanthropy, Industrial Capital, and Social Authority''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2014: 201. {{ISBN|9781409463344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was also frequently parodied. The poem "Three Aces", signed "Carl Byng", was published in the ''Buffalo Express'' in December 1870, not long after "Plain Language from Truthful James" first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 200. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was widely attributed to Mark Twain and labeled a "feeble imitation" of Harte.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Ron. ''Mark Twain: A Life''. New York: Free Press, 2005: 293. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-4899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain angrily denied the charge and demanded a retraction, writing to the editor [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], "I am not in the imitation business". Harte, in turn, targeted Twain years later in his 1893 story "Ingénue of the Sierras" by creating an unsavory character named "Charley Bing", modeled after Twain. The incident was one of several in a long rivalry between the two authors.&lt;ref&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 201. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, ''The Overland Monthly'' ran a poem making fun of Harte himself, who had moved to Europe in 1871 and never returned, for forgetting what life was like in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. ''Bret Harte: Opening the American Literary West''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000: 183–184. {{ISBN|0-8061-3254-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

"The Heathen Chinee", as the poem was most often called, was recited in public among opponents to [[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigration]], and [[Eugene Casserly]], a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from California who was "vehemently opposed to the admission of Chinese labour", apparently thanked Harte in writing for supporting his cause.&lt;ref name="Scharnhorst"&gt;Scharnhorst, Gary. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2934016  "Ways That Are Dark": Appropriations of Bret Harte's "Plain Language from Truthful James"]. ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Vol. 51, No. 3 (December 1996), pp. 377–399.&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion was furthered by the altered title, which allowed for a more literal reading, and the illustrations in later republications.&lt;ref name=Ott201/&gt; Harte's poem shaped the popular American conception of the Chinese more than any other writing at the time,&lt;ref name="Scharnhorst"/&gt; and made him the most popular literary figure in America in 1870.&lt;ref name="Railton" /&gt; The poem was especially relevant to Harte's fame as his other popular works "[[The Luck of Roaring Camp]]" and "[[The Outcasts of Poker Flat]]" which were originally published without the author's name.&lt;ref name=Scharnhorst52/&gt;

It inspired a series of west coast songwriters, for example, to produce songs which looked at Chinese immigrants through negative stereotypes and questioned their place in America. Some used Harte's poem word-for-word.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Krystyn R. ''Yellowface: Creating the Chinese in American Popular Music and Performance, 1850–1920s''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2005: 38–40. {{ISBN|0-8135-3506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1875, Union Porcelain Works in [[Long Island]] announced the release of a pitcher decorated with figures from "The Heathen Chinee". The title character was depicted with four aces falling from his sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;Frelinghuysen, Alice Cooney. ''American Porcelain, 1770-1920''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1989: 183. {{ISBN|0-87099-540-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence continued for decades and spread into other authors' writings. In 1895, for example, [[Adeline Knapp]] published her short story "The Ways That Are Dark", quoting a line from the poem. In 1931, [[Earl Derr Biggers]] considered the same quote from the poem as a title for his sixth [[Charlie Chan]] novel, inspired by a movie studio executive's suggestion, "Incidentally, could you use the Bret Harte—heathen Chinee phrase of 'Ways that are dark' as a possible title for some forthcoming exploits?"&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Yunte. ''Charlie Chan: The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous with American History''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010: 131. {{ISBN|978-0-393-06962-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Townsend]] used the same line for his anti-Chinese book ''[[Ways That Are Dark]]''.

'''Turks in Ireland''' ({{lang-tr|İrlanda Türkleri}}, {{lang-ga|Turcaigh in Éirinn}}) are [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] having been born elsewhere, or are Irish-born, but have Turkish roots. By Turkish roots, this could mean roots linking back to [[Turkey]], the island of [[Cyprus]] or the communities of the [[Turkish diaspora]].

The Turkish embassy may have an investment in down-playing the number of Turks in Ireland given the negative reception of [[Turks in Europe|Turks in other European countries]], such as [[Turks in Germany|German Turks]], [[Turks in the Netherlands|Dutch-Turks]] and [[Turks in France|French-Turks]].&lt;ref name="Lacey 2007 loc=154"/&gt; Thus, overall the number of Turkish descendants living in Ireland is estimated at 2,000-3,000.&lt;ref name="Lacey 2007 loc=154"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4343">The '''Yaaku''', also called '''Mukogodo''', are a people living in the Mukogodo forest west of [[Mount Kenya]], a division of [[Laikipia District Kenya|Laikipia County]] in the [[Rift Valley Province|former Rift Valley Province]], [[Kenya]].

==Etymology==
The name Yaaku is said to be a Southern Nilotic term for hunting people while Mukogodo is a Yaakunte word meaning people who live in rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Yaaku speakers moved into Kenya from southern Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mukogodo Assimilation===  
When the Yaaku community first entered the territory they would occupy, they met a people who mostly lived by hunting and gathering. This community lived in caves and the Yaaku came to call them Mukogodo, a name which means people who live in rocks in Yaakunte.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Interaction==
The Yaaku community was later assimilated by another food producing people, a process that happened over a long period of time. During this period, the Yaaku speaking Mukogodo maintained their way of life and the Yaakunte language.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
===Maasai Assimilation===
The Yaaku assimilated to the [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in the first half of the twentieth century (1920's and 30's), although some still keep bees. The reason for this transition is mostly one of social prestige. The Maasai look down upon [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples, calling them [[Dorobo]] ('the ones without cattle'), and many Yaaku consider the Maasai culture superior to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adoption of Maasai Language====
As a result of the decision to transition to pastoralism, the Yaaku largely gave up their [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]] for the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] [[Maasai language]] between 1925 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Mhando, J., Safeguarding Endangered Oral Traditions In East Africa, Nationl Museums of Kenya [https://ich.unesco.org/doc/src/00374-EN.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;
