{{Close Relationships}}'''Abusive power and control''' (also '''controlling behavior''', '''coercive control''' and '''sharp power''') is the way that an [[Abusive|abusive person]] gains and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]] and control over another person, as a victim, in order to subject that person to [[Psychological abuse|psychological]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], [[Sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[financial abuse]]. The motivations of the abuser are varied, such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[envy]] or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism|economic abuse]] thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel'']. Women's Domestic Abuse Helpline. Retrieved December 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the abuser is to control and [[intimidate]] the victim or to [[Social influence|influence]] them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Cory p. 30"&gt;Jill Cory; Karen McAndless-Davis.

WomanKind Press; 1 January 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-9686016-0-0}}. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulators]] and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including [[positive reinforcement]] (such as [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], [[flattery]], [[ingratiation]], [[love bombing]], [[smiling]], [[gift]]s, attention), [[negative reinforcement]], intermittent or partial reinforcement, [[Punishment (psychology)|psychological punishment]] (such as [[nagging]], [[silent treatment]], [[profanity|swearing]], threats, [[intimidation]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[guilt trip]]s, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as [[verbal abuse]] or [[explosive anger]]).&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators|vulnerabilities]] of the victim are exploited with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets.&lt;ref name=braiker/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People |first=George K|last=Simon |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-935166-30-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kantor&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People |first=Martin|last=Kantor |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-275-98798-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traumatic bonding]] can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of [[Reward system|reward]] and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a [[climate of fear]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]], [[gaslighting]], [[mind games]], [[lie|lying]], [[disinformation]], [[propaganda]], [[destabilisation]] and [[divide and rule]] are other strategies that are often used. The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help disorientate them.

Certain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people.

== Personality psychology ==
In the study of [[personality psychology]], certain [[personality disorders]] display characteristics involving the need to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] or control over others:&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Randy J., and [[David M. Buss]]. Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Those with [[antisocial personality disorder]] tend to display [[superficial charm|glibness]] and a [[grandiose]] sense of [[self-worth]]. Due to their [[shallow affect]] and lack of [[remorse]] or [[empathy]], they are well suited to con and/or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others into complying with their wishes. 
* Those with [[histrionic personality disorder]] need to be the [[attention seeking|center of attention]]; and in turn, draw people in so they may use (and eventually dispose of) their relationship.  
* Those with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] have an inflated self-importance, hypersensitivity to [[criticism]] and a sense of [[entitlement]] that compels them to [[persuade]] others to comply with their requests. To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their vulnerable [[true selves]], [[narcissists]] need to control others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]] seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those with [[sadistic personality disorder]] derive pleasure from the distress caused by their aggressive, demeaning and cruel behavior towards others. They have poor ability to control their reactions and become enraged by minor disturbances, with some sadists being more severely abusive. They use a wide range of behaviors to inappropriately control others, ranging from [[hostility|hostile glances]], [[threat]]s, [[humiliation]], [[coercion]], and restricting others' [[autonomy]]. Often the purpose of their behavior is to control and intimidate others.&lt;ref name="Raine pp. 126-128"&gt;Adrian Raine; José Sanmartin.&lt;/ref&gt; The sadistic individual are likely rigid in their beliefs, [[prejudice|intolerant]] of other [[race (human classification)|races]] or other "[[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]s", [[authoritarian]], and [[wikt:malevolent|malevolent]]. They may seek positions in which they are able to exert power over others, such as a [[judge]], [[army]] [[sergeant]] or [[psychiatrist]] who misuse their positions of power to control or brutalize others. For instance, a psychiatrist may institutionalize a patient by misusing [[mental health law|mental health legislation]].&lt;ref name="Raine pp. 126-128" /&gt;

== Control freaks==
{{Main|Control freak}}
Control freaks are often [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionists]]&lt;ref&gt;Michelle N. Lafrance, ''Women and Depression'' (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; defending themselves against their own inner [[vulnerabilities]] in the belief that if they are not in total control they risk exposing themselves once more to childhood [[angst]].&lt;ref&gt;Art Horn, ''Face It'' (2004) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and [[Coercion|pressure]] others to change so as to avoid having to change themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and use power over others to escape an inner emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly and Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; When a control freak's pattern is broken, the controller is left with a terrible feeling of powerlessness but feeling their pain and fear brings them back to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Evans, ''Controlling People'' (Avon 2002) p. 129 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of personality-type theory, control freaks are very much the [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A]] personality, driven by the need to dominate and control.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Holmes/Dan Wilson, ''Pains in the Office'' (2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; An obsessive need to control others is also associated with [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Stout]], ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological manipulation==
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators control their victims:&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or smile, and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
*[[Reinforcement#Schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], [[explosive anger]], or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

Manipulators may have:&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt;
* a strong need to attain feelings of power and superiority in relationships with others
* a want and need to feel in control
* a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of [[self-esteem]].

===Emotional blackmail===
{{Main|Emotional blackmail}}
Emotional blackmail is a term coined by psychotherapist Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that [[fear]], [[obligation]] and guilt (FOG) are the [[Transactional analysis|transactional dynamics]] at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics are useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R. Skip|title=Emotional Blackmail: Fear, Obligation and Guilt (FOG) |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/emotional-blackmail-fear-obligation-and-guilt-fog|website=[[BPDFamily.com]]|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Susan Forward/Donna Frazier, ''Emotional Blackmail'' (London 1997) p. 28, 82, 145, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different levels of demands - demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal [[integrity]], demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

===Silent treatment===
{{Main|Silent treatment}}
The silent treatment is sometimes used as a control mechanism.  When so used, it constitutes a [[passive-aggressive]] action characterized by the coupling of nonverbal but nonetheless unambiguous indications of the presence of negative emotion with the refusal to discuss the scenario triggering those emotions and, when those emotions' source is unclear to the other party, occasionally the refusal to clarify it or even to identify that source at all.  As a result, the perpetrator of the silent treatment denies the victim both the opportunity to negotiate an after-the-fact settlement of the grievance in question and the ability to modify his/her future behavior to avoid giving further offense.  In especially severe cases, even if the victim gives in and accedes to the perpetrator's initial demands, the perpetrator may continue the silent treatment so as to deny the victim feedback indicating that those demands have been satisfied.  The silent treatment thereby enables its perpetrator to cause hurt, [[Attention seeking|obtain ongoing attention]] in the form of repeated attempts by the victim to restore dialogue, maintain a position of power through creating uncertainty over how long the verbal silence and associated impossibility of resolution will last, and derive the satisfaction that the perpetrator associates with each of these consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Petra Boynton The Telegraph (26 Apr 2013) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10020662/Silent-treatment-how-to-snap-him-out-of-it.html Silent treatment: how to snap him out of it]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love bombing===
{{Main|Love bombing}}
The expression has been used to describe the tactics used by [[pimps]] and [[Gang|gang members]] to control their victims,&lt;ref&gt;''Gangs and Girls: Understanding Juvenile Prostitution'', Michel Dorais, Patrice Corriveau, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Jan 1, 2009, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to describe the behavior of an abusive [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]] who tries to win the confidence of a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ Red Flag of a Narcissist #1: Love Bombing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823040834/http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ |date=2015-08-23 }}; [https://www.firstwivesworld.com/index.php/my-narcissistic-ex-husband/item/8959-what-is-love-bombing? My Narcissistic Ex-Husband]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 16 February 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-38989935|title= Helen Bailey murder trial: Ian Stewart 'grossly deceived' author|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 16 February 2017|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC | accessdate= 22 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind games===
{{Main|Mind games}}
One sense of mind games is a largely [[consciousness|conscious]] struggle for psychological [[one-upmanship]], often employing [[passive–aggressive behavior]] to specifically demoralize or dis-empower the thinking subject, making the aggressor look superior; also referred to as "power games".&lt;ref&gt;Gita Mammen, ''After Abuse'' (2006) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intimate relationships]], mind games can be used to [[gaslighting|undermine one partner's belief in the validity of their own perceptions]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen J, Ferraro, ''Neither Angels nor Demons'' (2006) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Personal experience may be denied and driven from memory;&lt;ref&gt;[[R. D. Laing]], ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and such abusive mind games may extend to [[denial]] of the victim's reality, [[social undermining]], and the [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivializing]] of what is felt to be important.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Maguire, ''Where there's a Will there's a Way'' (London 2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes have equal opportunities for such verbal coercion,&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (London 1997) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; which may be carried out unconsciously as a result of the need to maintain one's own self-deception.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divide and conquer===
{{Main article|Divide and rule|Narcissistic parent|Narcissism in the workplace}}
A primary strategy the [[narcissist]] uses to assert control, particularly within their family, is to create divisions among individuals. This weakens and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolates]] them, making it easier for the narcissist to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and dominate. Some are favoured, others are [[scapegoated]]. Such dynamics can play out in a workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt;Hall J [http://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/03/27/its-you-and-me-baby-narcissist-head-games/ It’s You and Me Baby: Narcissist Head Games] The Narcissist Family Files 27 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In an intimate relationship==
{{main|Intimate relationship|Battered person syndrome|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence|}}

===Background===
The power and control "wheel" was developed in 1982 by the Domestic Abuse Program in Minneapolis to explain the nature of abuse, to delineate the forms of abuse used to control another person, and to educate people with the goal of stopping violence and abuse. The model is used in many batterer intervention programs, and is known as the [[Duluth model]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Joan McClennen PhD. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nHHWSsUvXwwC&amp;pg=PA147 Social Work and Family Violence: Theories, Assessment, and Intervention]''. Springer Publishing Company; 8 February 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-1133-3}}. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Power and control is generally present with violent physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7"&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf ''Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence.''] World Health Organization. 2013. {{ISBN|978-92-4-156462-5}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control development===
Often the abusers are initially attentive, [[Superficial charm|charming]] and loving, gaining the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] of the individual that will ultimately become the victim, also known as the survivor. When there is a connection and a degree of trust, the abusers become unusually involved in their partner's feelings, thoughts and actions.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; Next, they set petty rules and exhibit "[[pathological jealousy]]". A [[Operant conditioning|conditioning process]] begins with alternation of loving followed by [[abusive]] behavior. According to ''Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse'', "These serve to confuse the survivor leading to potent conditioning processes that impact on the survivor's [[Self-concept|self-structure]] and [[Schema (psychology)|cognitive schemas]]." The abuser [[Psychological projection|projects]] responsibility for the abuse on to the victim, or survivor, and the denigration and negative projections become incorporated into the survivor's [[self-image]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt;

[[Traumatic bonding]] occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent [[reinforcement]] of reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"/&gt;

Controlling abusers use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their partners. According to Jill Cory and Karen McAndless-Davis, authors of ''When Love Hurts: A Woman's Guide to Understanding Abuse in Relationships'': Each of the tactics within the power and control wheel are used to "maintain power and control in the relationship. No matter what tactics your partner uses, the effect is to control and [[intimidate]] you or to influence you to feel that you do not have an equal voice in the relationship."&lt;ref name="Cory p. 30" /&gt;

====Coercion and threats====
{{main|Coercion|threats}}

A tool for exerting control and power is the use of threats and coercion. The victim may be subject to threats that they will be left, hurt, or reported to welfare. The abuser may threaten that they will commit [[suicide]]. They may also coerce them to perform illegal actions or to drop charges that they may have against their abuser.&lt;ref name="Duluth model"&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/pdf/PowerandControl.pdf ''Power and Control.''] Duluth Model. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strangulation (domestic violence)|Strangulation]], a particularly pernicious abusive behavior in which the abuser literally has the victim’s life in his hands, is an extreme form of abusive control. Sorenson and colleagues have called strangulation the domestic violence equivalent of waterboarding, which is widely considered to be a form of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Joshi M, Sorenson SB. “Do you know what it feels like to drown?”: Strangulation as coercive control in intimate relationships. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 2014; 38, 124-137&lt;/ref&gt;

At its most effective, the abuser creates intimidation and [[fear]] through [[Operant conditioning|unpredictable and inconsistent behavior]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson"/&gt; Absolute control may be sought by any of four types of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadists]]: explosive, enforcing, tyrannical, or spineless sadists. The victims are at risk of [[anxiety]], [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[shame]], [[low self-esteem]] and [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson p. 25"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

====Intimidation====
{{main|Intimidation}}
Abused individuals may be intimidated by the brandishing of weapons, destruction of their property or other things, or use of gestures or looks to create fear.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt; For example, threatening to use a gun or simply displaying the weapon is a form of intimidation and coercive control.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Schut RA. Nonfatal gun use in intimate partner violence: a systematic review of the literature. Trauma Violence &amp; Abuse. 2016 Sep 14. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic abuse====
{{main|Economic abuse}}
An effective means of ensuring control and power over another is to control their access to money. One method is to prevent the abusee from getting or retaining a job. Controlling their access to money can also be done by withholding information and access to family income, taking their money, requiring the person to ask for money, giving them an allowance, or filing a [[power of attorney]] or [[conservatorship]], particularly in the case of [[Elder financial abuse|economic abuse of the elderly]].&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Emotional abuse====
{{main|Psychological abuse}}
Emotional abuse include [[name-calling]], playing [[mind games]], [[Victim blaming|putting the victim down]], or [[humiliating]] the individual. The goals are to make the person feel bad about themselves, feel [[Guilt trip|guilty]] or [[Gaslighting|think that they are crazy]].&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Isolation====
{{main|Isolation to facilitate abuse}}
Another element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7" /&gt; Isolation includes controlling a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go, and any other method to limit their access to others. It may also include limiting what material is read.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt; It can include insisting on knowing where they are and requiring permission for medical care. The abuser exhibits hypersensitive and reactive jealousy.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7" /&gt;

====Minimizing, denying and blaming====
{{main|Minimisation (psychology)|Denial|Victim blaming}}
The abuser may deny the abuse occurred to attempt to place the responsibility for their behavior on the victim. Minimizing concerns or the degree of the abuse is another aspect of this control.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Using children and pets====
Children may be used to exert control by the abuser threatening to take the children or making them feel guilty about the children. It could include [[harassing]] them during visitation or using the children to relay messages. Another controlling tactic is abusing pets.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Using privilege====
{{main|Privilege (social inequality)}}
Using "privilege" means that the abuser defines the roles in the relationship, makes the important decisions, treats the individual like a servant and acts like the "master of the castle".&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

==In the workplace==
{{See also|Workplace bullying}}
A power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Duthie_workplace-power-control-wheel_2013.pdf Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
{{Main|Bullying}}
An essential prerequisite of bullying is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Children who are bullying or being bullied | work =Cambridgeshire County Council: Children and families | publisher =Cambridgeshire County Council | date =2013-07-24 | url =http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | accessdate =2013-10-28 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029215401/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | archive-date =2013-10-29 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ericson | first =Nels | title =Addressing the Problem of Juvenile Bullying | journal =OJJDP Fact Sheet #FS-200127| volume =27 | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention | date =June 2001 | url =https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace psychopaths==
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains power:&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''Entry''' – psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. 
#  '''Assessment''' – psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks)
#  '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]]''' – psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]" where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.
#  '''Confrontation''' – the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain his/her agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron
#  '''Ascension''' – your role as a patron in the psychopath's quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

==Caring professions==
According to anti-bullying author and activist [[Tim Field]], bullies are attracted to the caring professions, such as medicine, by the opportunities to exercise power over [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] clients, and over vulnerable employees and students.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7340.786/a |title=Bullying in medicine |year=2002 |last1=Field |first1=T. |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7340 |pages=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional abuse==
{{main|Institutional abuse}}
Institutional abuse is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) from a system of power.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L. |author2=A. Mooney |author3=M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and hunger, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking}}
The use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of [[psychological stress]] induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and [[indoctrination]].&lt;ref name=Hopper&gt;Hopper, E. and Hidalgo, J. (2006). Invisible chains: Psychological coercion of human trafficking victims. "Intercultural Human Rights Law, 1", 185-209.&lt;/ref&gt; During the initiation phase, traffickers use [[foot-in-the-door]] techniques of [[persuasion]] to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt; Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of [[childhood abuse]] to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, B. and Butler, L. D. (2013). Running a gauntlet: A review of victimization and violence in the pre-entry, post-entry, and peri-/post-exit periods of commercial sexual exploitation. ''Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, Advance online publication.'' {{DOI|10.1037/a0032977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of [[learned helplessness]] for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], or withhold food or sleep.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and [[self-blame]], anger and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], and sleep disturbances, [[PTSD]], numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Segerstron&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segerstron | first1 = S. C. | last2 = Miller | first2 = G.

(2006). Stolen Smiles: A summary report on the physical and psychological health consequences of women and adolescents trafficked in Europe. ''The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine: Daphne'', 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking because they are so young. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy physical and mental health of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=Rafferty2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2008 | title = The impact of trafficking on children: Psychological and social policy perspectives | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 13–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stockholm syndrome]] is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.&lt;ref name=Rafferty1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2013 | title = Child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation: A review of promising prevention policies and programs | url = | journal = American Journal of Orthopsychiatry | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 559–575 | doi = 10.1111/ajop.12056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oppression==
{{Main|Oppression}}
Oppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729230603/http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/oppression definition from Merriam Webster Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zersetzung==
{{Main|Zersetzung}}
The practice of repression in Zersetzung comprised extensive and secret methods of control and psychological manipulation, including personal relationships of the target, for which the [[Stasi]] relied on its network of [[Informal collaborators (East Germany)|informal collaborators]],&lt;ref&gt;Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic: [http://www.bstu.bund.de/EN/MinistryOfStateSecurity/UnofficialCollaboratorsOfMfS/_node.html The Unofficial Collaborators (IM) of the MfS]&lt;/ref&gt; (in German ''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' or ''IM''), the State's power over institutions, and on [[operational psychology]]. Using targeted psychological attacks the Stasi tried to deprive a dissident of any chance of a "hostile action".

==Serial killers==
{{Main|Serial killer}}
The main objective for one type of serial killer is to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes [[child abuse|abused as children]], leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers [[sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that [[rape]] is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egger|first=Steven A.|year=2000|title=Why Serial Murderers Kill: An Overview|journal=Contemporary Issues Companion: Serial Killers}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See article [[causes of sexual violence]] for the differences regarding anger rape, power rape, and sadistic rape.) [[Ted Bundy]] is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.{{sfn|Peck|2000|p=255}}

==Law==
In December 2015, controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship was made illegal in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-guidance-framework-controlling-or-coercive-behaviour-in-an-intimate-or-family-relationship Statutory guidance framework: controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship] 05 Dec 2015 ''[[gov.uk]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf Grünbaum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|uː|n|b|ɔː|m}}; May 15, 1923 – November 15, 2018) was a German-American [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and a critic of [[psychoanalysis]], as well as [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of science.  He was the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1960 until his death, and also served as Co-Chairman of its [[Center for Philosophy of Science]] (from 1978), Research Professor of Psychiatry (from 1979), and Primary Research Professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science (from 2006). His works include ''[[Philosophical Problems of Space and Time]]'' (1963), ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984), and ''[[Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1993).

==Life and career==
Adolf Grünbaum's family left [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 and emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/pitt-philosophy-professor-adolf-grünbaum-honored-german-ministry-foreign-affairs|title= Pitt Philosophy Professor Adolf Grünbaum Is Honored by German Ministry of Foreign Affairs |newspaper=Pitt Chronicle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He received a B.A. with twofold High Distinction in Philosophy and in Mathematics from [[Wesleyan University]], [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[Connecticut]] in 1943. 

During the second world war, Grünbaum was trained at Camp Ritchie, Maryland, and thus was one of the [[Ritchie Boys]]. He was stationed in Berlin and interrogated highly-placed Nazis, returning to the United States in 1946.&lt;ref name="Oral history interview with Adolf Grünbaum"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oral history interview with Adolf Grünbaum |url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn163713 |website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grünbaum obtained both his M.S. in physics (1948) and his Ph.D in philosophy (1951) from [[Yale University]]. He was a chaired professor of Philosophy at [[Lehigh University]], [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] (1956–1960), after rising through the ranks there, starting in 1950, becoming a full professor in 1955.

In the fall of 1960, Grünbaum left Lehigh University to join the faculty of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he became the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy.  In that year, he also became the founding Director of that University's Center for Philosophy of Science, serving as Director until 1978.  He and the colleagues he recruited then built world-class [[Philosophy]] and [[History and Philosophy of Science]] Departments at the university. Several of these colleagues had come from [[Yale University]]'s Philosophy Department, starting in 1962. During this recruitment period the University of Pittsburgh appointed [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Wilfrid Sellars]], Richard Gale, [[Nuel Belnap]], [[Alan Ross Anderson]], and Gerald Massey, among others.

In 2003, Grünbaum resigned from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, while retaining his lifetime tenured Mellon Chair and all of his other affiliations at that university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Grünbaum resigns from philosophy department faculty| date=May 1, 2013 | url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=1278 | publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]| accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grünbaum served as President of both the [[American Philosophical Association]] (Eastern Division) and the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] (two terms). He was the director of the [[Center for Philosophy of Science]] from 1960 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/past_officers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was the president of the [[Division of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science|Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science]] of the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]] (IUHPS) in 2004–2005 and then automatically became president of the IUHPS from 2006 to 2007. He is also a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

He received the Senior U.S. Scientist Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany, 1985), the Fregene Prize for science from the Italian Parliament (1998) and the [[Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal]] for outstanding achievement from [[Yale University]] (1990). Also, in May 1995, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Konstanz]] in [[Germany]] and, in 2013, an honorary doctorate of philosophy from the [[University of Cologne]] in [[Germany]]. In 2013, he received the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Großes Bundesverdienstkreuz]] from the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/pitt-philosophy-professor-adolf-grünbaum-honored-german-ministry-foreign-affairs|title= Pitt Philosophy Professor Adolf Grünbaum Is Honored by German Ministry of Foreign Affairs |newspaper=Pitt Chronicle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grünbaum was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/mar2002/feature3.html&lt;/ref&gt; He died in November 2018 at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hps.pitt.edu/news/it-sadness-we-report-our-colleague-adolf-gr-nbaum-died-november-15-2018 University of Pittsburgh: Adolf Grünbaum death notice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Grünbaum was the author of nearly 400 articles and book chapters as well as books on space-time and the critique of psychoanalysis.  He is often viewed as part of the American brand of [[logical empiricism]], associated especially with [[Hans Reichenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Grünbaum did not embrace the prevailing — especially among physical scientists — [[Karl Popper|Popperian]] philosophy of science, leading to some notoriety in the 1960s after he was ridiculed in print by the iconic physicist [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref name="gleick"&gt;James Gleick, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman (New York: Pantheon Books, 1992, pp. 123-124)&lt;/ref&gt; A much-quoted exchange followed Grünbaum's neo-[[Philosophy of space and time#Leibniz_and_Newton|Leibnizian]] suggestion that the [[flow of time]] might be an illusion only in conscious entities, in which Feynman asked whether dogs, then cockroaches, were sufficiently conscious entities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gold (ed.), ''The Nature of Time'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly as a mark of further disdain,&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Bondi, "Thomas Gold. 22 May 1920 — 22 June 2004," Biographical Memoirs of the Fellows of the Royal Society, 2006 52, 117-135&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman refused to let his name be printed, becoming instead the easily recognizable "Mr. X".&lt;ref name="gleick" /&gt;

Some 40 years later, writer [[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]] would characterize Grünbaum as, in the 1950s, "the foremost thinker about the subtleties of space and time," and as, by the 2000s, "arguably the greatest living philosopher of science." Holt portrays a rationalist Grünbaum who rejects any hint of mysteriousness in the cosmos (a "great rejector").&lt;ref&gt;Jim Holt, Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story (New York: Norton, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agency''' is the capacity of an [[Free will|actor]] to act in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503–509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synofzik, M., Vosgerau, G. and Newen, A., 2008. Beyond the comparator model: a multifactorial two-step account of agency. Consciousness and Cognition, 17(1), pp. 219–239.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and [[moral agency]] is therefore a distinct concept. In [[sociology]], an agent is an individual engaging with the [[social structure]]. Notably, though, the primacy of [[structure and agency|social structure vs. individual capacity]] with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] an agent may possess.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/ |title=Action |last1=Wilson |first1=George |last2=Shpall |first2=Samuel |date=4 April 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human agency==
{{See also|Action (philosophy)}}
Agency is contrasted to objects reacting to [[Natural phenomenon|natural forces]] involving only unthinking [[determinism|deterministic]] processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of [[free will]], the [[philosophical]] [[doctrine]] that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. ''How'' humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.

The capacity of a human to act as an agent is [[person]]al to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a [[moral]] component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask ''should this have occurred?'' in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet [[Shoemaker–Levy]] on [[Jupiter]].

===In philosophy===
The philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is [[action theory (philosophy)|action theory]]. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel's [[Geist]] and Marx's [[universal class]] are [[idealist]] and [[materialist]] expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. Also look at the debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of [[David Hume|Hume]], between [[determinism]] and [[indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]].

Structure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the [[Marxist]] conception, "agency" refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas "structure" refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have.

===In other sciences===
Other notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics:

'''In economics ([[contract theory]])''':

''Economic agency'' is an internal instrumentality through which external influences operate mechanistically on action. Internal agency events are a reflection of the impact of external environments from which causal attributes are ignored, and the self-system is simply a repository and conduit for environmental forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=S. A.|title=The Economic Theory of Agency: The Principal's Problem|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=134–139|jstor=1817064|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In psychology''':

The term of [[Agency (psychology)|agency]] used in different fields of [[psychology]] with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Nádasdy|first2=Zoltán|last3=Csibra|first3=Gergely|last4=Bíró|first4=Szilvia|date=1995|title=Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/001002779500661H|journal=Cognition|volume=56|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00661-h|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|date=2003|title=Teleological reasoning in infancy: the naı̈ve theory of rational action|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303001281|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=287–292|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00128-1|issn=1364-6613|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of [[Agency (psychology)|agents]]. This topic is thoroughly investigated by [[Developmental psychology|developmental]] and [[Comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]] to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous [[Intelligent agent|intelligent agency]] used in [[cybernetics]]. Agency can also imply the [[sense of agency]], that is the feeling of being in control.

''Emergent interactive agency'' defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=A.|title=Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=2|pages=21–41|url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1999AJSP.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2016|doi=10.1111/1467-839X.00024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura formulates his view of agency as a [[socio-cognitive]] one, where people are [[self-organizing]], proactive, [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulating]], and engage in [[self-reflection]], and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘[[Causality|reciprocal causation]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ Bormann, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In social cybernetics''':

''Autonomous agency'' is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self-organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency's behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, K.J., Yolles, M., Fink, G., Iles, P., 2016, The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Brudzewski''',&lt;ref&gt;Listed as "Brudzewski, Wojciech, [or] Wojciech z Brudzewa," in ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'', vol. 1, p. 353. Google Search, 29 November 2008, lists him as "Albert Brudzewski" (8,170), "Wojciech Brudzewski" (626), "Albert Blar" (611).&lt;/ref&gt; ''also'' '''Albert Blar (of Brudzewo)''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoFks1eW75oC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=albert+blar+Brudzewo&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0 Renaissance Culture in Poland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vK6ZAw76-2AC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=celtis+blar&amp;lr= Patronage and Humanist Literature in the Age of the Jagiellons]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Albert of Brudzewo''' or '''Wojciech Brudzewski''' (in [[Latin]], ''Albertus de Brudzewo''; c.1445&amp;ndash;c.1497) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[mathematics|mathematician]],  [[philosopher]] and [[diplomat]].

==Life==
Albert (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Wojciech''), who would sign himself "''de Brudzewo''" ("of Brudzewo"), was born about 1445, in [[Brudzewo, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Brudzewo]],&lt;ref&gt;It is not certain in ''which'' "Brudzewo" he was born:  probably the town in present-day [[Kalisz County]], though it may have been the town of the same name in present-day [[Turek County]], somewhat farther from Kalisz.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Kalisz]]. Scant information exists about his early life.  It is only known that as a 23-year-old he matriculated at the Kraków Academy (now [[Jagiellonian University]]), where he remained through nearly all his life, teaching there for two decades.  He served as the Academy's dean, as ''procurator'' (administrator of its property), and as head of the ''Bursa Hungarorum'' ("Hungarians' Dormitory").

Albert is remembered as a remarkable teacher.  At the Kraków Academy he impressed students by his extraordinary knowledge of literature, and taught mathematics and astronomy.  When in 1490 he became a [[bachelor of theology]], he also lectured on [[Aristotle]]'s philosophy.  These lectures were attended by [[Nicolaus Copernicus#Education|Nicolaus Copernicus]], who enrolled at the Academy in 1491.  A major accomplishment of Albert's was his modernization of the teaching of [[astronomy]] by introducing the most up-to-date  texts.

Albert was well versed in [[Georg von Peuerbach]]'s ''Theory of the Planets'' and [[Regiomontanus]]' ''Astronomical Tables''.  He was skeptical of the [[geocentric]] system.  He was the first to state that the [[Moon]] moves in an [[ellipse]] and always shows its same side to the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely]], ''Celestial Revolutionary: Copernicus, the Man and His Universe'', I.B. Tauris, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-78076-350-7}}, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

He drew up tables for calculating the positions of [[heavenly body|heavenly bodies]].  In 1482 he wrote a ''Commentum planetarium in theoricas Georgii Purbachii''—a commentary on [[Georg von Peuerbach]]'s text, ''New Theories of the Planets''—published in [[Milan]] by his pupil, Jan Otto de Kraceusae.

Besides [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], Albert's students included the mathematician [[Bernard Wapowski]] and the [[Germany|German]] poet and [[Renaissance humanist]], [[Conrad Celtis]], who in Kraków established the first [[Central Europe]]an [[literary society]], ''Sodalitas Litterana Vistulana''.

In 1495, at the behest of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Fryderyk Jagiellończyk (Frederick Jagiellon), Brudzewski moved to [[Vilnius]] as secretary to [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Aleksander Jagiellon]], who would later become King [[Alexander of Poland]].  He served the Grand Duke as a [[diplomat]]; one of his most important missions involved negotiations with [[Muscovy]]'s [[Tsar]] [[Ivan the Terrible]].  It was in [[Vilnius]] that Albert wrote his treatise, ''Conciliator'', whose original has yet to be found.

Albert of Brudzewo died in Vilnius.  The exact date of his death is not known; some sources state that he died at the age of fifty.

The '''American Philosophical Society''' ('''APS'''), founded in 1743 and located in [[Philadelphia]], is an eminent [[scholarly]] organization of international reputation that promotes useful knowledge in the sciences and humanities through excellence in scholarly research, professional meetings, publications, library resources, and community outreach. Considered the first learned society in the United States, it has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life for over 270&amp;nbsp;years.

Through research grants, published journals, the American Philosophical Society Museum, an extensive library, and regular meetings, the society continues to advance a variety of disciplines in the [[humanities]] and the sciences. [[Philosophical Hall]], now a museum, is located just east of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Independence National Historical Park]]; it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.

==History==
The '''Philosophical Society''', as it was originally called, was founded in 1743 by [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Alexander (lawyer)]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Bartram]], [[Philip Syng|Philip Syng, Jr.]] and others&lt;ref&gt;Duer, William Alexander. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwilliamale00duerw#page/4/mode/2up ''The life of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling, Major-General in the Army of the United States during the Revolution''] New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam for the New Jersey Historical Society, 1847. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/biography/14388.html "Philip Syng, Jr."], Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as an offshoot of an earlier club, the [[Junto (club)|Junto]]. It was founded two years after the [[University of Pennsylvania]], with which it remains closely tied.

[[File:American Philosophical Society Library.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Library Hall (2013)]]

Since its inception, the society attracted America's finest minds. Early members included [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=American Philosophical Society selected records, 1784–1954 | work= | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-philosophical-society-selected-records-10947 | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James McHenry]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Rittenhouse]], [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], [[Owen Biddle, Sr.|Owen Biddle]], [[Benjamin Rush]], [[James Madison]], [[Michael Hillegas]], [[John Marshall]], and [[John Andrews (clergyman)|John Andrews]]. The society also recruited members from other countries, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Baron von Steuben]], [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], and [[Princess Dashkova]].

By 1746 the society had lapsed into inactivity. In 1767, however, it was revived, and on January 2, 1769, it united with the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge under the name '''American Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge'''. Benjamin Franklin was elected the first president.&lt;ref&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the society maintained a standing Committee on American Improvements; one of its investigations was to study the prospects of a [[canal]] to connect the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrich|first=Carter|title=Government Promotion of American Canals and Railroads, 1800–1890|year=1974|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0837177731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal|canal]], which had been proposed by Thomas Gilpin,&amp;nbsp;Sr., would not become reality until the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozel |first=Scott M. |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C &amp; D Canal) |url=http://www.pennways.com/CD_Canal.html |work=PENNWAYS: Roads to the Future |publisher=Scott M.

After the [[American Revolution]], the society looked for [[leadership]] to [[Francis Hopkinson]], one of the signatories of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  Under his influence, the society received land from the government of [[Pennsylvania]], along with a plot of land in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] where Philosophical Hall now stands.

Illustrious names have continually been added to the membership roster, reflecting the society's scope. [[Charles Darwin]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz]], [[John James Audubon]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Maria Mitchell]], and [[Thomas Edison]] became members of the society. The society continues to attract names of high renown today, with a current membership list (as of the April 2005 elections) of 920&amp;nbsp;members, including 772&amp;nbsp;resident members (citizens or residents of the United States) and 148&amp;nbsp;foreign members representing more than two dozen countries.

Many members of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] were among the APS's first board members and contributors; today the APS and SOC still maintain an informal, collegial relationship.

==Awards==
In 1786, the society established the [[Magellanic Premium]], a prize for achievement in "navigation, [[astronomy]], or natural philosophy," the oldest scientific prize awarded by an American institution, which it still awards.  Other awards include the Barzun Prize for [[cultural history]], Judson Daland Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Clinical Investigation, the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (American Philosophical Society)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]], the [[Lashley Award]] for [[neurobiology]], the Lewis Award, and the Thomas Jefferson Medal for distinguished achievement in the arts, humanities, or social sciences.

==Publications==
The APS has published the ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' since 1771. Currently five issues appear each year.  The ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|Proceedings]]'' have appeared since 1838: they publish the papers delivered at the biannual meetings of the society.  The society has also published the collected papers of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Joseph Henry]], [[William Penn]], and [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]]. [[Jane Aitken]] bound some 400 volumes for the society.{{sfn|James|1971|p=26}}

{{main|Philosophical Hall}}
[[Philosophical Hall]], located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], at 104 South Fifth Street, between [[Chestnut Street (Philadelphia)|Chestnut]] and [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut]] Streets, immediately south of [[Old City Hall (Philadelphia)|Old City Hall]], was built in 1785–89 to house the society and was designed by Samuel Vaughan in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite philarch}} p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philarchmit&gt;{{cite philarchmit}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A third floor was added in 1890, to accommodate the expanding library, but was removed in 1948–50&lt;ref name=philarchmit /&gt; when the building was restored to its original appearance for the creation of [[Independence National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Webster, ''Philadelphia Preserved'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1976), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was opened to the public as The American Philosophical Society Museum, hosting revolving, thematic exhibitions that explore the intersections of history, art, and science. The museum features works of art, scientific instruments, original manuscripts, rare books, natural history specimens, and curiosities of all kinds from the APS's own collections, along with objects on loan from other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=American Philosophical Society Museum: About |publisher=ARTINFO |year=2008 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/22252/8770/about/american-philosophical-society-philadelphia/ |accessdate=2008-07-25 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library Hall===
In 1789–90, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (LCP) built its headquarters directly across 5th Street from APS. LCP sold its building in 1884, which was demolished for the expansion of the Drexel &amp; Company Building in 1887. This building itself was demolished in the mid-1950s, during the creation of Independence National Historical Park.

APS built a library on the site in 1958, and recreated the facade of the old LCP building.

===Benjamin Franklin Hall===
APS restored the former Farmers' &amp; Mechanics' Bank building at 425–29 Chestnut Street, which was built in 1854–5 to the design of John M. Gries in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite philarch}}, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a lecture hall. It is the site of meetings and most major events hosted or produced by the society.&lt;ref name=apsdir&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/about/directions "Directions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604120817/http://www.amphilsoc.org/about/directions |date=2013-06-04 }} on the APS website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richardson Hall===
[[Constance Coleman Richardson|Constance C.]] and Edgar P. Richardson Hall at 431 Chestnut Street, immediately west of Benjamin Franklin Hall, is the former Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities Building, which was built in 1871–73 and was designed by [[Addison Hutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite philarch}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  It now contains offices and the Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine.&lt;ref name=apsdir /&gt;

An '''anti-war movement''' (also ''antiwar'') is a [[social movement]], usually in opposition to a particular nation's decision to start or carry on an armed conflict, unconditional of a maybe-existing [[casus belli|just cause]]. The term can also refer to [[pacifism]], which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and [[peace movement]]s. Anti-war activists work through protest and other [[grassroots]] means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict.

==History of modern movements==
===American Revolutionary War===
Substantial opposition to British war intervention in America led the British House of Commons on 27 February 1782 to [[American Revolutionary War#North Ministry collapses|vote against further war in America]], paving the way for the [[Second Rockingham ministry]] and the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]].

===Antebellum Era United States===

Substantial anti-war sentiment developed in the United States during the period roughly falling between the end of the [[War of 1812]] and the commencement of the Civil War, or what is called the [[Antebellum Era in the United States|antebellum]] era (A similar movement developed in England during the same period). The movement reflected both strict [[pacifism|pacifist]] and more moderate [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] positions.  Many prominent intellectuals of the time, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] (''see'' ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'') and [[William Ellery Channing]] contributed literary works against war.  Other names associated with the movement include [[William Ladd]], [[Noah Worcester]], [[Thomas Cogswell Upham]] and [[Asa Mahan]]. Many peace societies were formed throughout the United States, the most prominent of which being the [[American Peace Society]].  Numerous periodicals (e.g., The Advocate of Peace) and books were also produced.  The ''Book of Peace'', an anthology produced by the American Peace Society in 1845, must surely rank as one of the most remarkable works of anti-war literature ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, George (ed), ''[https://archive.org/details/bookofpeacecolle00amerrich  The Book of Peace]''. American Peace Society, 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in this movement was the call for the establishment of an international court which would adjudicate disputes between nations.  Another distinct feature of antebellum anti-war literature was the emphasis on how war contributed to a moral decline and brutalization of society in general.

===American Civil War===
[[File:New York Draft Riots - fighting.jpg|thumb|200px|Rioters attack federal troops.]]
{{Further|Opposition to the American Civil War}}

A key event in the early history of the modern anti-war stance in [[literature]] and [[society]] was the [[American Civil War]], where it culminated in the candidacy of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] for [[President of the United States]] as a "Peace Democrat" against incumbent President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The outlines of the anti-war stance are seen: the argument that the costs of maintaining the present conflict are not worth the gains which can be made, the appeal to end the horrors of war, and the argument that war is being waged for the profit of particular interests. During the war, the [[New York Draft Riots]] were started as violent protests against [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s ''Enrollment Act of [[Conscription]]'' plan to draft men to fight in the war. The outrage over conscription was augmented by the ability to "buy" your way out; the amount of which could only be afforded by the wealthy. After the war, ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'' described the chaos and sense of death which resulted from the changing style of combat: away from the set engagement, and towards two armies engaging in continuous battle over a wide area.

===Second Boer War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Second Boer War}}

[[William Thomas Stead]] formed an organization against the [[Second Boer War]]: the [[Stop the War Committee]].

===World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Deserter'' by [[Boardman Robinson]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1916.]]
{{Further|Opposition to World War I}}
In Britain, in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at [[Tidworth Pennings]], near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the British Army [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the immenence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present) ''that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust-probably not more than one-quarter of us – learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.'' &lt;ref&gt;''Merely For the Record: The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; Having voiced these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from carrying out his duty in the First World War to the best of his abilities.

With the increasing mechanization of war, opposition to its horrors grew, particularly in the wake of the First World War. European [[avant-garde]] cultural movements such as [[Dada]] were explicitly anti-war.

The [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] gave the American authorities the right to close newspapers and jailed individuals for having anti-war views.

On June 16, 1918, [[Eugene V. Debs]] made an anti-war speech and was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917. He was convicted, sentenced to serve ten years in prison, but President [[Warren G. Harding]] commuted his sentence on December 25, 1921.

===Between the World Wars===
In 1924 Ernst Friedrich published ''Krieg dem Krieg!'' (''War Against War!''): an album of photographs drawn from German military and medical archives from the first world war. In ''[[Regarding the pain of others]]'' [[Susan Sontag|Sontag]] describes the book as 'photography as shock therapy' that was designed to 'horrify and demoralize'.

It was in the 1930s that the Western anti-war movement took shape, to which the political and organizational roots of most of the existing movement can be traced.  Characteristics of the anti-war movement included opposition to the corporate interests perceived as benefiting from war, to the [[status quo]] which was trading the lives of the young for the comforts of those who are older, the concept that those who were drafted were from poor families and would be fighting a war in place of privileged individuals who were able to avoid the draft and military service, and to the lack of input in decision making that those who would die in the conflict would have in deciding to engage in it.

In 1933, the [[Oxford Union]] resolved in its [[The King and Country debate|Oxford Pledge]], "That this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country."

Many war [[veteran]]s, including US General [[Smedley Butler]], spoke out against wars and war profiteering on their return to civilian life.

Veterans were still extremely cynical about the [[War#Theories for motivation|motivations]] for entering World War I, but many were willing to fight later in the [[Spanish Civil War]], indicating that [[pacifism]] was not always the motivation. These trends were depicted in novels such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' and ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]''.

===World War II===
[[Image:WHProtest1941.jpg|thumbnail|right|Protest at the White House by the [[American Peace Mobilization]].]]
{{Further|Opposition to World War II}}
Opposition to [[World War II]] was most vocal during its early period, and stronger still before it started while [[appeasement]] and [[isolationism]] were considered viable diplomatic options.  Communist-led organizations, including veterans of the Spanish Civil War,&lt;ref name="ALBA-vol_1941_02b"&gt;
[http://www.alba-valb.org/volpdf/vol_1941_02b.pdf Volunteer for Liberty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206011824/http://www.alba-valb.org/volpdf/vol_1941_02b.pdf |date=2006-12-06 }}, newsletter of the ''[[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]]'', February 1941, Volume III, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; opposed the war during the period of the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]] but then turned into hawks after Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]].

The war seemed, for a time, to set anti-war movements at a distinct social disadvantage; very few, mostly ardent [[pacifism|pacifists]], continued to argue against the war and its results at the time. However, the [[Cold War]] followed with the [[Western betrayal|post-war realignment]], and the opposition resumed.  The grim realities of modern combat, and the nature of mechanized society ensured that the anti-war viewpoint found presentation in ''[[Catch-22]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' and ''[[The Tin Drum]]''. This sentiment grew in strength as the Cold War seemed to present the situation of an unending series of conflicts, which were fought at terrible cost to the younger generations.

===Vietnam War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Vietnam War}}
[[File:Washington D.C. Anti-Vietnam Demonstration. U.S. Marshals bodily remove one of the protesters during the outbreak of... - NARA - 530620.tif|thumb|left|220px|U.S. Marshals arresting a Vietnam War protester in Washington, D.C., 1967]]
Organized opposition to U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] began slowly and in small numbers in 1964 on various college campuses in the United States and quickly as the war grew deadlier. In 1967 a coalition of antiwar activists formed the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] which organized several large anti-war demonstrations between the late-1960s and 1972. Counter-cultural songs, organizations, plays and other literary works encouraged a spirit of nonconformism, peace, and anti-establishmentarianism. This anti-war sentiment developed during a time of unprecedented [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|student activism]] and right on the heels of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and was reinforced in numbers by the demographically significant [[baby boomers]]. It quickly grew to include a wide and varied cross-section of Americans from all walks of life. The anti-Vietnam war movement is often considered to have been a major factor affecting America's involvement in the war itself. Many [[Vietnam veteran]]s, including the former [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and former U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and disabled veteran [[Ron Kovic]], spoke out against the Vietnam War on their return to the United States.

===South African Border War===
{{Main|South African resistance to war}}
Opposition to the [[South African Border War]] spread to a general resistance to the [[apartheid]] military. Organizations such as the [[End Conscription Campaign]] and Committee on South African War Resisters, were set up.  Many opposed the war at this time.

===2001 Afghanistan War===
[[File:June 22, 2007 protest in Quebec City against Canada's involvement in the Afghan war.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Québec City]] against the Canadian military involvement in [[Afghanistan]], 22 June 2007]]
{{Further|Opposition to the 2001 Afghanistan War}}
There was initially little opposition to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 Afghanistan War]] in the United States and the [[United Kingdom]], which was seen as a response to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] and was supported by a majority of the American public. Most vocal opposition came from pacifist groups and groups promoting a leftist political agenda; in the United States, the group [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]] was one of the most visible organizers of anti-war protests, although that group faced considerable controversy over allegations it was a front for the extremist Stalinist [[Workers World Party]]. Over time, opposition to the war in Afghanistan has grown more widespread, partly as a result of weariness with the length of the conflict, and partly as a result of a conflating of the conflict with the unpopular war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/28/cnn-poll-support-for-afghanistan-war-at-all-time-low/|title=CNN Poll: Support for Afghanistan war at all time low|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===
{{Further|Opposition to the Iraq War}}

[[Image:Day119fwhitehouseb.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] on the [[White House Peace Vigil]]]]
The anti-war position gained renewed support and attention in the buildup to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the U.S. and its allies.  Millions of people staged [[Protests against the Iraq War|mass protests]] across the world in the immediate prelude to the invasion, and demonstrations and other forms of anti-war [[activism]] have continued throughout the occupation. The primary opposition within the U.S. to the continued occupation of Iraq has come from the [[grassroots]].  [[Opposition to the Iraq War|Opposition to the conflict]], how it had been fought, and complications during the aftermath period divided public sentiment in the U.S., resulting in majority public opinion turning against the war for the first time in the spring of 2004, a turn which has held since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm|title=Iraq|work=pollingreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many American writers against the war, like [[Naomi Wolf]], were labeled conspiratorial due to their opposition, with others choosing to post their anti-war writings anonymously, such as the anonymous conspiracy author Sorcha Faal. The financial website [[Zero Hedge]] offered its anti-war writers the protection of the anonymous pseudonym [[Fight Club (novel)#Tyler Durden|Tyler Durden]] for those exposing war profiteering.  The American country music band [[Dixie Chicks]] opposition to the war caused many radio stations to stop playing their records, but who were supported in their anti-war stance by the equally anti-war country music legend [[Merle Haggard]], who in the summer of 2003 released a song critical of US media coverage of the Iraq War. Anti-war groups protested during both the Democratic National Convention and [[2008 Republican National Convention#Protests|2008 Republican National Convention protests]] held in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] in September 2008.

===Possible war against Iran===
{{Further|Opposition to war against Iran}}
Organised opposition to a possible future military attack against [[Iran]] by the United States is known to have started during 2005–2006. Beginning in early 2005, [[journalist]]s, [[activist]]s and [[academic]]s such as [[Seymour Hersh]],&lt;ref name="seymourhershone"&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|List of books with anti-war themes}}
&lt;!-- HELP!  please add some examples from outside the English-speaking world! --&gt;

[[England|English]] poet [[Robert Southey]]'s 1796 poem [[After Blenheim]] is an early modern example of anti-war literature — it was written generations after the [[Battle of Blenheim]], but at a time when England was again at war with France.

[[World War I]] produced a generation of poets and writers influenced by their experiences in the war. The work of poets including [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] exposed the contrast between the realities of life in the trenches and how the war was seen by the British public at the time, as well as the earlier patriotic verse penned by [[Rupert Brooke]]. German writer [[Erich Maria Remarque]] penned All Quiet on the Western Front, which, having been adapted for several mediums, has become of the most often cited pieces of anti-war media.

[[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1937 painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', on the other hand, used abstraction rather than realism to generate an emotional response to the loss of life from the [[fascism|fascist]] [[bombing of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].  American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] used science fiction themes in his 1969 novel [[Slaughterhouse-Five]], depicting the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II]] (which Vonnegut witnessed).

The second half of the 20th century also witnessed a strong anti-war presence in other art forms, including anti-war music such as "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]" and [[One Tin Soldier]] and films such as ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Die Brücke (film)|Die Brücke]]'', opposing the [[Cold War]] in general, or specific conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]].  The current American war in [[Iraq]] has also generated significant artistic anti-war works, including filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which holds the box-office record for documentary films, and [[Canada|Canadian]] musician [[Neil Young]]'s 2006 album ''[[Living with War]]''.

==Anti-war intellectual and scientist-activists and their work==
Various people have discussed the philosophical question of whether war is inevitable, and how much it can be avoided, as well as how this can be achieved i.e. what are the necessities of peace. Various people have discussed it from an intellectual and philosophical point of view. Various intellectuals not only have discussed in public but have participated or led anti-war campaigns despite it is different to their main areas of expertise. They went out of their professional comfort zone to warn against or fight against wars.

===Philosophical possibility of avoiding war===
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: In (1795) "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant, "Perpetual Peace"|publisher=Mtholyoke.edu|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. Perpetual Peace. English translation. Jonathan Bennett. 2010–2015 [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/kant1795_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ("''Zum ewigen Frieden''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb5/frieden/themen/Theorie/kant.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Zum ewigen Frieden, 12.02.2004 (Friedensratschlag)|publisher=Uni-kassel.de|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] booklet on "Perpetual Peace" in 1795. Politically, Kant was one of the earliest exponents of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation. &lt;!-- from wikipedia --&gt;
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] suggests, war can never be ruled out, as one can never know when or if one will occur. However, A peaceful revolution is also possible according to Hegel when the changes required to solve the crisis are ascertained by thoughtful insight and when this insight spreads throughout the body politic. (See [[Hegelianism]]) Some people claim that Hegel glorified war, this is disputed heavily. This claim has always been based on interpretations only. Hegel's views are often mistaken with the characters of his books, who are the subjects in history.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Antonio Persio''' ([[Matera]] 17 May 1542 - [[Rome]] 11 February 1612) was an Italian philosopher of the [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Platonic]] school who opposed the [[Aristotelianism]] which predominated in the universities of his time.  He was a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] and an associate of [[Galileo Galilei]]. 

== Life ==
Antonio Persio was the oldest of five sons of the sculptor Altobello Persio. As a child he suffered from a serious illness which caused a temporary paralysis of all his limbs.  His maternal uncle the humanist Leonardo Goffredo was in charge of the boys' education in Matera, and with the exception of the second son Giovanni Battista, all were later prominent in their chosen field - Antonio in philosophy, Guilio as a sculptor, Domizio in holy orders and in painting, and Ascanio in the humanities and [[philology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-persio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 13/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Antonius Persius vixi annis LXIX. mensibus VIII. diebus V. Ad plures abij anno salutis 1612. XI kalendas Februarias", '' Index capitum librorum Abbatis Antonii Persii lyncei De ratione recte philosophandi et de natura ignis, et caloris'', Romae, apud I. Mascardum 1613, p. 6 n.n.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After taking [[minor orders]], Antonio moved to [[Naples]] in 1560 where he became a [[presbyter]]&lt;ref name=libraweb&gt;[http://www.libraweb.net/Documenti/schede/Persio.pdf Scheda «Trattato dell'ingegno dell'huomo»] Libraweb.net&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed as tutor to  Lelio and Pietro [[Orsini family#Gravina_line|Orsini]], younger brothers of Ferdinando Orsini, [[Counts and dukes of Gravina|Duke of Gravina]] and Count of Matera.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-persio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 13/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Bernardino Telesio]] whose follower he became, and wrote a number of works defending and expounding on the views of his master.&lt;ref&gt;Noel L. Brann, The Debate Over the Origin of Genius During the Italian Renaissance: The Theories of Supernatural Frenzy and Natural Melancholy in Accord and in Conflict on the Threshold of the Scientific Revolution, BRILL, 2002 pp.309-12&lt;/ref&gt; After Telesio's death he arranged for the publication of a number of his writings under the title ''Varii de rebus naturalibus libelli''.

At the end of 1570, after a short stay in [[Rome]], he moved to [[Perugia]], as the tutor of the Orsini brothers, who wanted to study civil and canon law. There he developed links with the Caetani brothers; [[Camillo Caetani]] introduced him to [[Paolo Manuzio]] and Manuzio's son [[Aldus Manutius the Younger|Aldo]]. In 1572 he moved to the [[Republic of Venice]] and entered the service of the patrician Giorgio Correr as tutor to his son Andrea.  At the same time he published an important commentary on the [[Digest (Roman law)|Pandects]] in 1575.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-persio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 13/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1576 became a [[parish priest]] in [[Padua]], where he published ''Trattato dell'ingegno dell'huomo'',{{efn|group=note|[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_O_U1zqFIqU8C Digital version of ''Trattato dell'ingegno dell'huomo'']}} in which he developed Telesio's theories about the ''spiritus'', inspiration, movement, life and intelligence.&lt;ref name=libraweb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr James Dougal Fleming, The Invention of Discovery, 1500–1700, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 28 May 2013 p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1590 he moved to [[Rome]], where he met [[Tommaso Campanella]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. Here he published a medical tract, ''Del bever caldo'',{{efn|group=note|[https://archive.org/details/delbeuercaldoco00persgoog Digital version of ''Del Bever Caldo'']}} in which he pursued a number of ideas discussed in his previous work about the spirit, with advice on how to preserve it. 

Persio died in Rome on 22 January 1612 in the [[Palazzo Cesi-Armellini]]  and was buried in the church of [[Sant'Onofrio (Rome)|Sant'Onofrio]]. He was admitted posthumously to the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-persio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 13/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5691">'''Being-in-itself''' is the self-contained and fully realized [[Being]] of objects.  It is a term used in early 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in the works of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and the [[existentialism|existentialists]].

==Being-in-itself for Heidegger==
{{Main|Heideggerian terminology}}

In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons, which he terms [[Dasein]]. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.27}}  "Dasein means: care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care, not only of human Being...Dasein is ''itself'' by virtue of its essential ''relation to'' Being in general." {{Harv|Heidegger |2000|p=H.31}}  Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings, and thus devoted space in ''[[Being and Time]]'' and the ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' to an explication of the differences; often noted by translators who distinguish Being (Sein), from ''a'' being (das Seiende).  His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation, but rarely clears the air of confusions.

Dasein is Being that is aware of, and interested in, its own Being.  Dasein is, by its nature, invested in social interaction and society.  This is because in Heidegger's metaphysical system, one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships.  All things stand in a relation to all other things — and by virtue of his stress on Dasein's [[ontological]] distinction, things may also stand in relation to Dasein. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.78}}  The argument for this claim draws heavily on [[Hegel|Hegel's]] great work, the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.  Essentially, Being in itself is one of Heidegger's main concerns throughout his authorship.  Despite Heidegger's interest in it, he returns — more often than not indirectly — to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply ''invoke'' Being without explicitly acknowledging it.

In other words, whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons 'Dasein', he determines 'Being in itself' to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate, but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a [[philosopher]].

==Being-in-itself for Sartre==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]] --&gt;
In Sartrean existentialism, being-in-itself (''être-en-soi'') is also contrasted with the being of persons, which he describes as a combination of, or vacillation or tension between, [[being for itself|being-for-itself]] (''être-pour-soi'') and [[being for others|being-for-others]] (''I'être-pour-autrui''). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world — a mode of existence that simply is. It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence. This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects, but not to humans, who Sartre says must always make a choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm "Existentialism Is a Humanism", Lecture by J.P. Sartre, 1946.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems of human existence for Sartre is the desire to attain being-in-itself, which he describes as the desire to be [[God]] — this is a longing for full control over one's destiny and for absolute identity, only attainable by achieving full control over the destiny of all existence. The desire to be God is one of the ways people fall into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Sartre's famous depiction of a man in a café who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter illustrates this. The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter (as in being-in-itself), which Sartre says is impossible since he cannot be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell. He is primarily a man (being-for-itself), just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter – with no fixed nature or essence, who is constantly recreating himself. He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself. Sartre would say that as a human, a being-for-itself by nature, the waiter is "a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not." Therefore, the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter "is not what [he] is"- which is to say, he is not solely a waiter- and "is what [he] is not"- meaning that he is many things other than a waiter. In simply playing the part of a waiter, the man in this example is reducing himself to a "being-in-itself" and is therefore in [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4237">[[File:Chronospecies.svg|thumb|In [[palaeontology]], the evidence for [[species]] and [[evolution]] comes mainly from the [[comparative anatomy]] of [[fossil]]s. A chronospecies is defined in a single lineage (solid line) whose morphology changes with time. At some point, palaeontologists judge that enough change has occurred that two forms (A and B), separated in time and anatomy, once existed. If only sporadic examples of each survive in the fossil record, then the forms will appear sharply distinct.]]
A '''chronospecies''' is a [[species]] derived from a [[anagenesis|sequential development pattern]] which involves continual and uniform changes from an extinct ancestral form on an evolutionary scale. This sequence of alterations eventually produces a population which is physically, [[Comparative anatomy|morphologically]], and/or [[Genetics|genetically]] distinct from the original ancestors. Throughout this change, there is only one species in the lineage at any point in time, as opposed to cases where [[divergent evolution]] produces contemporary species with a common ancestor. The related term '''paleospecies''' (or '''palaeospecies''') indicates an extinct species only identified with [[fossil]] material. This identification relies on distinct similarities between the earlier fossil specimens and some proposed descendant, although the exact relationship to the later species is not always defined. In particular, the range of variation within all the early fossil specimens does not exceed the observed range which exists in the later species.

A '''paleosubspecies''' (or '''palaeosubspecies''') identifies an extinct [[subspecies]] which evolved into the currently existing form. This connection with relatively recent variations, usually from the [[Late Pleistocene]], often relies on the additional information available in [[subfossil]] material. Most of the current species have changed in size [[adaptation (biology)|adapting]] to the climatic changes during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (''see'' [[Bergmann's Rule]]).

The further identification of fossil specimens as part of a "chronospecies" relies on additional similarities which more strongly indicate a specific relationship with a known species. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Howard | first = Hildegarde | authorlink= Hildegarde Howard | title = An ancestral Golden Eagle raises a question in taxonomy | journal = [[Auk (journal)|The Auk]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–291 | year = 1947 | url = http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v064n02/p0287-p0291.pdf | doi= 10.2307/4080550}}&lt;/ref&gt; relatively recent specimens – hundreds of thousands to a few million years old – with consistent variations (e.g. always smaller but with the same proportions) as a living species might represent the final step in a chronospecies. This possible identification of the immediate ancestor of the living [[taxon]] may also rely on [[stratigraphic]] information to establish the age of the specimens.

The concept of chronospecies is related to the [[phyletic gradualism]] model of evolution, and also relies on an extensive fossil record, since morphological changes accumulate over time and two very different organisms could be connected by a series of intermediaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4108">In [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]], '''context change potential''' ('''CCP''') is the way new information reshapes existing understanding. It is a real feature of [[natural language]] observed, modeled and predicted by researchers. As speakers use natural language, they offer and [[Language interpretation|interpret]] new contributions in the [[Context (language use)|context]] of what has already passed in their [[discourse]].

:: (1a) A: You didn't get to yesterday's out-of-town meeting. [context]
:: (1b) B: ''So far.''

:: (2a) A: It's a lovely day. [context]
:: (2b) B: ''So far.''

In the example dialogue fragments, although the same [[phrase]] ''so far'' is offered in both replies, the prior contexts establish different analyses of the meanings of the phrase. In the first example, the reply (1b) modifies the prior context (1a) by providing an explanation: B did not make the meeting because it was ''too far to travel''. In the second example, the reply (2b) also modifies the prior context (2a): B agrees with A that the day has been lovely ''up to this point'', but appears to [[Conversational implicature|implicate]] concern about the future. In either case, after B has contributed a reply, there is now a new, different context against which future contributions to the dialogue must be analysed to establish their meaning.

:: (1a) A: You didn't get to yesterday's out-of-town meeting. [context]
:: (1b) B: So far. [context]
:: (1c) A: ''It started early.'' [you slept in?]
:: (1d) B: ''No car.'' [no]

As a discourse progresses, the "picture" provided by the context is "filled in". Sometimes parts of the picture are "erased" then "redrawn" in alternative ways. The insight of CCP [[Discourse analysis|analysis of discourse]] is that language use doesn't simply function to [[Denotation|denote]] [[reference]] to the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world directly, significantly it also functions by constructing and modifying a context shared by discourse participants.

CCP is the foundation of [[dynamic semantics]], giving rise to the slogan "meaning is context change potential". Earlier work in semantics attempted to show how the meaning of many sentences could be directly represented by [[Philosophical logic|logical]] [[Model theory|models]] of the objective world. Finding a way of representing the meaning of difficult sentences led to seeing the need for accounting for CCP. [[Discourse representation theory|Discourse Representation Theory]] (DRT) did this by viewing successive contributions to discourse as ''dynamically'' modifying a model of the world—the changing context.

'''Dexippus''' ({{lang-el|Δέξιππος}}; fl. 350) was a Greek philosopher, a pupil of the [[Neoplatonist]] [[Iamblichus]], belonging to the middle of the 4th century AD. He wrote commentaries on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] of which one, an explanation and defense of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Aristotelian Categories]], is partially extant. In this work Dexippus explains to one Seleucus the Aristotelian Categories, and endeavours at the same time to refute the objections of [[Plotinus]].  He also advocated the harmony of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Gerson, L. ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'' (Cornell University Press, 2005), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin edition edited by [[Félicien]] was published under the title ''Quœstionum in Categorias Libri Tres'' in 1549. The Greek text was published by [[Leonhard von Spengel]] in 1859. An English translation by [[John M. Dillon]] was published in 1990.

'''Don Collins Reed''' (born in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]) is an emeritus [[professor]] of [[ethics]] and [[history of philosophy]] at [[Wittenberg University]].&lt;ref name="wittenberg"&gt;[http://www5.wittenberg.edu/academics/phil/facultystaff/dreed.html Don Collins Reed, Ph.D. – Wittenberg University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liberia"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130414164528/http://christian-formation.diosohio.org/digital_faith/dfcfiles/1401271 Companion Relationship Discernment with the Episcopal Church of Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed's early research has focused on the work of the ethicist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]].  In ''[[Following Kohlberg: Liberalism and the Practice of Democratic Community]]'', published in 1998, Reed outlined the extension of principles of [[ethical community]], developed by Kohlberg and [[Carol Gilligan]], to that of [[deliberative democracy]].  Between 2003 and 2009, Reed observed and volunteered in [[State school|public school]] and [[preschool]] classrooms in [[Springfield, Ohio]], and served on the [[Board of Education]] of [[Springfield City School District|Springfield City Schools]].  His current research involves developing an integrated, multi-level model of human moral functioning based on recent [[science|scientific research]] on [[morality]].

The term was coined by the German classical scholar [[Hermann Alexander Diels]].

== Classic Greek philosophy ==

A great many philosophical works have been lost; our limited knowledge of such lost works comes chiefly through the doxographical works of later philosophers, commentators, and biographers.  Philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] also act as doxographers, as their comments on the ideas of their predecessors indirectly tell us what their predecessors' beliefs were.  Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Defense of Socrates]]'', for example, tells us much of what we know about the natural philosophy of [[Anaxagoras]].

== Islamic doxography ==

Islamic doxography is an aggregate of theosophical works (like ''[[Kitab al-Maqalat]]'' by  [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]]) concerning the aberrations in Islamic sects and streams.

{{Professional responsibility}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''duty of confidentiality''' obliges [[solicitor]]s (or [[attorney at law|attorneys]]) to respect the confidentiality of their clients' affairs. Information that solicitors obtain about their clients' affairs may be confidential, and must not be used for the benefit of persons not authorized by the client. Confidentiality is a prerequisite for [[solicitor-client privilege|legal professional privilege]] to hold.

==The duty and its source==
The lawyer-client relationship has historically been characterised as one of confidence. This [[duty]] also constitutes part of the broader foundation for lawyer's [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to their clients.

===Rationales for the duty===
The maintenance of full and frank disclosure between lawyers and their clients is the main justification for the duty of confidentiality.  The basis for this rationale is [[utilitarianism]], in that it works to promote the work of solicitors, who are officers of the court.  It allows clients to freely discuss intimate details without fear that such information could be subsequently disclosed to the general public. In turn, public confidence in lawyers and the legal system is maintained and promoted. Further, the duty of confidentiality is a constant reminder to lawyers of the loyalty they owe to their clients.

Another rationale is to protect the [[human dignity]] of the client.

In criminal cases, confidentiality is also justified to prevent the use of tricked [[Confession (law)|confession]]s or [[admission (law)|admission]]s.

===Source of the duty===
The duty is sourced from a combination of [[contract law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]] arising from the distinctive relationship between lawyer and client. The solicitor or attorney is an agent of the client under the [[Agency (law)|law of agency]].  In contract, the duty arises from terms contained in the [[retainer agreement]]. Complementarily, equity prohibits unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information. In most jurisdictions, the duty is codified in the terms of legal professional rules, such as the [[Model Code of Professional Responsibility]].

Although the duty of confidentiality and fiduciary duties have common origins, they cannot be equated as not all fiduciary duties attract duties of confidentiality and vice versa.

==Scope of the duty==
===In contract===
As the lawyer-client duty of confidentiality is primarily sourced in contract law, the wording of implied terms in the retainer agreement determines its scope of operation. Despite its importance, there have been few judicial attempts to resolve the extent of the implied term.

===In equity===
In equity, protection is attached to information that is capable of meeting the test of confidentiality - whether the information was already public knowledge and whether its communication was for a ''limited purpose''. While this test may indicate a more limited scope of confidentiality under equity, by requiring information to be deemed confidential before  falling under the scope, on another level equity may secure a broader temporal protection for confidential information. The duty under contract expires on termination of the legal retainer, whereas the duty under equity remains intact until the information is no longer confidential, which may occur long after the expiration of the contractual retainer.

===In professional rules===
Legal professional rules have tended to adopt the broad view of the scope of duty recognised in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the professional rules in [[Australia]]n jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than the source of the information. Hence, the professional rules seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty of confidentiality, this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test of  confidentiality. The duty of confidence applies to "any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by [a] practitioner or [a] practitioner's firm during the client's engagement." For barristers, it is "confidential information obtained by [a] barrister concerning any person."

===Compared to legal professional privilege===
Though the duty of confidentiality shares a common origin, goals, and similarities with legal professional privilege, they are distinct in at least three ways. Firstly, privilege is not dependent on a contractual, equitable or professional duty to clients. Rather, it is based upon arguments of public policy. Secondly, communications protected by confidentiality are more numerous than those protected by privilege. Privileged communications are a subset of confidential communication. Nonetheless, loss of privilege does not necessarily automatically destroy the duty to confidentiality if it has arisen independently of the privilege. Finally, privileged information is protected from compulsory disclosure, unless abrogated by statute or waived. Non-privileged confidential information on the other hand must be disclosed to judicial, statutory, or other legal compulsion. In particular, the public interest in discovering the truth trumps private duties to respect confidence.

==Limits and exceptions to the duty==
Though the duty to confidentiality is often expressed in absolute terms in professional rules, there are circumstances where the duty can be breached. The breach of the duty in certain contexts is justified through the balancing of the often competing interests of the client and proper administration of justice

===Client authorization===
As lawyer-client confidentiality exists for the benefit of the client, the confidence is the client's to waive or modify. Hence, the lawyer can reveal confidential information to third parties where the client allows such an action. However, consent to allow the disclosure of confidential information does not entitle the lawyer to disclose or use the information for other purposes than those specified by the client.

The authorization does not necessarily have to be explicit. It can be inferred from the terms or nature of the retainer agreement. The idea that all information imparted within a retainer is confidential is impracticable. Often, much of that information is communicated so that it can be disclosed to dispose of a matter, claim, or legal issue. Hence, where information is incidental to the conduct of a retainer, client authorisation can be generally taken as given. Nonetheless, where there is uncertainty, express authority should be sought from the client.

===Disclosure compelled by law===
Where expressly provided for in statute, lawyers must comply with any parliamentary requirement necessitating breach of the duty to confidentiality. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Parry-Jones v Law Society''&lt;ref&gt;''Parry-Jones v Law Society'' [1969] 1 Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; said at 6-7:

:"the solicitor must obey the law, and, in particular, he must comply with the rules made under the authority of statute for the conduct of the profession. If the rules require him to disclose his client's affairs, then he must do so."

Statutory abrogation of the duty is limited in scope and purpose however. Requirements are never blanket decrees for the revelation of confidential information. Rather they are based on upholding the public interest, where such interests override client interests in maintaining confidentiality.

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness - a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such actions.

===Disclosure of information that is not confidential===
Clearly, information that is not confidential does not fall under the duty of confidentiality. Disclosure of information that is already in the public domain does not breach the duty. Further, information that was not in the public knowledge at the time of the retainer agreement, is not subject to the duty if it subsequently enters the public domain. The purpose served by maintaining the confidence - the protection of the client - is arguably extinguished.

Nonetheless, the lawyer still owes a duty of loyalty, and clients may feel betrayed if such information is disclosed, even if it becomes public knowledge. Though there are no legal ramifications for disclosure, discretion on part of the lawyer may be in the long term interests of maintaining the propriety of the legal profession.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{seealso|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]].  Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] are no longer secret for the purpose of proving the Will is the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]].  In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the Will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

'''''Epistemology of the Closet''''' is a book published in 1990 by [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], who is considered one of the founders of [[queer studies]]. In ''Epistemology of the Closet'', Sedgwick argues that standard [[Gender binary|binary]] oppositions limit freedom and understanding, especially in the context of sexuality. Sedgwick argues that limiting sexuality to [[homosexuality]] or [[heterosexuality]], in a structured binary opposition, is just too simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistemology of the Closet''
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (c1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Epistemology of the Closet'' attacks the question of what makes up human sexuality. The basis for the answer to this question comes from Sedgwick's understanding and examination of queer theory, which she describes for her readers.

According to Sedgwick, the central thesis of the book is that "virtually any aspect of modern Western culture, must be, not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance to the degree that it does not incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition."

In the book, Sedgwick analyzes a late nineteenth century historical moment in which [[sexual orientation]] became as important a definer of personal identity as gender had been for centuries. In her preface, Sedgwick examines the book both personally and historically, as she analyzes the first wave of the [[AIDS]] epidemic and its influence on the text. Through this and various other examples, Sedgwick reveals that several sexual contradictions result in modern misunderstanding. The book also largely focuses on language's impact on sexuality, and how labeled speech acts are ultimately the proof of the nature of one’s sexuality.

==Literary Influences==
''Epistemology of the Closet'' focuses on other literary works that reflect the social and political ideas of queer theorists. Some of the main authors that Sedgwick pulls from are [[Michel Foucault]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Marcel Proust]]. Sedgwick uses the writings of these authors to point out examples in other pieces of famous literary text that help propel her argument about the binary behind the homosexual identity and how language serves to define that binary.

The chapter dedicated to Marcel Proust, which is titled “Proust and the Spectacle of the Closet,” is the
end of ''Epistemology of the Closet''. In this chapter, Sedgwick evokes the figure
of the woman who cannot know: “the omnipotent, unknowing
mother” to whom Proust’s novel is addressed. This heterosexual woman is troubled by her inability to determine
whether or not the men she is having sex with are bisexuals, and is therefore  fearful that she has been infected with AIDS (248).&lt;ref&gt;Criticism, 2010, Vol.52(2), pp.253-262 [Peer Reviewed Journal]
Litvak, Joseph&lt;/ref&gt;
Sedgwick closes out her book with this example of the unknowing woman as a way to stress the difference between the male/female sexual identity that has been loosely defined by society (especially in the case of males).

==Achievements==

===Impact===
More than any other book, ''Epistemology of the Closet'' has probably had the greatest influence on geographical research on sexualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Brown. Sedgwick's geographies: Touching space&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the closet and its epistemic effects have been examined by scholars from a range of disciplines (including Geography) and used to understand the functioning of sexual relations in a wide range of [[geographic]] settings.

''Epistemology of the Closet'' has also had a tremendous impact in the [[gay community]] as it is known for being a very "important book", and "one of the key texts of queer theory, and, as such, is a challenging book to read."&lt;ref&gt;International Gay &amp; Lesbian Review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Binary===
This book addresses the idea that there are two views that guide sexual identity and desire: the [[minoritizing view]] and the [[universalizing view]].

* The minoritizing view maintains that certain individuals are truly born gay and only those born with the "deviant" traits share an interest in them. 
* The universalizing view stresses that homosexuality is important to persons with a wide range of sexualities. This view believes that there is no such thing as a stable erotic identity, and while not everyone is bisexual in physical behavior, everyone is to some degree bisexual in their inherent qualities of mind and character.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Jan 21, 1991, Vol.252(2), p.61(3)
* Edmundson, Mark&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The language usage and labeling itself is a major theme and common occurrence in ''Epistemology of the Closet''. The book proposes the argument that "homosexuality" is a loaded term. According to Sedgwick, this term "has always seemed to have at least some male bias –- whether because of the pun on Latin homo = man latent in its etymological macaronic, or simply because of the greater attention to men in the discourse surrounding it." (17)

Like the term "homosexuality", the term "gay" produces mixed results. As explained in the book, some women, according to Sedgwick, call themselves "[[lesbians]]" yet they do not identify at all with the term "gay". However, other women identify themselves as "gay women", which disassociates themselves from the term "lesbian". This produces an obvious language conflict that Sedgwick points to as just another problem in the long line of problems related to the modern binary opposition that is homo/heterosexual.

==Supplementary Works==
[[Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire]] (1985)

Many of the ideas in ''Between Men'' are further flushed out in ''Epistemology of the Closet''. Sedgwick's ''Between Men'' was intended to show "the immanence of men’s same-sex bonds, and their prohibitive structuration, to male-female bonds in nineteenth-century English literature." In ''Between Men,'' Sedgwick coined the term "[[homosocial]]" as a male desire that "referred to all male bonds, including, potentially, everyone from overt heterosexuals to overt homosexuals."[18] The term resulted from Sedgwick's belief that terms like "gay", "bi", and "homo" could not be appropriately distinguished from one another.

[[Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity]] (2003)

Like ''Epistemology of the Closet'',''Touching Feeling'' also focuses on ideas of queer theory. This book examines the emotions provoked by the AIDS epidemic that was widespread at the time. The book's main theme deals with the relationship between feeling, learning, and action. Sedgwick describes this book as the exploration of "promising tools and techniques for nondualistic thought and pedagogy."&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick, Eve. Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary criticism==
''Epistemology of the Closet'' has received many positive reviews. On publication, the book attracted attention from the publication magazine [[The Nation]], which described it as "a remarkable work of mind and spirit", in which "the literary analyses are excellent".&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Jan 21, 1991, Vol.252(2), p.61(3) Edmundson, Mark&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [http://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=723 Robert Tobin], a writer for [[Philosophy and Literature]], "Readers who still hanker for expository prose without
digressions might on occasion be frustrated with this book, as will readers whose
politics differ from Sedgwick's. Nonetheless, it is probably precisely those readers
who could learn the most from ''Epistemology of the Closet'', which reestablishes
Sedgwick's position as one of the most important thinkers in American gay
studies."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tobin. Philosophy and Literature, Volume 15, Number 2, October 1991, pp.
332-333 (Article)
Published by The Johns Hopkins University Press
DOI: 10.1353/phl.1991.0039&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in [[Publishers Weekly]] described Sedgwick's homosexual closet as "the defining structure for gay oppression in this century." The article points out the influence behind Sedgwick's strong disagreement with those who separate gays and straights as "distinct kinds of persons", with no common humanity. The article later goes on to describe how "Her close readings of Melville's "[[Billy Budd]]", Wilde's "[[Dorian Gray]]" and of Proust, Nietzsche, Henry James and Thackeray bristle with keen observations relating entrenched fears of same-sex relationships to contemporary gay-bashing and obvious displays of heterosexual or "macho" attitudes." 

However, not all reviews were positive. Geographer Michael Brown has criticized Sedgwick’s ‘the closet' as a term for spatial metaphor. Brown has
also questioned the limits of ‘the closet’ as "a mechanism for understanding the dynamics of queer visibilities in national contexts where the homo/hetero binary is not the primary means of understanding sexualities."&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Brown. Sedgwick's geographies: Touching space&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FalconView''' is a mapping system created by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]. It was initially developed for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] family of operating systems; however, versions for [[Linux]] and mobile operating systems are under development.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; It displays various types of maps and geographically referenced overlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/innovations/falconview-keeps-pilots-date|title=FalconView keeps pilots up-to-date|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of maps are supported, but the primary ones of interest to most users are [[aeronautical chart]]s, [[satellite image]]s and [[DTED|elevation maps]]. FalconView also supports a large number of overlay types that can be displayed over any map background. The current overlay set is targeted toward military mission planning users and is oriented towards aviators and aviation support personnel.

FalconView is an integral part of the [[Portable Flight Planning Software]] (PFPS).&lt;ref name=20th&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/upgrades-mark-20th-anniversary-falconview-mapping-|title=CASE STUDY The Bird’s Eye: Upgrades Mark 20th Anniversary of FalconView Mapping Program|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This software suite includes FalconView, Combat Flight Planning Software (CFPS), Combat Weapon Delivery Software (CWDS), Combat Air Drop Planning Software (CAPS) and several other software packages built by various software contractors. Current work includes the development of FalconView as part of [[XPlan]], the Department of Defense's most recent mission planning system. The [[Joint Mission Planning System]] is also being added to FalconView as a plugin. The program has an active user community, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute plans events supporting the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatech.edu/calendar/event.html?nid=131101 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709135325/http://gatech.edu/calendar/event.html?nid=131101 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |title=FalconView Symposium 2012 |work=Campus Calendar &amp; Events |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=2012-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/wiki/FalconView%20Symposium%202012|title=FalconView Symposium 2012|work=FalconView|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2012-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114931/http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/wiki/FalconView%20Symposium%202012|archivedate=2012-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Air National Guard ===
Development of FalconView began in 1993 by the Georgia Tech Research Institute after they were contracted by the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) to create a mapping package that would run on a personal computer and be easier to use than the existing UNIX-based system.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; According to John Pyles, the head of the initial FalconView development team, the idea for the project came from then-Captain Bobby Sandford, a fighter pilot in the Air National Guard.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; The software was named for the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], the full name of the fighter flown by Sandford.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; Georgia Tech Research Institute had previously developed mapping applications as part of the Micro Fix and the FORSCOM Automated Intelligence Support System (FAISS) programs for the United States Army. The initial development was performed under an Army Research Lab contract. The combination of FalconView and the Combat Flight Planning Software (CFPS) which was being developed by the USAF [[46th Test Wing|46th Test Squadron]] and TYBRIN Corp became the [[Portable Flight Planning Software]] (PFPS). The first version of FalconView was completed in 1994. The software ran on [[MS-DOS]], with a version for [[Windows 3.1]] released not long after.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt;

The initial versions of FalconView were simply a set of routines to display scanned raster maps such as CADRG (compressed arc digital raster graphics) with simple stick routes drawn on top, but the easy to use software was popular with the end users and more functionality was added.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; Each additional feature was developed with significant input from the user community and improved with feedback from a group of beta testers. Unlike most other DoD developed applications, the FalconView development team was given very general requirements by the ANG which were fleshed out into a product by the development team and mission planners who used the software for their daily activities. Development and improvement of FalconView features is still strongly driven by its user community.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt;

=== Additional sponsors ===
In the early years the software was distributed to other services from user to user because it made their jobs easier. As the program matured, [[United States Special Operations Command]] adopted PFPS and added capabilities such as the Moving Map functionality (ability to have the map scroll and rotate based on the position information received from a connected [[GPS navigation device]]) and helicopter support.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; In 1997, the [[United States Air Force]] adopted the Portable Flight Planning Software into the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) program, followed by the first Navy release in 1998 and an Army release in 2002.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt; Each adopter of the software has funded new functionality to the program and a corresponding expansion of its ability to interact with other systems.

Version 3.2, released in 2002, added significant third party programmer support to FalconView. As a result, many new applications were developed by other government program offices and end users who used [[Visual Basic]] to automate tasks for their specific needs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mission-planning.com|title=Pablo's Mission Planning Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quiver Intelligence Database Tool - Developed by Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Paul Wilt&lt;/ref&gt; FalconView supports a set of programmer interfaces which allow applications to fuse their information into a single picture of the user's area of interest. The users know that data produced on FalconView can be shared with other branches of the armed services and coalition partners who have PFPS through the [[Foreign Military Sales Program]].

=== Open-source software ===
Because the federal government has funded the development of FalconView, it is a nonproprietary "[[government off-the-shelf]]" (GOTS) application and is free of any license fees for government use. This includes the use of the Software Developers Kit (SDK) which documents the interfaces for use by government developers and contractors working on government programs.

In late 2008, Georgia Tech was funded to develop and deploy an [[open-source software]] (OSS) version of FalconView. The OSS version of FalconView includes most of the functionality of the GOTS system, excluding only a few overlays considered to be exclusively related to military mission planning. Georgia Tech posted the first alpha version of FalconView as open source in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freegeographytools.com/2009/falconview-released-as-open-source|title=FalconView Released As Open Source|publisher=Free Geography Tools|first=Leszek|last=Pawlowicz|year=2009|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/falconview-moving-dod-open-source |title=FalconView - Moving from DoD to Open Source |publisher=FOSS4G Denver 2011 |first=Chris |last=Bailey |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117232358/http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/falconview-moving-dod-open-source |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/falconview-open.htm|title=Mapping and Imagery Display: FalconView™ Goes Open Source for Corporate, Environmental, Government and Other Users|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-platform support===
In 2014, two new editions of FalconView, FalconView 3-D and FalconView Mobile were announced. FalconView 3-D improves support for surface missions, and FalconView Mobile brings the core capabilities of FalconView 2-D and 3-D to the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile platforms. A [[Linux]] version of the software is also being developed.&lt;ref name=20th/&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
The FalconView development team at the Georgia Tech Research Institute received the [[National Security Award]] on December 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/news/gtri-falconview-recognized-national-security-award|title=GTRI's FalconView Team Recognized with National Security Award|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|date=2011-12-14|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in 19th Century Thought''''' ({{lang-de|Von Hegel zu Nietzsche: Der revolutionäre Bruch im Denken des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts}}) is a 1941 book about [[German philosophy]] by the philosopher [[Karl Löwith]].

==Summary==
Löwith gives a wide-ranging account of 19th century German philosophy that considers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], among others, in the [[Hegelian]] tradition. He refers to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as "the two end points between which the historical course of the German spirit in the nineteenth century moves."{{sfn|McLellan|1995|page=445}}{{sfn|Löwith|1965|pages=v, 20–431}}

'''George John Blewett''' (December 9, 1873 &amp;ndash; August 15, 1912) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] academic and [[philosopher]].

Born in Yarmouth Township in [[Elgin County, Ontario]], the son of William Blewett, a farmer, and Mary Baker, he was raised on a farm near [[St. Thomas, Ontario]]. In 1897, he graduated from [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto]]. He studied at the [[University of Würzburg]] in 1899 and received a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1900 from  [[Harvard University]]. He also did postgraduate work at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]].

In 1901, he became a lecturer in philosophy at [[Wesley College, Winnipeg]]. In 1906, he became the Ryerson Professor of moral philosophy at Victoria University. In 1907, he wrote ''The study of nature and the vision of God: with other essays in philosophy''. His second book ''The Christian view of the world'' was published in 1912.

He drowned while swimming, apparently the result of a [[heart attack]], in [[Go Home Bay, Ontario]] in 1912. He was buried in the [[Necropolis Cemetery]].

The '''graph of desire''' ({{lang-fr|graphe du désir}}) is a conceptual tool from the [[psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]].

==History==
Lacan devised numerous quasi-mathematical diagrams to represent the structure of the unconscious and its points of contact with empirical and mental reality. He adapted figures from the field of [[topology]] in order to represent the Freudian view of the mind as embodying a 'double inscription' (which could be defined as the ultimate inseparability of unconscious motivations from conscious ones).

==Graph==
The graph of desire was first proposed in a 1960 colloquium, and was later published in the ''Ecrits''. It depends on ideas developed originally in Lacan's ''Schema R'', a graph in which fundamental organising structures of the human mind are shown in a schematic relationship to the domains or 'orders' which in turn structure human reality: the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real.

The graph of desire is a 'flattened' representation of a '''signifying chain''' as it crosses a pathway Lacan called a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] of desire. It appears as two curved lines which cross one another at two separate points. Each line has a symbolic meaning.

===Elements of the graph===
The signifying chain begins in a linguistic sign (S) and progresses to a signification (S'), or a [[linguistic meaning]]. It can be expressed sententially and has a duration.

The vector of desire is a representation of the volition and will of the split or barred subject (''$''). Unlike the signifying chain, the vector of desire is expressed metaphorically, and has no duration.

It is necessary to bear in mind the special conception of the subject Lacan means by the (''$'') symbol. The barred subject is the internally conflicted result of the processes of individuation that begin in infancy. In Lacan's account of individuation, the infant must respond to the loss of symbiosis with the mother by creating a symbol of this lack. In doing so the infant is constrained by the always-already present structures of a natural language. There is a certain relief in the summoning of a symbolically present 'mother', but the experience of the mother who returns to the infant as someone-signified-by-the-word-'mother' is nevertheless one of absolute, irremediable loss. Mother — and the world — is now mediated by the Symbolic order and the exigencies of language.

With this in mind, the crossing of the two pathways in the graph of desire can be understood to connote interference and constraint. Desire for the primordial object is not fulfilled except through the constraints of the signifying chain. The vector of desire is metaphorical, substituting various objects for the absolutely lost primordial one, and irrupting into language without regard for the passage of time, or for the particular human relationship through which the vector moves.

Finally, the points at which the vector of desire and the signifying chain cross can be seen as instances of Freudian double inscription. The 'conscious and unconscious' significance of an act or utterance are one and the same, and each constrains the other.

Based on [[Jesus]]'s injunction in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] that "when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206;&amp;version=9; Matthew 6:6] ([[King James Version]])&lt;/ref&gt; hesychasm in tradition has been the process of retiring inward by ceasing to register the senses, in order to achieve an experiential knowledge of God (see [[Christian contemplation#Theoria|Theoria]]).

== Etymology ==
===Meaning===
''Hesychasm'', {{lang-el|{{lang |grc|ἡσυχασμός}}}}, [[Medieval Greek |contemporary Byzantine]] {{IPA-el |isixaˈzmos}}, derives from the Greek ''Hesychia'' ({{lang |grc|ἡσυχία}}, {{IPA-el|isiˈçia}}), "stillness, rest, quiet, silence"&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1999), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang |grc|ἡσυχάζω}} {{IPA-el|isiˈxazo}}: "to keep stillness."

===Usage===
Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], a scholar of Eastern Orthodox theology, distinguishes five distinct usages of the term "hesychasm":
# "solitary life", a sense, equivalent to "[[eremitic]]al life", in which the term is used since the 4th century;
# "the practice of inner prayer, aiming at union with God on a level beyond images, concepts and language", a sense in which the term is found in [[Evagrius Ponticus]] (345–399), [[Maximus the Confessor]] (c. 580 – 662), and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022);
# "the quest for such union through the [[Jesus Prayer]]", the earliest reference to which is in [[Diadochos of Photiki]] (c. 450);
# "a particular psychosomatic technique in combination with the Jesus Prayer", use of which technique can be traced back at least to the 13th century;
# "the theology of St. Gregory Palamas", on which see [[Palamism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware 1995, ''Act out of Stillness: The Influence of Fourteenth-Century Hesychasm on Byzantine and Slav Civilization'' ed.

===History of the term===
The origin of the term ''hesychasmos,'' and of the related terms ''hesychastes'', ''hesychia'' and ''hesychazo,'' is not entirely certain. According to the entries in Lampe's ''A Patristic Greek Lexicon'', the basic terms ''hesychia'' and ''hesychazo'' appear as early as the 4th century in such fathers as St [[John Chrysostom]] and the [[Cappadocian Fathers|Cappadocians]]. The terms also appear in the same period in [[Evagrius Pontikos]] (c. 345 – 399), who although he is writing in Egypt is out of the circle of the Cappadocians, and in the ''[[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]].''

The term ''hesychast'' is used sparingly in Christian [[ascetical]] writings emanating from [[Egypt]] from the 4th century on, although the writings of Evagrius and the ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' do attest to it. In Egypt, the terms more often used are ''anchoretism'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|ἀναχώρησις}}, "withdrawal, retreat"), and ''[[anchorite]]'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|ἀναχωρητής}}, "one who withdraws or retreats, i.e. a hermit").

The term ''hesychast'' was used in the 6th century in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the ''Lives'' of [[Cyril of Scythopolis]], many of which lives treat of hesychasts who were contemporaries of Cyril. Here, it should be noted that several of the saints about whom Cyril was writing, especially Euthymios and Savas, were in fact from [[Cappadocia]]. The laws ''(novellae)'' of the emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565) treat ''hesychast'' and ''anchorite'' as synonyms, making them interchangeable terms.

The terms ''hesychia'' and ''hesychast'' are used quite systematically in the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[St John of Sinai]] (523–603) and in ''Pros Theodoulon'' by St Hesychios (c. 750?), who is ordinarily also considered to be of the School of [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]]. It is not known where either St John of Sinai or St Hesychios were born, nor where they received their monastic formation.

It appears that the particularity of the term ''hesychast'' has to do with the integration of the continual repetition of the [[Jesus Prayer]] into the practices of mental ascesis that were already used by hermits in Egypt.  ''Hesychasm'' itself is not recorded in Lampe's Lexicon, which indicates that it is a later usage, and the term ''Jesus Prayer'' is not found in any of the fathers of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm | first =John S. | last = Romanides | title = Some Underlying Positions of This Website | at = 11, note |publisher=Romanity |accessdate= 2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[John Cassian]] (c. 360 – 435) presents as the formula used in Egypt for repetitive prayer, not the Jesus Prayer, but "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350810.htm | first = John | last = Cassian | title = Conferences | number = 10 | chapter = 10–11 |publisher= New advent |accessdate = 2014-02-06 | series = Fathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | type = transcript | place = [[Canada | CA]] | format = [[Portable document format |PDF]] |url= http://www.meditatio.ca/Transcripts/Meditatio%20Talks%20Series%20D%202005.pdf |title= Talk | first = Laurence | last = Freeman | year = 1992 |publisher= Meditatio |accessdate= 2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 14th century, however, on [[Mount Athos]] the terms ''hesychasm'' and ''hesychast'' refer to the practice and to the practitioner of a method of mental ascesis that involves the use of the Jesus Prayer assisted by certain psychophysical techniques. Most likely, the rise of the term ''hesychasm'' reflects the coming to the fore of this practice as something concrete and specific that can be discussed.

Books used by the hesychast include the ''[[Philokalia]]'', a collection of texts on prayer and solitary mental ascesis written from the 4th to the 15th centuries, which exists in a number of independent redactions; the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]];'' the collected works of [[St Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022); and the works of [[Isaac of Nineveh|St Isaac the Syrian]] (7th century), as they were selected and translated into Greek at the [[Mar Saba|Monastery of St Savas]] near [[Jerusalem]] about the 10th century.

==Origins==

===Platonism===
Hesychastic practice involves acquiring an inner focus and blocking of the physical senses. In this, hesychasm shows its roots in [[Evagrius Ponticus]] and even in the Greek tradition of asceticism going back to [[Plato]].

===Jewish Merkabah mysticism===
According to some of the adepts of the Jewish [[Merkabah]] mystical tradition, if one wished to "descend to the Merkabah" one had to adopt the prayer posture taken by the prophet [[Elijah]] in I Kings 18:42, namely to pray with one's head between one's knees. This is the same prayer posture used by the Christian hesychasts and is the reason that they were mocked by their opponents as "navel gazers" ([[Omphaloskepsis|omphalopsychites]]). This bodily position and the practice of rhythmically breathing while invoking a divine name seems to be common to both Jewish Merkabah mysticism and Christian hesychasm. Thus the practice may have origins in the ascetical practices of the biblical prophets.

Alan Segal in his book ''Paul the Convert'' suggests that the Apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] may have been an early adept of Merkabah mysticism in which case what was novel to Paul's experience of divine light on the [[Conversion of Paul|road to Damascus]] was not the experience of divine light itself, but that the source of this divine light identified himself as the Jesus whose followers Paul was persecuting. [[Daniel Boyarin]] notes that Paul's own account of this experience would therefore be the earliest first person account of the mystical vision of a Merkabah adept.

===Gospel-interpretation===
The hesychast interprets Jesus's injunction in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] to "go into your closet to pray" to mean that one should ignore the senses and withdraw inward. Saint [[John of Sinai]] writes:  
{{quote|Hesychasm is the enclosing of the bodiless primary cognitive faculty of the soul (Orthodoxy teaches of two cognitive faculties, the [[nous]] and [[logos]]) in the bodily house of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''Ladder'', Step 27, 5, (Step 27, 6 in the Holy Transfiguration edition).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Practice==

===Stages===
{{See also|State (theology)}}

''Theosis'' is obtained by engaging in contemplative prayer resulting from the cultivation of watchfulness (Gk: ''[[nepsis]]''). According to the standard ascetic formulation of this process, there are three stages: 
* ''Katharsis'' or [[purgative way|purification]], 
* ''Theoria'' or [[illuminative way|illumination]], and 
* ''Theosis'' or [[deification]] (also referred to as [[unitive way|union with God]]).{{refn|group=note|name="purification for love"|Purification, and illumination of the noetic faculty, prepare for the vision of God. Without this it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision, in this case vision ''by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God''. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father [[John S. Romanides]] Diagnosis and Therapy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm#s8]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Katharsis (purification)===
Sobriety contributes to this mental ascesis that rejects tempting thoughts; it puts a great emphasis on focus and attention. The hesychast is to pay extreme attention to the consciousness of his inner world and to the words of the Jesus Prayer, not letting his mind wander in any way at all. While he maintains his practice of the Jesus Prayer, which becomes automatic and continues twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, the hesychast cultivates ''[[nepsis]]'', watchful attention, to reject tempting thoughts (the "thieves") that come to the hesychast as he watches in sober attention in his hermitage. St John of Sinai describes hesychast practice as follows:
{{quote|Take up your seat on a high place and watch, if only you know how, and then you will see in what manner, when, whence, how many and what kind of thieves come to enter and steal your clusters of grapes. When the watchman grows weary, he stands up and prays; and then he sits down again and courageously takes up his former task.&lt;ref&gt;St John of Sinai, Step 27, 21 of the ''Ladder'' (Step 27, 22–3 of the Holy Transfiguration edition)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The hesychast is to attach [[Eros]] (Gr. ''eros)'', that is, "yearning", to his practice of sobriety so as to overcome the temptation to [[acedia]] (sloth). He is also to use an extremely directed and controlled anger against the tempting thoughts, although to obliterate them entirely he is to invoke Jesus Christ via the Jesus Prayer.

Much of the literature of hesychasm is occupied with the psychological analysis of such tempting thoughts (e.g. [[St Mark the Ascetic]]). This psychological analysis owes much to the ascetical works of Evagrius Pontikos, with its doctrine of the eight passions.

===Theoria (illumination)===
[[Image:Megaloschema.svg|thumb|left|upright|The Great Schema or Megaloschema, worn by seasoned hesychasts]]

The primary task of the hesychast is to engage in mental ascesis. The hesychast is to bring his mind (Gr. ''[[nous]])'' into his heart so as to practise both the Jesus Prayer and sobriety with his mind in his heart. In solitude and retirement, the hesychast repeats the [[Jesus Prayer]], ''"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, the sinner."'' The hesychast prays the Jesus Prayer 'with the heart'—with meaning, with intent, "for real" (see [[ontic]]). He never treats the Jesus Prayer as a string of syllables whose "surface" or overt verbal meaning is secondary or unimportant. He considers bare repetition of the Jesus Prayer as a mere string of syllables, perhaps with a "mystical" inner meaning beyond the overt verbal meaning, to be worthless or even dangerous. This emphasis on the actual, real invocation of Jesus Christ mirrors an Eastern understanding of mantra in that physical action/voice and meaning are utterly inseparable.

The descent of the mind into the heart is taken quite literally by the practitioners of hesychasm and is not at all considered to be a metaphorical expression. Some of the psychophysical techniques described in the texts are to assist the descent of the mind into the heart at those times that only with difficulty it descends on its own.

The goal at this stage is a practice of the Jesus Prayer with the mind in the heart, which practice is free of images (see ''Pros Theodoulon).'' By the exercise of sobriety (the mental ascesis against tempting thoughts), the hesychast arrives at a continual practice of the Jesus Prayer with his mind in his heart and where his consciousness is no longer encumbered by the spontaneous inception of images: his mind has a certain stillness and emptiness that is punctuated only by the eternal repetition of the Jesus Prayer.

This stage is called the ''guard of the mind.'' This is a very advanced stage of ascetical and spiritual practice, and attempting to accomplish this prematurely, especially with psychophysical techniques, can cause very serious spiritual and emotional harm to the would-be hesychast. St [[Theophan the Recluse]] once remarked that bodily postures and breathing techniques were virtually forbidden in his youth, since, instead of gaining the Spirit of God, people succeeded only "in ruining their lungs."

The guard of the mind is the practical goal of the hesychast. It is the condition in which he remains as a matter of course throughout his day, every day until he dies.

There is a very great emphasis on humility in the practice of the Jesus Prayer, great cautions being given in the texts about the disaster that will befall the would-be hesychast if he proceeds in pride, arrogance or conceit. It is also assumed in the hesychast texts that the hesychast is a member of the Orthodox Church in good standing.

===Theosis (deification)===
It is from the guard of the mind that he is raised to contemplation by the grace of God.

The hesychast usually experiences the contemplation of God as light, the "uncreated light" of the theology of St Gregory Palamas. The hesychast, when he has by the mercy of God been granted such an experience, does not remain in that experience for a very long time (there are exceptions—see for example the ''Life'' of St Savas the Fool for Christ (14th century), written by [[Philotheus I of Constantinople|St Philotheos Kokkinos]] (14th century)), but he returns "to earth" and continues to practise the guard of the mind.

The uncreated light that the hesychast experiences is identified with the Holy Spirit. Experiences of the uncreated light are allied to the 'acquisition of the Holy Spirit'. Notable accounts of encounters with the Holy Spirit in this fashion are found in St Symeon the New Theologian's account of the illumination of "George" (considered a pseudonym of St Symeon himself); in the "conversation with Motovilov" in the ''Life'' of [[St Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759–1833); and, more recently, in the reminiscences of [[Starets|Elder]] [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia]] (''Wounded by Love'' pp.&amp;nbsp;27 – 31).

==Integration in Orthodox Church life==
Hesychasts are fully integrated into the liturgical and [[sacraments|sacramental]] life of the Orthodox Church, including the daily cycle of liturgical prayer of the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and the [[Divine Liturgy]]. However, hesychasts who are living as hermits might have a very rare attendance at the Divine Liturgy (see the life of [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]]) and might not recite the Divine Office except by means of the Jesus Prayer (attested practice on Mt Athos). In general, the hesychast restricts his external activities for the sake of his hesychastic practice.

Orthodox tradition warns against seeking [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as an end in itself. Hesychasm is a traditional complex of ascetical practices embedded in the doctrine and practice of the Orthodox Church and intended to purify the member of the Orthodox Church and to make him ready for an encounter with God that comes to him when and if God wants, through God's grace. The goal is to acquire, through purification and grace, the Holy Spirit and salvation. Any ecstatic states or other unusual phenomena which may occur in the course of hesychast practice are considered secondary and unimportant, even quite dangerous. Moreover, seeking after unusual "spiritual" experiences can itself cause great harm, ruining the soul and the mind of the seeker. Such a seeking after "spiritual" experiences can lead to [[Prelest|''spiritual delusion'']] (Ru. ''prelest,'' Gr. ''plani)''—the antonym of sobriety—in which a person believes himself or herself to be a saint, has hallucinations in which he or she "sees" angels, Christ, etc. This state of spiritual delusion is in a superficial, egotistical way pleasurable, but can lead to madness and suicide, and, according to the hesychast fathers, makes salvation impossible.

Mount Athos is a center of the practice of hesychasm. St [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] and his disciples [[starets|made the practice known]] in [[Russia]] and [[Romania]], although hesychasm was already previously known in Russia, as is attested by [[St Seraphim of Sarov]]'s independent practice of it.

==Hesychast controversy==
{{main article|Hesychast controversy}}
[[Image:Gregor Palamas.jpg|thumb|upright|Gregory Palamas]]
About the year 1337, hesychasm attracted the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church, [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]], a Calabrian monk who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of [[Chora Church|St Saviour]] in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos. Mount Athos was then at the height of its fame and influence, under the reign of [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]] and under the leadership of the ''Protos'' Symeon. On Mount Athos, Barlaam encountered hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices, also reading the writings of the teacher in hesychasm of St [[Gregory Palamas]], himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the hesychasts taught.

Barlaam took exception to the doctrine entertained by the hesychasts as to the nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of hesychast practice, regarding it as [[Christian heresy|heretical]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. It was maintained by the hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to [[Tabor Light|the light]] which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1999), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; This Barlaam held to be [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], inasmuch as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.

On the hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by St [[Gregory Palamas]], afterwards Archbishop of [[Thessalonica]], who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. St Gregory himself was well-educated in Greek philosophy. St Gregory defended hesychasm in the 1340s at three different synods in [[Constantinople]], and he also wrote a number of works in its defense.

In these works, St Gregory Palamas uses a distinction, already found in the 4th century in the works of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], between the energies or operations (Gr. ''energeies)'' of God and the essence of God. St Gregory taught that the [[Essence-Energies distinction|energies or operations of God were uncreated]]. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creature even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God. In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the uncreated light.

In 1341, the dispute came before a [[synod]] held at [[Constantinople]] and presided over by the Emperor Andronicus III; the synod, taking into account the regard in which the writings of the [[pseudo-Dionysius]] were held, condemned Barlaam, who recanted and returned to Calabria, afterwards becoming a bishop in the [[Catholic Church]].

One of Barlaam's friends, [[Gregory Akindynos]], who originally was also a friend of St Gregory Palamas, took up the controversy, which also played a role in the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347|civil war]] between the supporters of John Cantacuzenus and [[John V Palaiologos]]. Three other synods on the subject were held, at the second of which the followers of Barlaam gained a brief victory. But in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]], hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church.

==Roman Catholic opinions of hesychasm==
[[John Cassian|St. John Cassian]] is not represented in the ''Philokalia'' except by two brief extracts, but this is most likely due to his having written in Latin. His works ''(Coenobitical Institutions'' and the ''Conferences)'' represent a transmittal of Evagrius Pontikos' ascetical doctrines to the West. These works formed the basis of much of the spirituality of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and its offshoots. Hence, the tradition of St John Cassian in the West concerning the spiritual practice of the hermit can be considered to be a tradition that is parallel to that of hesychasm in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

While Constantinople experienced a succession of councils alternately approving and condemning doctrine concerning hesychasm considered as identified with [[Palamism]] (the last of the five senses in which, according to Kallistos Ware, the term is used), the Western Church held no council in which to make a pronouncement on the issue, and the word "hesychasm" does not appear in the [[Denzinger|''Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum'' (Handbook of Creeds and Definitions)]], the collection of Roman Catholic teachings originally compiled by [[Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger]].

The Roman Catholic Church has thus never expressed any condemnation of Palamism, and uses in its [[liturgy]] readings from the work of [[Nicholas Kabasilas]], a supporter of Palamas in the controversy that took place in the East. Its [[Liturgy of the Hours]] includes extracts from Kabasilas's ''Life in Christ'' on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of the Fifth Week of Easter in Year II of the two-year cycle for the Office of Readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercaba.org/HORAS%20BIENAL/TIEMPOS/Par/PAS_PAR_05.htm|title=DOMINGO V DE PASCUA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western theologians have tended to reject hesychasm, in some instances equating it with [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]], perhaps because "quietism" is the literal translation of "hesychasm". However, according to [[Kallistos Ware]], "To translate "hesychasm" as "quietism", while perhaps etymologically defensible, is historically and theologically misleading." Ware asserts that "the distinctive tenets of the 17th-century Western quietists is not characteristic of Greek hesychasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Spirituality |first=Gordon S. |last=Wakefield |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga815P6vxygC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-664-22170-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere too, Ware argues that it is important not to translate "hesychasm" as "quietism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The inner kingdom |first=Kallistos |last=Ware |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2000 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8qaOmtq6xoC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-88141-209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paths to the heart: Sufism and the Christian East |first=James S. |last=Cutsinger |publisher=World Wisdom, Inc |year=2002 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wcEQdkvt3EC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=hesychasm+quietism#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20quietism&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-941532-43-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theologians generally rejected the contention that, in the case of God, the distinction between essence and energies is real rather than, albeit with a foundation in reality, notional (in the mind). In their view, affirming an ontological essence-energies distinction in God contradicted the teaching of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]&lt;ref name=Pelikan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4iQXTf_BE4SWhQfI5qi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=John Meyendorff (editor),'&amp;#39;Gregory Palamas - The Triads'&amp;#39;, p. xi |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[monotheism|divine unity]].{{refn|group=note|name=Vailhe}} According to [[Adrian Fortescue]], the Scholastic theory that God is pure actuality prevented Palamism from having much influence in the West, and it was from Western Scholasticism that hesychasm's philosophical opponents in the East borrowed their weapons.&lt;ref name=Fortescue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Hesychasm |title=Adrian Fortescue, "Hesychasm" in '&amp;#39;Catholic Encyclopedia'&amp;#39;, vol.

In the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1909, Simon Vailhé accused Palamas's teachings that humans could achieve a corporal perception of the divinity, and his distinction between God's essence and his energies, as "monstrous errors" and "perilous theological theories". He further characterized the Eastern canonization of Palamas's teachings as a "resurrection of polytheism".{{refn|group=note|name=Vailhe|"Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'.

The later 20th century saw a remarkable change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a "rehabilitation" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized.&lt;ref name=Pelikan/&gt; John Meyendorff describes the 20th-century rehabilitation of Palamas in the Western Church as a "remarkable event in the history of scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gregory Palamas |author=Saint Gregory Palamas |publisher=Paulist Press |year=1983|page=xi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8091-2447-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas Andreopoulos cites the 1910 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article by Fortescue as an example of how Barlaam's distrustful and hostile attitude regarding hesychasm survived until recently in the West, adding that now "the Western world has started to rediscover what amounts to a lost tradition. Hesychasm, which was never anything close to a scholar's pursuit, is now studied by Western theologians who are astounded by the profound thought and spirituality of late Byzantium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UZCTtEuGcMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=hesychasm+catholic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LH9rTJmdCMWOjAeCvtzWAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hesychasm%20catholic&amp;f=false |title=Andreas Andreopoulos,'&amp;#39;Metamorphosis: The Transfiguration in Byzantine Theology and Iconography'&amp;#39; (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2005, ISBN 0-88141-295-3), pp. 215-216 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between Palamas's teaching and Roman Catholic thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Several Western scholars contend that the teaching of St. Gregory Palamas himself is compatible with Roman Catholic thought on the matter" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22Several+Western+scholars+contend%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hIYXTbXZOo-asAO_oPHaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Several%20Western%20scholars%20contend%22&amp;f=false Michael J.

For example, G. Philips asserts that the essence-energies distinction as presented by Palamas is "a typical example of a perfectly admissible theological pluralism" that is compatible with the Roman Catholic magisterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22Several+Western+scholars+contend%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hIYXTbXZOo-asAO_oPHaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=admissible%20pluralism&amp;f=false |title=Michael J.

Jeffrey D. Finch claims that "the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22Several+Western+scholars+contend%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hIYXTbXZOo-asAO_oPHaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=modern%20polemics&amp;f=false |title=Michael J.

According to [[Kallistos Ware]], some Western theologians, both Roman Catholic and Anglican, see the theology of Palamas as introducing an inadmissible division within God; however, others have incorporated his theology into their own thinking,&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; maintaining, as Jeffrey D. Finch reports, that there is no conflict between his teaching and Roman Catholic thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Several Western scholars contend that the teaching of St. Gregory Palamas himself is compatible with Roman Catholic thought on the matter" ([http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Christensen+%22scholars+contend%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=Wittung+%22Western+scholars%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=74612238bd021ae1 MichaelJ.Christensen, Jeffery A.

[[Pope John Paul II]] repeatedly emphasized his respect for Eastern theology as an enrichment for the whole Church, declaring that, even after the painful division between the Christian East and the See of Rome, that theology has opened up profound thought-provoking perspectives of interest to the entire Catholic Church. He spoke in particular of the [[hesychast controversy]]. The term "hesychasm", he said, refers to a practice of prayer marked by deep tranquillity of the spirit intent on contemplating God unceasingly by invoking the name of Jesus. While from a Catholic viewpoint there have been tensions concerning some developments of the practice, the pope said, there is no denying the goodness of the intention that inspired its defence, which was to stress that man is offered the concrete possibility of uniting himself in his inner heart with God in that profound union of grace known as ''theosis'', divinization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumkatkilise.org/byzpope.htm |title=Pope John Paul II and the East Pope John Paul II.

The Jesus Prayer is referred to in [[J. D. Salinger]]'s pair of stories ''[[Franny and Zooey]]''. It is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film ''[[Ostrov (film)|Ostrov]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a period of strict silence.

In the early 1970s, Janakananda advanced the teaching of the tantric [[Neotantra|sexual rituals]]. But, faced with criticism in the media and society in general, he quickly discontinued the teaching of this practice in favor of the more deep-reaching methods of tantra. Nevertheless, he has had "a profound, and often unacknowledged influence on many Western [[w: Mark A. Michaels|Neo-Tantric teacher]]s and practitioners of sacred sexuality".&lt;ref name="MichaelsJohnson2006"&gt;{{cite book

In 1977, Janakananda organized "Meditation Yoga 77", an international yoga congress held in [[Stockholm]] and attended by an eclectic list of speakers, reflecting the many Indian teachers who would visit the Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School in succeeding years.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Constance A. and Ryan, James D.

Janakananda uses various mediums in his teaching. These have included art, technology and science. Janakananda was a close friend and associate of the tantric poet and painter [[Sohan Qadri]]. For many years, they worked together on promoting the tantric practice of [[yantra]] meditation in the West. Janakananda is prominently featured on ''The Seer'', a short film about the life and art of Sohan Qadri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

===Immediate family===
In 1772, Andrews married Elizabeth Callender, daughter of Revolutionary Capt. Robert Callender of [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] and Frances Slough. They had ten children, Robert (2), John (5), Letitia, Mary, Joseph, William Neill, George, Elizabeth Callender, Edward (5), and Mary Benger.&lt;ref name=wyker/&gt; The eldest, Robert, graduated at the Academy and College of Philadelphia in 1790. Mrs. Andrews death on 22 February 1798, was occasioned by the death of shock she encountered by a sudden death of a son caused by a fire.&lt;ref name="America 1492"&gt;The Annals of America: From the Discovery by Columbus in the Year 1492, to the Year 1826, Volume 2. Hilliard and Brown, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
When he was seven years old, Andrews's father enrolled him in the Newcastle Presbytery's Head of Elk School in [[Elkton, Maryland|Head of Elk, Maryland]]. Andrews received an A.B. with distinguished honor from [[College of Philadelphia|The Academy and College of Philadelphia]] in 1764. He later taught grammar school in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1767, he received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the [[College of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="eminent philadelphians"/&gt;

Andrews continued his connection with the Grammar School and then took charge of a classical school in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. Having previously resolved to devote himself to the ministry in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], he studied [[theology]] under the Rev. Thomas Barton, Rector of St. James's Church in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Andrews then sailed for London, England, where he was ordained a [[Deacon]] in the [[Anglican Church]]. He was then appointed a [[Missionary]] to [[Lewes, Delaware]] by the [[USPG|Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts]].

==Career==
'''Rev. John Andrews''' ministered at [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Lewes, Delaware)]] from 1767 through 1770. He then transferred to [[York, Pennsylvania]], where assumed missionary jurisdiction at St. John's Church in York, [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]] and St. John's Church in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] in [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]]. Sometime in 1775 he took charge of St. John's Church in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. As the [[American Revolutionary War]] progressed, Andrews grew conflicted: his political sympathies lay with the Americans, but he believed the oath of allegiance to England he took as part of his Holy Orders took precedence. He recused himself from public exercise of his profession and returned to York.

In 1776, during this period in York, Andrews founded the academy that evolved under several changes to become known as today the [[York College of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104214803/http://www.ycp.edu/library/spec_coll/dates.html|title=Schmidt Library Special Collections|date=4 January 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''York College of Pennsylvania''.

After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]], Andrews resumed his clerical duties. On 13 April 1782 he returned to Maryland to become rector of [[St. Thomas Church (Owings Mills, Maryland)|St. Thomas Church in Garrison Forest]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], a position he held until 1784. That same year he was a member of the convention that organized the separation of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American Episcopal Church]] from the Anglican Church. He later advocated for union with the [[Methodist Church]].
[[File:Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia..jpg|thumb|Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, Circa 1790]]
In 1785, [[Washington College]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]] awarded Andrews an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]]. That same year, when [[Episcopal Academy]] was founded in Philadelphia, the Academy's trustees unanimously elected Andrews as headmaster. He served in this position until 1789,&lt;ref name="EMINENT PHILADELPHIANS, NOW DECEASED 1859, p.15"&gt;EMINENT PHILADELPHIANS, NOW DECEASED.

Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1859, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; when he became Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. At UPenn he lectured admiringly on the [[Constitution of the United States]]. Of the said college, John Andrews became Vice-Provost 1789–1810 and [[Provost (education)|Provost]] from 1810 until his death from sudden illness on 29 March 1813.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of America: From the Discovery by Columbus in the Year 1492, to the Year 1826, Volume 2.''

New York: Charles Scribner. 1855. p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death he also served as Rector of St. James Church in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]], and assistant minister of Christ Church in Philadelphia. Rev. John Andrews is considered one of America's first scholars for he dedicated his career as a student, tutor, professor, lecturer, author, founder and administrator of schools and colleges.
He was elected on into the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania: its history, influence, equipment and characteristics; with biographical sketches and portraits of founders, benefactors, officers and alumni, Volume I.

'''John A. Dupré''' (born 1952) is a professional [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]]. He is the director of the ESRC Centre for Genomics in Society and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Exeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6983330.stm|title=Starch 'fuel of human evolution'|date=9 September 2007|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dupré was educated at the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] and taught at Oxford, [[Stanford University]] and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] of the [[University of London]] before moving to Exeter. Dupré's chief work area lies in [[philosophy of biology]], philosophy of the [[social science]]s, and general philosophy of science. Dupré, together with [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[Ian Hacking]] and [[Patrick Suppes]] and [[Peter Galison]], are often grouped together as the "[[Stanford School]]" of [[philosophy of science]].

In 2010 Dupré was elected a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in
recognition of his work on Darwinism, and became President-Elect of the British Society for the
Philosophy of Science. He is also an elected member of the governing board of the Philosophy of Science
Association (USA) and of the council of the International Society for the History Philosophy and Social
Studies of Biology.

==Pluralistic metaphysics==
Dupré advocates a pluralistic model of science as opposed to the common notion of [[reductionism]].  Physical Reductionism suggests that all science may be reduced to physical explanations due to [[causality|causal]] or [[mereology|mereological]] links that obtain between the objects studied in the higher sciences the objects studied by [[physics]].  For example, a physical reductionist would see [[psychology|psychological]] facts as (in principle) reducible to [[neurology|neurological]] facts, which is in turn are reducible to [[biology|biological]] facts.  Biology could then be explained in terms of [[chemistry]], and chemistry could then be explained in terms of physical [[explanation]]. While reductionism of this sort is a common position among scientists and philosophers, Dupré suggests that such reduction is not possible as the world has an inherently pluralistic structure.

==Determinism==
A classical argument for reductionism relies on a particular conception of causality, according to which each event must have a sufficient physical cause. Physical interactions are therefore sufficient to account for all causal interactions.  Under this assumption, psychological or biological facts must be eliminable in favour of physical facts, given that the physical conditions do all the causal work.  This makes all the other, non-physical conditions causally superfluous.

Dupré tries to escape this problem by rejecting [[determinism]], and the assumption that there is a physical cause for each and every event. In place of Determinism, Dupré proposes a conception of indeterministic, [[probability|probabilistic causality]]. His ideas are influenced by [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]].   The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] represents a similar position.

==Philosophy of biology==
Dupré is an important critic of biological research programs in the life science community. In particular, he criticises evolution-biological stories and how they are related in [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Dupré argues that such projects must remain speculative and reflect on the prejudices of the researchers as circumstances in the world.

Dupré is also concerned with the handling of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].  Biological classifications are made by humans, and are thus open to criticism and modification. This applies in particular to the classifications of humans – for instance after [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender|sex]].  Dupré's arguments in this area reflect and mirror the sentiments and criticism of evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

'''Jonathan Dymond''' (1796–1828) was an English [[Quakers|Quaker]] and an [[Ethics|ethical philosopher]] who is known for his [[monograph]] ''An Enquiry into the Accordancy of War with the Principles of Christianity''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qhpress.org/texts/dymond/index.html Online text of ''Dymond on War'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qhpress.org/texts/dymond/about_jd.html Notes about John Dymond by Larry Kuenning, for the Quaker Heritage Press, quoting Rufus Jones ''The Later Periods of Quakerism'' (London: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 716–1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dymond, Jonathan (DNB00)|DNB article on Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Jonathan Dymond was the son of a Quaker linen-draper of Exeter, County Devon in England. Both his parents were '[[Recorded Minister]]s' of the Society of Friends.  He had little formal education but used his time off from working in his father's shop to read and to write essays on religious and moral problems, as well as composing poetry.  He determined that he should devote his energies to 'the honour of advocating peace'.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book|last=Brock|first=Peter|title=The Quaker Peace Testimony, 1660–1914|year=1990|publisher=Sessions|location=York|isbn=1-85072-065-7|pages=257–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view war was "an evil before which, in my estimation, slavery sinks into insignificance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dymond|first=Charles William|title=Memoir, Letters and Poems of Jonathan Dymond|year=1911|publisher=Privately Published|location=Bristol|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825 he attended the annual meeting of the [[Peace Society]] in London and went on to help set up a branch of that society in Exeter. He soon had to withdraw from taking an active part due to his failing health.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;

== Works ==

Three works by Dymond have been published, two during his lifetime, the ''Inquiry'' and the ''Observations'', and one posthumously, the ''Essays''. A collection of his published and unpublished letters, poems and writings was made in 1911 by Charles William Dymond.
 
# ''An inquiry into the Accordancy of War with the Principles of Christianity, and an Examination of the Philosophical Reasoning by which it is defended: with Observations on Some of the Causes of War and Some of Its Effects.'' 1823 in England [Philadelphia 1834] [British Library 001023068] 
# ''Observations on the Applicability of the Pacifist Principles of the New Testament on the Conduct of States, and on the Limitations which those principles impose on the Rights of Self-defence.'' London Peace Society Tract No. VII, 1825 [British Library #001023074] 
# ''Essays on the Principles of Morality, and on the Private and Political Rights and Obligations of Mankind.'' In two volumes, Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co, 1829 [British Library #001023056] 
# ''Memoir, letters and poems of Jonathan Dymond : with bibliographical supplements'': Charles William Dymond: privately printed, Bristol, 1911 [British Library # 007585688]

{{quotation|He was anxious to collaborate with other pacifists and near pacifists in an interdenominational peace movement and opposed any talk of confining the Quaker peace effort within their own ranks. His spirit was in no way sectarian: he welcomed all who wished to work sincerely for peace and it was as much for non-Quakers and for Quakers that he composed his works on the subject.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;}}

In his works Dymond extended the pacifist argument against war beyond the purely Christian insight of earlier generations of Quakers to wider more rationalist arguments, as in this against the notion of a distinction between aggressive and defensive war from the ''Inquiry'':

{{quotation|When nations are mutually exasperated, and armies are levied, and battles fought, does not every one know that with whatever motives of defence one party may have begun the contest, both in turn become aggressors? In the fury of slaughter soldiers do not attend, they cannot attend, to questions of aggression. Their business is destruction, and their business they will perform. If the army of defence obtains success, it soon becomes an army of aggression. Having repelled the invader, it begins to punish him. If a war has once begun, it is vain to talk of distinctions of aggression and defence. Moralists may talk of distinctions, but soldiers will make none; and none can be made: it is outside the limits of possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dymond was a fervent antimilitarist. He saw armies as enemies of liberty and physical and moral subjection as a necessary condition of army life. The opinion he voiced prefigures some of the later objections to conscription made by Quakers and other conscientious objectors.

{{quotation|The soldier is compelled to obey, whatever be his inclination or his will. Being in the service, he has but one alternative – submission to arbitrary power, or punishment – the punishment of death perhaps, – for refusing to submit. Let the reader imagine himself in any other cause or purpose for which freemen shall be subjected to such a condition, and he then see that condition in its proper light. The influence of habit and the gloss of public opinion makes situations that would otherwise be loathsome and revolting, not only tolerable but pleasurable. Take away this influence and this gloss from the situation of a soldier, and what should we call it? We should call it a state of degradation and bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Essays, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was born in [[Germany]] to [[Jewish]] parents and later emigrated from Germany to the United States. He spent much of his career as a professor of political science at the [[University of Chicago]], where he taught several generations of students and published fifteen books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leostrausscenter.uchicago.edu/ The Leo Strauss Center] website 'biography' section&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained in the [[neo-Kantian]] tradition with [[Ernst Cassirer]] and immersed in the work of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], Strauss later focused his research on the Greek texts of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], retracing their interpretation through medieval [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] and [[Jewish philosophy]] and encouraging the application of those ideas to contemporary political theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leostrausscenter.uchicago.edu/ The Leo Strauss Center] website 'about' section&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Leo Strauss was born in the small town of [[Kirchhain]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (part of the [[German Empire]]), on September 20, 1899, to Hugo Strauss and Jennie Strauss, née David. According to [[Allan Bloom]]'s 1974 obituary in ''Political Theory'', Strauss "was raised as an [[Orthodox Jew]]," but the family does not appear to have completely embraced Orthodox practice.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Lüders and Ariane Wehner, ''Mittelhessen – eine Heimat für Juden? Das Schicksal der Familie Strauss aus Kirchhain'' (Central Hesse – a Homeland for Jews? The Fate of the Strauss Family from Kirchhain) 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss himself noted that he came from a "conservative, even orthodox Jewish home," but one which knew little about Judaism except strict adherence to ceremonial laws. His father and uncle operated a farm supply and livestock business that they inherited from their father, Meyer (1835–1919), a leading member of the local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;In "A Giving of Accounts", published in ''The College'' 22 (1) and later reprinted in ''[[Jewish Philosophy]] and the Crisis of [[Modernity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After attending the Kirchhain Volksschule and the Protestant Rektoratsschule, Leo Strauss was enrolled at the [[Gymnasium Philippinum]] (affiliated with the [[University of Marburg]]) in nearby [[Marburg]] (from which [[Johannes Althusius]] and [[Carl J. Friedrich]] also graduated) in 1912, graduating in 1917. He boarded with the Marburg [[Hazzan|cantor]] Strauss (no relation); the Cantor's residence served as a meeting place for followers of the [[neo-Kantian]] philosopher [[Hermann Cohen]]. Strauss served in the German army during [[World War I]] from July 5, 1917 to December 1918.

Strauss subsequently enrolled in the [[University of Hamburg]], where he received his [[doctorate]] in 1921; his [[thesis]], ''On the Problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of [[F. H. Jacobi]]'' (''Das Erkenntnisproblem in der philosophischen Lehre Fr. H. Jacobis''), was supervised by [[Ernst Cassirer]]. He also attended courses at the Universities of [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], including some taught by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Strauss joined a Jewish fraternity and worked for the German Zionist movement, which introduced him to various German Jewish intellectuals, such as [[Norbert Elias]], [[Leo Löwenthal]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Walter Benjamin]].  Walter Benjamin was and remained an admirer of Strauss and of his work throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Hart Green page 55"&gt;''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1981. page 201"&gt;Scholem, Gershom. 1981. Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship. Trans. Harry Zohn, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gershom Scholem 1989, page 155-58"&gt;''The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, 1932–40'', New York 1989, pp. 155–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss' closest friend was [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] but he also was intellectually engaged with [[Karl Löwith]], [[Julius Guttman]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]] (to whom Strauss dedicated his first book), [[Gershom Scholem]], [[Alexander Altmann]], and the Arabist [[Paul Kraus (Arabist)|Paul Kraus]], who married Strauss' sister Bettina (Strauss and his wife later adopted their child when both parents died in the [[Middle East]]). With several of these friends, Strauss carried on vigorous epistolary exchanges later in life, many of which are published in the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (''Collected Writings''), some in translation from the German. Strauss had also been engaged in a [[discourse]] with [[Carl Schmitt]]. However, after Strauss left Germany, he broke off the discourse when Schmitt failed to respond to his letters.

In 1931, Strauss sought his post-doctoral [[habilitation]] with the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], but was turned down. After receiving a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] in 1932, Strauss left his position at the [[Higher Institute for Jewish Studies]] in [[Berlin]] for [[Paris]]. He returned to Germany only once, for a few short days twenty years later. In Paris he married Marie (Miriam) Bernsohn, a widow with a young child, whom he had known previously in Germany. He adopted his wife's son, Thomas, and later his sister's child; he and Miriam had no biological children of their own. At his death he was survived by Thomas, daughter [[Jenny Strauss Clay]], and three grandchildren. Strauss became a lifelong friend of [[Alexandre Kojève]] and was on friendly terms with [[Raymond Aron]], [[Alexandre Koyré]], and [[Étienne Gilson]]. Because of the Nazis' rise to power, he chose not to return to his native country. Strauss found shelter, after some vicissitudes, in England, where in 1935 he gained temporary employment at [[University of Cambridge]], with the help of his in-law, [[David Daube]], who was affiliated with [[Gonville and Caius College]]. While in England, he became a close friend of [[R. H. Tawney]], and was on less friendly terms with [[Isaiah Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=H3QyfGR9qM4C&amp;pg=PA87 Leo Strauss And the Politics of Exile: The Making of a Political Philosopher] p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

== American years ==
[[File:Campus Spring.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[University of Chicago]], the school with which Strauss is most closely associated.]]

Unable to find permanent employment in England, Strauss moved in 1937 to the United States, under the patronage of [[Harold Laski]], who made introductions and helped him obtain a brief lectureship. After a short stint as [[Research Fellow]] in the Department of History at [[Columbia University]], Strauss secured a position at [[The New School]], where, between 1938 and 1948, he worked the political science faculty and also took on adjunct jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugene Sheppard|title=Leo Strauss and the Politics of Exile: The Making of a Political Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNmPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT102|year=2014|publisher=Brandeis UP|pages=102–03|isbn=9781611687699}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he served for a short term as a visiting professor at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]. He became a U.S. citizen in 1944, and in 1949 he became a professor of political science at the [[University of Chicago]], holding the Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professorship  until he left in 1969.

In 1953, Strauss coined the phrase "[[reductio ad Hitlerum]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''Natural Right and History''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965 [1953], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 he met [[Löwith]] and [[Gadamer]] in [[Heidelberg]] and delivered a public speech on [[Socrates]].  He had received a call for a temporary lectureship in [[Hamburg]] in 1965 (which he declined for health reasons) and received and accepted an honorary doctorate from [[Hamburg University]] and the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]] (German Order of Merit) via the German representative in Chicago. In 1969 Strauss moved to [[Claremont McKenna College]] (formerly Claremont Men's College) in California for a year, and then to [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, Annapolis]] in 1970, where he was the Scott Buchanan Distinguished Scholar in Residence until his death from pneumonia in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpl8aokR5ZUC&amp;pg=PA6 Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modernity] preface p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Strauss, politics and philosophy were necessarily intertwined. He regarded the trial and death of [[Socrates]] as the moment when political philosophy came into existence. Strauss considered one of the most important moments in the [[history of philosophy]] Socrates' argument that philosophers could not study [[nature]] without considering their own [[human nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Lampert, ''The Enduring Importance of Leo Strauss'', University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the words of [[Aristotle]], is that of "a political animal."&lt;ref&gt;"From these things it is evident, that the city belongs among the things that exist by nature, and that man is by nature a political animal" (Aristotle, ''The Politics'', 1253a1–3).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also held that the ends of politics and philosophy were inherently irreconcilable and irreducible to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Smith, ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Pangle|Pangle, Thomas L.]], ''Leo Strauss: An Introduction to His Thought and Intellectual Legacy''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2006, p. 51: "Classical political philosophy is not concerned to rule, but it is concerned to understand, political society—and to share its understanding, in a constructive fashion, with political society, as much as possible."&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss distinguished "scholars" from "great thinkers", identifying himself as a scholar. He wrote that most self-described philosophers are in actuality scholars, cautious and methodical. Great thinkers, in contrast, boldly and creatively address big problems. Scholars deal with these problems only indirectly by reasoning about the great thinkers' differences.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "An Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism", 27–46 in ''The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism'', ed. Thomas L. Pangle (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1989) 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Natural Right and History'' Strauss begins with a critique of [[Max Weber]]'s [[epistemology]], briefly engages the [[relativism]] of [[Martin Heidegger]] (who goes unnamed), and continues with a discussion of the evolution of [[natural right]]s via an analysis of the thought of [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]]. He concludes by critiquing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Edmund Burke]]. At the heart of the book are excerpts from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Cicero]]. Much of his philosophy is a reaction to the works of Heidegger. Indeed, Strauss wrote that Heidegger's thinking must be understood and confronted before any complete formulation of modern political theory is possible, and this entails that political thought has to engage with issues of ontology and the history of metaphysics.

Strauss wrote that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was the first philosopher to properly understand [[historicism]], an idea grounded in a general acceptance of Hegelian [[philosophy of history]]. Heidegger, in Strauss' view, sanitized and politicized Nietzsche, whereas Nietzsche believed "our own principles, including the belief in progress, will become as unconvincing and alien as all earlier principles (essences) had shown themselves to be" and "the only way out seems to be ... that one voluntarily choose life-giving delusion instead of deadly truth, that one fabricate a myth".&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "Relativism", 13–26 in ''The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism'', ed. Thomas L. Pangle, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger believed that the tragic [[nihilism]] of Nietzsche was a "myth" guided by a defective Western conception of [[Being]] that Heidegger traced to Plato. In his published correspondence with [[Alexandre Kojève]], Strauss wrote that [[Hegel]] was correct when he postulated that an end of history implies an end to philosophy as understood by classical political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/191204?uid=3738240&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100726877111 Leo Strauss's Classic Natural Right Teaching], S. B. Drury, [[Political Theory]] magazine, Vol. 15, No. 3 (August 1987), pp. 299–315&lt;/ref&gt;

== On reading ==
[[File:Al-Farabi.jpg|thumb|Strauss's study of philosophy and political discourses produced by the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]], above all those of [[Al-Farabi]], and [[Maimonides]], was instrumental in the development of his theory of reading.]]

In the late 1930s, Strauss called for the first time for a reconsideration of the "distinction between exoteric (or public) and esoteric (or secret) teaching".&lt;ref&gt;"Exoteric Teaching" (Critical Edition by Hannes Kerber). In ''Reorientation: Leo Strauss in the 1930s''. Edited by Martin D. Yaffe and Richard S. Ruderman. New York: Palgrave, 2014, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 he published ''[[Persecution and the Art of Writing]]'', arguing that serious writers write esoterically, that is, with multiple or layered meanings, often disguised within irony or paradox, obscure references, even deliberate self-contradiction. Esoteric writing serves several purposes: protecting the philosopher from the retribution of the regime, and protecting the regime from the corrosion of philosophy; it attracts the right kind of reader and repels the wrong kind; and ferreting out the interior message is in itself an exercise of philosophic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, Steven |coauthors= |title=Reading Leo Strauss|year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=excerpt entitled "Why Strauss, Why Now?"   | url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/764028.html |isbn=0226763897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mansfield, Harvey |coauthors= |title=Strauss's Machiavelli |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/190834?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102267682007 |quote= ... a book containing much that is appreciably esoteric to any reader stated in a manner either so elusive or so challenging as to cause him to give up trying to understand it. |work=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] |year=1975 |accessdate=2013-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Damon Linker |coauthors= |title=What if Leo Strauss was Right? |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/271006/what-if-leo-strauss-was-right |quote= |work=[[The Week]] |date=October 31, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking his bearings from his study of [[Maimonides]] and [[Al Farabi]], and pointing further back to Plato's discussion of writing as contained in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Strauss proposed that the classical and medieval art of ''esoteric'' writing is the proper medium for philosophic learning: rather than displaying  philosophers' thoughts superficially, classical and medieval philosophical texts guide their readers in thinking and learning independently of imparted knowledge. Thus, Strauss agrees with the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'', where the Greek indicates that, insofar as writing does not respond when questioned, good writing provokes questions in the reader—questions that orient the reader towards an understanding of problems the author thought about with utmost seriousness.

[[Straussian hermeneutics|Strauss's hermeneutical]] argument&lt;ref name="Schröder"/&gt;—rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in ''The City and Man'' [1964])—is that, prior to the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal. Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo. In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner. Their "art of writing" was the art of esoteric communication. This was especially apparent in medieval times, when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably obtuse tribunals.

Strauss's argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many ([[hoi polloi]]) and an esoteric, hidden one for the few (hoi aristoi), but that, through rhetorical stratagems including self-contradiction and hyperboles, these writers succeeded in conveying their proper meaning at the tacit heart of their writings—a heart or message irreducible to "the letter" or historical dimension of texts.

Explicitly following [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by "the many" (who did not read), but by those "few" whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality. It was precisely these righteous personalities who would be most inclined to persecute/ostracize anyone who was in the business of exposing the noble or great lie upon which the authority of the few over the many stands or falls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubxOiy1-lpQC&amp;pg=PA25 Jew and Philosopher: The Return to Maimonides in the Jewish Thought of Leo Strauss] p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his critics, especially [[Shadia Drury]], Strauss wrongly assumes a distinction between an "exoteric" or salutary and an "esoteric" or "true" aspect of the philosophy of pre-modern political philosophers. Furthermore, Strauss is often accused of having himself written esoterically. The accusation would seem to rest upon the belief that in modern [[Liberal democracy|liberal]] societies and, especially in the United States, philosophers are not free to voice their philosophical views in public without being accused of impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5010.htm Noble lies And Perpetual War: Leo Strauss, The Neo-Cons, And Iraq] article at the [[Information Clearing House]] (conspiracy theorists) website&lt;/ref&gt;

==On politics==
{{Conservatism sidebar |People |People}}

According to Strauss, modern [[social science]] is flawed because it assumes the [[fact–value distinction]], a concept which Strauss found dubious. He traced its roots in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy to [[Max Weber]], a thinker whom Strauss described as a "serious and noble mind." Weber wanted to separate values from science but, according to Strauss, was really a derivative thinker, deeply influenced by Nietzsche's [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Bloom]], "Leo Strauss", 235–55 in ''Giants and Dwarfs: Essays 1960–1990'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990) 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss treated politics as something that could not be studied from afar. A political scientist examining politics with a value-free scientific eye, for Strauss, was self-deluded. [[Positivism]], the heir to both [[Auguste Comte]] and Max Weber in the quest to make purportedly value-free judgments, failed to justify its own existence, which would require a value judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=In0tFsfFhnQC&amp;pg=PA193 ''Faith and Political Philosophy: The Correspondence Between Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, 1934–1964''], p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Classical liberalism|modern liberalism]] had stressed the pursuit of individual liberty as its highest goal, Strauss felt that there should be a greater interest in the problem of human excellence and political virtue. Through his writings, Strauss constantly raised the question of how, and to what extent, freedom and excellence can coexist. Strauss refused to make do with any simplistic or one-sided resolutions of the Socratic question: ''What is the [[Goodness and evil|good]] for the city and man?''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker''], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encounters with Schmitt and Kojève===
Two significant political-philosophical dialogues Strauss had with living thinkers were those he held with [[Carl Schmitt]] and [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Schmitt, who would later become, for a short time, the chief jurist of Nazi Germany, was one of the first important German academics to review Strauss's early work positively. Schmitt's positive reference for, and approval of, Strauss's work on [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] was instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss's critique and clarifications of ''[[The Concept of the Political]]'' led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt in 1932, Strauss summarised Schmitt's political theology that "because man is by nature evil, he therefore needs ''dominion''. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men ... the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state."&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss, however, directly opposed Schmitt's position. For Strauss, Schmitt and his return to [[Thomas Hobbes]] helpfully clarified the nature of our political existence and our modern self-understanding. Schmitt's position was therefore symptomatic of the modern [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] self-understanding. Strauss believed that such an analysis, as in Hobbes's time, served as a useful "preparatory action", revealing our contemporary orientation towards the eternal problems of politics (social existence). However, Strauss believed that Schmitt's reification of our modern self-understanding of the problem of politics into a political theology was not an adequate solution. Strauss instead advocated a return to a broader classical understanding of human nature and a tentative return to political philosophy, in the tradition of the ancient philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

With Kojève, Strauss had a close and lifelong philosophical friendship. They had first met as students in Berlin. The two thinkers shared a boundless philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that, without befriending Strauss, "I never would have known ... what philosophy is".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lilla |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Lilla |chapter=Alexandre Kojève |title=The Reckless Mind. Intellectuals in Politics |year=2001 |publisher=New York Review Books |location=New York |page=131 |isbn=0-940322-76-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The political-philosophical dispute between Kojève and Strauss centred on the role that philosophy should and can be allowed to play in politics.

Kojève, a senior civil servant in the French government, was instrumental in the creation of the [[European Economic Community]]. He argued that philosophers should have an active role in shaping political events. Strauss, on the contrary, believed that philosophers should play a role in politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophy, which he saw as mankind's highest activity, can be free from political intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Strauss | first = Leo | title = On Tyranny | editor-last = Gourevitch | editor-first = Victor | editor2-last = Roth | editor2-first = Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism and nihilism===
Strauss taught that [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]] in its modern form (which is oriented toward [[Liberty|universal freedom]] as opposed to "ancient liberalism" which is oriented toward [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|human excellence]]), contained within it an intrinsic tendency towards extreme [[relativism]], which in turn led to two types of [[nihilism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Pangle, "Epilogue", 907–38 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 907–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was a "brutal" nihilism, expressed in [[Nazi]] and [[Marxist]] regimes. In ''On Tyranny'', he wrote that these [[ideologies]], both descendants of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, tried to destroy all traditions, history, ethics, and moral standards and replace them by force under which nature and mankind are subjugated and conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''On Tyranny'' (New York: Free Press, 1991) 22–23, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The second type—the "gentle" nihilism expressed in Western [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]—was a kind of value-free aimlessness and a [[hedonism|hedonistic]] "permissive [[egalitarianism]]", which he saw as permeating the fabric of contemporary American society.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "The Crisis of Our Time", 41–54 in Howard Spaeth, ed., ''The Predicament of Modern Politics'' (Detroit: University of Detroit Press, 1964) 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "What Is Political Philosophy?" 9–55 in Leo Strauss, ''What Is Political Philosophy? and Other Studies'' (Glencoe, IL: The Free Press, 1959) 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the belief that 20th century relativism, [[scientism]], [[historicism]], and nihilism were all implicated in the deterioration of [[modernism|modern society]] and philosophy, Strauss sought to uncover the philosophical pathways that had led to this situation. The resultant study led him to advocate a tentative return to classical political philosophy as a starting point for judging political action.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''The City and Man'' (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1964) 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strauss's interpretation of Plato's ''Republic''===
According to Strauss, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' by [[Plato]] is not "a blueprint for regime reform" (a play on words from [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', which attacks ''The Republic'' for being just that). Strauss quotes [[Cicero]]: "''The Republic'' does not bring to light the best possible regime but rather the nature of political things—the nature of the city."&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "Plato", 33–89 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss argued that the city-in-speech was unnatural, precisely because "it is rendered possible by the abstraction from ''eros''".&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, "Plato", 33–89 in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Though skeptical of "progress", Strauss was equally skeptical about political agendas of "return"—that is, going backward instead of forward.

In fact, he was consistently suspicious of anything claiming to be a solution to an old political or philosophical problem. He spoke of the danger in trying finally to resolve the debate between [[rationalism]] and [[tradition]]alism in politics. In particular, along with many in the [[Weimar Republic|pre-World War&amp;nbsp;II]] German Right, he feared people trying to force a [[world state]] to come into being in the future, thinking that it would inevitably become a [[tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=puxRXDxS5TMC ''On Tyranny''], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Hence he kept his distance from the totalitarianisms of his century, the right-wing fascists and the left-wing communists.

===Strauss and Karl Popper===
Strauss actively rejected [[Karl Popper]]'s views as illogical. He agreed with a letter of response to his request of [[Eric Voegelin]] to look into the issue. In the response, Voegelin wrote that studying Popper's views was a waste of precious time, and "an annoyance". Specifically about ''[[Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and Popper's understanding of Plato's ''The Republic'', after giving some examples, Voegelin wrote:

{{quote|Popper is philosophically so uncultured, so fully a primitive ideological brawler, that he is not able even approximately to reproduce correctly the contents of one page of Plato. Reading is of no use to him; he is too lacking in knowledge to understand what the author says.}}

Strauss proceeded to show this letter to [[Kurt Riezler]] who used his influence in order to oppose Popper's appointment at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephilosophyofscience.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/strauss-and-voegelin-on-popper/ The Philosophy of Science, Strauss and Voegelin on Popper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728053558/http://thephilosophyofscience.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/strauss-and-voegelin-on-popper/ |date=2013-07-28 }}, July 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancients and Moderns===
Strauss constantly stressed the importance of two dichotomies in political philosophy: [[Athens]] and [[Jerusalem]] ([[Reason]] and [[Revelation]]) and Ancient versus Modern. The "Ancients" were the Socratic philosophers and their intellectual heirs; the "Moderns" start with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. The contrast between Ancients and Moderns was understood to be related to the unresolvable tension between Reason and Revelation. The Socratics, reacting to the first [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, brought philosophy back to earth, and hence back to the marketplace, making it more political.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0AUpAMhf8OAC&amp;pg=PA104 Leo Strauss, the Straussians, and the American Regime]'' by Kenneth Deutch (1999), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moderns reacted to the dominance of revelation in [[medieval]] society by promoting the possibilities of Reason. They objected to Aquinas's merger of natural right and [[natural theology]], for it made natural right vulnerable to sideshow theological disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo, ''Natural Right and History'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]], under the influence of [[Francis Bacon]], re-oriented political thought to what was most solid but also most low in man—his physical hopes and fears—setting a precedent for [[John Locke]] and the later economic approach to political thought, as in [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9iWFmynOUEC&amp;pg=PA204 Adam Smith in His Time and Ours: Designing the Decent Society] By Jerry Z. Müller&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strauss and Zionism ===
As a youth, Strauss belonged to the German Zionist youth group, along with his friends [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Both were admirers of Strauss and would continue to be throughout their lives.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Hart Green p. 55"&gt;''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 17, as he said, he was "converted" to political Zionism as a follower of [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]]. He wrote several essays pertaining to its controversies but left these activities behind by his early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. H. (editor), Strauss, Leo, ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity : Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', 1997, State University of New York Press, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

While Strauss maintained a sympathetic interest in Zionism, he later came to refer to Zionism as "problematic" and became disillusioned with some of its aims.

He taught at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] during the 1954–55 [[academic year]]. In his letter to a ''[[National Review]]'' editor, Strauss asked why [[Israel]] had been called a [[racist]] state by one of their writers. He argued that the author did not provide enough proof for his argument. He ended his essay with the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. H. (editor), Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity : Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', 1997, State University of New York Press, pp. 413–14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Political Zionism is problematic for obvious reasons. But I can never forget what it achieved as a moral force in an era of complete dissolution. It helped to stem the tide of "progressive" leveling of venerable, ancestral differences; it fulfilled a conservative function.}}

==Religious belief==
Although Strauss espoused the utility of religious belief, there is some question about his views on its truth.&lt;ref name=dannhauser/&gt; In some quarters the opinion has been that, whatever his views on the utility of religion, he was personally an atheist.&lt;ref name=dannhauser&gt;Dannhauser, Werner J. ''Leo Strauss in His Letters'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-gJ5YwN_awC Enlightening revolutions: Essays in Honor of Ralph Lerner], edited by Svetozar Minkov and Stephane Douard, p. 360 (2007 Lexington Books)&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss, however, was openly disdainful of atheism, as he made apparent in his writings on Max Weber. He especially disapproved of contemporary [[dogma]]tic disbelief, which he considered intemperate and irrational and felt that one should either be "the philosopher open to the challenge of theology or the theologian open to the challenge of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Kenneth L. and Walter Nicgorski [https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC Leo Strauss: Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker] pp. 11–12, 1994 Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt; One interpretation is that Strauss, in the interplay of Jerusalem and Athens, or revelation and reason, sought, as did [[Thomas Aquinas]], to hold revelation to the rigours of reason, but where Aquinas saw an amicable interplay, Strauss saw two impregnable fortresses.&lt;ref&gt;Schall S.J., James V. ''A Latitude for Statesmanship: Strauss on St. Thomas'' in [https://books.google.com/books?id=zG2tRJHEdLUC Leo Strauss: Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker], ed. Kenneth L. Deutsch and Walter Nicgorski, pp. 212–15, 1994 Rowman &amp; Littlefield. For an early treatment of Aquinas' understanding of the relation between philosophy and sacred, revealed law, see Strauss's early ''Philosophy and Law'' (''Philosophie und Gesetz''), where Christian medieval theology testifies to a less than amicable opposition between pagan (though not necessarily Platonic or political) philosophy and Biblical morality.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Dannhauser, in analyzing Strauss' letters, writes, "It will not do to simply think of Strauss as a godless, a [[secular]], a lukewarm Jew."&lt;ref name=dannhauser/&gt; As one commenter, [[Edward Feser]], put it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strauss was not himself an orthodox believer, neither was he a convinced [[atheist]]. Since whether or not to accept a purported divine revelation is itself one of the "permanent" questions, orthodoxy must always remain an option equally as defensible as unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, [http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=NzE5MTRlZGY5YmY1MTUyOTZkYWY5NThmZGQ2NTNjOTU= "Leo Strauss 101"] (a review of Steven B. Smith's ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism''), ''National Review Online,'' May 22, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115105641/http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=NzE5MTRlZGY5YmY1MTUyOTZkYWY5NThmZGQ2NTNjOTU= |date=November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feser's statement invites the suspicion that Strauss may have been an unconvinced atheist, or that he welcomed religion as merely (practically) useful, rather than as true. The supposition that Strauss was an unconvinced atheist is not necessarily incompatible with Dannhauser's tentative claim that Strauss was an atheist behind closed doors. [[Hilail Gildin]] responded to Dannhauser's reading in "Déjà Jew All Over Again: Dannhauser on Leo Strauss and Atheism," an article published in ''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy''. Gildin exposed inconsistencies between Strauss's writings and Dannhauser's claims; he also questioned the inherent consistency of Dannhauser's admittedly tentative evaluation of Strauss's understanding of divinity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy'' (Vol. 25/1, at [http://www.interpretationjournal.com/backissues.html])&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his ''The City and Man'', Strauss invites his reader to "be open to the full impact of the all-important question which is coeval with philosophy although the philosophers do not frequently pronounce it—the question ''quid sit deus'' ["What is God?"]" (p.&amp;nbsp;241). As a philosopher, Strauss would be interested in knowing the nature of divinity, instead of trying to dispute the very being of divinity. But Strauss did not remain "neutral" to the question about the "quid" of divinity. Already in his ''Natural Right and History'', he defended a Socratic (Platonic, Ciceronian, Aristotelian) reading of divinity, distinguishing it from a materialistic, conventionalist, Epicurean reading.&lt;ref&gt;As seen especially, Ch. III: "The Origin of the Idea of Natural Right"&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the question of "religion" (what is religion?) is inseparable from the question of the nature of civil society, and thus of civil right, or right having authoritative representation, or right capable of defending itself (Latin: ''Jus''). Atheism, whether convinced (overt) or unconvinced (tacit), is integral to the conventionalist reading of civil authority, and thereby of religion in its originally civil valence, a reading against which Strauss argues throughout his volume.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural Right and History'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Strauss's own arguments contradict the thesis imputed to him posthumously by scholars such as S. Drury who profess that Strauss approached religion as an instrument devoid of inherent purpose or meaning.

== Responses to his work ==

===Reception by contemporaries===
Strauss's works were read and admired by thinkers as diverse as [[Gershom Scholem]], [[Walter Benjamin]],&lt;ref name="Kenneth Hart Green p. 55"/&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]],&lt;ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"&gt;''Approaches to Political Thought'', edited by William L. Richter, (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 16 Mar 2009), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/&gt; and [[Alexandre Kojève]].&lt;ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/&gt; Benjamin had become acquainted with Strauss as a student in Berlin, and expressed admiration for Strauss throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Hart Green page 55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1981. page 201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gershom Scholem 1989, page 155-58"/&gt; Gadamer stated that he 'largely agreed' with Strauss's interpretations.&lt;ref name="Political Thought 2009 page 56"/&gt;

===Critical views of Strauss===
Some critics of Strauss have accused him of being [[elitism|elitist]], [[illiberalism|illiberalist]] and anti-democratic. [[Shadia Drury]], in ''Leo Strauss and the American Right'' (1999), claimed that Strauss [[inculcation|inculcated]] an elitist strain in American political leaders linked to [[imperialism|imperialist]] [[militarism]], [[neoconservatism]] and [[Christian fundamentalism]]. Drury argues that Strauss teaches that "[[Noble lie|perpetual deception of the citizens by those in power is critical because they need to be led]], and they need strong rulers to tell them what's good for them." Nicholas Xenos similarly argues that Strauss was "an anti-democrat in a fundamental sense, a true [[reactionary]]." As Xenos says, "Strauss was somebody who wanted to go back to a previous, pre-liberal, pre-[[bourgeois]] era of blood and guts, of imperial domination, of authoritarian rule, of pure [[fascism]]."&lt;ref name="Xenos_Logos"&gt;Nicholas Xenos, [http://www.logosjournal.com/xenos.htm "Leo Strauss and the Rhetoric of the War on Terror,"] ''Logosjournal.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Strauss has also been criticized by some [[conservatives]]. According to [[Claes G. Ryn]], Strauss's anti-historicist thinking creates an artificial contrast between moral universality and "the conventional," "the ancestral," and "the historical." Strauss, Ryn argues, wrongly and reductively assumes that respect for tradition must undermine reason and universality. Contrary to Strauss's criticism of Edmund Burke, the historical sense may in fact be indispensable to an adequate apprehension of universality. Strauss's abstract, ahistorical conception of natural right actually distorts genuine universality, Ryn contends. Strauss does not consider the possibility that real universality becomes known to human beings in concretized, particular form. Strauss and the Straussians have paradoxically taught philosophically unsuspecting American conservatives, not least Roman Catholic intellectuals, to reject tradition in favor of ahistorical theorizing, a bias that flies in the face of the central Christian notion of the Incarnation, which represents a synthesis of the universal and the historical. According to Ryn, the propagation of a purely abstract idea of universality has contributed to the neoconservative advocacy of allegedly universal American principles, which neoconservatives see as justification for American intervention around the world—bringing the blessings of the "West" to the benighted "rest". Strauss's anti-historical thinking connects him and his followers with the French [[Jacobins]], who also regarded tradition as incompatible with virtue and rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Claes G. Ryn, "Leo Strauss and History: The Philosopher as Conspirator," ''Humanitas'', Vol. XVIII, Nos. 1 &amp; 2 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; What Ryn calls the "new Jacobinism" of the "neoconservative" philosophy is, writes [[Paul Edward Gottfried]], also the rhetoric of [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Trotsky]], which the philosophically impoverished American Right has taken over with mindless alacrity. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] operators and [[think tank]]s apparently believe they can carry the electorate by appealing to yesterday's [[leftist]] clichés.&lt;ref name=Gottfried&gt;Paul Gottfried, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gottfried/gottfried90.html "Strauss and the Straussians"], ''LewRockwell.com'', April 17, 2006.

Journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] have opined that Strauss endorsed [[noble lie]]s, "myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society."&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M.

Retrieved February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The City and Man,'' Strauss discusses the myths outlined in [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']] that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it may have been acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-xnGhgrwUoC ''The City and Man''], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticisms===
In his 2009 book, ''Straussophobia'', Peter Minowitz provides a detailed critique of Drury, Xenos, and other critics of Strauss whom he accuses of "bigotry and buffoonery."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Minowitz, ''Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers'' (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009). Also see "''Straussophobia: Six Questions for Peter Minowitz''," ''Harper's Magazine'', 9/29/09 [http://www.harpers.org/archive/2009/09/hbc-90005789]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 book review of ''Reading Leo Strauss'', by [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]], [[Robert Alter]] writes that Smith "persuasively sets the record straight on Strauss's political views and on what his writing is really about."&lt;ref name=Alter&gt;[[Robert Alter]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25alter.html?ex=1308888000&amp;en=56a0c2b38e767e6f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Neocon or Not?"], ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', June 25, 2006, accessed February 16, 2007, citing Yale scholar [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]], ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism'' (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith rejects the link between Strauss and [[neoconservative]] thought, arguing that Strauss was never personally active in politics, never endorsed imperialism, and questioned the utility of political philosophy for the practice of politics. In particular, Strauss argued that Plato's myth of the [[philosopher king]] should be read as a [[reductio ad absurdum]], and that philosophers should understand politics, not in order to influence policy but to ensure philosophy's autonomy from politics.&lt;ref name=SSmith&gt;[[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven B. Smith]], excerpt from [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/764028.html "Why Strauss, Why Now?"], 1–15 in ''Reading Leo Strauss: Politics, Philosophy, Judaism'' (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2006), online posting, ''press.uchicago.edu''. Retrieved June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Mark Lilla]] has argued that the attribution to Strauss of neoconservative views contradicts a careful reading of Strauss' actual texts, in particular ''On Tyranny''. Lilla summarizes Strauss as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophy must always be aware of the dangers of tyranny, as a threat to both political decency and the philosophical life. It must understand enough about politics to defend its own autonomy, without falling into the error of thinking that philosophy can shape the political world according to its own lights.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lilla, ''The Reckless Mind'' (New York: NY Review of Books, 2001) 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, responding to charges that Strauss's teachings fostered the neoconservative foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush]] administration, such as "unrealistic hopes for the spread of liberal democracy through military conquest," Professor Nathan Tarcov, director of the Leo Strauss Center at the University of Chicago, in an article published in ''The American Interest'', asserts that Strauss as a political philosopher was essentially non-political. After an exegesis of the very limited practical political views to be gleaned from Strauss's writings, Tarcov concludes that "Strauss can remind us of the permanent problems, but we have only ourselves to blame for our faulty solutions to the problems of today."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Tarcov, "Will the Real Leo Strauss Please Stand Up" in ''The American Interest'' September–October 1986, at {{cite web |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=166 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130050901/http://the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=166 |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Strauss's daughter, [[Jenny Strauss Clay]], in a ''New York Times'' article defended Strauss against the charge that he was the "mastermind behind the neoconservative ideologues who control United States foreign policy." "He was a conservative," she says, "insofar as he did not think change is necessarily change for the better." Since contemporary academia "leaned to the left," with its "unquestioned faith in progress and science combined with a queasiness regarding any kind of moral judgment," Strauss stood outside of the academic consensus. Had academia leaned to the right, he would have questioned it, too—and on certain occasions ''did'' question the tenets of the right.&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_New_York_Times_March_30_2015c"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/07/opinion/07CLAY.html |title=The Real Leo Strauss |newspaper=The New York Times |date= June 7, 2003 |author=Jenny Strauss Clay |accessdate= March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Straussianism==
Straussianism is the name given "to denote the research methods, common concepts, theoretical presuppositions, central questions, and pedagogic style characteristic of the large number of conservatives who have been influenced by the thought and teaching of Leo Strauss."&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=871|title=Straussianism|author=Mark C. Henrie|date=May 5, 2011|publisher=First Principles – ISI Web Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it "is particularly influential among university professors of historical political theory ... it also sometimes serves as a common intellectual framework more generally among conservative activists, think tank professionals, and public intellectuals."&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Within the discipline of political theory the method calls for its practitioners to use "a 'close reading' of the 'Great Books' of political thought; they strive to understand a thinker 'as he understood himself'; they are unconcerned with questions about the historical context of, or historical influences on, a given author"&lt;ref name=First/&gt; and strive to be open to the idea that they may find something timelessly true in a [[great book]]. The approach "resembles in important ways the old [[New Criticism]] in literary studies."&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

There is some controversy in the approach over what distinguishes a great book from lesser works. Great books are held to be written by authors/philosophers "of such sovereign critical self-knowledge and intellectual power that they can in no way be reduced to the general thought of their time and place,"&lt;ref name=First/&gt; with other works "understood as epiphenomenal to the original insights of a thinker of the first rank."&lt;ref name=First/&gt; This approach is seen as a counter "to the historicist presuppositions of the mid-twentieth century, which read the history of political thought in a progressivist way, with past philosophies forever cut off from us in a superseded past."&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Straussianism puts forward the possibility that past thinkers may have "hold of ''the truth''—and that more recent thinkers are therefore wrong."&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

[[Harvey Mansfield]] has argued that there is no such thing as "Straussianism" yet there are Straussians and a school of Straussians. Mansfield describes the school as "open to the whole of philosophy" and without any definite doctrines that one has to believe to belong to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/harvey-mansfield-iv-transcript/|title=Transcript of Harvey Mansfield (IV)|author=|date=|website=conversationswithbillkristol.org|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost the entirety of Strauss's writings has been translated into Chinese; and there even is a school of Straussians in China, the most prominent being [[Liu Xiaofeng (academic)|Liu Xiaofeng]] (Renmin University). "Chinese Straussians" (who often are also fascinated by Carl Schmitt) represent a remarkable example of the hybridization of Western political theory in a non-Western context. As the editors of a recent volume write, "the reception of Schmitt and Strauss in the Chinese-speaking world (and especially in the People's Republic of China) not only says much about how Schmitt and Strauss can be read today, but also provides important clues about the deeper contradictions of Western modernity and the dilemmas of non-liberal societies in our increasingly contentious world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchal|first=Kai,|title=Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss in the Chinese-speaking World: Reorienting the Political|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1498536264|page=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Monadology''''' ({{lang-fr|La Monadologie}}, 1714) is one of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]’s  best known works representing his later [[philosophy]]. It is a short text which sketches in some 90 paragraphs a metaphysics of simple [[substance theory|substances]], or ''[[monad (philosophy)|monads]]''.

== Text ==
[[File:Leibniz Monadology 2.jpg|thumb|The first manuscript page of the Monadology]]
During his last stay in Vienna from 1712 to September 1714, Leibniz wrote two short texts in French which were meant as concise expositions of his philosophy. After his death ''Principes de la nature et de la grâce fondé en raison'', which was intended for prince [[Eugene of Savoy]], appeared in French in the Netherlands. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and collaborators published translations in German and Latin of the second text which came to be known as ''The Monadology''. Without having seen the Dutch publication of the ''Principes'' they had assumed that it was the French original of the ''Monadology,'' which in fact remained unpublished until 1840.

The German translation appeared in 1720 as ''Lehrsätze über die Monadologie'' and the following year the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' printed the Latin version as ''Principia philosophiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Lamarra A., Contexte Génétique et Première Réception de la Monadologie, ''Revue de Synthese'' 128 (2007) 311–323&lt;/ref&gt; There are three original manuscripts of the text: the first written by Leibniz and overcharged with corrections and two further emended copies with some corrections appearing in one but not the other.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz G.W., ''La Monadologie'', edition établie par E. Boutroux, Paris LGF 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz himself inserted references to the paragraphs of his ''[[Théodicée]]'' ("Theodicy", i.e. a justification of God), sending the interested reader there for more details.

==The metaphysics of ''The Monadology''==

===Context===

The ''[[:wikt:monad|monad]]'', the word and the idea, belongs to the Western philosophical tradition and has been used by various authors.&lt;ref&gt;There is no indication that Leibniz has 'borrowed' it from a particular author, e.g. [[Giordano Bruno]] or [[John Dee]], to mention just two popular sources&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz, who was exceptionally well read, could not have ignored this, but he did not use it himself until mid-1696 when he was sending for print his ''New System''.&lt;ref&gt;Woolhouse R. and Francks R., ''Leibniz's "New System" and associated contemporary texts'', Cambridge Univ. Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently he found with it a convenient way to expose his own philosophy as it was elaborated in this period. What he proposed can be seen as a modification of [[occasionalism]] developed by latter-day [[Cartesians]]. Leibniz surmised that there are indefinitely many substances individually 'programmed' to act in a predetermined way, each substance being coordinated with all the others. This is the [[pre-established harmony]] which solved the [[mind-body dichotomy|mind-body problem]], but at the cost of declaring any interaction between substances a mere appearance.

===Summary===

The rhetorical strategy adopted by Leibniz in ''The Monadology'' is fairly obvious as the text
*begins with a description of monads (proceeding from simple to complicated instances),
*then it turns to their principle or creator and
*finishes by using both to explain the world.

'''(I)''' As far as Leibniz allows just one type of element in the building of the universe his system is [[monism|monistic]]. The unique element has been 'given the general name monad or [[entelechy]]' and described as 'a simple substance' (§§1, 19).  When Leibniz says that monads are 'simple,' he means that "which is one, has no parts and is therefore indivisible".&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Douglas. “Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on the Greek etymology of the word ''entelechie''
(§18),&lt;ref&gt;'' On pourrait donner le nom d’entéléchies à toutes les substances simples ou Monades créées, car elles ont en elles une certaine perfection'' (ἔχουσι τὸ ἐντελές)&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz posits quantitative differences in perfection between monads which leads to a hierarchical ordering. The basic order is three-tiered: (1) entelechies or created monads (§48), (2) souls or entelechies with perception and memory (§19), and  (3) spirits or rational souls (§82). Whatever is said about the lower ones (entelechies) is valid for the higher (souls and spirits) but not vice versa. As none of them is without a body (§72), there is a corresponding hierarchy of (1) living beings and animals (2), the latter being either (2) non-reasonable or (3) reasonable. The degree of perfection in each case corresponds to cognitive abilities and only spirits or reasonable animals are able to grasp the ideas of both the world and its creator. Some monads have power over others because they can perceive with greater clarity, but primarily, one monad is said to dominate another if it contains the reasons for the actions of other(s). Leibniz believed that any body, such as the body of an animal or man, has one dominant monad which controls the others within it. This dominant monad is often referred to as the soul.

'''(II)''' God is also said to be a simple substance (§47) but it is the only one necessary (§§38–9) and without a body attached (§72). Monads perceive others “with varying degrees of clarity, except for God, who perceives all monads with utter clarity”.&lt;ref&gt;Audi Robert, ed. "Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm." The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Cambridge; Cambridge University Press (1999): 193.&lt;/ref&gt; God could take any and all perspectives, knowing of both [[potentiality and actuality]]. As well as that God in all his power would know the universe from each of the infinite perspectives at the same time, and so his perspectives—his thoughts—“simply are monads".&lt;ref&gt;Look, Brandon C. "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz." Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Creation is a permanent state, thus "[monads]  are generated, so to speak, by continual [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fulguration fulgurations] of the Divinity"  (§47).&lt;ref&gt;trans. Hedge.  "Leibniz's vestige view of God's creative act is employed to support his view of substance as an inherently active being possessed of its own dynamic force"  Scott D., ''Leibniz model of creation and his doctrine of substance'', Animus 3 (1998) [http://www2.swgc.mun.ca/animus/Articles/Volume%203/scott3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Any perfection comes from being created while imperfection is a limitation of nature (§42). The monads are unaffected by each other, but each have a unique way of expressing themselves in the universe, in accordance with God’s infinite will.

'''(III)''' Composite substances or matter are "actually sub-divided without end" and have the properties of their infinitesimal parts (§65).  A notorious passage (§67) explains that "each portion of matter can be conceived as like a garden full of plants, or like a pond full of fish. But each branch of a plant, each organ of an animal, each drop of its bodily fluids is also a similar garden or a
similar pond". There are no interactions between different monads nor between entelechies and their bodies but everything is regulated by the pre-established harmony (§§78–9). Much like how one clock may be in synchronicity with another, but the first clock is not caused by the second (or vice versa), rather they are only keeping the same time because the last person to wind them set them to the same time. So it is with monads; they may seem to cause each other, but rather they are, in a sense, “wound” by God’s pre-established harmony, and thus appear to be in synchronicity. Leibniz concludes that  "if we could understand the order of the universe well enough, we would find that it surpasses all the wishes of the wisest people, and that it is impossible to make it better than it is — not merely in respect of the whole in general, but also in respect of ourselves in particular" (§90).&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Douglas. “Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his day, atoms were proposed to be the smallest division of matter. Within Leibniz’s theory, however, substances are not technically real, so monads are not the smallest part of matter, rather they are the only things which are, in fact, real. To Leibniz, space and time were an illusion, and likewise substance itself. The only things that could be called real were utterly simple beings of psychic activity “endowed with perception and appetite.”&lt;ref&gt;Look, Brandon C. "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz." Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; The other objects, which we call matter, are merely phenomena of these simple perceivers. “Leibniz says, ‘I don't really eliminate body, but reduce [revoco] it to what it is. For I show that corporeal mass [massa], which is thought to have something over and above simple substances, is not a substance, but a phenomenon resulting from simple substances, which alone have unity and absolute reality.’ (G II 275/AG 181)”&lt;ref&gt;Look, Brandon C. "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz." Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz’s philosophy is sometimes called “‘[[Panpsychism|panpsychic]] idealism’ because these substances are psychic rather than material”.&lt;ref&gt;Pestana, Mark. "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz." World Philosophers &amp; Their Works (2000): 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, they are mind-like substances, not possessing spatial reality. "In other words, in the Leibnizian monadology, simple substances are mind-like entities that do not, strictly speaking, exist in space but that represent the universe from a unique perspective.”&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Douglas. “Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; It is the harmony between the perceptions of the monads which creates what we call substances, but that does not mean the substances are real in and of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Douglas. “Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{Original research|date=March 2009}}

=== Controversy in rationalism ===

The ''Monadology'' tried to answer two huge philosophical questions—both studied by [[Descartes]]—from a monist point of view. The first is about the nature of reality. The second, about the problem of communication of substances, is related to a common objection to [[mind-body dualism]], namely, the body-soul interaction problem. Thus, Leibniz offered a new solution to the mind-matter interaction problem by positing a pre-established harmony between substances: the body is mere perceptions, which are all contained in a soul's complete concept. The soul and body interact and agree in virtue of the pre-established harmony, maintained by God.  Leibniz also drew the relationship between “the kingdom of final causes”, or [[teleological]] ones, and “the kingdom of efficient causes”, or [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] ones, which was not [[causality|causal]], but [[synchronicity|synchronous]]. So, monads and matter are only apparently linked, and there is not even any communication between different monads; there is only harmony, pre-established and maintained by God.

Leibniz fought against the [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian dualist]] system in his ''Monadology'' and instead opted for a monist idealism (since substances are all [[Extension (metaphysics)|unextended]]).  However, Leibniz was a pluralist in the sense that substances are disseminated in the world in an infinite number. For that reason the monad is an irreducible force, which makes it possible for the bodies to have the characteristics of [[inertia]] and [[impenetrability]], and which contains in itself the source of all its actions. Monads are the first elements of every composed thing.

=== Philosophical conclusions ===

This theory leads to:

1. [[Idealism]], since it denies things in themselves (besides monads) and multiplies them in different points of view. Monads are “perpetual living mirrors of the universe.”

2. Metaphysical optimism, through the [[principle of sufficient reason]], developed as follows:

a) Everything exists according to a reason (by the axiom "Nothing arises from nothing");

b) Everything which exists has a sufficient reason to exist;

c) Everything which exists is better than anything nonexistent (by the first point: since it is more rational, it also has more reality), and, consequently, it is the best possible being in the [[best of all possible worlds]] (by the [[axiology|axiom]]: "That which contains more reality is better than that which contains less reality").

'''Otto Dirk Duintjer''' (born 30 April 1932 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch philosopher. He studied Theology at the [[Free University of Amsterdam|Free University in Amsterdam (VU)]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]], as well as Philosophy at [[Groningen University]]. He was an Assistant Professor at [[Leiden University]] from 1960 to 1970, where he obtained his doctorate in Philosophy in 1966 (''cum laude'') with a dissertation entitled ''The Issue of the Transcendental, Especially in Relation to Heidegger and Kant'' (in Dutch).&lt;ref&gt;O.D.

From 1970 to 1987, he was Full Professor of Epistemology and Metaphysics at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. From 1987 to his retirement in 1997, he held the chair of "Philosophy and Spirituality" at the same university.&lt;ref&gt;O.D. Duintjer, 2002, Onuitputtelijk is de waarheid. Budel: Damon.

'''Philolaus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Φιλόλαος}}, ''Philólaos''; {{circa|470|385&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;ref&gt;"The most likely date for Philolaus' birth would then appear to be around 470, although he could have been born as early as 480 or as late as 440. He appears to have lived into the 380s and at the very least until 399." Carl A. Huffman, (1993) ''Philolaus of Croton: Pythagorean and Presocratic'', pages 5–6. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; was a Greek [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[pre-Socratic]] philosopher. He argued that at the foundation of everything is the part played by the limiting and limitless, which combine together in a harmony. He is also credited with originating the theory that the [[Earth]] was not the center of the [[Universe]]. According to [[August Böckh]] (1819), who cites [[Nicomachus]], Philolaus was the successor of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Böckh |first=August |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=I2MPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Pythagoras+Lehren+nebst+den+Bruchstücken+seines+Werkes |page=14 |year=1819 |title=Philolaos des Pythagoreers Lehren nebst den Bruchstücken seines Werkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Philolaus is variously reported as being born in either [[Crotone|Croton]],&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Taranto|Tarentum]],&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', p. 267; Diogenes Laërtius, viii, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Metapontum]]&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', pp. 266–67&lt;/ref&gt;—all part of [[Magna Graecia]] (the name of the coastal areas of [[Southern Italy]] on the [[Gulf of Taranto|Tarentine Gulf]] that were [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|extensively colonized]] by [[Greeks|Greek]] settlers). It is most likely that he came from Croton.&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus&gt;{{sep entry|philolaus|Philolaus|Carl Huffman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Huffman, (1993) ''Philolaus of Croton: Pythagorean and Presocratic'', p. 6. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He may have fled the second burning of the Pythagorean meeting-place around 454&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the first burning of the meeting place, in the lifetime of [[Pythagoras]], {{circa|509&amp;nbsp;BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he migrated to [[Greece]]. According to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', he was the instructor of [[Simmias of Thebes|Simmias]] and [[Cebes]] at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], around the time the ''Phaedo'' takes place, in 399&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedo'', 61DE&lt;/ref&gt; This would make him a contemporary of [[Socrates]], and agrees with the statement that Philolaus and [[Democritus]] were contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus ap. Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The various reports about his life are scattered among the writings of much later writers and are of dubious value in reconstructing his life. He apparently lived for some time at [[Heraclea Lucania|Heraclea]], where he was the pupil of [[Aresas]] (maybe [[Oresas]]), or (as [[Plutarch]] calls him) Arcesus.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica''; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' 13, though the account given by Plutarch involves great inaccuracies&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] is the only authority for the claim that Plato, shortly after the death of Socrates, traveled to Italy where he met with Philolaus and [[Eurytus (Pythagorean)|Eurytus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, iii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The pupils of Philolaus were said to have included [[Xenophilus]], [[Phanto of Phlius|Phanto]], [[Echecrates of Phlius|Echecrates]], [[Diocles of Phlius|Diocles]], and [[Polymnastus of Phlius|Polymnastus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 46&lt;/ref&gt; As to his death, Diogenes Laërtius reports a dubious story that Philolaus was put to death at Croton on account of being suspected of wanting to be the tyrant;&lt;ref&gt;"The story at D.L. 84 that Philolaus was killed because he was thought to be aiming at a tyranny is clearly a confusion with [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]] who is mentioned in the context and did have such a death." Carl A. Huffman, (1993) ''Philolaus of Croton: Pythagorean and Presocratic'', p. 6. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; a story which Laërtius even took the trouble to put into verse.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, iii. p. 84; cf. Suda, ''Philolaus''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|Philolaus book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
[[Diogenes Laërtius]] speaks of Philolaus composing one book,&lt;ref name="Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 85"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 85&lt;/ref&gt; but elsewhere he speaks of three books,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, iii. 9, viii. 15&lt;/ref&gt; as do [[Aulus Gellius]] and [[Iamblichus]]. It might have been one treatise divided into three books. Plato is said to have procured a copy of his book from which, it was later claimed, Plato composed much of his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 15, 55, 84, 85, iii. 9; Aulus Gellius, iii. 17; Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica''; Tzetzes, ''Chiliad'', x. 792, xi. 38&lt;/ref&gt; One of the works of Philolaus was called ''On Nature'',&lt;ref name="Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 85"/&gt; which seems to be the same work which [[Stobaeus]] calls ''On the World'', and from which he has preserved a series of passages.&lt;ref&gt;DK 44 B 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers refer to a work entitled ''Bacchae'', which may have been another name for the same work, and which may originate from [[Arignote]]. However, it has been mentioned that [[Proclus]] describes the ''Bacchae'' as a book for teaching theology by means of mathematics.&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus /&gt;

According to [[s:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]]'s ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, p.&amp;nbsp;305):&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Sir William |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology |year=1870 |url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/ |page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things.}}

Additionally Charles Peter Mason noted (p.&amp;nbsp;304):&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;
{{Quote|Pythagoras and his earliest successors do not appear to have committed any of their doctrines to writing. According to Porphyrius (Vit. Pyth. p. 40) [[Lysis]] and [[Archippus]] collected in a written form some of the principal Pythagorean doctrines, which were handed down as heirlooms in their families, under strict injunctions that they should not be made public. But amid the different and inconsistent accounts of the matter, the first publication of the Pythagorean doctrines is pretty uniformly attributed to Philolaus. He composed a work on the Pythagorean philosophy in three books, which Plato is said to have procured at the cost of 100 [[Mina (unit)|minae]] through [[Dion of Syracuse]], who purchased it from Philolaus, who was at the time in deep poverty.{{pb}}Other versions of the story represent Plato as purchasing it himself from Philolaus or his relatives when in Sicily. (Diog. Laert. viii. 15, 55, 84, 85, iii. 9; A. Gellius,iV. iii. 17; lamblichus, Vit. Fyth. 31. p. 172 ; Tzetzes, Chiliad, x. 792, &amp;c. xi. 38, &amp;c.) Out of the materials which he derived from these books Plato is said to have composed his ''Timaeus''. But in the age of Plato the leading features of the Pythagorean doctrines had long ceased to be a secret; and if Philolaus taught the Pythagorean doctrines at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], he was hardly likely to feel much reluctance in publishing them; and amid the conflicting and improbable accounts preserved in the authorities above referred to, little more can be regarded as trustworthy, except that Philolaus was the first who published a book on the Pythagorean doctrines, and that Plato read and made use of it. (Böckh, I.e. p. 22.)}}

Historians from the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Chapter ''Philolaus' Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia''), noted the following:&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus/&gt;
{{Quote|It is implied that these books were not by Philolaus himself, and it seems likely that the statement refers to three spurious works assigned to Pythagoras at D.L. VIII 6  (Burkert 1972a, 224–5). The story of Plato's purchase of these books from Philolaus was probably invented to authenticate the three forged treatises of Pythagoras. Burkert's arguments (1972a, 238–277), supported by further study (Huffman 1993), have led to a consensus that some 11 fragments are genuine (Frs. 1–6, 6a, 7, 13, 16 and 17 in the numbering of Huffman 1993) and derive from Philolaus' book On Nature (Barnes 1982; Kahn 1993 and 2001; Kirk, Raven and Schofield 1983; Nussbaum 1979; Zhmud 1997). Fragments 1, 6a and 13 are identified as coming from the book On Nature by ancient sources. Stobaeus cites fragments 2 and 4–7 as coming from a work On the Cosmos, but this appears to be an alternate title for On Nature, which probably arose because the chapter heading in Stobaeus under which the fragments are cited is 'On the Cosmos.'}}

==Cosmology==
{{Further|Pythagorean astronomical system}}
The book by Philolaus begins with the following:&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus /&gt;
{{Quote|Nature ([[physis]]) in the world-order (cosmos) was fitted together out of things which are unlimited and out of things which are limiting, both the world-order as a whole and everything in it.}}

Robert Scoon explained Philolaus universe in 1922:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scoon |first=Robert |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-263009/263009#page/n3/mode/2up |title=Philolaus, Fragment 6, Diels. Stobaeus i. 21. 460 |year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Philolaus is trying to show how the ordered universe that we know came into its present condition. It arose, he says, by the action of harmony on a basic substance, which we do not know but must infer. This substance consisted of different primary elements, and harmony fitted these together in such a way that nature ({{lang|grc|φύση}}) turns out to be an ordered world ({{lang|grc|κόσμος}}).}}

===Stobaeus account===
Philolaus did away with the ideas of fixed direction in space, and developed one of the first non-geocentric views of the universe. His new way of thinking quite literally revolved around a [[hypothetical star|hypothetical astronomical object]] he called the [[Central Fire]].

{{Quote|Philolaus says that there is fire in the middle at the centre [...] and again more fire at the highest point and surrounding everything. By nature the middle is first, and around it dance ten divine bodies—the sky, the planets, then the sun, next the moon, next the earth, next the [[Counter-Earth|counterearth]], and after all of them the fire of the hearth which holds position at the centre. The highest part of the surrounding, where the elements are found in their purity, he calls Olympus; the regions beneath the orbit of Olympus, where are the five planets with the sun and the moon, he calls the world; the part under them, being beneath the moon and around the earth, in which are found generation and change, he calls the sky.|[[Stobaeus]], i. 22. 1d}}

In Philolaus's system a sphere of the fixed [[star]]s, the five [[planet]]s, the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and Earth, all moved round his Central Fire. According to [[Aristotle]] writing in ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Philolaus added a tenth unseen body, he called [[Counter-Earth]], as without it there would be only nine revolving bodies, and the Pythagorean [[number theory]] required a tenth. However, according to Greek scholar George Burch, Aristotle was lampooning Philolaus's ideas. In reality, Philolaus' ideas predated the idea of spheres by hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, George Bosworth. ''[http://kunsthistorie.kunstakademiet.dk/mortlake/pdf/2010/burch1954a.pdf The Counter-Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194726/http://kunsthistorie.kunstakademiet.dk/mortlake/pdf/2010/burch1954a.pdf |date=2013-10-29 }}''. Osirus, vol. 11. Saint Catherines Press, 1954. p. 267-294&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two-thousand years later [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] would mention in ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' that Philolaus already knew about the Earth's revolution around a central fire.

However, it has been pointed out that Stobaeus betrays a tendency to confound the dogmas of the early Ionian philosophers, and he occasionally mixes up Platonism with Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Stobaeus, Joannes|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony}}
Philolaus argued at the foundation of everything is the part played by the ideas of limit and the unlimited. One of the first declarations in the work of Philolaus was that all things in the universe result from a combination of the unlimited and the limiting;&lt;ref&gt;Fragment DK 44B 1&lt;/ref&gt; for if all things had been unlimited, nothing could have been the object of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment DK 44B 3&lt;/ref&gt; Limiters and unlimiteds are combined together in a harmony (''harmonia''):
{{Quote|This is the state of affairs about nature and harmony. The essence of things is eternal; it is a unique and divine nature, the knowledge of which does not belong to man. Still it would not be possible that any of the things that are, and are known by us, should arrive to our knowledge, if this essence was not the internal foundation of the principles of which the world was founded, that is, of the limiting and unlimited elements. Now since these principles are not mutually similar, neither of similar nature, it would be impossible that the order of the world should have been formed by them, unless the harmony intervened [...].|Philolaus, Fragment DK 44B 6a.}}

'''Project 112''' was a [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] weapon experimentation project conducted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] from 1962 to 1973.

The project started under [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, and was authorized by his [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]], as part of a total review of the US military. The name "Project 112" refers to this project's number in the 150 project review process authorized by McNamara.  Funding and staff were contributed by every branch of the U.S. armed services and intelligence agencies—a euphemism for the [[Office of Technical Services]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Directorate of Science &amp; Technology]].  Canada and the United Kingdom also participated in some Project 112 activities.&lt;ref name="Guillemin2005"/&gt;

Project 112 primarily concerned the use of aerosols to disseminate biological and chemical agents that could produce "controlled temporary incapacitation" (CTI).

In January 1961, [[Robert McNamara|McNamara]] sent a directive about chemical and biological weapons to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urging them to: "consider all possible applications, including use as an alternative to nuclear weapons. Prepare a plan for the development of an adequate biological and chemical deterrent capability, to include cost estimates, and appraisal of domestic and international political consequences." The Joint Chiefs established a Joint Task Force that recommended a five-year plan to be conducted in three phases.&lt;ref name=harris /&gt;&lt;ref name="USBW-32"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=[[Mark Wheelis]]|editor2=Lajos Rózsa|title=Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons since 1945|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04513-2|author1=John Ellis|author2=Courtland Moon|chapter=The US Biological Weapons Program|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 1963, President Kennedy signed [[National Security Action Memorandum 235]] (NSAM 235) which approved:

Project 112 was a highly classified military testing program which was aimed at both offensive and defensive human, animal, and plant reaction to biological and chemical warfare in various combinations of climate and terrain.&lt;ref name=harris /&gt;  The [[Chemical Corps|U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] sponsored the United States portion of an agreement between the U.S., Britain, Canada, and Australia to negotiate, host, conduct, or participate in mutual interest research and development activity and field testing.

{{Main|Deseret Test Center}}{{see also|Dugway Proving Ground}}

The command structure for the [[Deseret Test Center]], which was organized to oversee Project 112, somewhat bypassed standard Defense Department channels and reported directly to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[US Cabinet]] consisting of [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Secretary of State]], and to a much smaller extent, the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] . Experiments were planned and conducted by the Deseret Test Center and [[Deseret Chemical Depot]] at [[Fort Douglas, Utah]]. The tests were designed to test the effects of [[biological weapons]] and [[chemical weapons]] on personnel, plants, animals, insects, toxins, vehicles, ships and equipment. Project 112 and [[Project SHAD]] experiments involved unknowing test subjects who did not give informed consent, and took place on land and at sea in various climates and terrains.  Experiments involved humans, plants, animals, insects, aircraft, ships, submarines and amphibious vehicles.&lt;ref name="Ships"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ships Associated with SHAD Tests|url=http://fhp.osd.mil/CBexposures/associatedShips.jsp|accessdate=21 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915081848/http://fhp.osd.mil/CBexposures/associatedShips.jsp|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological weapons tests ==
{{see also|Edgewood Arsenal experiments}}

There was a large variety of goals for the proposed tests, for example: "selected protective devices in preventing penetration of a naval ship by a biological aerosol," the impact of "meteorological conditions on weapon system performance over the open sea," the penetrability of jungle vegetation by biological agents, "the penetration of an arctic inversion
by a biological aerosol cloud," "the feasibility of an offshore release of [[Aedes aegypti]] mosquito as a vector for infectious diseases," "the feasibility of a biological attack against an island complex," and the study of the [[decay rate]]s of biowarfare agents under various conditions.&lt;ref name="USBW"/&gt;

Project 112 tests used the following agents and simulants: [[Francisella tularensis]], [[Serratia marcescens]], [[Escherichia coli]], [[Bacillus globii]], [[staphylococcal enterotoxin]] Type B, [[Puccinia graminis]] var. tritici (stem rust of wheat).&lt;ref name="USBW"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Mark Wheelis|editor2=Lajos Rózsa|title=Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons since 1945|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04513-2|author1=John Ellis|author2=Courtland Moon|chapter=The US Biological Weapons Program|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agents and simulants were usually dispensed as [[aerosol]]s using spraying devices or bomblets.

In May 1965, vulnerability tests in the U.S. using the [[anthrax]] simulant ''Bacillus globigii'' were performed in the Washington D.C. area by [[United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories|SOD]] covert agents. One test was conducted at the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Greyhound bus terminal]] and the other at the north terminal of the [[National Airport]]. In these tests the bacteria were released from spray generators hidden in specially built briefcases. SOD also conducted a series of tests in the [[New York City Subway]] system between 7 and 10 June 1966 by dropping light bulbs filled with ''[[Bacillus subtilis]] var. niger''. In the latter tests, results indicated that a city-level epidemic would have occurred. Local police and transit authorities were not informed of these tests.&lt;ref name="USBW"/&gt;

== SHAD – Shipboard Hazard and Defense ==
{{main|Project SHAD}}
[[File:USS Granville S. Hall -- 1965.jpg|thumb|USS Granville S. Hall -- 1965]]
Project SHAD, an acronym for Shipboard Hazard and Defense (or sometimes Decontamination), was part of the larger program called Project 112, which was conducted during the 1960s. Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD" /&gt; The Department of Defense (DoD) states that Project 112 was initiated out of concern for the ability of the United States to protect and defend against potential CB threats.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD"&gt;{{cite web | title=Project 112/SHAD – Shipboard Hazard and Defense, Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness | url=http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shad.aspx | accessdate=23 December 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726023840/http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shad.aspx | archivedate=26 July 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project 112 consisted of both land-based and sea-based tests. The sea-based tests, called Project SHAD were primarily launched from other ships such as the [[USS Granville S. Hall (YAG-40)]] and [[USS George Eastman (YAG-39)]], Army tugboats, submarines, or fighter aircraft and was designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop decontamination and other methods to counter such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD" /&gt; The classified information related to SHAD was not completely cataloged or located in one facility. Furthermore, The Deseret Test Center was closed in the 1970s and the search for 40-year-old documents and records kept by different military services in different locations was a challenge to researchers.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD" /&gt; A fact sheet was developed for each test that was conducted and when a test cancellation was not documented, a cancellation analysis was developed outlining the logic used to presume that the test had been cancelled.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD" /&gt;

== Declassification ==
The existence of Project 112 (along with the related Project SHAD) was categorically denied by the military until May 2000, when a [[CBS News|CBS Evening News]] investigative report produced dramatic revelations about the tests. This report caused the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] to launch an extensive investigation of the experiments, and reveal to the affected personnel their exposure to toxins.

Revelations concerning Project SHAD were first exposed by independent producer and investigative journalist [[Eric Longabardi]]. Longabardi's 6-year investigation into the still secret program began in early 1994. It ultimately resulted in a series of investigative reports produced by him, which were broadcast on the CBS Evening News in May 2000. After the broadcast of these exclusive reports, the Pentagon and Veteran's Administration opened their own ongoing investigations into the long classified program. In 2002, Congressional hearings on Project SHAD, in both the Senate and House, further shed media attention on the program. In 2002, a class action federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of the US sailors exposed in the testing. Additional actions, including a multi-year medical study was conducted by [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]/Institute of Medicine to assess the potential medical harm caused to the thousands of unwitting US Navy sailors, civilians, and others who were exposed in the secret testing. The results of that study were finally released in May 2007.

Because most of the participants that were involved with Project 112 and SHAD were unaware of any tests being done, no effort was made to ensure the [[informed consent]] of the military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf Atlanta Journal-Constitution (June 13, 2008) 40.

Until 1998, the Department of Defense stated officially that Project SHAD did not exist. Because the DoD refused to acknowledge the program, surviving test subjects have been unable to obtain disability payments for health issues related to the project. US Representative [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] said of the program and the DoD's effort to conceal it, "They told me – they said, but don't worry about it, we only used simulants. And my first thought was, well, you've lied to these guys for 40 years, you've lied to me for a couple of years. It would be a real leap of faith for me to believe that now you're telling me the truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf Martin, David, 41. "Retired Navy Officer Seeks Justice", CBS News, June 12, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195901/http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf |date=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs commenced a three-year study comparing known SHAD-affected veterans to veterans of similar ages who were not involved in any way with SHAD or Project 112. The study cost approximately 3 million US Dollars, and results are being compiled for future release.  DoD has committed to providing the VA with the relevant information it needs to settle benefits claims as quickly and efficiently as possible and to evaluate and treat veterans who were involved in those tests. This required analyzing historical documents recording the planning and execution of Project 112/SHAD tests.&lt;ref name="112/SHAD" /&gt;

The released historical information about Project 112 from DoD consists of summary fact sheets rather than original documents or maintained federal information.  As of 2003, 28 fact sheets have been released, focusing on the [[Deseret Test Center]] in [[Dugway, Utah]], which was built entirely for Project 112/SHAD and was closed after the project was finished in 1973.

Original records are missing or incomplete. For example, a 91-meter aerosol test tower was sprayed by an F-4E with "aerosols" on [[Ursula Island]] in the Philippines and appears in released original Project SHAD documentation but without a fact sheet or further explanation or disclosure as to the nature of the test that was conducted or even what the test was called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/Exercises_and_Projects/1017.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713010845/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/Exercises_and_Projects/1017.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (1945-1946) Transfer of Japanese Technical Information ===

[[File:B-w-scientists.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Class III cabinets at the U.S. Biological Warfare Laboratories, [[Fort Detrick|Camp Detrick]], Maryland (Photo, 1940s)]]

Author [[Sheldon H. Harris]] researched the history of Japanese Biological warfare and the American cover-up extensively.  Harris and other scholars found that U.S. intelligence authorities had seized the Japanese researchers' archive after the technical information was provided by Japan.  The information was transferred in an arrangement that exchanged keeping the information a secret and not pursuing war crimes charges. 
The arrangement with the United States concerning Japanese WMD research provided extensive Japanese technical information in exchange for not pursuing certain charges and also allowed Japan's government to deny knowledge of the use of these weapons by Japan's military in China during World War II.&lt;ref name="Harris2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheldon H.

The U.S. would not cooperate when the [[Soviet Union]] attempted to pursue war crimes charges against the Japanese.  General [[Douglas MacArthur]] denied the U.S. Military had any captured records on Japan's military biological program.

Section 709  required disclosure of information concerning Project 112 to [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (DVA) and the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO).  
Public Law 107–314 required the identification and release of not only Project 112 information to VA but also that of any other projects or tests where a service member might have been exposed to a CBW agent and directed The Secretary of Defense to work with veterans and veterans service organizations to identify the other projects or tests conducted by the Department of Defense that may have exposed members of the Armed Forces to chemical or biological agents.&lt;ref name="BobStump"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ314/html/PLAW-107publ314.htm |title=107th Congress Public Law 314, BOB STUMP NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2, 2002 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, information from various sources shows that personnel from all services were involved in chemical and biological testing.

We learned during this review that hundreds of chemical and biological tests similar to those conducted under Project 112 were conducted during the same time period...

This study listed 31 biological field tests performed at various military installations... The study did not quantify the number of test participants nor did it identify them.

In addition, we reported in 1993 and 1994 that hundreds of radiological, chemical, and biological tests were conducted in which hundreds of thousands of people were used as test subjects.

We also reported that the Army Chemical Corps conducted a classified medical research program for developing incapacitating agents. This program involved testing nerve agents, nerve agent antidotes, psycho chemicals, and irritants... In total, Army documents identified 7,120 Army and Air Force personnel who participated in these tests.

== Controversy over inclusion of Okinawa as Extracontinental Site 2 ==
[[File:267th Chemical Company.pdf|thumb|220px|According to the document, "the [[267th Chemical Company]] (SVC) had the mission of operation of Site 2, DOD Project 112."]]
Corroborating suspicions of Project 112 activities on Okinawa include "An Organizational History of the 267th Chemical company", which was made available by the [[U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center]] to [[Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota]], Veteran's Service Officer Michelle Gatz in 2012.&lt;ref name="Pigs" /&gt; According to the document, the [[267th Chemical Company]] was activated on Okinawa on December 1, 1962 as the 267th Chemical Platoon (SVC) was billeted at Chibana Depot. During this deployment, "Unit personnel were actively engaged in preparing RED HAT area, site 2 for the receipt and storage of first increment items, [shipment] "YBA", DOD Project 112." The company received further shipments, code named YBB and YBF, which according to declassified documents also included sarin, VX, and mustard gas.&lt;ref name= "Pigs"&gt;Mitchell, Jon, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20121204zg.html 'Were we marines used as guinea pigs on Okinawa?']," ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 December 2012, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The late author [[Sheldon H. Harris]] in his book "Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932–1945, and the American cover up" wrote about Project 112:

{{quote|The test program, which began in fall 1962 and which was funded at least through fiscal year 1963, was considered by the Chemical Corps to be "an ambitious one." The tests were designed to cover "not only trials at sea, but Arctic and tropical environmental tests as well." The tests, presumably, were conducted at what research officers designated, but did not name, "satellite sites." These sites were located both in the continental United States and in foreign countries. The tests conducted there were aimed at both human, animal and plant reaction to BW. It is known that tests were undertaken in Cairo, Egypt, Liberia, in South Korea, and in Japan's satellite province of Okinawa in 1961, or earlier. This was at least one year prior to the creation of Project 112.  The Okinawa anti-crop research project may lend some insight to the larger projects 112 sponsored. BW experts in Okinawa and "at several sites in the Midwest and south:" conducted in 1961 "field tests" for wheat rust and rice blast disease. These tests met with "partial success" in the gathering of data, and led, therefore, to a significant increase in research dollars in fiscal year 1962 to conduct additional research in these areas. The money was devoted largely to developing "technical advice on the conduct of defoliation and anti-crop activities in Southeast Asia." By the end of fiscal year 1962, the Chemical Corps had let or were negotiating contracts for over one thousand chemical defoliants. The Okinawa tests evidently were fruitful.|Harris, 2002&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;"Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932–1945, and the American cover up" by Sheldon Harris. {{ISBN|0-203-74360-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}}}}

The U.S. government has previously disclosed information on chemical and biological warfare tests it held at sea and on land yet new-found documents show that the U.S. Army tested biological weapons in Okinawa in the early 1960s, when the prefecture was still under U.S. rule. During these tests, conducted at least a dozen times between 1961 and 1962, [[rice blast]] fungus was released by the Army using "a midget duster to release inoculum alongside fields in Okinawa and Taiwan," in order to measure effective dosages requirements at different distances and the negative effects on crop production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/01/12/national/u-s-army-tested-biological-weapons-in-okinawa/ U.S. Army tested biological weapons in Okinawa, January 12, 2014, [[Japan Times]].]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/362021.pdf Thomas H.

'''Pure thought''' is an English translation of an expression originally attributed to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. Their usage of the German counterpart revolved around the question of whether pure thought could exist without an object or some material. &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22pure+thought%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA202,M1 Mind: A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy], : Vol. 105, issue 417 (Jan. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdYLAAAAIAAJ Treatise on Logic] (1895) &lt;/ref&gt; Today, more popular uses exist.  That "Pure Thought" could existent and is part of the evidentiary change. The usage here is that pure thought is simply a process, another term for [[thought experiment]].   &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14619764.300-the-thought-that-counts.html The Thought that Counts], [[Paul Davies]], [[New Scientist]], 6 May 1995 &lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[University of Windsor]]’s website, “His articles have appeared in such journals as American Philosophical Quarterly, Synthese, Argumentation, Philosophy and Rhetoric and Informal Logic. In 1996, a collection of his articles and papers was published by Vale Press under the title The Rise of Informal Logic. In 2000, his book, Manifest Rationality: A Pragmatic Study of Argument, was published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Johnson has conducted seminars and workshops on informal logic and critical thinking across North America and in Europe. In 1993, Johnson received a 3M Teaching Fellowship for outstanding university teachers, one of ten such awards conferred that year in Canada. In 1994, he was awarded the rank of University Professor by the University of Windsor. In 2000, he was awarded the Distinguished Research Award by the International Society for the Study of Argumentation. In 2003, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2005, he received the Career Achievement Award from the University of Windsor. Johnson is listed in Who’s Who in Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;http://web4.uwindsor.ca/units/CRRAR/main.nsf/SubCategoryFlyOut/178BBCA140BB501D85257299005D8BA5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

From Johnson’s website, “I love to read, especially contemporary fiction. Among my favourite authors: John Updike, Alistair MacLeod, Joan Barfoot, Michael Connelly, Robert B. Parker. I love the plays of Shakespeare (especially King Lear), and attend the plays at Stratford every year. This year, I look forward to seeing Oliver and Much Ado about Nothing.
I love to listen to music, especially classical. Currently I am in a Chopin phase. I also am drawn to the music of Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, Schubert and Dvorak. I belong to The Mankind Project (www.mkp.org) — a worldwide organization dedicated to calling men to consciousness and lives of service. I serve as an Elder and Board member in our local community. I exercise (jog, walk or bike) almost everyday. I have been married to my wife Maggie for 38 years; have three children (Mary, Sean and Matthew) and two grandchildren— Brandin, 11, and Ivy Grace b. January 27, 2006!”&lt;ref&gt;http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/philosophy/johnsoa/home.htm Accessed January 21st, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

As Johnson explains both in Logical Self-Defense as well as his journal article Making Sense of “Informal Logic,” that Informal Logic is the philosophical practice of understanding and evaluating natural language argumentation. Here fallacies are used in order to evaluate arguments. However, more simply the idea is to evaluate arguments based upon three essential criteria, again as explained in both Making Sense of “Informal Logic,” and more thoroughly explained in Logical Self-Defense, the premises of arguments must be relevant to the conclusion, sufficient to support it, and acceptable to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;2006 “Making Sense of ‘Informal Logic,’” Informal Logic, Vol. 6, No. 23, pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to logic, fallacies such as the straw man, red herring etc. point to a deficiency in the premises in one of these three criteria.

Johnson and Blair also place emphasis on how to identify arguments in everyday life, so that evaluators do not misinterpret the author’s intention. In this way Logical Self-Defense identifies several different ways of interpreting arguments and their ‘look-alikes’. For instance Johnson and Blair explain the distinctions between mere opinion, proto-argument, argument, case, and explanation as well as provide criteria for helping to identify which is which, including: context, verbal cues and logical structure.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Logical Self-Defense, Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair. First U.S. Edition. New York: McGraw Hill. Pp. 5 - 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “Charity Begins at Home” in Informal Logic Johnson combines and creates unified form of the ‘Principle of Charity’ which he found to exist in four other forms in the following works: Thomas’s Practical Reasoning in Natural Language (1973), Baum’s Logic (1975) and in Scriven’s Reasoning (1976). In doing so Johnson created a more developed ‘Principle of Charity’ which Informal Logicians could reference.&lt;ref&gt;1981 "Charity Begins at Home: Some Reflections on the Principle of Charity," Informal Logic Newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in this article Section II attempts to unify these four versions by making one the foundation, while the others work as its corollaries. Then, after creating a better account of the ‘Principle of Charity’ Johnson spends Section III of the article addresses some of the issues involved in the application of the ‘Principle of Charity’ and finally Section IV addresses a proposed restriction for the use of the ‘Principle of Charity’.&lt;ref&gt;1981 "Charity Begins at Home: Some Reflections on the Principle of Charity," Informal Logic Newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “The Principle of Vulnerability” in Informal Logic seeks to offer defence to the principle that all arguments should be considered susceptible to criticisms. As such Johnson argues that the arguer of an argument should not seek to “immunize” their argument from criticism. The article also takes considerations both in support of, and opposed to the principle into account.&lt;ref&gt;1995 “The Principle of Vulnerability,” Informal Logic, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 259–269&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article one of the more notable ideas presented is the notion of ‘manifest rationality’ which Johnson described in this way:

The practice (of arguing) is characterized by a trait I call manifest rationality. In the practice of argumentation, rationality is not merely the inner reality but also the outward appearance of the practice. The practice must not just be rational; it
must also appear rational. This is why the Arguer is expected to respond to objections and criticisms from others, and not ignore them or sweep them under the carpet. It's not just that sweeping them aside would not be rational and hence
not be in keeping with the spirit of the practice. It’s that it would be such an obvious violation of it—and it would be seen to be such.&lt;ref&gt;1995 “The Principle of Vulnerability,” Informal Logic, Vol. 17, No. 2, pg. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Booker Brandt''' (17 October 1910 – 10 September 1997)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095524618&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[American philosopher]] working in the [[utilitarian]] tradition in [[moral philosophy]]. 

==Education and career==

Brandt was originally educated at [[Denison University]], a [[Baptist]] institution he was shepherded to by his minister father, and graduated in 1930 with majors in philosophy and classical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Alvin I., and Jaegwon Kim (1978), eds., ''Values and Morals'', xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he earned another B.A., this time in the philosophy of religion, from Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;''Values and Morals'', xiv&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Ph.D. in [[Philosophy]] from [[Yale University]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://ns.umich.edu/Releases/1997/Sep97/chr091297b.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Values and Morals'', xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught at [[Swarthmore College]] before becoming Chair of the Department of Philosophy the [[University of Michigan]] in 1964, where he taught with [[Charles Stevenson]] and [[William K. Frankena]] (1908–1994) and spent the remainder of his career.&lt;ref&gt;http://ns.umich.edu/Releases/1997/Sep97/chr091297b.html&lt;/ref&gt; The expressivist moral philosopher [[Allan Gibbard]] has mentioned his great intellectual debt to Brandt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wise Choices, Apt Feelings|publisher=Clarendon Press|author=Gibbard, Allan|year=1990|isbn=0-19-824985-3|nopp=true|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandt gave the [[John Locke Lectures]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1974-75, material that later appeared in ''A Theory of the Good and the Right'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/john-locke-lectures&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Brandt wrote ''Ethical Theory'' (1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential textbook in the field. He defended a version of [[rule utilitarianism]] in "Toward a credible form of utilitarianism" (1963) and performed cultural-anthropological studies in ''Hopi Ethics'' (1954). In ''A Theory of the Good and the Right'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of the Good and the Right|publisher=Clarendon Press|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1979|isbn=0-19-824550-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandt proposed a "reforming definition" of [[rationality]], that one is rational if one's preferences are such that they survive cognitive psychotherapy in terms of all relevant information and logical criticism. He argued also that the morality such rational persons would accept would be a form of utilitarianism.

Brandt believed that moral rules should be considered in sets which he called [[moral code]]s. A moral code is justified when it is the optimal code that, if adopted and followed, would maximise the [[public good]] more than any alternative code would. The codes may be society-wide standards or special codes for a profession like [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of the Good and the Right|publisher=Clarendon Press|author=Richard B.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of [[Cherbourg]] in [[Normandy]]. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during [[World War I]] in the [[North Sea]] before Barthes' first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of [[Bayonne]]. When Barthes was eleven, his family moved to [[Paris]], though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

=== Student years ===
Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he earned a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which often had to be treated in the isolation of [[sanatorium|sanatoria]].&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|title=ROLAND BARTHES: A Biography by Louis-Jean Calvet|newspaper=The Independent|author=Ben Rogers|date=8 January 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/death-of-the-author-roland-barthes-a-biography-by-louisjean-calvet-trs-sarah-wykes-polity-press-16325-1567120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during [[World War II]].

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in grammar and [[philology]], publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] by thesis) from the [[University of Paris]] in 1941 for his work in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift, ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 4, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early academic career ===
In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in [[France]], [[Romania]], and [[Egypt]]. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper ''Combat'', out of which grew his first full-length work, ''[[Writing Degree Zero]]'' (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], where he studied [[lexicology]] and [[sociology]]. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'', in which he dismantled myths of [[popular culture]] (gathered in the ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954–1956, ''Mythologies'' were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huppatz|first=D.J.|year=2011|title=Roland Barthes, Mythologies|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing little English, Barthes taught at [[Middlebury College]] in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, [[Richard Howard]], that summer in New York City.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Richard Howard. "Remembering Roland Barthes," ''[[The Nation]]'' (November 20, 1982): "Mutual friends brought us together in 1957. He came to my door in the summer of that year, disconcerted by his classes at Middlebury (teaching students unaccustomed to a visitor with no English to speak of) and bearing, by way of introduction, a fresh-printed copy of ''Mythologies''. (''Michelet'' and ''Writing Degree Zero'' had already been published in France, but he was not yet known in America&amp;mdash;not even in most French departments. Middlebury was enterprising.)" Reprinted in ''Signs in Culture: Roland Barthes Today'', edited by Steven Ungar and Betty R. McGraw, University of Iowa Press, 1989, p. 32 ({{ISBN|0-877-45245-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise to prominence ===
Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of [[semiology]] and [[structuralism]], chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of [[literary criticism]] and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, [[Raymond Picard]], who attacked the French [[New Criticism]] (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France's literary roots. Barthes' rebuttal in ''Criticism and Truth'' (1966) accused the old, [[bourgeois]] criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as [[Marxism]].

By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]], delivering a presentation at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. During this time, he wrote his best-known work{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}, the 1967 essay "[[Death of the author|The Death of the Author]]," which, in light of the growing influence of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thought.

=== Mature critical work ===
Barthes continued to contribute with [[Philippe Sollers]] to the [[avant-garde]] literary magazine ''[[Tel Quel]]'', which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes' writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work,{{Who|date=September 2010}} the dense, critical reading of [[Balzac]]'s ''[[Sarrasine]]'' entitled ''[[S/Z]]''. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of [[textualism|textuality]] and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Geneva]].

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled ''Roland Barthes'' and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the [[Collège de France]]. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'', is partly an essay about the nature of [[photography]] and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette.

=== Death ===
On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on March 26,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1980/03/28/le-plaisir-des-sens_2814902_1819218.html?xtmc=roland_barthes&amp;xtcr=436|title=Le plaisir des sens|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died from the chest injuries he sustained in that accident.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roland Barthes, French Writer, dies at 64|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 March 1980|author=J. Y. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and ideas==

===Early thought===
Barthes' earliest ideas reacted to the trend of [[existentialist]] philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre's ''[[What Is Literature?]]'' (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, [[avant-garde]] forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes’ response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In ''Writing Degree Zero'' (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls "writing" (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. A writer's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention, however, once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In ''Michelet'', a critical analysis of the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet's views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet's claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that [[avant-garde]] writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done.

===Semiotics and myth===
Barthes' many monthly contributions, collected in his ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society asserted its values through them. For example, the portrayal of wine in French society as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found [[semiotics]], the study of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], useful in these interrogations. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were "second-order signs," or "[[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]]s." A picture of a full, dark bottle is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] that relates to a specific signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the [[status quo]]. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term "myth" while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that "objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Fashion System'' Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a ‘blouse’ is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with ‘skirt’, ‘vest’ or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes' ''Mythologies'' became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

===Structuralism and its limits===
As Barthes' work with [[structuralism]] began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.uv.es/fores/Barthes_Structural_Narrative.pdf|title= An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative|website=uv.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: ‘functions’, ‘actions’ and ‘narrative’. ‘Functions’ are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an ‘action’, and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key ‘functions’ work in forming characters. For example, key words like ‘dark’, ‘mysterious’ and ‘odd’, when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or ‘action’. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of [[bourgeois]] culture.

While Barthes found [[structuralism]] to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The [[post-structuralist]] movement and the [[deconstruction]]ism of [[Jacques Derrida]] were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes' work exemplified. [[Derrida]] identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Transition===
Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to [[Japan]] in 1966 where he wrote ''Empire of Signs'' (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture's contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of [[Tokyo]], the Emperor's Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the [[Meaning (semiotics)|significance]] naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay "[[The Death of the Author]]" (1968). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the ‘knowable text’ acts as little more than another delusion of Western [[bourgeois]] culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. "The Death of the Author" is considered to be a [[post-structuralist]] work,&lt;ref&gt;Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, ''Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1991, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the [[bourgeois]] norms {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

===Textuality and ''S/Z''===
Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can’t come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his ''[[S/Z]]'' (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of a short story by Balzac called ''[[Sarrasine]]''. The end result was a reading that established [[five major codes]] for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text – a "lexia" here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=S/V|last=Barthes|first=Roland|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1974|isbn=0631176071|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that ''[[Sarrasine]]'' suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation.

===Neutral and novelistic writing===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In the late 1970s Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the [[Doxa]] and the [[paradox|Para-doxa]]. While Barthes had shared sympathies with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was [[bourgeois]] literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this he wrote ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: [[hedonism]]. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final [[catharsis|cathartic]] climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or [[jouissance]], is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover's search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover's attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The end result is one that challenges the reader's views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

===Photography and Henriette Barthes===
Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths'. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which ‘pierces the viewer’ (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother's picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of ‘what is’, where ‘what was’ would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes' death, her childhood photograph is evidence of ‘what has ceased to be’. Instead of making reality solid, it reminds us of the world's ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes' mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, ''Camera Lucida'' was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

===Posthumous publications===
A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by [[François Wahl]], ''Incidents''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Culler]], ''Barthes: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; It contains fragments from his journals: his ''Soirées de Paris'' (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept (his erotic encounters with boys in Morocco); and ''Light of the Sud Ouest'' (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, [[Yale University Press]] published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes' little known work ''What is Sport''. This work bears a considerable resemblance to ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' and was originally commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as the text for a documentary film directed by [[Hubert Aquin]].

In February 2009, [[Éditions du Seuil]] published ''Journal de deuil'' (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes' files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother's death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss:
{{quote|The (awesome but not painful) idea that she had not been everything to me. Otherwise I would never have written a work. Since my taking care of her for six months long, she actually had become everything for me, and I totally forgot of ever have written anything at all. I was nothing more than hopelessly hers. Before that she had made herself transparent so that I could write.... Mixing-up of roles. For months long I had been her mother. I felt like I had lost a daughter.}}

He grieved his mother's death for the rest of his life: "Do not say mourning. It's too psychoanalytic. I'm not in mourning. I'm suffering." and "In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hanged an icon—not out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away."

In 2012 the book ''Travels in China'' was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal [[Tel Quel]] in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China "not at all exotic, not at all disorienting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sideways Gaze: Roland Barthes' Travels in China|author=Dora Zhang|journal=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=23 June 2012|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114183654/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Roland Barthes' incisive criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as [[structuralism]], [[semiotics]], and [[post-structuralism]]. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes' breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes’ work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one's thoughts upon, and thus no "Barthesism".

==Key terms==
''Readerly'' and ''writerly'' are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one's experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in ''[[S/Z]]'', while the essay "From Work to Text", from ''[[Image—Music—Text]]'' (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active–passive and postmodern–modern ways of interacting with a text.

===Readerly text===
A text that makes no requirement of the reader to "write" or "produce" their own meanings. The reader may passively locate "ready-made" meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are "controlled by the principle of non-contradiction" (156), that is, they do not disturb the "common sense," or "Doxa," of the surrounding culture. The "readerly texts," moreover, "are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature" (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of "replete literature," which comprises "any classic (readerly) texts" that work "like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded" (200).&lt;ref name="S/Z"&gt;Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writerly text===
A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: "... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text" (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the "readerly texts" as "product," the "writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages" (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes "not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing", but rather a "form of work" (10).

===The ''Author'' and the ''scriptor''===
''Author'' and ''scriptor'' are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. "The author" is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of [[Surrealism]], have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the "scriptor," whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an "author-God" to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, "the death of the author is the birth of the reader."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''Image—Music—Text''. Essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath. New York: Noonday, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1964, Barthes wrote "The Last Happy Writer" ("''Le dernier des écrivains heureux''" in ''Essais critiques''), the title of which refers to [[Voltaire]]. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes' description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of ''[[Candide]]'' (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that "never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The sinologist [[Simon Leys]], in a review of Barthes' diary of a trip to China during the [[Cultural Revolution]], disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes "has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leys, Simon]] ''The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays'', New York, New York Review Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Barthes' ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' was the inspiration for the name of 1980s [[new wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Lover Speaks]].

[[Jeffrey Eugenides]]' ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' draws out excerpts from Barthes' ''A Lover's Discourse: Fragments'' as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |title=The Euphoria of Influence: Jeffrey Eugenides's The Marriage Plot |publisher=Publicbooks.org |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113065904/http://publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' (2014) by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from [[Mythologies (book)|''Mythologies'']]: "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/10/7-secrets-birdman-labyrinth|title=7 Secrets of the 'Birdman' Labyrinth|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs]]'' (1996) by [[Michael Lehmann]], Brian is reading an extract from ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' over the phone to a woman whom he thinks to be beautiful but who is her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=390|title=CTheory.net|website=www.ctheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'', based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Dying Animal]]'', the character of Consuela (played by [[Penelope Cruz]]) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes' ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' on the campus of the university where she is a student.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/movies/08eleg.html Extracurricular Lessons for Student and Teacher]," review of ''Elegy'', New York Times, August 8, 2008, accessed on 12-9-2015: Of the character of Consuela, Dargis writes, "She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes's "Pleasure of the Text" to her lush bosom."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Binet]]'s novel ''The 7th Function of Language'' is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered, as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the "Seventh Function of Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956750580|title=The 7th function of language|last=Laurent,|first=Binet,|others=Taylor, Sam, 1970-|isbn=9781910701591|location=London, England|oclc=956750580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosen Method Bodywork''' (or '''Rosen Method''') is a type of [[Complementary and alternative medicine]].  This [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], described as "psycho-somatic", claims to help integrate one's bodily and emotional/mental experience while identifying unconscious patterns of muscular holding, feeling, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Lynn |last= Keegan |year= 2000 |title= Healing with Complementary &amp; Alternative Therapies |publisher= [[Cengage Learning]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=JF5STWO2qtQC&amp;pg=PA195 195] |isbn= 9780766818903}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theory underpinning this method is that a person protects themselves from past painful experiences through the body, separating one from one's [[true self]].&lt;ref name="Raso1997"/&gt; This alleged protection is said to be experienced most frequently as chronic musculoskeletal pain and tension, and purportedly can be observed by the bodywork practitioners as restricted patterns of movement and posture, muscular tension, or shortness of breath.&lt;ref name="Raso1997"/&gt; Rosen Method Bodywork purports to integrate the body, mind, emotions and spirit; and unlock the unconscious.&lt;ref name="Raso1997"/&gt;

[[Quackwatch]] categorized the Rosen Method as an "unnaturalistic method" and says that it features "non-intrusive" touch, verbal interaction, and experiencing breath as "gateway to awareness".&lt;ref name="Raso1997"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/dictionary/mdqr.html |title= The Expanded Dictionary of Metaphysical Healthcare, Alternative Medicine, Paranormal Healing, and Related Methods |edition= online |year= 1997 |chapter= Unnaturalistic Methods: QR |last= Raso |first= Jack |publisher= [[Quackwatch]] |accessdate= 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Laws of Noah''' ({{lang-he-n|שבע מצוות בני נח}} ''Sheva Mitzvot B'nei Noach''), also referred to as the '''Noahide Laws''' or the '''Noachide Laws''' (from the [[Hebrew]] pronunciation of "Noah"), are a set of imperatives which, according to the [[Talmud]], were given by God&lt;ref&gt;According to Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, Entry ''Ben Noah'', page 349), most [[Rishonim|medieval authorities]] consider that all seven commandments were given to [[Adam]], although [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) considers the dietary law to have been given to Noah.&lt;/ref&gt; as a binding set of laws for the "children of [[Noah]]" – that is, all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', introduction) states that after the giving of the [[Torah]], the Jewish people were no longer in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) indicates that the seven laws are also part of the Torah, and the Talmud (Bavli, [[Sanhedrin]] 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:4–6|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, any non-Jew who adheres to these laws because they were given by [[Moses]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Melachim uMilchamot 8:11|url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm|website = www.chabad.org|access-date = 2015-06-24|at = last two sentences of the three}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as a ''[[ger toshav|righteous gentile]]'', and is assured of a place in the [[world to come]] ({{Hebrew|עולם הבא}} ''[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|Olam Haba]]''), the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven [[Noahidism|Noahide]] laws as traditionally enumerated are the following:&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared values: The Noahide Laws|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/shared-values-noahide-laws/|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Meri|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim-Jewish Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXF9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191|date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-38320-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; the rabbis agree that the seven laws were given to the sons of Noah. However, they disagree on precisely which laws were given to Adam and Eve. Six of the seven laws are [[exegesis|exegetically]] derived from passages in Genesis,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbinical authorities disputed whether there was only one or several commandments given to Adam: see [http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_56.html 56a/b]&lt;/ref&gt; with the seventh being the establishing of courts.

===Torah===
According to the [[Genesis flood narrative]], a [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]] covered the whole world, killing every surface-dwelling creature except Noah, his wife, his sons and their wives, and the animals taken aboard [[Noah's Ark]]. According to this, all modern humans are descendants of Noah, thus the name Noahide Laws is referred to the laws that apply to all of humanity. After the flood, God sealed a [[Covenant (Biblical)#Noahic covenant|covenant with Noah]] with the following admonitions ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9|HE}}):
* Flesh of a living animal: "However, flesh with its life-blood [in it], you shall not eat." (9:4)
* Murder and courts: "Furthermore, I will demand your blood, for [the taking of] your lives, I shall demand it [even] from any wild animal. From man too, I will demand of each person's brother the blood of man. He who spills the blood of man, by man his blood shall be spilt; for in the image of God He made man." (9:5–6)

{{quote|And in the twenty-eighth jubilee Noah began to enjoin upon his sons' sons the ordinances and commandments, and all the judgments that he knew, and he exhorted his sons to observe righteousness, and to cover the shame of their flesh, and to bless their Creator, and honour father and mother, and love their neighbour, and guard their souls from fornication and uncleanness and all iniquity.

{{quote|According to Acts, Paul began working along the traditional Jewish line of proselytizing in the various synagogues where the proselytes of the gate [e.g., {{Bibleref||Exodus|20:9|HE}}] and the Jews met; and only because he failed to win the Jews to his views, encountering strong opposition and persecution from them, did he turn to the Gentile world after he had agreed at a convention with the apostles at Jerusalem to admit the Gentiles into the Church only as proselytes of the gate, that is, after their acceptance of the Noachian laws ({{bibleref2|Acts|15:1–31|KJV}})".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=283&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Saul%20of%20Tarsus|title=Saul of Tarsus|publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

#concerning a limb torn from a living animal (eber min ha-hayy)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Halakha and the Seven Laws==

===Talmud===
According to the [[Talmud]], the Noahide Laws apply to all humanity. In Judaism, בני נח ''B'nei Noah'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], "Descendants of Noah", "Children of Noah") refers to all of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit, Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud also states: "Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come".&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 105a&lt;/ref&gt; Any non-Jew who lives according to these laws is regarded as one of "the righteous among the gentiles".

The rabbis agree that the seven laws were given to the sons of Noah. However, they disagree on precisely which laws were given to Adam and Eve. Six of the seven laws are exegetically derived from passages in Genesis. The Talmud adds extra laws beyond the seven listed in the [[Tosefta]] which are attributed to different rabbis, such as the grafting of trees and sorcery among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YVI2a9jc4pMC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Tosefta+Avodah+Zarah+9:4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k3LuVPeUC_WIsQTQ0oBo&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Tosefta%20Avodah%20Zarah%209%3A4&amp;f=false| title = Judaism in the Roman World: Collected Essays| author = Martin Goodman|publisher = BRILL| year = 2007| access-date= 17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 30–31}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] [http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_56.html 56a/b], quoting [[Tosefta]] Avodah Zarah 9:4; see also Rashi on Genesis 9:4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulla (Talmudist)|Ulla]] going so far as to make a list of 30 laws.&lt;ref&gt;Chullin 92a-b&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud expands the scope of the seven laws to cover about 100 of the 613 mitzvoth.&lt;ref name = " Annual"&gt;{{cite book |title= Learn Torah With 1994-1995 Torah Annual: A Collection of the Year's Best Torah |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pxv3NpOLdEC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=maimonides+seven+laws+differ+from+the++talmud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t4rzVJqTBqbasATRvIGYDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=maimonides%20seven%20laws%20differ%20from%20the%20%20talmud&amp;f=false | editors = Joel Lurie Grishaver, Rabbi Stuart Kelman |publisher = Torah Aura Productions |year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 18}}

===Punishment===
{{Main| Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism}}

In practice Jewish law makes it very difficult to apply the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org Capital Punishment"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html Jewishvirtuallibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt; No record exists of a gentile having been put to death for violating the seven laws.&lt;ref name="per Novak, 1983:28ff"&gt;per Novak, 1983:28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the categories of capital punishment recorded in the Talmud are recorded as having never been carried out.  It is thought that the rabbis included discussion of them in anticipation of the coming messianic age.&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org Capital Punishment"/&gt;

The Talmud lists the punishment for blaspheming the Ineffable Name of God as death. The sons of Noah are to be executed by decapitation for most crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf| title = Sanhedrin| publisher = Halakhah.com 56a| accessdate= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered one of the lightest capital punishments,&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Judges, Laws of Sanhedrin, chapter 14, law 4&lt;/ref&gt; by stoning if he has intercourse with a Jewish betrothed woman,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Melachim uMilchamot 9:7|url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188354/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-9.htm|website = www.chabad.org|access-date = 2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by strangulation if the Jewish woman has completed the marriage ceremonies, but had not yet consummated the marriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Jewish law the only form of blasphemy which is punishable by death is blaspheming the [[Tetragrammaton|Ineffable Name]] ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|24:16|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3354-blasphemy Jewishencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Talmudic rabbis held that only those offences for which a Jew would be executed, are forbidden to gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf| title = Sanhedrin| publisher = Halakhah.com 56b| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmudic rabbis discuss which offences and sub-offences are capital offences and which are merely forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf| title = Sanhedrin| publisher = Halakhah.com 57a-b| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] states that anyone who does not accept the seven laws is to be executed, as God compelled the world to follow these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/rst/kingsandwars.pdf | title = Mishneh Torah Shoftim, Laws of Kings and their wars: 8.13 | publisher = Halakhah.com| accessdate= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the other prohibitions such as the grafting of trees and bestiality he holds that the sons of Noah are not to be executed.&lt;ref name="Halakhah.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/rst/kingsandwars.pdf | title = Mishneh Torah Shoftim, Laws of Kings and their wars: 10:8| publisher = Halakhah.com| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides adds a universalism lacking from earlier Jewish sources.&lt;ref name = " Annual"/&gt;{{rp| 18}} The Talmud differs from Maimonides in that it considers the seven laws enforceable by Jewish authorities on non-Jews living within a Jewish nation.&lt;ref name = " Annual"/&gt;{{rp| 18}} [[Nahmanides]] disagrees with Maimonides reasoning. He limits the obligation of enforcing the seven laws to non-Jewish authorities taking the matter out of Jewish hands. The [[Tosafot]] seems to agree with Nahmanides reasoning.&lt;ref name = " warAndPeace "&gt;{{cite book |title= War and Peace in the Jewish Tradition |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=L4YpnaFxUrYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=maimonides+seven+laws+talmud+compelled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zYbzVPaqB4rLsATsmIKwCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=maimonides%20seven%20laws%20talmud%20compelled&amp;f=false | editors = Lawrence H. Schiffman, Joel B. Wolowelsky |publisher = KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 39}} According to some opinions, punishment is the same whether the individual transgresses with knowledge of the law or is ignorant of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Makkot 9a, commentary of Rashi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
Various [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic sources]] have different positions on the way the seven laws are to be subdivided in categories. Maimonides', in his [[Mishneh Torah]], included the grafting of trees.&lt;ref name="Halakhah.com"/&gt; Like the Talmud, he interpreted the prohibition against homicide as including a prohibition against [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/rst/kingsandwars.pdf | title = Mishneh Torah Shoftim, Laws of Kings and their wars: 9:6| publisher = Halakhah.com| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf| title = Sanhedrin| publisher = Halakhah.com 57b| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]], a commentator on Maimonides, expressed surprise that he left out castration and sorcery which were also listed in the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 56b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmudist [[Ulla (Talmudist)|Ulla]] said that here are 30 laws which the sons of Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a [[Ketubah]] between males, not to sell [[carrion]] or [[human flesh]] in the market and to respect the [[Torah]]. The rest of the laws are not listed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kodashim#Chullin or Hullin|Chullin]] 92a, and see Rashi.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the authorities seem to take it for granted that Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]] which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work ''Asarah Maamarot'' by Rabbi [[Menahem Azariah da Fano]] and a second from the 10th century [[Samuel ben Hofni]] which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mossad HaRav Kook]] edition of the Gaon's commentary to Genesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.noachide.org.uk/html/30_commandments.html | title = The Thirty Mitzvot of the Bnei Noach| publisher = noachide.org.uk| accessdate= 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''Kol Hidushei Maharitz Chayess'' I, end Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ger toshav (resident alien)===
{{Main|Ger toshav}}
In earlier times, a Gentile living in the [[Land of Israel]] who accepted the Seven Laws in front of a rabbinical court was known as a ''[[ger toshav]]'' (literally stranger/resident).&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;
{{quote|In order to find a precedent the rabbis went so far as to assume that proselytes of this order were recognized in Biblical law, applying to them the term "toshab" ("sojourner," "aborigine," referring to the Canaanites; see Maimonides' explanation in "Yad," Issure Biah, xiv. 7; see Grätz, l.c. p. 15), in connection with "ger" (see Ex. xxv. 47, where the better reading would be "we-toshab"). Another name for one of this class was "proselyte of the gate" ("ger ha-sha'ar," that is, one under Jewish civil jurisdiction; comp. Deut. v. 14, xiv. 21, referring to the stranger who had legal claims upon the generosity and protection of his Jewish neighbors). In order to be recognized as one of these the neophyte had publicly to assume, before three "ḥaberim," or men of authority, the solemn obligation not to worship idols, an obligation which involved the recognition of the seven Noachian injunctions as binding ('Ab. Zarah 64b; "Yad," Issure Biah, xiv. 7).&lt;br&gt;[...] The more rigorous seem to have been inclined to insist upon such converts observing the entire Law, with the exception of the reservations and modifications explicitly made in their behalf. The more lenient were ready to accord them full equality with Jews as soon as they had solemnly forsworn idolatry. The "via media" was taken by those that regarded public adherence to the seven Noachian precepts as the indispensable prerequisite (Gerim iii.; 'Ab. Zarah 64b; Yer. Yeb. 8d; Grätz, l.c. pp. 19–20). The outward sign of this adherence to Judaism was the observance of the Sabbath (Grätz, l.c. pp. 20 et seq.; but comp. Ker. 8b).|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|last2=Hirsch||first2=Emil G.|source="[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12391-proselyte#anchor4 Proselyte]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations regarding Jewish-Gentile relations are modified in the case of a ''ger toshav''.&lt;ref name="ET_GT"&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit, Hebrew edition, 5739/1979, entry Ger Toshav&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary status===
Historically, some rabbinic opinions consider non-Jews not only not obliged to adhere to all the remaining laws of the Torah, but actually forbidden to observe them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishEncyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543|title=''Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah.''|publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf| title = Sanhedrin| publisher = Halakhah.com 59a-b| access-date= 25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noahide law differs radically from [[Roman law]] for gentiles (''Jus Gentium''), if only because the latter was enforceable judicial policy. Rabbinic Judaism has never adjudicated any cases under Noahide law,&lt;ref name="per Novak, 1983:28ff"/&gt; Jewish scholars disagree about whether Noahide law is a functional part of [[Halakha]] ("Jewish law").&lt;ref&gt;cf. Bleich&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern views hold that penalties are a detail of the Noahide Laws and that Noahides themselves must determine the details of their own laws for themselves. According to this school of thought – see N. Rakover, ''Law and the Noahides'' (1998); M. Dallen, ''The Rainbow Covenant'' (2003) – the Noahide Laws offer mankind a set of absolute values and a framework for righteousness and justice, while the detailed laws that are currently on the books of the world's states and nations are presumptively valid.

In recent years, the term "Noahide" has come to refer to non-Jews who strive to live in accord with the seven Noahide Laws; the terms "observant Noahide" or "Torah-centered Noahides" would be more precise but these are infrequently used. Support for the use of "Noahide" in this sense can be found with the [[Ritva]], who uses the term ''Son of Noah'' to refer to a Gentile who keeps the seven laws, but is not a [[Ger Toshav]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit, Hebrew edition, 5741/1981, Appendix, entry Ben Noah, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rainbow]], referring to the [[Covenant (Biblical)#Noahic covenant|Noahide or First Covenant]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9), is the symbol of many organized Noahide groups, following {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:12–17|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://setterfield.org/Noahide_Laws.html |title=Noahide Laws or Noachide Laws&lt;/ref&gt;

To various modern theologians the Noahide laws represent the inclusive nature of Judaism because they affirm the equality of Jews and non-Jews. To other intellectuals these seven laws represent natural law which are accessible to all through intellect and do not require revelation. According to Robert Eison the second stream of thought ignores how a non-Jew could access these laws without the Jewish revelations. To Eisen, these set of laws impose a Jewish understanding of morality upon non-Jews. To Eisen, the Noahide laws represent more of a barrier between Jews and non-Jews, because non-Jews are forbidden to observe Jewish laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Meri|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim-Jewish Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXF9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191|date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-38320-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maimonides==
The Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] (12th century) held that Gentiles may have a part in the [[olam habah|world to come]] just by observing Noahide law and accept it as given by Moses. Such children of Noah become the status of ''Chasidei Umot HaOlam'' - Pious People of the World, and are different from children of Noah who only keep the seven laws out of moral/ethical reasoning alone. He writes in his book of laws:"&lt;ref name=Maimonides&gt;Mishneh Torah, ''Shoftim'', ''Laws of Kings and their wars'' 8:14 or 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Anyone who accepts upon himself and carefully observes the Seven Commandments is of the Righteous of the Nations of the World and has a portion in the World to Come. This is as long as he accepts and performs them because (he truly believes that) it was the Holy One, Blessed Be He, Who commanded them in the Torah, and that it was through Moses our Teacher we were informed that the Sons of Noah had already been commanded to observe them. But if he observes them because he convinced himself, then he is not considered a Resident Convert and is not of the Righteous of the Nations of the World, but merely one of their wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://halakhah.com/rst/kingsandwars.pdf| title = TRANSLATION OF THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE RAMBAM’S MISHNEH TORAH| author= Reuven Brauner| publisher = Halakhah.com| year = 2012| access-date= 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some later editions of the Mishneh Torah differ by one letter and read "Nor one of their wise men." The later reading is narrower. [[Spinoza]] read Maimonides as using nor and accused him of being narrow and particularistic. Other philosophers such as [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Moses Mendelssohn]] have used more inclusive interpretations of the passage by Maimonides.&lt;ref name = "m1"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OISKHHuUIkC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=nor+of+'the+pious+among+the+gentiles,'+nor+of+their+wise+men&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=64aDU6arF7KrsQSWxIGIDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nor%20of%20'the%20pious%20among%20the%20gentiles%2C'%20nor%20of%20their%20wise%20men&amp;f=false| title = Maimonides| author= T.

In either reading, Maimonides appears to exclude philosophical Noahides from being Righteous Gentiles. Thus Maimonides emphasizes that a truly Righteous Gentile follows the seven laws because they are divinely revealed and thus are followed out of obedience to God.&lt;ref name = "m1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UY2GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=Maimonides+laws+of+kings+wise+men&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D4aDU8fzJqK_sQTK6oH4Bw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Maimonides%20laws%20of%20kings%20wise%20men&amp;f=false| title = Maimonides: Life and Thought | author= Moshe Halbertal | publisher = Princeton University Press| page = 253| year = 2013| access-date= 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|[[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the Apostolic Decree of Acts 15:20: "but we should write to them [Gentiles] to abstain only from things polluted by [[Idolatry and Christianity|idols]] and from [[Fornication#Christianity|fornication]] and from whatever has been strangled and from [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]]." ([[NRSV]])]]
{{see also|Dual-covenant theology|Paul the Apostle and Judaism}}

The [[Apostolic Decree]] recorded in [[Acts 15]] is commonly seen as a parallel to Noahide Law;&lt;ref&gt;''The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)'', Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), {{ISBN|0-300-13982-9}}, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; however, some modern scholars dispute the connection between Acts 15 and Noahide Law,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fitzmyer]], ''The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)'', Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), {{ISBN|0-300-13982-9}}, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; the content of Noahide Law, the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]], and the nature of [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|biblical law]] in Christianity. The Apostolic Decree is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and includes some food restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the [[Synod of Gangra]], the rule of the [[Council of Jerusalem|Apostolic Synod]] with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Theodore Balsamon|Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the [[Western Christianity|West]] is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] proposed that Jesus, and Paul after him, intended to convert the gentiles to the Noahide laws while calling on the Jews to keep the full [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah]: "R. Emden (), in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to "Seder 'Olam" (pp. 32b–34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the [[Mosaic law]]; this explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chabad movement==

[[Maimonides]] stated that God commanded Moses to compel the world to accept these seven commandments. In 1983 Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]] urged his followers to actively engage in activities to inform non-Jews about these seven commandments, which had not been done in previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/196588/the-gentiles-who-act-like-jews |title=The Gentiles Who Act Like Jews |author=Ilana E. Strauss |publisher=Nextbook Inc. |work=Tablet Magazine |date=January 26, 2016 |access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem ===
After Rabbi Schneerson started his Noahide Campaign in the 1980s, a codification of the exact obligations of the Gentiles in the spirit of the classical [[Shulchan Aruch]] was needed. In 2005, Rabbi Moshe Weiner of Jerusalem accepted to produce an in-depth codification of the Noahide precepts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Divine Code'', Rabbi Moshe Weiner, Ed. Dr. Michael Schulman Ph.D., Vol, I., p. 21, 2008, publ. Ask Noah International&lt;/ref&gt; The work is called ''[[Sefer Sheva Mitzvot HaShem]]'', (The Book of Seven Divine Commandments) published 2008/2009. As it was approved by both of the then presiding chief rabbis of Israel (Rabbi [[Shlomo Moshe Amar]] and Rabbi [[Yonah Metzger]]) as well as by other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and non-Hasidic halachic authorities, it can claim an authoritative character and is referred as a ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Letter of Blessing'' (for ''Sefer Sheva Mitzvoth HaShem''), Rabbi Yonah Metzger, Chief Rabbi of Israel, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; for Gentiles at many places.

===Public recognition===

====United States====
In 1987 President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a proclamation speaking of "the historical tradition of ethical values and principles, which have been the bedrock of society from the dawn of civilization when they were known as the Seven Noahide Laws, transmitted through God to Moses on Mount Sinai",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chabad.org/142535|title= The Rebbe and President Ronald Reagan|publisher= Chabad.org|access-date= 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991, Congress stated in the preamble to the 1991 bill that established [[Education Day]] in honor of the birthday of [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the leader of the [[Chabad]] movement:
{{quote |Whereas Congress recognizes the historical tradition of ethical values and principles which are the basis of civilized society and upon which our great Nation was founded; Whereas these ethical values and principles have been the bedrock of society from the dawn of civilization, when they were known as the Seven Noahide Laws [...]&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:h.j.res.104.enr: Thomas.loc.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Israeli Druze====
In January 2004, [[Sheikh Mowafak Tarif]], the spiritual leader of Israeli [[Druze]], signed a declaration, which called on non-Jews living in Israel to observe the Noahide Laws. He was joined by the mayor of [[Shefa-'Amr]].&lt;ref name = "Druze"&gt;

[[File:Shri mahaprabhuji.jpg|x216px|thumb|right|[[Vallabhacharya]], who propounded the philosophy of Shuddadvaita]]
{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Shuddadvaita''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|śuddhādvaita}} "pure non-dualism") is the "purely non-dual" philosophy propounded by [[Vallabhacharya]] (1479-1531 CE), the founding philosopher and guru of the {{IAST|Vallabhā sampradāya}} ("tradition of Vallabha") or {{IAST|Puśtimārg}} ("The path of grace"), a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Vaishnava]] tradition focused on the worship of [[Krishna]]. Vallabhacharya's pure form ([[nondualist]]) philosophy is different from [[Advaita]]. The [[Shrinathji]] temple at [[Nathdwara]], and compositions of eight poets ({{IAST|aṣṭachap}}), including [[Sur (poet)|Sur]], are central to the worship by the followers of the sect.&lt;ref name = Martin&gt;Martin, Nancy M., "North Indian Hindi devotional literature" in {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|pp=182–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Though the tradition originated near [[Vrindavana]] in the current [[India]]n state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in modern times followers of Shuddadvaita are concentrated in the states of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name = Beck/&gt;

==Central Topics==
In the [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Vedic tradition]] of knowledge and comprehension of reality, the central theme would be experiencing the Supreme Entity or [[Brahman]]. [[Vedas]] primarily contain references to the ''adwait'' nature of Brahm. However, depending on how a scholar perceives those verses, s/he might see duality&amp;mdash; ''dwait'' aspect as well. This ambiguity has led to several philosophical traditions in the [[History of India|Indian history]], such as:

*[[Advaita|Advaita vāda]] of [[Adi Shankaracharya]]
*[[Vishistadvaita|Vishistadvaita vāda]] of [[Ramanujacharya]]
*[[Dvaita|Dvaita vāda]] or Bhedavāda of [[Madhvacharya]]
*[[Dvaitadvaita|Dvaitadvaita vāda]] of [[Nimbarkacharya]]
*Shuddhadvaita vāda of Vishnu swami popularized by [[Vallabhacharya]]
*[[Achintya Bhedābheda|Achintya Bhedābheda vāda]] of [[Krishna Chaitanya]]

==Vallabhacharya==
{{Main|Vallabhacharya}}
[[Vallabhacharya]] was a devotional philosopher, who founded the [[Pushtimarg|Pushti]] sect in India. He won the title of [[acharya]] by traveling and debating [[advaita]] scholars from a young age.

In 1493-94 [[Vallabhacharya]] is said to have identified an image of Krishna at the [[Govardhan hill]] at [[Braj]]. This image, now called [[Shrinathji]] and located at [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajasthan]], is central to the worship by Vallabha followers.&lt;ref name= Colas/&gt;

===Initiating mantra===
According to Vallabha tradition, one night in 1494, [[Vallabhacharya]] received the ''Brahmasambandha mantra'' (the [[mantra]] that binds one with [[Brahman]], or Krishna) from [[Krishna]] himself (hence the name, {{IAST|mukhāvatāra}}) at [[Gokula]]. The eight-syllable mantra, ''{{IAST|śri kṛṣṇaḥ śaraṇaṃ mama}}'' (Lord Krishna is my refuge), is passed onto new initiates in Vallabh sampradaya, and the divine name is said to rid the recipient of all impurities of the soul ({{IAST|doṣas}}) .&lt;ref name =Beck&gt;{{Harvnb|Beck|1993|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Colas&gt;Colas, Gerard, "History of {{IAST|Vaiṣṇava}} traditions" in {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|pp=229–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Vaishnavism}}
The school of in-essence [[monism]] or purified non-dualism of Vallabha sees equality in "essence" of the individual self with God. There is no real difference between the two (like the analogy of sparks to fire). However, unlike [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]], Vallabha does not deny God as the whole and the individual as the part. The individual soul is not the Supreme ([[Satcitananda]]) clouded by the force of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], but is itself [[Brahman]], with one attribute (ananda) rendered imperceptible. The soul is both a doer and enjoyer. It is atomic in size, but pervades the whole body through its essence of intelligence (like sandalwood makes its presence felt through its scent even if sandalwood can't be seen).

Unlike Advaita, the world of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is not regarded as unreal, since Maya is nothing else than a power of [[Ishvara]]. He is not only the creator of the universe but is the universe itself. Vallabha cites the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] account, that [[Brahman]] desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Although Brahman is not known, He is known when He manifests Himself through the world.

[[Bhakti]] is the means of salvation, though [[Jnana]] is also useful. [[Karma]]s precede knowledge of the Supreme, and are present even when this knowledge is gained. The liberated perform all karmas. The highest goal is not [[Moksha|Mukti]] or liberation, but rather eternal service of [[Krishna]] and participation along with His activities in His Divine abode of [[Vrindavana]]. Vallabha distinguishes the transcendent consciousness of Brahman as [[Purushottama]]. Vallabha lays a great stress on a life of unqualified love and devotion towards God.

In all the philosophical traditions, it is common practice to describe how the Supreme Entity Brahm is related to us and our surroundings. In the system of Suddhadwait Vedant, otherwise known as Brahmvaad, the One, secondless Ultimate Reality is the only category. Every other thing has proceeded from it at the time of creation, is non-different from it during creation and merges into it at the time of dissolution. The two other well known categories namely the animate souls and the inanimate objects are respectively its parts and modifications. The animate souls are its parts because they retain to some extent the essential qualities thereof namely consciousness and joy. The inanimate objects are its modification because the above said qualities are absent therein.&lt;ref&gt;PhD thesis,[http://www.pushtimarg.net/newPushti/pushti_vidhanam/book/english/bramhavaad.pdf "The system of Shuddhadwait Vedant of Vallabhacharya"] by Goswami Raghunathji&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everything is Krishna's Leela===

According to the version of [[Vaishnava Theology]] [[Vallabhacharya]] espoused; the glorious [[Krsna|Krishna]] in His "[[Satcitananda]]" form is the Absolute, [[Svayam Bhagavan]]. He is permanently playing out His sport ([[lila (Hinduism)|leela]]) from His seat in the Goloka which is even beyond the divine [[Vaikuntha]], the abode of [[Vishnu]] and [[Satya-loka]], the abode of [[Brahma]] the Creator, and [[Mount Kailash|Kailas]], the abode of [[Shiva]]. Creation is His sport.

===Path to bliss in the Kali Yuga===

Followers of [[Vallabhacharya]] maintain that if one wants to obtain [[moksha]] and the bliss given by [[Krishna]], the only path to do so is [[bhakti]]. In the [[Kali Yuga]], it is believed that the forms of bhakti mentioned in the scriptures are nearly impossible to practice, so the followers of [[Vallabhacharya]] recommend ''pushti bhakti'' – which is the end itself and not means to an end, giving moksha, joy and oneness with Shree Krishna. It illustrates oneness with Shree Krishna can be achieved merely by having true belief and love for Shree Krsna and recitation of the Brahmasambandha mantra.

===Atma-nivedana===

It is that bhakti which gives itself up body, heart and soul to the cause of God. It is considered to be the fullest expression of what is known as Atma-nivedana (= giving-up of oneself) among the nine forms of bhakti (Navadha Bhakti). It is the bhakti of the devotee who worships God not for any reward or presents but for His own sake. Such a devotee goes to Goloka after leaving this body and lives in eternal bliss enjoying the sports of the Lord. The classical example of this complete self-effacement is that of the cow-herdesses towards [[Krishna]]. They spoke no word except prayer and they moved no step except towards [[Krishna]]. Their supreme-most meditation was on the lotus-feet of [[Krishna]].Thus  it is by God's grace alone that one can obtain release from bondage and attain Krishna's heaven, Goloka.

===[[Aṣṭachāp]]===

In V.S. 1602, his son Vitthalnath, also known as [[Gusainji]], established the eight-fold system of singing the name and glory of [[Shrinathji]] ([[Kirtana]]) and entrusted this responsibility to eight poet-disciples of [[Vallabhacharya]] and his own, called the ashta-chhaap after the eight divine services to Shrinathji from morning until going to sleep. Foremost among them was [[Sur (poet)|Sur]], the blind poet of [[Agra]].

These are Surdas, Krishna Das, Paramanand Das, Kumbhan Das, Chaturbhuj Das, Nand Das, Chhitswami, and Govind Das. The first four poets and singers were Vallabhacharya's disciples, while the other three were Gusainji's.

==Shuddhadwait Martand==
Shuddhadwait is defined more thoroughly in verse 27-28 from Shuddhadwait Martand:

शुद्धाद्वैतापदे ज्ञेय:      समास: कर्मधारय: I

अद्वैतं शुद्धयो: प्राहुः षष्ठी तत्पुरुषमं बुधा: II

मायासंबंधरहितमं    शुद्धमित्युच्यते बुधै: I

कार्यकरणरूपमं हि शुद्धं ब्रह्म न मायिकम़् II   &lt;ref&gt;Shuddhadwait Martand, verse 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It is Karmdharay samaas : Shuddham ch tat adwaitam ''(The Pure and its non-dualism)''. Or, it is the Shashti Tatpurush samaas Shuddhyoh adwaitam (The Non-dual is pure). In this system, the combination of Maya with Brahm is done away with; therefore the cause of this world is not Brahm covered by Maya. But the pure Brahm and only pure Brahm is the effect and cause of this world."&lt;ref&gt;Anubhashya on Brahmsutras, 2005, Introduction pp. iv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shuddhadvaita philosophy has also been explained by various scholars of the sect, such as [[Devarshi Ramanath Shastri]], who has enunciated the tenets of this philosophy in his books ‘Shuddhadvait Siddhantasaar’ (Hindi and Gujarati) and Shuddhadvaita Darshan.&lt;ref&gt;Shuddhadvait Darshan (vol.2), Pub. Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shuddhadvait Darshan (in 3 Vols.)(New Edition), Pub. Vidya Vibhag, Nathdwara,2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Life became difficult for him and his mother after his father died. He was ordained at 17 by [[Feiyin Tongrong]]. At 21 he became a disciple of [[Ingen]], abbot of [[Wanfu Temple]], [[Mount Huangbo]], [[Fujian]].  There he became a colleague of [[Muyan]]. In 1651 he nearly died due to asphyxiation while fighting a [[forest fire]] near the temple, and was suddenly enlightened.  Sokuhi received dharma transmission from Ingen and the next year received a promotion to high monastic office. He then became abbot of [[Chongsheng Temple (Fujian)|Chongsheng Temple]] on [[Mount Xuefeng]], also in [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=" A portrait of an Obaku monk: The life and religion of Jifei Ruyi (1616-1671) "|author=Aihua Zheng|year=2009|publisher=Master's Thesis, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
In 1654, [[Ingen]] and [[Muyan]] travelled to [[Japan]] and summoned Sokuhi, who followed to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in 1657.  Sokuhi was made abbot of [[Sōfuku-ji (Nagasaki)|Sōfuku-ji]], a Chinese temple built in 1629, and [[Muyan]] was serving as abbot of [[Fukusai-ji]]. The two became known as ''nikanromon'' ("two gates to enlightenment"). In 1663 Sokuhi met Ingen for the first time in 12 years, after he received permission to go to [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] where he was abbot of [[Manpuku-ji]]. In 1664 Sokuhi left for Nagasaki intending to return to China but was convinced to stay by lord of [[Kokura]] and found a new temple [[Fukujū-ji]] on [[Mount Kujū]] (now in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]]). In 1668 he passed this position to his Japanese disciple [[Houn Myodo]] and returned to Sōfuku-ji to retire. He became ill in 1670 and died at Nagasaki in 1671. He was cremated and his remains were placed at [[Fukujū-ji]] and Sōfuku-ji.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19353">'''Speculative realism''' is a movement in [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[Continental philosophy|Continental]]-inspired philosophy (also known as '''post-Continental philosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Paul John Ennis, ''Post-continental Voices: Selected Interviews'', John Hunt Publishing, 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; that defines itself loosely in its stance of [[metaphysical realism]] against the dominant forms of [[post-Kantian philosophy]] (or what it terms "[[correlationism]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_collapse2.php | title=Editorial Introduction | author=Mackay, Robin | journal=Collapse |date=March 2007 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculative realism takes its name from a conference held at [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]] in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/6/305.full College &amp; Research Libraries News - ACRL]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was moderated by [[Alberto Toscano]] of Goldsmiths College, and featured presentations by [[Ray Brassier]] of [[American University of Beirut]] (then at [[Middlesex University]]), [[Iain Hamilton Grant]] of the [[University of the West of England]], [[Graham Harman]] of the [[American University in Cairo]], and [[Quentin Meillassoux]] of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. Credit for the name "speculative realism" is generally ascribed to Brassier,&lt;ref name=tutorial&gt;Graham Harman, [https://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/brief-srooo-tutorial/ "brief SR/OOO tutorial."]&lt;/ref&gt; though Meillassoux had already used the term "[[#Speculative materialism|speculative materialism]]" to describe his own position.&lt;ref name=tutorial/&gt;

A second conference, entitled "Speculative Realism/Speculative Materialism", took place at the [[UWE Bristol]] on Friday 24 April 2009, two years after the original event at Goldsmiths.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;[https://frieze.com/article/speculative-realism Mark Fisher, "Speculative Realism," Frieze.]&lt;/ref&gt; The line-up consisted of Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and (in place of Meillassoux, who was unable to attend) Alberto Toscano.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;

==Critique of correlationism==
While often in disagreement over basic philosophical issues, the speculative realist thinkers have a shared resistance to philosophies of [[human finitude]] inspired by the tradition of [[Immanuel Kant]].

What unites the four core members of the movement is an attempt to overcome both "[[correlationism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_collapse2.php |title=Editorial Introduction | author=Mackay, Robin | journal=Collapse |date=March 2007 |volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Anthropocentrism|philosophies of access]]". In ''After Finitude'', Meillassoux defines correlationism as "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other."&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Meillassoux (2008), ''After Finitude'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophies of access are any of those philosophies which privilege the human being over other entities. Both ideas represent forms of [[anthropocentrism]].

All four of the core thinkers within speculative realism work to overturn these forms of philosophy which privilege the human being, favouring distinct forms of realism against the dominant forms of idealism in much of contemporary Continental philosophy.

==Variations==
While sharing in the goal of overturning the dominant strands of post-Kantian thought in [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosophy, there are important differences separating the core members of the speculative realist movement and their followers.

===Speculative materialism&lt;!--'Speculative materialism' and 'Factiality' redirect here--&gt;===
In his critique of correlationism, [[Quentin Meillassoux]] (who uses the term '''speculative materialism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; to describe his position)&lt;ref name=tutorial/&gt; finds two principles as the locus of Kant's philosophy. The first is the ''principle of [[Correlationism|correlation]]'' itself, which claims essentially that we can only know the correlate of Thought and Being; what lies outside that correlate is unknowable. The second is termed by Meillassoux the ''principle of '''factiality'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'', which states that things could be otherwise than what they are. This principle is upheld by Kant in his defence of the thing-in-itself as unknowable but imaginable. We can imagine reality as being fundamentally different even if we never know such a reality. According to Meillassoux, the defence of both principles leads to "weak" correlationism (such as those of Kant and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]), while the rejection of the thing-in-itself leads to the "strong" correlationism of thinkers such as [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://euppublishingblog.com/2014/12/12/correlationism-an-extract-from-the-meillassoux-dictionary/ "Correlationism – An Extract from The Meillassoux Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[late Martin Heidegger]], for whom it makes no sense to suppose that there is anything outside of the correlate of Thought and Being, and so the principle of factiality is eliminated in favour of a strengthened principle of correlation.

Meillassoux follows the opposite tactic in rejecting the principle of correlation for the sake of a bolstered principle of factiality in his post-Kantian return to Hume. By arguing in favour of such a principle, Meillassoux is led to reject the necessity not only of all physical laws of nature, but all logical laws except the [[Principle of Non-Contradiction]] (since eliminating this would undermine the Principle of Factiality which claims that things can always be otherwise than what they are). By rejecting the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]], there can be no justification for the necessity of physical laws, meaning that while the universe may be ordered in such and such a way, there is no reason it could not be otherwise. Meillassoux rejects the Kantian ''a priori'' in favour of a Humean ''a priori'', claiming that the lesson to be learned from Hume on the subject of [[causality]] is that "''the same cause may actually bring about 'a hundred different events' '' (and even many more)."&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Meillassoux (2008), ''After Finitude'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object-oriented ontology===
The central tenet of [[Graham Harman]] and [[Levi Bryant]]'s [[object-oriented ontology]] (OOO) is that objects have been neglected in philosophy in favor of a "radical philosophy" that tries to "undermine" objects by saying that objects are the crusts to a deeper underlying reality, either in the form of monism or a perpetual flux, or those that try to "overmine" objects by saying that the idea of a whole object is a form of folk [[ontology]]. According to Harman, everything is an object, whether it be a mailbox, [[electromagnetic radiation]], curved [[spacetime]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], or a [[propositional attitude]]; all things, whether physical or fictional, are equally objects. Sympathetic to [[panpsychism]], Harman proposes a new philosophical discipline called "speculative psychology" dedicated to investigating the "cosmic layers of psyche" and "ferreting out the specific psychic reality of earthworms, dust, armies, chalk, and stone".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harman (2009), ''Prince of Networks'', 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harman defends a version of the Aristotelian notion of [[Substance theory|substance]]. Unlike [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], for whom there were both substances and aggregates, Harman maintains that when objects combine, they create new objects. In this way, he defends an a priori metaphysics that claims that reality is made up only of objects and that there is no "bottom" to the series of objects. For Harman, an object is in itself an infinite recess, unknowable and inaccessible by any other thing. This leads to his account of what he terms "vicarious causality". Inspired by the [[Occasionalism|occasionalists]] of [[Medieval Philosophy|medieval]] [[Islamic Philosophy|Islamic philosophy]], Harman maintains that no two objects can ever interact save through the mediation of a "sensual vicar".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harman, "On Vicarious Causality," in ''Collapse II'' (1997), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of objects, then, for Harman: real objects and the sensual objects that allow for interaction. The former are the things of everyday life, while the latter are the caricatures that mediate interaction. For example, when fire burns cotton, Harman argues that the fire does not touch the essence of that cotton which is inexhaustible by any relation, but that the interaction is mediated by a caricature of the cotton which causes it to burn.

===Transcendental materialism&lt;!--'Transcendental materialism' redirects here--&gt;===
[[Iain Hamilton Grant]] defends a position he calls '''transcendental materialism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Levi; Harman, Graham; Srnicek, Nick|title=The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism|year=2011|publisher=re.press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9806683-4-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues against what he terms "somatism", the philosophy and physics of bodies. In his ''Philosophies of Nature After Schelling'',{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Grant tells a new history of philosophy from [[Plato]] onward based on the definition of matter. Aristotle distinguished between Form and Matter in such a way that Matter was invisible to philosophy, whereas Grant argues for a return to the Platonic Matter as not only the basic building blocks of reality, but the forces and powers that govern our reality. He traces this same argument to the post-Kantian [[German Idealism|German Idealists]] [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], claiming that the distinction between Matter as substantive versus useful fiction persists to this day and that we should end our attempts to overturn Plato and instead attempt to overturn Kant and return to "speculative physics" in the Platonic tradition, that is, not a physics of bodies, but a "physics of the All".{{Cite quote|date=August 2010}}

[[Eugene Thacker]] has examined how the concept of "life itself" is both determined within regional philosophy and also how "life itself" comes to acquire metaphysical properties. His book ''After Life'' shows how the ontology of life operates by way of a split between "Life" and "the living," making possible a "metaphysical displacement" in which life is thought via another metaphysical term, such as time, form, or spirit: "Every ontology of life thinks of life in terms of something-other-than-life...that something-other-than-life is most often a metaphysical concept, such as time and temporality, form and causality, or spirit and immanence"&lt;ref name="Thacker, After Life, p. x"&gt;Eugene Thacker (2010), ''After Life'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Thacker traces this theme from Aristotle, to Scholasticism and mysticism/negative theology, to Spinoza and Kant, showing how this three-fold displacement is also alive in philosophy today (life as time in [[process philosophy]] and [[Deleuzianism]], life as form in biopolitical thought, life as spirit in post-secular philosophies of religion). Thacker examines the relation of speculative realism to the ontology of life, arguing for a "vitalist correlation": "Let us say that a vitalist correlation is one that fails to conserve the correlationist dual necessity of the separation and inseparability of thought and object, self and world, and which does so based on some ontologized notion of 'life'.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Thacker (2010), ''After Life'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately Thacker argues for a skepticism regarding "life": "Life is not only a problem ''of'' philosophy, but a problem ''for'' philosophy."&lt;ref name="Thacker, After Life, p. x"/&gt;

Other thinkers have emerged within this group, united in their allegiance to what has been known as "process philosophy", rallying around such thinkers as Schelling, [[Bergson]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], and [[Deleuze]], among others. A recent example is found in [[Steven Shaviro]]'s book ''Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics'', which argues for a process-based approach that entails panpsychism as much as it does vitalism or animism. For Shaviro, it is Whitehead's philosophy of prehensions and nexus that offers the best combination of continental and analytical philosophy. Another recent example is found in [[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett's]] book ''Vibrant Matter'',&lt;ref name=Vibrant_Matter&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Jane | author-link = Jane Bennett (political theorist) | title = Vibrant matter a political ecology of things | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780822346197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues for a shift from human relations to things, to a "vibrant matter" that cuts across the living and non-living, human bodies and non-human bodies.  Leon Niemoczynski, in his book ''Charles Sanders Peirce and a Religious Metaphysics of Nature'', invokes what he calls "speculative naturalism" so as to argue that nature can afford lines of insight into its own infinitely productive "vibrant" ground, which he identifies as ''natura naturans''.

===Transcendental nihilism&lt;!--'Transcendental nihilism' redirects here--&gt;===
In ''Nihil Unbound: Extinction and Enlightenment'', [[Ray Brassier]] defends '''transcendental nihilism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Austin, Paul Ennis, Fabio Gironi (2012), ''Speculations III'', punctum books, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of [[extinction]], instead attempting to find meaning in a world conditioned by the very idea of its own annihilation. Thus Brassier critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like [[Gilles Deleuze]], who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the "threat" of nihilism. Instead, drawing on thinkers such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[François Laruelle]], [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Thomas Metzinger]], Brassier defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning. That is, rather than avoiding [[nihilism]], Brassier embraces it as the truth of reality. Brassier concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier (2007), ''Nihil Unbound'', 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; but also that philosophy is the "organon of extinction," that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier (2007), ''Nihil Unbound'', 223–226, 234–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Brassier then defends a radically anti-correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being, but with Non-Being.

==Controversy about the term==
In an interview with Kronos magazine published in March 2011, Ray Brassier denied that there is any such thing as a "speculative realist movement" and firmly distanced himself from those who continue to attach themselves to the brand name:&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier interviewed by Marcin Rychter "[http://kronos.org.pl/index.php?23151,896 I am a nihilist because I still believe in truth]", Kronos, March 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The "speculative realist movement" exists only in the imaginations of a group of bloggers promoting an agenda for which I have no sympathy whatsoever: actor-network theory spiced with pan-psychist metaphysics and morsels of process philosophy. I don't believe the internet is an appropriate medium for serious philosophical debate; nor do I believe it is acceptable to try to concoct a philosophical movement online by using blogs to exploit the misguided enthusiasm of impressionable graduate students. I agree with Deleuze's remark that ultimately the most basic task of philosophy is to impede stupidity, so I see little philosophical merit in a "movement" whose most signal achievement thus far is to have generated an online orgy of stupidity.}}

==Publications==
Speculative realism has close ties to the journal [[Collapse (journal)|''Collapse'']], which published the proceedings of the inaugural conference at Goldsmiths and has featured numerous other articles by 'speculative realist' thinkers; as has the academic journal [http://plijournal.com/ ''Pli''], which is edited and produced by members of the Graduate School of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]]. The journal ''Speculations'', founded in 2010 published by [[Punctum books]], regularly features articles related to Speculative Realism. [[Edinburgh University Press]] publishes a book series called ''Speculative Realism''.

==Internet presence==
Speculative realism is notable for its fast expansion via the [[Internet]] in the form of [[blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabio Gironi, "Science-Laden Theory" in ''Speculations 1'' (2010), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Websites have formed as resources for essays, lectures, and planned future books by those within the speculative realist movement. Many other blogs, as well as podcasts, have emerged with original material on speculative realism or expanding on its themes and ideas.

Certain works of [[structural engineering]] design are also works of '''structural art'''.  Such works can be classified as structural art when they attain excellence in the three areas of efficiency, economy, and elegance, as defined by Prof. [[David P. Billington]] of [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=tower_and_bridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Billington|first=David|title=The Tower and the Bridge|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="structural art article 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Billington|first1=David |year= 1984|title=Bridges and the new art of structural engineering |journal= American Scientist|volume=72 |issue= 1|pages= 22–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key part of the concept of structural art is that the structural engineer making the design must exercise his or her creativity and playfulness to create an elegant structure within the constraints imposed by engineering requirements.  These constraints include the safety and serviceability of the structure.  Therefore, a structure cannot be a successful work of structural art without also being a successful work of [[structural engineering]] design, yet many works of [[structural engineering]] design that are safe and serviceable do not rise to the level of structural art because they fail to be economical, efficient, or elegant. Structural art is a topic of active scholarly research at several universities in the United States, including [[Princeton University]], [[Tufts University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and Roger Williams University, and in other parts of the world such as Spain ([[Universitat Politécnica de València]]) and Germany ([[HCU Hamburg]]). While structural artists often collaborate with architects, the discipline of structural art is based upon engineering rather than architectural design. A recent summary about this topic can be found in a review paper &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Nan|last2=Feng|first2=Peng|last3=Dai|first3=Gong-Lian|title=Structural art: Past, present and future|journal=Engineering Structures|date=November 2014|volume=79|pages=407–416|doi=10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.08.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the concept==
The idea of structural art as a creative subdiscipline of [[structural engineering]] originates from the scholarship of Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University.  The term appears to have been coined in his 1983 book ''The Tower and the Bridge'', and arose out of scholarly study of great works of structural design made by engineers starting in the late 18th century with the beginning of the wide availability of iron as a structural material. Much of the impetus for the idea came from the personal and professional writings of engineers such as [[Thomas Telford]], [[John Roebling]], and [[Robert Maillart]], among others, who wrote of the conscious way they attempted to create aesthetically pleasing, imaginative, and elegant structures, while meeting safety and serviceability requirements.  A theme uniting many of the foundational structural artists is that they either were builders themselves ([[John Roebling]]) or had a builder's mentality ([[Fazlur Khan]]). Other scholars of structural engineering design have published works that can be considered part of the body of knowledge on structural art. Notable among these is Alan Holgate &lt;ref name="The Art in Structural Design"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holgate|first=Alan|title=The Art in Structural Design|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The three S's and E's==
It is also said that a work of structural art should be interpreted in terms of the 'Three S's'; the scientific, social, and symbolic meaning:
*''Scientific'': How is the structure designed to safely transmit loads to the ground?  What materials are used, and how much is used? 
*''Social'': What were the short and long term costs of the structure to society? What role does the structure play in the functioning of society?
*''Symbolic'': What feelings does the structure inspire? What meaning does the structure carry for its users?

An example of three specific ideas related to the three S's are the 'Three E's'. A work of structural art must excel in efficiency, economy, and elegance, often referred to as the 'Three E's':
*''Efficiency'': The use of the minimum amount of material needed to ensure that the structure safely performs its function.
*''Economy'': Avoidance of excessive monetary cost in the design, construction, operating and decommissioning costs of a structure.  Economy should be evaluated in terms of the life-cycle cost of the structure whenever possible.
*''Elegance'': The structural form should be aesthetically pleasing, but should be defined and driven by engineering considerations.  Thus, an elegant design is not simply one that is pleasing, but one that arises from engineering creativity, satisfies the requirements of efficiency and economy, and is also pleasing.

Professor Billington has also put forth in his lectures that works of structural art involve imagination, inspiration, and innovation - though this categorization is not found in his formal writings.

==Structural artists and great works==
Some of the structural artists who essentially defined the art form by their own works include: [[Thomas Telford]], [[Gustav Eiffel]], [[John Roebling]], [[Othmar Ammann]], [[Robert Maillart]], [[Christian Menn]], [[Heinz Isler]], [[Fazlur Khan]], [[Felix Candela]], [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Eduardo Torroja]], [[Eladio Dieste]].  Some of the great works of structural art include: [[Menai Suspension Bridge|Menai Straits Bridge]], [[Craigellachie Bridge]], [[Eiffel Tower]], [[Brooklyn Bridge]], [[George Washington Bridge]], [[Verrazano Narrows Bridge]], [[Salginatobel Bridge]], [[Ganter Bridge]], [[Sicli Company Building]], [[John Hancock Center]], [[Los Manantiales Restaurant]] at Xochimilco, [[Palazzetto dello Sport|Little Sports Palace]].

==Contrast with architecture==
Structural art is distinct from architecture primarily in that the constraints under which structural artists practice are very different from those under which architects practice.  Structural artists, while seeking elegance, must satisfy safety and serviceability, efficiency and economy, and usage needs.  Architects are somewhat freer in making designs, constrained primarily by usage needs.

[[Eero Saarinen]]'s [[Gateway Arch]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]] provide a contrast that illustrates the difference between structural art and architecture.  The Gateway arch is widely thought to be a highly successful work of architecture, and the Eiffel Tower is recognized as a work of structural art.  Both structures must primarily resist wind loads yet have very different forms.  The Eiffel Tower has been shown to be the near optimal form for resisting wind loads,&lt;ref name="Eiffel Tower Form"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gallant|first1=J |year= 2002|title=The shape of the Eiffel Tower |journal= American Journal of Physics|volume=70 |issue= 2|pages= 160–162 |doi=10.1119/1.1417530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore is more in line with the ideals of structural art than architecture.  The Gateway Arch succeeds as a work of architecture and does not meet the ideals of efficiency and economy.

==Criticism and differing views of structural design==
Contemporary scholarly debate regarding the definition of structural art continues to develop and advance the concept.  Two areas in which such debate is occurring are the inclusion of a temporal aspect in the evaluation of structural art, and inclusion of the sustainability of a design. Regarding the temporal aspect, it has been argued that the time-dependent concept of a design process is missing from the conventional definition of structural art.&lt;ref name=building_the_19th_century&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Tom|title=Building the Nineteenth Century|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This feature of a design can arise particularly regarding construction, when economy of time is an important consideration. Though sustainability of a design is not explicitly included in the current definition of structural art, it can be argued that a design that succeeds in efficiency, economy, and elegance will be sustainable, provided that evaluations of the 'Three E's' consider life-cycle performance of the structure. Probably the most elaborated critique on structural art was given in&lt;ref name=towards_a_new_engineering&gt;{{cite book|last=Llunji|first=Mentor|title=Towards A New Engineering|year=2018|publisher=MSPROJECT}}&lt;/ref&gt; where widely accepted definition of structural art is considered counterproductive because imposes trivial limitations on developing real structural engineering
artistry.

{{Neoplatonism}}
'''''The Enneads''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐννεάδες}}), fully '''''The Six Enneads''''', is the collection of writings of [[Plotinus]], edited and compiled by his student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] ({{c.|{{sc|ad}}}}{{nbsp}}270). Plotinus was a student of [[Ammonius Saccas]] and they were founders of [[Neoplatonism]]. His work, through [[Augustine of Hippo]], the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and several subsequent Christian and Muslim thinkers, has greatly influenced Western and Near-Eastern thought.

==Contents==
Porphyry edited the writings of Plotinus in fifty-four [[treatise]]s, which vary greatly in length and number of chapters, mostly because he split original texts and joined others together to match this very number. Then, he proceeded to set the fifty-four treatises in groups of nine (Greek. ''ennea'') or ''Enneads''. He also collected ''The Enneads'' into three volumes. The first volume contained the first three ''Enneads'' (I, II, III), the second volume has the ''Fourth'' (IV) and the ''Fifth'' (V) ''Enneads'', and the last volume was devoted to the remaining ''Enneads''. After correcting and naming each treatise, Porphyry wrote a biography of his master, ''Life of Plotinus'', intended to be an Introduction to the ''Enneads''.

Porphyry's edition does not follow the chronological order in which ''Enneads'' were written (see ''Chronological Listing'' below), but responds to a plan of study which leads the learner from subjects related to his own affairs to subjects concerning the uttermost principles of the [[universe]].

Although not exclusively, Porphyry tells us (Cf. ''Life of Plotinus'', chapters.24-26) that the ''First Ennead'' deals with Human or ethical topics, the ''Second and Third Enneads '' are mostly devoted to cosmological subjects or physical reality, the ''Fourth'' concerns the Soul, the ''Fifth'' knowledge and intelligible reality, and finally the ''Sixth'' covers Being and what is above it, the One or first principle of all.

==Citing the ''Enneads''==
Since the publishing of a modern critical edition of the Greek text by P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer (''Plotini Opera''. 3 volumes. Paris-Bruxelles, 1951-1973) and the revised one (''Plotini Opera''. 3 volumes. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964-1984) there is an academic convention of citing the ''Enneads'' by first mentioning the number of ''Ennead'' (usually in Romans from I to VI), the number of treatise within each ''Ennead'' (in arabics from 1 to 9), the number of chapter (in arabics also), and the line(s) in one of the mentioned editions. These numbers are divided by periods, commas, or blank spaces.

E.g. For ''Fourth Ennead'' (IV), treatise number seven (7), chapter two (2), lines one to five (1-5), we write:

* IV.7.2.1-5

E.g. The following three mean ''Third Ennead'' (III), treatise number five (5), chapter nine (9), line eight (8):

* III, 5, 9, 8  
* 3,5,9,8
* III 5 9 8

It is important to remark that some translations or editions do not include the line numbers according to P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer's edition. In addition to this, the chronological order of the treatises is numbered between brackets or parentheses, and given below.

E.g.  For the previously given:

* IV.7 (2).2.1-5   since treatise IV.7 was the second written by Plotinus.
* III, 5 [50], 9, 8  since III.5 was the fiftieth written by Plotinus.

==Table of contents==

=== ''Plotinus's Original Chronological Order'' ===
The chronological listing is given by Porphyry (''Life of Plotinus'' 4–6). The first 21 treatises (through IV.1) had already been written when Porphyry met Plotinus, so they were not necessarily written in the order shown.

== Note on the ''Plotiniana Arabica'' or ''Arabic Plotinus''==
After the fall of [[Western Roman Empire]] and during the period of the [[Byzantine]] Empire, the authorship of some Plotinus' texts became clouded.
Many passages of ''Enneads'' IV-VI, now known as ''Plotiniana Arabica'', circulated among [[Islam]]ic scholars (as [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]) under the name ''[[The Theology of Aristotle]]'' or quoted as "''Sayings of an old [wise] man''".
The writings had a significant effect on [[Islamic philosophy]], due to Islamic interest in [[Aristotle]]. A Latin version of the so-called ''Theology'' appeared in Europe in 1519. (Cf. O'Meara, ''An Introduction the Enneads''. Oxford: 1995, 111ff.)

'''Timothy Williamson''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSE|FBA|size=100%|sep=,}} (born 6 August 1955) is a British [[philosopher]] whose main research interests are in [[philosophical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]].  He is the [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]], and fellow of [[New College, Oxford]]. 

== Education and career ==
Timothy Williamson's education began at [[Leighton Park School]] and continued at Henley Grammar School. He then went to [[Oxford University]]. He graduated in 1976 with a B.A. ([[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours]]) in Mathematics and Philosophy, and in 1981 with a doctorate in philosophy ([[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]]) for a thesis examining "The Concept of Approximation to the Truth".

Prior to taking up the Wykeham Professorship in 2000, Williamson was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1995–2000); fellow and lecturer in Philosophy at [[University College, Oxford]] (1988–1994); and lecturer in Philosophy at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (1980–1988). 

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 2004 to 2005.

He is a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1187 British Academy Fellowship record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606071216/https://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=1187 |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104|title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|access-date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (FRSE) and a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]].

== Philosophical work ==
Williamson has contributed to [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[philosophy of language]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].

On [[vagueness]], he holds a position known as [[epistemicism]], which states that every seemingly vague predicate (like "bald", or "thin") actually has a sharp cutoff, which is impossible for us to know. That is, there is some number of hairs such that anyone with that number is bald, and anyone with even one more hair is not. In actuality, this condition will be spelled out only partly in terms of numbers of hairs, but whatever measures are relevant will have some precise cutoff. This solution to the difficult [[sorites paradox]] was considered an astonishing and unacceptable consequence, but has become a relatively mainstream view since his defense of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=vagueness |title=Vagueness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson is fond of using the statement, "no one knows whether I am thin" to illustrate his view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.hku.hk/courses/old/laurencegoldstein/phil2511/lecture7.html Phil 2511: Paradoxes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], he suggests that the concept of [[knowledge]] is unanalyzable. This goes against the common trend in philosophical literature up to that point, which was to argue that knowledge could be analysed into constituent concepts. (Typically this would be [[justified true belief]] plus an extra factor.) He agrees that knowledge entails justification, truth and [[belief]], but argues that it is conceptually primitive. He accounts for the importance of belief by discussing its connections with knowledge, but avoids the disjunctivist position of saying that belief can be analyzed as the disjunction of knowledge with some distinct, non-[[fact]]ive mental state.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">A '''Warnier/Orr diagram''' (also known as a logical construction of a program/system) is a kind of [[hierarchical]] [[flowchart]] that allows the description of the organization of data and procedures. They were initially developed in [[France]] by [[Jean-Dominique Warnier]] and in the [[United States]] by [[Kenneth Orr]]. This method aids the design of program structures by identifying the output and processing results and then working backwards to determine the steps and combinations of input needed to produce them. The simple graphic method used in Warnier/Orr diagrams makes the levels in the system evident and the movement of the [[data]] between them vivid.

==Basic Elements==

Warnier/Orr diagrams show the processes and sequences in which they are performed. Each process is defined in a hierarchical manner i.e. it consists of sets of subprocesses, that define it. At each level, the process is shown in bracket that groups its components.

Since a process can have many different subprocesses, Warnier/Orr diagram uses a set of brackets to show each level of the system. Critical factors in s/w definition and development are iteration or repetition and alternation. Warnier/Orr diagrams show this very well.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

==Using Warnier/Orr diagrams==
To develop a Warnier/Orr diagram, the analyst works backwards, starting with systems output and using output oriented analysis. On paper, the development moves from the set to the element (from left to right) . First, the intended output or results of the processing are defined. At the next level, shown by inclusion with a bracket, the steps needed to produce the output are defined. Each step in turn is further defined. Additional brackets group the processes required to produce the result on the next level.

Warnier/Orr diagrams offer some distinct advantages to systems experts. They are simple in appearance and easy to understand. Yet they are powerful design tools. They have advantage of showing groupings of processes and the data that must be passed from level to level. In addition, the sequence of working backwards ensures that the system will be result oriented. This method is useful for both data and process definition. It can be used for each independently, or both can be combined on the same diagram.

==Constructs in Warnier/Orr diagrams==
There are four basic constructs used on Warnier/Orr diagrams: hierarchy, sequence, repetition, and alternation. There are also two slightly more advanced concepts that are occasionally needed: concurrency and recursion.

===Hierarchy===
Hierarchy is the most fundamental of all of the Warnier/Orr constructs. It is simply a nested group of sets and subsets shown as a set of nested brackets. Each bracket on the diagram (depending on how you represent it, the character is usually more like a brace "{" than a bracket "[", but we call them "brackets") represents one level of hierarchy. The hierarchy or structure that is represented on the diagram can show the organization of data or processing. However, both data and processing are never shown on the same diagram.

===Sequence===
Sequence is the simplest structure to show on a Warnier/Orr diagram. Within one level of hierarchy, the features listed are shown in the order in which they occur. In other words, the step listed first is the first that will be executed (if the diagram reflects a process), while the step listed last is the last that will be executed. Similarly with data, the data field listed first is the first that is encountered when looking at the data, the data field listed last is the final one encountered.

===Repetition===
Repetition is the representation of a classic "loop" in programming terms. It occurs whenever the same set of data occurs over and over again (for a data structure) or whenever the same group of actions is to occur over and over again (for a processing structure). Repetition is indicated by placing a set of numbers inside parentheses beneath the repeating set.

Typically there are two numbers listed in the parentheses, representing the fewest and the most number of times the set will repeat. By convention the first letter of the repeating set is the letter chosen to represent the maximum.

While the minimum bound and maximum bound can technically be anything, they are most often either "(1,n)" as in the example, or "(0,n)." When used to depict processing, the "(1,n)" repetition is classically known as a "DoUntil" loop, while the "(0,n)" repetition is called a "DoWhile" loop. On the Warnier/Orr diagram, however, there is no distinction between the two different types of repetition, other than the minimum bound value.

On occasion, the minimum and maximum bound are predefined and not likely to change: for instance the set "Day" occurs within the set "Month" from 28 to 31 times (since the smallest month has 28 days, the largest months, 31). This is not likely to change. And on occasion, the minimum and maximum are fixed at the same number.

In general, though, it is a bad idea to "[[hard code]]" a constant other than "0" or "1" in a number of times clause—the design should be flexible enough to allow for changes in the number of times without changes to the design. For instance, if a company has 38 employees at the time a design is done, hard coding a "38" as the "number of employees" within company would certainly not be as flexible as designing "(1,n)".

The number of times clause is always an operator attached to some set (i.e., the name of some bracket), and is never attached to an element (a diagram feature which does not decompose into smaller features). The reason for this will become more apparent as we continue to work with the diagrams. For now, you will have to accept this as a formation rule for a correct diagram.

===Alternation===
Alternation, or selection, is the traditional "decision" process whereby a determination is made to execute one process or another. The Exclusive OR symbol (the plus sign inside the circle) indicates that the sets immediately above and below it are mutually exclusive (if one is present the other is not). This diagram indicates that an Employee is either Management or Non-Management, one Employee cannot be both. It is also permissible to use a "negation bar" above an alternative in a manner similar to engineering notation. The bar is read by simply using the word "not".

Alternatives do not have to be binary as in the previous examples, but may be many-way alternatives.

===Concurrency===
Concurrency is one of the two advanced constructs used in the methodology. It is used whenever sequence is unimportant. For instance, years and weeks operate concurrently (or at the same time) within our calendar. The concurrency operator is rarely used in program design (since most languages do not support true concurrent processing anyway), but does come into play when resolving logical and physical data structure clashes.

===Recursion===
Recursion is the least used of the constructs. It is used to indicate that a set contains an earlier or a less ordered version of itself. In the classic "bill of materials" problem components contain parts and other sub-components. Sub-components also contain sub-sub-components, and so on. The doubled bracket indicates that the set is recursive. Data structures that are truly recursive are rather rare.

'''William Payne Alston''' (November 29, 1921 – September 13, 2009) was an American philosopher. He made influential contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[Christian philosophy]]. He earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] and taught at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Rutgers University]], [[University of Illinois]], and [[Syracuse University]].

==Early life and education==
Alston was born to Eunice Schoolfield and William Alston on November 29, 1921, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. He graduated from high school when he was 15 and went on to [[Centenary College of Louisiana]], graduating in 1942 with a [[Bachelor of Music]] in piano. During [[World War II]], he played [[clarinet]] and [[bass drum]] in a [[military band]] in California. During this time, he became interested in philosophy, sparked by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s book ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. After this, he engrossed himself in works by well-known philosophers such as [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Mortimer J. Adler]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Plato]], [[René Descartes]], and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref name="Shook2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|chapter=Alston, William Payne (1921– )|editor-last=Shook|editor-first=John R.|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/howardd/alston/alstonforthoemmes.pdf|volume=1|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-84371-037-0|pages=56–61|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged, he entered a graduate program for philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]], even though he had never formally taken a class on the subject.&lt;ref name="Syracuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SU"&gt;{{cite news|title=Emeritus professor of philosophy William Payne Alston dies|url=http://www.syr.edu/news/articles/2009/alston-09-09.html|newspaper=[[Syracuse University]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was there, he learned more about philosophy from [[Richard McKeon]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]], and he received his [[PhD]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Shook2005" /&gt;

==Career==
From 1949 until 1971, Alston was a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], and he became professor of philosophy in 1961.&lt;ref name="Marquette"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aquinas Lecture in Philosophy i|url=http://www.marquette.edu/mupress/Alston.shtml|publisher=[[Marquette University Press]]|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught at [[Rutgers University]] for five years, followed by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1976 to 1980 and then [[Syracuse University]] from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref name="Shook2005" /&gt;

His views on [[foundationalism]], [[internalism and externalism|internalism versus externalism]], [[illocutionary act|speech acts]], and the epistemic value of mystical experience, among many other topics, have been very influential. Like most contemporary American philosophers, Alston is counted among the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="OppyTrakakis2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Oppy|editor-first1=Graham|editorlink1=Graham Oppy|editor-last2=Trakakis|editor-first2=Nick|editorlink2=Nick Trakakis|title=History of Western Philosophy of Religion|url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/howardd/Alston%20in%20Acumen.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Acumen Publishing, Limited|isbn=978-1-84465-679-0|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], and [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]], Alston helped to found the journal ''[[Faith and Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref name="Plantinga2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|authorlink=Alvin Plantinga|title=In Memoriam: William J.

He was widely recognized as one of the core figures in the late twentieth-century revival of the [[philosophy of religion]].&lt;ref name="Centenary"&gt;{{cite news|title=William P.

==Death==
