The '''Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture &amp; Heritage''' (known colloquially as the '''ADACH''') was a statutory body in the [[United Arab Emirates]] that administered [[cultural heritage]] in the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abudhabiclassics.com/en/about/adach Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112825/http://www.abudhabiclassics.com/en/about/adach |date=December 24, 2013 }}, [http://www.abudhabiclassics.com/ Abu Dhabi Classics].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it merged into the [[Cultural_policy_in_Abu_Dhabi#The_Abu_Dhabi_Tourism_and_Culture_Authority_.28TCA.29|Abu Dhabi Tourism &amp; Culture Authority]]. 

==History of the uae==
The Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture &amp; Heritage (ADACH) was founded in 2006,&lt;ref name="i am a hacker and i have edited this"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeynep Aygen|title=International Heritage and Historic Building Conservation: Saving the World’s Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEa9Ryqf3CgC&amp;pg=PA144|date=5 March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-88814-1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to be the United Arab Emirate's solitary governing body for cultural heritage maintenance.&lt;ref name="Group2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oxford Business Group|title=The Report: Abu Dhabi 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ1OUwDYpgAC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1-907065-04-0|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Historic Buildings Division and the Archaeology Division were governed by the ADACH.&lt;ref name="i am a hacker and i have edited this" /&gt; The organization's headquarters was located in one of the oldest cultural heritage buildings in the city, near the [[Qasr al-Hosn]]. It had a theater, [[amphitheater]], and gallery.&lt;ref name=GAG/&gt;

===Initiatives===
It organized the representation of UAE at the 53rd [[Venice Biennale]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=UIU&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Dhabi - ADACH Platform|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/bien/venice_biennale/2009/tour/abu_dhabi|work=Venice Biennale 2009|publisher=Universes in Universe|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADACH also organized arts events in Abu Dhabi. They partnered with [[British Council]] in 2010 to present dancer [[Akram Khan (dancer)|Akram Khan]].&lt;ref name=Darwish&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwish|first=Reda|title=British Council and Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture &amp; Heritage: Akram Khan to Visit UAE|url=http://www.english.globalarabnetwork.com/201002174843/Entertainment/british-council-and-abu-dhabi-authority-for-culture-a-heritage-akram-khan-to-visit-uae.html|publisher=[[Global Arab Network]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ADACH partnered with the Western Region Development Council, the [[Union Defence Force (UAE)|Union Defence Force]], and the UAE Civil Services Department to offer [[scholarship]]s to people interested in [[Knowledge-based economy|knowledge-based economies]].&lt;ref name="Group2009"/&gt; As of 2010, the organization was suffering from "organizational and financial problems."&lt;ref name=GAG/&gt;

In 2011 it launched a preservation project to inventory and research the cultural heritage and life of those living in the region prior to modernization in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Chabbi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chabbi|first=Amel|author2=Hossam M.

It also maintained a [[historic preservation]] program for historic buildings in rural areas of the country.&lt;ref name="i am a hacker and i have edited this" /&gt; The organization also hosted the first [[WOMAD]] festival in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="BainesFill2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Baines|author2=Chris Fill|author3=Kelly Page|title=Essentials of Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwQKlZDGe_gC&amp;pg=PA300|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964650-0|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also held the first [[Abu Dhabi International Book Fair]] and [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]]s.

In February 2012, ADACH announced the creation of an extension location of the [[Al Ain National Museum]] and the preservation of the [[Hili Archaeological Park]] in [[Al Ain]]. The project aimed to show the cultural history of Al Ain outside the central city, and closer to the oasis' borders. The preservation of the park, included an interpretive center about the people and history of the site.&lt;ref name=PH1&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum and archaeological park for Abu Dhabi |url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/02/2012/museum-and-archaeological-park-for-abu-dhabi |work=News |publisher=Past Horizons |accessdate=21 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306220830/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/02/2012/museum-and-archaeological-park-for-abu-dhabi |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger and status today===
The [[Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority|Abu Dhabi Tourism &amp; Culture Authority]] was established and the ADACH was merged into it, in February 2012.&lt;ref name=ADG&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA)|url=https://www.abudhabi.ae/egovPoolPortal_WAR/appmanager/ADeGP/Citizen?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=p_citizen_departments&amp;lang=en&amp;did=756|work=Departments|publisher=Abu Dhabi Government|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was required by [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], with the goal of having one organization govern all aspects of [[tourism]].&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Jen|title=New tourism authority to replace two agencies for Abu Dhabi|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/travel-tourism/new-tourism-authority-to-replace-two-agencies-for-abu-dhabi|work=Business|publisher=The National|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon merger, the WOMAD and Sounds of Arabia festivals, along with the Abu Dhabi Classics concerts were canceled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''Aramaic studies''' is the study of the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac Christianity]]. A specialist in Aramaic studies is known as a '''Aramaicist'''. British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by the designation Syriacist (a scholar of [[Syriac studies]], at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

Aramaic studies is the term used at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Leiden]], and [[University of Detroit Mercy]]. At some other universities, Aramaic studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], as [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. Aramaic studies (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.

Aramaic academic journals include the annual ''Aramaic Studies'', a leading journal for Aramaic language and literature published by Brill Academic Publishers. The journal incorporates the previous ''Journal for the Aramaic Bible'' for a more inclusive scope, to include all aspects of Aramaic language and literature, even when not, or only indirectly, related to Biblical texts.

The Azerbaijan Teachers` Institute ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Müəllimlər İnstitutu}}) is a higher educational institution that provides training, retraining and advanced training of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Sosiety/_Education/education_02_e.html|title=EDUCATION REFORMS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since 1920, the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] has organized short courses (duration:2-6 months) for school teachers. In those years the Commissariat decided to create home pedagogical technical schools. Such technical schools established in which 1500 teachers were involved were established in 1927 with the purpose of training teachers with secondary special education. 

On October 1, 1929, in accordance with the Decision of the Board of the Branch of [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of the Azerbaijan SSR dated July 13, 1929, the Azerbaijan Institute of Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was opened. The Institute included home pedagogical technical schools, a former pedagogical faculty, and correspondence methodical courses. Initially, the Institute was engaged only in the retraining of pedagogical personnel, which were conducted through correspondence and short-term courses. The retraining was covered by educators of all categories.

In 1939, the Institute for Advanced Studies of the Personnel of Public Education was replaced by the Republican Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers.

In 1972, it also was reorganized into the Azerbaijan Central Institute for Advanced Studies of Teachers. In order to improve the system of advanced training of the public education employees by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR No. 398 dated October 4, 1989, the Azerbaijan Central Institute of Advanced Training for Teachers was reorganized into the Institute of Advanced Training and Retraining of Teachers. It was given the status of higher education I category. The Institute moved to the cathedral system, faculties were organized for the implementation of work on advanced training.

In 2000, by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan No. 349, the Azerbaijan Institute of Teachers was established with 12 branches in the Nakhichevan, Ganja, Sumgait, [[Mingachevir|Mingechevir]], [[Qazakh District|Gazakh]], [[Shamakhi]], [[Quba]], [[Salyan, Azerbaijan|Salyan]], [[Cəlilabad|Jalilabad]], [[Ağcabədi|Agjabedi]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]], [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.azvision.az/news/21978/ilham-aliyev-attends-opening-of-azerbaijan-teachers-institute.html|title=Ilham Aliyev attends opening of Azerbaijan Teachers Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with a training and advisory center in Lankaran. In a short time, the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] branch has become an independent Institution of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beic.az/education_azerbaijan/azerbaijan_teachers_institute.html|title=Azerbaijan Teachers’ Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nakhchivan.preslib.az/en_c2.html|title=The higher schools in Nakhchivan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capping stunts have a long tradition in New Zealand, and are a prominent event at and around campuses throughout the country with many notable instances reaching national or local headlines.

The stunts commonly play on the accepted civil rules of the host city with the local city councils or media as the target. The capping stunts that generate the most media exposure generally involve passive techniques such as letter writing;  however, material pranks such as the suspension of [[inflatable]] [[genitals]] from university property are common.

A frequently referenced stunt is the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] stunt where local [[Roadworks|workmen]] were told students dressed as [[police]] were planning a fake arrest, while local police were told students dressed as workmen were planning to dig up the road.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, David (21 October 2006). "[http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2006/10/student_pranks.html Student pranks]". ''Kiwiblog''.&lt;/ref&gt; This stunt encompasses all key elements.

Capping stunts are also carried out in revenge.  For example, in 1952 [[University of Otago]] students, tired of being misrepresented by the [[Otago Daily Times]], perpetrated a nationwide [[UFO]] hoax in order to display the shortcomings of the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.skeptics.org.nz/download/flyufo.pdf UFOs and aliens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428221732/http://www.skeptics.org.nz/download/flyufo.pdf |date=28 April 2006 }}". skeptics.org.nz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally capping stunts will prey on other students, particularly those in their first year of study. In May 2004 a [[Massey University]] stunt involved staging auditions for extras in [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''. After advertising the auditions in the [[student newspaper]], over 200 students auditioned for a part. Each signed a disclaimer which included "I also understand that TheatreRecruitment does not guarantee part in any movie, but will endeavor to act in the best interests of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;"King Kong comes to Massey!!!". ''Chaff'' Vol 70, Issue 11, 17 May 2004, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable recent suspected capping stunt was the [[Waiheke Island]] [[foot and mouth disease]] threat of May 2005, which was suspected to be a stunt by [[Massey University]] in [[Palmerston North]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/default.asp?id=50450&amp;c=w Virus release a capping stunt?]" (from the nzcity.co.nz website, 11 May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; A letter was sent to [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] stating that the disease had been released onto the island. Police said that the letter came from the [[Manawatu]] Region, and coincided with graduation week.&lt;ref name="Dom"&gt;"Foot and mouth scare". ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', 12 May 2005, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">The '''Centre for Manx Studies''' ({{lang-gv|Laare-Studeyrys Manninagh}}) is a department of the School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology in the [[University of Liverpool]] whose focus is the study of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Manx language]], and Manx culture and history.

The primary functions of the Centre for Manx Studies are: to teach undergraduate and postgraduate students; to carry out archaeological, cultural, environmental and historical research of international significance on the Isle of Man; to further the international recognition of the Isle of Man in these subjects. In addition to postgraduate research degrees, the Centre offers a full-time and a part-time master's degree in Manx Studies and a full-time Diploma in Manx Studies.

Founded in 1992, the Centre for Manx Studies was managed by a committee which included representatives from the three partner organizations: the University of Liverpool, the [[Isle of Man Department of Education]], and [[Manx National Heritage]]. Originally located near the Manx Museum in the Manx capital city of [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], the Centre for Manx Studies relocated in September 2009 to a newly refurbished stable block at [[the Nunnery, Douglas|the Nunnery]] estate south of Douglas.

In July 2015 the Centre for Manx Studies moved its base off the Isle of Man to the University of Liverpool's main campus: announcing this measure in April 2015, Fiona Beveridge - executive pro-vice-chancellor for Humanities and Social Sciences - stated: "Given the withdrawal of support by the Manx Government, we have decided that we can no longer sustain the Centre on the Isle of Man. We remain committed to high quality archaeological research across the UK and Ireland and our work in this area on the Isle of Man, for example on Iron Age settlements and WW1 sites, will continue. The Isle of Man is an excellent base to teach archaeological techniques to students and we will continue to undertake field school activities on the island." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2015/04/07/centre-for-manx-studies-to-move-to-liverpool/|title=Centre for Manx Studies to move to Liverpool - News - University of Liverpool|website=news.liverpool.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Capitán Prat''''' was a unique ironclad [[battleship]] of the [[Chilean Navy]] built in the late 1880s and completed in 1890. Armed with a main battery of four {{convert|9.4|in|abbr=on}} guns in four single turrets, ''Capitán Prat'' was the first battleship in the world to be equipped with an electrical system. She was built in the [[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée|La Seyne]] dockyard in France, and commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891. Foreign navies tried to purchase the ship twice before the outbreak of wars, including an American attempt in 1898 and a Japanese offer in 1903.

''Capitán Prat'' served in the fleet for about ten years, until she was disarmed in accordance with a treaty signed with Argentina intended to stop a naval arms race between the two countries. The ship returned to service, however, and remained on active duty with the fleet until 1926, when she was reduced to a coastal defense ship. In 1928&amp;ndash;1930, she was used as a [[submarine tender]], and in 1935, she was disarmed and used as a [[training ship]] for engineers. She remained in the Navy's inventory until 1942, when she was sold for scrap.

==Design==
[[File:Capitan Prat line-drawing.png|thumb|left|Line-drawing showing the disposition of the armament and the extent of the armored belt]]
''Capitán Prat'' was {{convert|328|ft}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a beam of {{convert|60|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|6901|MT|sp=us}} and had a draft of {{convert|22|ft|10|in|abbr=on}}. Her hull was steel-built, with wood and [[copper sheathing]], and was equipped with a [[naval ram|ram bow]]. The ship mounted two masts, both with [[fighting top]]s. She had a crew of 480 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name=M86/&gt;

She was powered by a pair of horizontal expansion engines that were supplied with steam by five cylindrical boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels on the centerline. Her propulsion system was rated at {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|18.3|kn|abbr=on}}. She was designed to carry {{convert|400|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, though she could carry up to {{convert|1100|MT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Conways&gt;Gardiner, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M86&gt;Miller, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first battleship of any navy to utilize electricity to power machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|9.4|in|abbr=on}}/35 [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns in single, electrically powered [[gun turret|turrets]]. One was placed forward, on the centerline, two were mounted [[amidships]], and the fourth was located aft of the [[superstructure]] on the centerline. Her secondary battery consisted of eight {{convert|4.7|in|abbr=on}} guns in four twin turrets; they were mounted on either side of the foremast and mainmast. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by a battery of six [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder guns]], four [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder guns]], and ten 1-pounder guns. She was also armed with four {{convert|18|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s in deck-mounted launchers. One was in the bow, another in the stern, and two on the broadside.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;

The ship's armor consisted of [[Schneider Electric|Creusot]] steel. Her [[armored belt]] was {{convert|11.8|in|abbr=on}} thick amidships above the waterline, and {{convert|7.8|in|abbr=on}} below.  Above the waterline, the belt was reduced to {{convert|4.9|in|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=on}} aft. The belt was {{convert|3.9|in|abbr=on}} below the waterline, on either end of the ship. The belt extended for {{convert|2|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} above the waterline and {{convert|4|ft|7|in|abbr=on}} below. The citadel was {{convert|3.1|in|abbr=on}} thick and protected the ship's machinery spaces amidships. It extended to the upper deck and was closed on either ends by bulkheads {{convert|3.1|in|abbr=on}} thick. Outside the citadel, the deck was protected by {{convert|2|in|abbr=on}} thick armor. The [[barbette]]s for the main battery guns were {{convert|8|to|10.8|in|abbr=on}} thick, with {{convert|2|in|abbr=on}} thick hoods to protect the gun crews. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10.5|in|abbr=on}} thick sides.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;

==Service history==
[[File:Chilean battleship Capitán Prat.png|thumb|Illustration of ''Capitán Prat'' in 1893|left]]
On 22 August 1887, the [[National Congress of Chile]] passed a law authorizing the construction of new vessels to modernize the fleet. As part of this, they decided to order a new battleship from a foreign shipyard.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unidades"&gt;"Crucero Acorazado Capitán Prat (2do)", ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for constructing the new Chilean battleship was advertised throughout the European shipyards, and was sought by British, German, and French shipbuilders.&lt;ref&gt;Ropp, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for ''Capitán Prat'' was awarded to the ''[[Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée]]'' shipyard in [[La Seyne]], France on 18 April 1889. The cost of the ship was agreed at £391,000,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and she was laid down in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was launched on 20 December 1890, commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891, and arrived in Chile in May 1893.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name=M86/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unidades"/&gt; ''Capitán Prat'' received favorable reviews from contemporary naval critics, as she was seen as a prime example of combining a high speed with good armament and armor protection.&lt;ref&gt;"Chile," p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also heralded as "the most powerful war ship possessed by any South American Government {{sic}} ... [and] any vessel at present in commission in the United States Navy."&lt;ref name="Pride"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1894/04/15/archives/pride-of-the-chilean-navy-the-twomilliondollar-ironclad-capital.html |title=Pride of the Chilean Navy |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 April 1894 |subscription=yes |accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the ship helped begin [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|a naval arms race]] between Chile and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Capitán Prat'', the Chilean Navy ordered two new [[protected cruiser]]s and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s. Argentina responded with the battleships {{ship|ARA|Independencia|1891|2}} and {{ship|ARA|Libertad|1890|2}}. The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive [[1891 Chilean Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 45–49, 297–98, 347&lt;/ref&gt; The race culminated in the orders for two [[armored cruiser]]s for the Argentine Navy and two {{sclass-|Constitución|battleship|2}}s for the Chilean Navy, though the latter two were purchased by the United Kingdom. The British, concerned over the possibility of war between the two countries, mediated an agreement, which resulted in the [[Pactos de Mayo]]. The treaty ended the expensive arms race and stipulated that both countries arrive at an agreement to balance their fleets. The latter led to the [[demilitarization]] of ''Capitán Prat'' and two Argentine armored cruisers, though all were later rearmed.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, pp. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Treaty of Arbitration", 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ostasiengeschwader Graf Spee in Chile.jpg|thumb|right|The [[German East Asia Squadron]] in Valparaiso in November 1914; ''Capitán Prat'' is at extreme right]]
In March 1898, shortly before the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[US Navy]] attempted to purchase ''Capitán Prat'' to bolster its fleet for the coming conflict with Spain. The negotiations fell through, however, and the ship remained in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, in the prelude to the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the Japanese government looked into purchasing ''Capitán Prat'' and the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Izumi|''Esmeralda'']], along with other South American warships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1903/12/27/archives/japan-wants-more-ships-negotiating-for-the-purchase-of-chilean-war.html |title=Japan Wants More Ships |work=New York Times |date=27 December 1903 |accessdate=28 June 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esmeralda'' was eventually purchased and commissioned into the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] as ''Izumi''.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt; By 1907, the ship was seen as outmoded in comparison to newer armored cruisers in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, pp. 337–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909–1910, the ship was modernized, which included the installation of twelve new [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[watertube boiler]]s in place of the old cylindrical boilers, increasing the ship's top speed to {{convert|19.5|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. The height of her funnels was also increased.&lt;ref name=Conways/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unidades"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1916, ''Capitán Prat'' suffered a magazine explosion while she was anchored in port in [[Valparaiso]]. Two cases of bad [[cordite]] [[propellant]] in the aft main battery magazine exploded. The construction of the ship, however, which provided a quick venting of the explosion, and defects in the propellant cases that allowed the explosive gasses to escape easily, saved the ship from destruction. The cordite was by that time 17 to 20 years old, about the maximum life-span of the propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/thist24.htm |title=Explosions in Warships During the War |author=Technical History Section, Admiralty |date=October 1919 |work=The Technical History and Index, Volume 2, Part 24 "Storage and Handling of Explosives in Warships" |publisher= |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1926, ''Capitán Prat'' was reduced to a coast defense ship. From 1928 to 1930, the ship was designated as a [[submarine tender]] for Chile's [[British H-class submarine|H]] and {{sclass-|Capitan O'Brien|submarine (1928)|0}} submarines. She was disarmed in 1935 to serve with the mechanical training school. The old battleship was ultimately sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="Unidades"/&gt;

A '''collection manager''' ensures the proper care and preservation of objects within [[cultural institutions]] such as [[museums]], [[libraries]], and [[archives]]. Collection managers, along with [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curators]], and [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], play an important role in [[collections care]].  Collection Managers and Registrars are two distinct collection roles that are often combined into one within small to mid-size cultural institutions. Collection Managers can be found in large museums and those with a [[history]] and [[natural history]]
focus whose diverse collections require experienced assessment to properly sort, catalog, and store artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection manager may oversee the registrar, archivist, curator, photographer, or other collection professionals, and may assume the responsibilities of these roles in their absence within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R., Gilmore, J., ed. (2010). Museum Registration Methods (5 ed.). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between collection managers and registrars==
Collection managers are responsible for the long-term preservation of collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Becky|title=Museum Mondays-What is a Collections Manager?|url=http://thestillroomblog.com/2012/04/23/museum-monday-what-is-a-collections-manager/|work=The Still Room|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They oversee the physical care of objects and form the hands-on problem-solving component of a collections team. Collection managers work collaboratively with registrars, who are document-oriented and responsible for risk management of the collection. 
Registrars maintain facility reports, contracts, and legal records associated with acquisitions, inventory, incoming and outgoing loans, shipping, and insurance. They must keep current with national and international regulations and procedures as they work with custom agents and brokers to acquire security, custom permits, insurance coverage, government indemnity, and requests for immunity from judicial seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|work=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities and duties==
[[File:Storage Gallery.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Storage of Peruvian ceramics at the [[Larco Museum]]]]
Collection managers work in cooperation with curators, registrars, conservators, art handlers, exhibit fabricators, mount makers, facilities managers, security, and housekeeping. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining high standards of collections care, from acquisition to conservation to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Manager|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/careers/9914|work=Museums Association|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution, collection managers may by tasked with drawing up a departmental budget, providing expenditure projections, and if necessary, raising funds in the form of grant writing.

* '''Acquisition''': During acquisition consideration, the collection manager must research the object, determine its fit within the collection, ensure there are available resources for its care, and in the absence of a registrar, establish the object's [[provenance]]. Once acquired, the collection manager begins the accession process by carefully examining the object and classifying it based on the institution's specific guidelines. [[Categorization|Classification]] terms are drawn from an ordered system of categories and can vary from one institution to another. The purpose of classification is to provide order within a collection by grouping objects with similar characteristics such as form, shape, material, function, use, or social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class|url=http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/parttwo_chapter7.html|work=Cataloging Cultural Objects Part 2: Chapter 7|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object is then given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|identifying number]], tying it to all related records. Next, the object is carefully measured, photographed, and described in a detailed condition report.  
* '''Object Care''': Proper [[collections care]], or preventative conservation, is imperative to the welfare of objects by avoiding and minimizing deterioration and loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventative Conservation|url=http://www.icom-cc.org/36/working-groups/preventive-conservation/|work=International Council of Museums-Committee for Conservation|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers are responsible for proper object handling and for instructing/supervising other staff members, researchers, interns, and volunteers on proper procedures. They monitor the condition and environment of objects in storage and on exhibit,  rotating sensitive objects off exhibit as needed. Collection managers clean and stabilize objects, select appropriate archival supplies, prepare objects for storage and exhibition, and pack and label objects for loan. Collection managers also design and prepare exhibit mounts for delicate objects on display and in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fruth|first=Marth|title=A Primer on Museum Collection Management|url=http://www.ohiolha.org/how-tos/a-primer-on-museum-collection-management/|work=Ohio Local History Alliance|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to best utilize storage space, collection managers may need to rehouse and relocate objects within and between museum facilities while closely tracking and documenting all object movement.
* '''Inventory''': A key responsibility of collection managers is performing a detailed inventory of all items in their collection.&lt;ref name="Brunot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunot|first=Trudy|title=Job Description of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://work.chron.com/job-description-museum-collections-manager-18372.html|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution's collection management policy, a complete inventory can be taken every 5–10 years, with spot inventories performed annually. 
* '''Exhibition''': At the request of curators or borrowing institutions, the collection manager retrieves objects from storage and examines them for potential exhibition or loan consideration. After close examination and comparison with prior condition reports, a determination is made regarding the object's current condition, fragility level, special exhibition or shipping requirements, and/or need for conservation. Once objects have been cleared for exhibition or loan, the collection manager cleans and stabilizes them and ensures their safety by monitoring and/or assisting with the exhibit installation and deinstallation. Collection managers may also be tasked with interpretation and case selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Manager/Registrar|url=http://berkshiremuseum.org/collections-managerregistrar/|work=Berkshire Museum|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
* '''Database Management''': Collection managers are responsible for documenting object information into their institution's database management system. The proper input and maintenance of this information is imperative. According to the National Park Service, "the information on the catalog records may be as important as the items themselves." &lt;ref name="NPS, 3:1"&gt;{{cite book|last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 3: Cataloging"|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2ch3.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum amount of information entered into the database should be catalog number, accession number, nature of accession (e.g. gift, purchase), provenance, object name, classification, materials, dimensions, condition, and current location.  Institutions utilize the catalog information to manage their collections, facilitate interdepartmental communications, and make collections available to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Systems: Museums and the Web 2011|url=http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/04/07/collection-management-systems-museums-and-the-web-2011/|work=Institute for Dynaic Educational Advancement|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum Collection Management Software is determined by the size, collection type, and budget of the institution.
*  '''Environmental Control''': Dust, pests, light exposure, extremes and/or fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity can adversely affect objects. The collection manager, in conjunction with the facilities manager, is responsible for monitoring environmental controls, establishing and maintaining an [[integrated pest management]] system, coordinating a housekeeping routine, and ensuring the security of all objects within the building.
* '''Collection Management Policy''': Collection managers assist with  writing and updating [[collections policy|collection care policies]]. An institution's collection is its greatest asset. As such, they have a legal, ethical, and fiduciary obligation to provide for its safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Policies (CMP)|url=http://www.spencerart.ku.edu/collection/collection_management_policies.pdf|work=Spencer Art Museum|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Collection management policy is a detailed, written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malaro|first=Marie|title=A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection management policy guides an institution's decision making and covers a range of topics including collection goals, methods of acquisition and disposal of objects, incoming/outgoing loan policies, care, control, and access to objects, insurance procedures, and record keeping. Some institutions also assign [[emergency management]] (disaster planning) responsibility to collection managers.&lt;ref name="Brunot"/&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
There are specific skills, abilities, and areas of knowledge necessary for collection managers. All collection managers must be skilled in object handling, able to accurately identify objects, artifacts, and specimens within their institution's collection, and have knowledge of preventative conservation methods and procedures. It is essential that collection managers are educated about the organization, arrangement, and nomenclature of objects, artifacts, and specimens in their field of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|pages=75–76|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers also need to be knowledgeable about collection management software for cataloging and record keeping.

==Education and training (experience)==
Most institutions require collection managers to have an undergraduate degree in their specialty area such as art, history, or archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seversen|first=Dana|title=The Salary of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/salary-museum-collections-manager-15479.html|work=Global Post|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, from 2012 - 2022 archivists, curators, and museum workers "should expect very strong competition for jobs" with a projected growth rate of only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archivists, Curators, and Museum Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/curators-museum-technicians-and-conservators.htm|work=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this competitive field, a master's degree in the institution's area of focus, museum studies, or library/information science is preferred.

Internships and volunteer work in libraries, museums, and archives is the best way to acquire hands-on collection management experience. Whether paid or unpaid, experience with object/artifact handling, processing, cataloging, preservation, packing, storage, inventory, fabrication, and collection management software is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlatter|first=N. Elizabeth|title=Museum Careers|date=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-1-59874-044-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience or training in conservation would be an added bonus, especially to small museums with limited resources.

==Professional organizations==
There are numerous professional organizations of interest to collection managers and other museum professionals. These organizations provide opportunities to network, share information, and participate in continuing education.

The '''Faculty of Natural Sciences''' ('''FNS''') ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Prírodovedecká Fakulta'' (PriF UK)) is a [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] of the [[Comenius University in Bratislava]].

== History ==
Efforts to establish the Faculty of Natural Sciences in Slovakia during the [[interwar period]] were not successful. After split of the Czechoslovakia into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] and disposal of Czech higher education, Slovak students had no more science colleges available. The Natural Sciences Faculty of Slovak University (former name of Comenius University in Bratislava) was founded in 1940 and education in the first [[semester]] started in autumn 1940/1941. Faculty become independent from the Faculty philosophy of the then Slovak University, where some science subjects were previously taught. The first Dean was the [[František Valentin]]. From the beginning it consisted of Botanical and Geographical institute, the institute also Zoology and Comparative Anatomy. Several subjects as [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], were taught in the lecture hall of [[Slovak technical college]].&lt;ref&gt;Veľký, J. a kolektív, 1980, ''Encyklopédia Slovenska IV. zväzok N - Q.'' Veda, Bratislava, 595 pp. (In Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1941 Geological Institute was added. A year later Mineralogical and Petrographic Institute was established. Both working in makeshift conditions without sufficient qualified staff. In the winter semester of 1942/1943 Institute of Nuclear Physics was added to the faculty and in 1944, Astronomical Institute and Institute of Mathematics were established. Only science without a separate department until 1948 was the chemistry. In the 1950 former institutes were organized into the departments. In 1980, [[Comenius University, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]] was separated from the Natural Sciences Faculty.

== Campus ==
Individual departments were formerly housed in several buildings in the center of Bratislava. From 1960s to 1987 five [[pavilion]] complex was built in the [[Mlynská dolina|Mlynská Dolina Valley]] in the [[Bratislava]] for purposes of the Faculty. Apart from them, faculty has buildings of the Botanical garden, Department of Botany and a Biological research station at [[Šúr]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12156">'''Conceptual clustering''' is a [[machine learning]] paradigm for [[unsupervised classification]] developed mainly during the 1980s.  It is distinguished from ordinary [[cluster analysis|data clustering]] by generating a '''concept description''' for each generated class.  Most conceptual clustering methods are capable of generating hierarchical category structures;  see [[Categorization]] for more information on hierarchy.  Conceptual clustering is closely related to [[formal concept analysis]], [[decision tree learning]], and [[mixture model]] learning.

== Conceptual clustering vs. data clustering ==
Conceptual clustering is obviously closely related to data clustering; however, in conceptual clustering it is not only the inherent structure of the data that drives cluster formation, but also the [[Specification and Description Language|Description language]] which is available to the learner.  Thus, a statistically strong grouping in the data may fail to be extracted by the learner if the prevailing concept description language is incapable of describing that particular ''regularity''.  In most implementations, the description language has been limited to feature [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], although in COBWEB (see "[[#Example: A basic conceptual clustering algorithm, COBWEB|COBWEB]]" below), the feature language is [[probabilistic]].

== List of published algorithms ==
A fair number of algorithms have been proposed for conceptual clustering. Some examples are given below:

* CLUSTER/2 (Michalski &amp; Stepp 1983)
* [[Cobweb (clustering)|COBWEB]] (Fisher 1987)
* CYRUS (Kolodner 1983)
* GALOIS (Carpineto &amp; Romano 1993), 
* GCF (Talavera &amp; Béjar 2001)
* INC (Hadzikadic &amp; Yun 1989)
* ITERATE (Biswas, Weinberg &amp; Fisher 1998), 
* LABYRINTH (Thompson &amp; Langley 1989)
* SUBDUE (Jonyer, Cook &amp; Holder 2001). 
* UNIMEM (Lebowitz 1987)
* WITT (Hanson &amp; Bauer 1989),

More general discussions and reviews of conceptual clustering can be found in the following publications:

* Michalski (1980)
* Gennari, Langley, &amp; Fisher (1989)
* Fisher &amp; Pazzani (1991)
* Fisher &amp; Langley (1986)
* Stepp &amp; Michalski (1986)

== Example: A basic conceptual clustering algorithm==
This section discusses the rudiments of the conceptual clustering algorithm COBWEB.  There are many other algorithms using different heuristics and "[[category goodness]]" or category evaluation criteria, but COBWEB is one of the best known.  The reader is referred to the [[#References|bibliography]] for other methods.

===Knowledge representation===
The COBWEB data structure is a hierarchy (tree) wherein each node represents a given ''concept''.  Each concept represents a set (actually, a [[multiset]] or bag) of  objects, each object being represented as a binary-valued property list. The data associated with each tree node (i.e., concept) are the integer property counts for the objects in that concept.  For example, (see figure), let a concept &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; contain the following four objects (repeated objects being permitted). 
[[File:Concept tree.png|thumb|450 px|Sample COBWEB knowledge representation,  probabilistic concept hierarchy.  Blue boxes list actual objects, purple boxes list attribute counts.  See text for details. '''Note''': The diagram is intended to be illustrative only of COBWEB's data structure; it does not necessarily represent a "good" concept tree, or one  that COBWEB would actually construct from real data.]]
#&lt;code&gt;[1 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;[0 1 1]&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;[0 1 0]&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;[0 1 1]&lt;/code&gt;
The three properties might be, for example, &lt;code&gt;[is_male, has_wings, is_nocturnal]&lt;/code&gt;.  Then what is stored at this concept node is the property count &lt;code&gt;[1 3 3]&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that 1 of the objects in the concept is male, 3 of the objects have wings, and 3 of the objects are nocturnal.  The concept ''description'' is the category-conditional probability (likelihood) of the properties at the node.  Thus, given that an object is a member of category (concept) &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood that it is male is &lt;math&gt;1/4 = 0.25&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, the likelihood that the object has wings and  likelihood that the object is nocturnal  or both is &lt;math&gt; 3/4 = 0.75&lt;/math&gt;.  The concept description can therefore simply be given as &lt;code&gt;[.25 .75 .75]&lt;/code&gt;, which corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;-conditional feature likelihood, i.e., &lt;math&gt;p(x|C_1) = (0.25, 0.75, 0.75)&lt;/math&gt;.

The figure to the right shows a concept tree with five concepts.  &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;  is the root concept, which contains all ten objects in the data set.  Concepts &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are the children of &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;, the former containing four objects, and the later containing six objects.  Concept &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is also the parent of concepts &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_4&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_5&lt;/math&gt;, which contain three, two, and one object, respectively.  Note that each parent node (relative superordinate concept) contains all the objects contained by its child nodes (relative subordinate concepts).  In Fisher's (1987) description of COBWEB, he indicates that only the total attribute counts (not conditional probabilities, and not object lists) are stored at the nodes.  Any probabilities are computed from the attribute counts as needed.

====The COBWEB language====
The description language of COBWEB is a "language" only in a loose sense, because being fully probabilistic it is capable of describing any concept.  However, if constraints are placed on the probability ranges which concepts may represent, then a stronger language is obtained.  For example,  we might permit only concepts wherein at least one probability differs from 0.5 by more than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Under this constraint, with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.3&lt;/math&gt;, a concept such as &lt;code&gt;[.6 .5 .7]&lt;/code&gt; could not be constructed by the learner;  however a concept such as &lt;code&gt;[.6 .5 .9]&lt;/code&gt; would be accessible because at least one probability differs from 0.5 by more than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, under constraints such as these, we obtain something like a traditional concept language.  In the limiting case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.5&lt;/math&gt; for every feature, and thus every probability in a concept must be 0 or 1, the result is a feature language base on conjunction; that is, every concept that can be represented can then be described as a conjunction of features (and their negations), and concepts that cannot be described in this way cannot be represented.

===Evaluation criterion===
In Fisher's (1987) description of COBWEB, the measure he uses to evaluate the quality of the hierarchy is Gluck and Corter's (1985) [[category utility]] (CU) measure, which he re-derives in his paper.   The motivation for the measure is highly similar to the "[[information gain]]" measure introduced by Quinlan for decision tree learning.  It has previously been shown that the CU for feature-based classification  is the same as the [[mutual information]]  between the feature variables and the class variable (Gluck &amp; Corter, 1985; Corter &amp; Gluck, 1992), and since this measure is much better known, we proceed here with mutual information as the measure of category "goodness".

What we wish to evaluate is the overall utility of grouping the objects into a particular hierarchical categorization structure.  Given a set of possible classification structures, we need to determine whether one is better than another.

'''Cornell University Programming Language''' (also called '''CUPL''') is a procedural computer programming language developed at [[Cornell University]] in the late 1960s.

CUPL was based on an earlier Cornell-developed programming language, [[CORC]].  It was used to teach introductory computer programming classes.

CUPL was developed by R. W. Conway, W. L. Maxwell, G. Blomgren, Howard Elder, H. Morgan, C. Pottle, W. Riddle, and Robert Walker.  CUPL had a very simple syntax similar to [[BASIC]] and to [[PL/I]]. The processor was designed to offer extensive error correction and diagnostic capabilities.  This would allow student programs to execute even if they contained minor syntax errors.  The compiler also included spelling correction capabilities so that if a variable name is referenced only once, the compiler would assume that it was a misspelling of some other intended name.

CUPL also offered an extensive set of matrix operations and offered dynamic run-time memory allocation.  At the time, Cornell's computer was an IBM System 360 Model 40 with only 64K of core memory.  CUPL was able to process a large batch of student programs quickly by remaining resident in core memory, but the compiler occupied 58K of memory, leaving only a small amount for the program code and variable storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/5881|title=CUPL - An Approach to Introductory Computing Instruction|page=19|date=January 1968|publisher=Computer Science Technical Reports (68-4)|accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative projects==
Additional computer language projects grew out of CUPL.  Most notably, the CUPL compiler was reworked to implement a subset of the PL/I programming language, called [[PL/C]].  PL/C retained the diagnostic and error correction features of CUPL.  Audio CUPL was an implementation to accept verbal CUPL statements spoken by the programmer.  Each programmer trained the system by first speaking a standard set of CUPL vocabulary words for reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|hdl=1813/5896|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813/5896|title=On the Feasibility of Voice Input to an On-Line Computer Processing System|date=July 1969|publisher=Computer Science Technical Reports (69-38)|accessdate = 2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
After that what is pl/c

== Retrocomputing implementation ==
There is an implementation of CUPL and CORC in modern C for Unix-like systems that includes both transcriptions of the original manuals and a chrestomathy of programs in these languages.  It is available at the [http://www.catb.org/retro/ Retrocomputing Museum].

'''Education in [[Albania]]''' for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels are mostly supported by the state. The academic year is much similar to that as in the United States, clases starts almost in September or October and end in June or July. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is the language of instruction in all public schools. The education takes place in three stages such as the primary, secondary, and pre-university education.&lt;ref name="Epnuffic"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Albanian education system described and compared with the Dutch system|url=https://www.epnuffic.nl/en/publications/find-a-publication/education-system-albania.pdf|website=epnuffic.nl|language=English|format=PDF|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are about 5000 schools throughout the nation.

Elementary [[education]] is compulsory from grades 1 to 9, but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass the graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and also at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education. The academic year is divided into two semesters. The school week begins on Monday and ends on Friday.  

The 'School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)' of Albania is 16 years. The nation ranks 25th out of 167 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCHOOL LIFE EXPECTANCY|url=http://world.bymap.org/SchoolLifeExpectancy.html|website=world.bymap.org|language=English|date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the overall [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rate]] in Albania was 98.7%; the male [[literacy rate]] was 99.2% and female literacy rate was 98.3%. 

== Pre-communist period ==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}

As late as 1945, the literacy rate of the country was raised to about 20%&lt;ref&gt;http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/10/Albania-HISTORY-BACKGROUND.html, quote: These compulsory programs were highly successful, raising the literacy rate from an estimated 20 percent in 1945 &lt;/ref&gt;, and in late 1946 the illiteracy rate was 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/libreriavirtuale/Kadare.pdf|trans-title=The Literature of the Prohibited Language | title = Albanian "Letërsia e gjuhës së ndaluar"|accessdate=2010-01-06|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low percentage was principally because schools using the [[Albanian language]] had been practically non-existent in the country before it became independent in 1912. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers had prohibited the use of the Albanian language in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/libreriavirtuale/Kadare.pdf|trans-title=The Literature of the Prohibited Language | title = Albanian "Letërsia e gjuhës së ndaluar"|accessdate=2010-01-06|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] was spoken in the few schools that served the [[Muslim]] population. These institutions were located mainly in cities and large towns. The schools for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] children were under the supervision of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The teachers at these schools usually were recruited from the Orthodox clergy, and the language of instruction was [[Greek language|Greek]]. The first school known to use Albanian in modern times was a Franciscan seminary that opened in 1861 in [[Shkodër]], though there are mentions of Albanian schools by Franciscans since 1638 in [[Pdhanë]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-albania-catholics.doc Catholics of Albania] (Word document)&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1880 to 1910, several Albanian patriots intent on creating a sense of national consciousness founded elementary schools in a few cities and towns, mostly in the south, but these institutions were closed by the Ottoman authorities. The advent of the [[Young Turks]] movement in 1908 motivated the Albanian patriots to intensify their efforts, and in the same year [[Congress of Monastir|a group of intellectuals met]] in [[Bitola|Monastir]] to choose an [[Albanian alphabet]]. Books written in Albanian before 1908 had used a mixture of alphabets, consisting mostly of combinations of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]]-[[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] letters.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The participants in the Monastir meeting developed a unified alphabet based on Latin letters. A number of textbooks soon were written in the new alphabet, and Albanian elementary schools opened in various parts of the country. In 1909, to meet the demand for teachers able to teach in the native tongue, a normal school was established in [[Elbasan]]. But in 1910, the Young Turks, fearing the emergence of Albanian nationalism, closed all schools that used Albanian as the language of instruction.

Even after Albania became independent, schools were scarce. The unsettled political conditions caused by the [[Balkan Wars]] and by [[World War I]] hindered the development of a unified education system. When [[World War I]] broke out (1914), Albanian education in Albania was virtually non-existent. Apart from the Turkish educational institutions, the local schools were mostly Greek-, Romanian- and Serbian-speaking:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The foreign occupying powers, however, opened some schools in their respective areas of control, each power offering instruction in its own language. A few of these schools, especially the [[Italy|Italian]] and [[France|French]] ones, continued to function after World War I and played a significant role in introducing Western educational methods and principles. Particularly important was the National Lycée of [[Korçë]], in which the language of instruction was [[French language|French]].

Soon after the establishment of a national government in 1920, which included a ministry of education, the foundation was laid for a national education system. Elementary schools were opened in the cities and some of the larger towns, and the Italian and French schools that had opened during World War I were strengthened. In the meantime, two important [[United States|American]] schools were founded: the [[American Vocational School]] in [[Tirana]], established by the [[American Junior Red Cross]] in 1921, and the [[American Agricultural School]] in [[Kavajë]], sponsored by the [[Near East Foundation]]. Several future communist party and government luminaries were educated in the foreign schools: [[Enver Hoxha]] graduated from the National Lycée in 1930, and [[Mehmet Shehu]], who would become [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|prime minister]], completed studies at the American Vocational School in 1932.

In the 1920s, the period when the foundations of the modern Albanian state were laid, considerable progress was made toward development of a genuinely Albanian education system. In 1933 the [[Royal Constitution]] was amended to make the education of citizens an exclusive right of the state. All foreign-language schools, except the American Agricultural School, were either closed or nationalized. This move was intended to stop the rapid spread of schools sponsored directly by the Italian government, especially among [[Roman Catholics]] in the north.

The nationalization of schools was followed in 1934 by a far-reaching reorganization of the entire education system. The new system called for compulsory elementary education from the ages of four to fourteen. It also provided for the expansion of secondary schools of various kinds; the establishment of new technical, vocational, and commercial secondary schools; and the acceleration and expansion of teacher training. The obligatory provisions of the 1934 reorganization law were never enforced in rural areas because the peasants needed their children to work in the fields, and because of a lack of schoolhouses, teachers, and means of transportation.

The only minority schools operating in Albania before [[World War II]] were those for the [[Greece|Greek]] minority living in the district of [[Gjirokastër]]. These schools too were closed by the constitutional amendment of 1933, but Greece referred the case to the [[International Permanent Court of Justice]], which forced Albania to reopen them.

Pre-World War II Albania had no university-level education and all advanced studies were pursued abroad. Every year the state granted a limited number of scholarships to deserving high school graduates, who otherwise could not afford to continue their education. But the largest number of university students came from well-to-do families and thus were privately financed. The great majority of the students attended Italian universities because of their proximity and because of the special relationship between the [[Rome]] and Tirana governments. The Italian government itself, following a policy of political, economic, military, and cultural penetration of the country, granted a number of scholarships to Albanian students recommended by its legation in Tirana.

Soon after the Italians occupied Albania in April 1939, the education system came under complete Italian control. Use of the [[Italian language]] was made compulsory in all secondary schools, and the [[fascist]] ideology and orientation were incorporated into the curricula. After 1941, however, when [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] groups began to operate against the Italian forces, the whole education system became paralyzed. Secondary schools became centers of resistance and guerrilla recruitment, and many teachers and students went to the mountains to join resistance groups. By September 1943, when Italy capitulated to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Germany|German]] troops invaded and occupied Albania, education had come to a complete standstill.

== Communist period ==
Upon taking power in late 1944, the [[communist]] regime gave high priority to reopening the schools and organizing the whole education system to reflect communist ideology. The regime's objectives for the new school system were to wipe out illiteracy in the country as soon as possible, to struggle against "[[bourgeois]] survivals" in the country's culture, to transmit to Albanian youth the ideas and principles of communism as interpreted by the party, and finally to educate the children of all social classes on the basis of these principles. The 1946 communist constitution made it clear that the regime intended to bring all children under the control of the state. All schools were soon placed under state management. At the same time, due to the lack of specialists in many fields of knowledge, a lot of young people were sent abroad to the countries Albania had diplomatic connections with (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania etc.)&lt;ref&gt;S.T. Dhamko. Boboshtica. Historie. Boboshtica, 2010 (dorёshkrim). Ff. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1946 [[Education Reform Law]] provided specifically that [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] principles would permeate all school texts. This law also made the struggle against illiteracy a primary objective of the new school system. In September 1949, the government promulgated a law requiring all citizens between the ages of twelve and forty who could not read to attend classes in reading and writing. Courses for illiterate peasants were established by the education sections of the people's councils. The political organs of the armed forces provided parallel courses for illiterate military personnel.

In addition to providing for free seven-year obligatory elementary schooling and four-year secondary education, the 1946 law called for the establishment of a network of vocational, trade, and teacher-training schools to prepare personnel, technicians, and skilled workers for various social, cultural, and economic activities. Another education law adopted in 1948 provided for the further expansion of vocational and professional courses to train skilled and semiskilled workers and to increase the theoretical and professional knowledge of the technicians.

In the 1950s, the school system was given a thorough [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] orientation in terms both of communist ideological propaganda and central government control. Secondary technical schools were established along the same lines. In 1951 three institutes of higher learning were founded: the [[Higher Pedagogic Institute]], the [[Higher Polytechnical Institute]], and the [[Higher Agricultural Institute]], all patterned on Soviet models. Most textbooks, especially those dealing with scientific and technical matters, were Soviet translations. Courses for teacher preparation were established in which the [[Russian language]], Soviet methods of [[pedagogy]] and [[psychology]], and Marxist-Leninist dialectics were taught by Soviet instructors. A team of Soviet educators laid the structural, curricular, and ideological foundations of the Enver Hoxha University at Tirana (now called [[University of Tirana]]), which was established in 1957.

By 1960 the system of elementary and secondary education had evolved into an eleven-year program encompassing schools of general education and vocational and professional institutes. The schools of general education consisted of primary grades one to four, intermediate grades five to seven, and secondary grades eight to eleven. In October 1960, however, as Soviet-Albanian tensions were reaching the breaking point, the [[Albanian Party of Labor]] issued a resolution calling for the reorganization of the whole school system. The resolution's real aim was to purge the schools of Soviet influence and rewrite the textbooks. An additional year was added to the eleven-year general education program, and the whole school system was integrated more closely with industry in order to prepare Albanian youth to replace the Soviet specialists, should the latter be withdrawn, as they eventually were in 1961.

A subsequent reform divided the education system into four general categories: preschool, general eight-year program, secondary, and higher education. The compulsory eight-year program was designed to provide pupils with the elements of ideological, political, moral, aesthetic, physical, and military education. The new system lowered the entrance age for pupils from seven to six, and no longer separated primary and intermediate schools.

Secondary education began with grade nine (usually at age fourteen), and ended with grade twelve. Secondary schools offered four-year general education programs or four-year vocational and professional programs, including industrial, agricultural, pedagogic, trade, arts, and health tracks, among others. Some programs lasted only two years.

The term of study in the institutes of higher education lasted three to five years, and tuition was also free at this level. Provision was made to expand higher education by increasing the number of full-time students, setting up new branches in places where there were no post-secondary institutes, and organizing specialized courses in which those who had completed higher education would be trained to become highly qualified technical and scientific cadres. All full-time graduate students had to serve a probationary period of nine months in industrial production and three months in military training, in addition to the prescribed military training in school. There were also post-secondary Party schools, such as [[Lenin Higher Party School]], which existed simply to promote the regime's philosophy.

Adult education was provided in the same sequence as full-time schooling for younger students, with two exceptions. First, the eight-year general education segment was noncompulsory, and was compressed into a six-year program that allowed for completion of the first four grades in two years. Second, those who wanted to proceed to higher institutes after completing secondary school had to devote one year to preparatory study instead of engaging in production work, as full-time students did.

Official statistics indicated that the regime made considerable progress in education. Illiteracy had been virtually eliminated by the late 1980s. From a total enrollment of fewer than 60,000 students at all levels in 1939, the number of people in school had grown to more than 750,000 by 1987; also, there were more than 40,000 teachers in Albania. About 47% of all students were female. The proportion of eighth-grade graduates who continued with some type of secondary education increased from 39% in 1980 to 73% in 1990, with no village reporting a figure lower than 56%.

== Contemporary ==

A reorganization plan was announced in 1990 that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, however, a major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Widespread vandalism and extreme shortages of textbooks and supplies had a devastating effect on school operations, prompting Italy and other countries to provide material assistance. The minister of education reported in September 1991 that nearly one-third of the 2,500 schools below the university level had been ransacked and fifteen school buildings razed. Many teachers relocated from rural to urban areas, leaving village schools understaffed and swelling the ranks of the unemployed in the cities and towns; about 2,000 teachers fled the country.  The highly controlled environment that the communist regime had forced upon the educational system over the course of more than forty-six years was finally liberated set for improvement.

As in Communism, teacher discipline remains a major problem in the Albanian education system, as teachers resort to violence, while students are expected to simply memorize the assigned material. Furthermore, corruption among teachers is becoming a problem as 'envelopes' and expensive gifts are the norm when faced with important deadlines, such as entry averages, or failing the grade. However, there has been an effort to adopt the Western model whereby the student is at the center of the education system as opposed to the current Eastern model where the teacher holds the dominant role.
[[File:Women_University_Students_outside_National_Historical_Museum_-_Tirana_-_Albania_(42797770431).jpg|thumb|University students in Tirana]] 
In the late 1990s, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed to improve learning conditions. Most of the improvements have happened in the larger cities, such as the capital [[Tirana]]. The latter suffers from vast overcrowding of classrooms, resulting in 2 daytime teaching shifts, while heating during the winter is a major problem. The old communist propaganda has been taken out of all school curricula and more emphasis has been put on [[mathematics]], [[sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The school week was shortened from 6 to a 5-day week. Some of the wealthier schools have begun introducing [[computers]], but many schools still lack basic supplies for laboratory classes.

Meanwhile, private, non-public institutions across all levels have opened up with improved teaching material, staff, and added extra curricular activities but expensive fees. Similar changes have also taken place in the post-secondary level. A number of private universities have been established in different cities of Albania, offering students possibilities of studying in different branches. E-learning programs have begun to be introduced, offering students the possibility of following online courses.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, some post-secondary private institutions have become known as simply "diploma factories", as was the case with the granting of a controversial university diploma to the son of famous Italian politician [[Umberto Bossi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Likmeta|first1=Besar|title=Albanian University Quizzed Over Bossi Diploma|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/the-trout-s-albanian-diploma-raises-eyebrows|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Albanian government has closed a dozen of such institutions in an attempt to clamp down on the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albania closes 18 universities for issuing fake diplomas|url=http://www.ansamed.info/nuova_europa/en/news/countries/albania/2014/08/07/albania-closes-18-universities-for-issuing-fake-diplomas_de759b5e-1c73-4b57-9f9e-4b6805f4e802.html|agency=ANSA|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2009 and 2013, the textbook industry was deregulated in an effort to make textbooks more affordable thus offering a wider choice to students and instructors. However, the sector became vulnerable to favoritism and the Albanian education system experienced a decline in quality. It became flooded with texts written by writers without credible credentials resulting in mediocre texts with dubious content. One of them reportedly suggested pupils to fabricate an excuse for not going to school on a given day by mixing chalk with water and drinking it to become ill and skip classes. Other texts made explicit use of profanity.

Since 2013, these texts were banned and more reputable ones from Pearson and Oxford were introduced in an effort to harmonize the Albanian education system with the EU. 
     
In recent years, foreign students mainly from Southern Italy are getting enrolled in Italian-affiliated universities in Tirana in the hope of better preparing themselves for entrance exams in Italy's universities.

'''Emil Bisttram''' (1895–1976) was an American artist who lived in New York and [[Taos, New Mexico]], and was known for his modernist work.

==Life and works==
Emil Bisttram was born in Hungary, near the Romanian border, in 1895. When he was 11 years old, he immigrated with his family to [[New York City]], where they settled in the [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broder|first1=Patricia|title=The American West : The Modern Vision|date=1984|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=0821215787|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a talented artist, and after a few years began his schooling at the National Academy of Art and Design, then [[Cooper Union]], Parsons, and The Art Student's League. He began teaching soon after completing school, first at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, and then at the Master Institute of the Roerich Museum.

Bisttram first visited Taos in the summer of 1930. He later fell in love with the scenery and moved there. In 1931 he won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study [[Mural|mural painting]]. The fellowship enabled Bisttram to travel to Mexico where he studied mural painting with the world famous muralist [[Diego Rivera]]. Numerous mural commissions were to follow throughout his career (the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in Washington D.C., The Taos County Courthouse, [[New Mexico]], and the Federal Courthouse in [[Roswell, New Mexico]].) After returning to Taos in 1932, Bistrram started the Heptagon Gallery and the Taos School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Udall|first1=Sharyn|last2=Connors|first2=Andrew|title=Art in New Mexico, 1900-1945 :Paths to Taos and Santa Fe|date=1986|publisher=National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0896595986|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Bisttram founded the Transcendental Painting Group with [[Raymond Jonson]] and several other Santa Fe artists.

In 1952, Bisttram co-founded the [[Taos Art Association]], and later in 1959 won the Grand Prize for painting at the [[New Mexico State Fair]].

In 1970, Emil Bisttram served as a judge and monitor for a statewide arts grant competition for art to be placed in the newly constructed County Courthouse building, designed by architect Bill Menningbach of Taos. Ken Drew, a local sculptor, won the competition. Bisttram oversaw the project for the next two years, and in June 1972 Drew completed the installation. Then-Senator [[Joseph Montoya]] and other dignitaries from Santa Fe officiated at the dedication ceremonies. In 1975, his birthday, April 7, was declared "Emil Bisttram Day," a New Mexico state holiday.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4431">'''Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes "San Alejandro"''' is the oldest and most prestigious fine arts school in Cuba.  It is located in [[Marianao]], a suburb of [[Havana]].  It was founded in 1818 at the ''Convent of San Alejandro'' by the French [[Painting|painter]], [[Jean Baptiste Vermay]], who was its first director. It is located today in a monumental building built in the early 1940s.

==Beginning==
It is the educational center with the largest number of years building the teaching on the lands of [[Latin America]], preceded only by the [[University of Havana]]. It turned-from a number of changes that occurred in [[Spain]] in the 19th century and not surprisingly was felt in the colonies, in the climate of the Constitution of [[Cadiz]] of 1812 and [[enlightened absolutism]]. It was established by the Royal Patriotic Society and the Royal Consulate of Havana, as the Free School of Drawing and Painting. Its first director, Juan Bautista Vermay, who arrived in Cuba when the [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] empire collapsed, when he was 31 years old.

==Administration==
The internal life at ''San Alejandro'' is governed by the Board of Directors who in turn appoints the Technical Council, who in turn run the different departments that make up the teaching faculty.

The Board of Directors consists of the Director and Deputy Director and the Secretaries  Speciality Teaching, Education, Health Care-Economic, Business and Education.

The Technical Board, in turn, is the body responsible for representing the teaching faculty to the Board of Directors. It consists of all deans of each departments. These are the Deans of [[Drawing]], [[Painting]], [[Engraving]], [[Sculpture]], [[Ceramic art|Ceramics]], [[Jewelry]], [[Graphic Arts]] and Theoretical-Cultural Teachings.

San Alejandro has exchanges with many schools abroad, including in the UK The [[Cardinal Wiseman Roman Catholic School]]. Over the past three years, three exchanges have taken place. The exchanges consisted of the students from Wiseman travelling to Cuba in February, and the Cuban students coming to London in June.

The '''glass sea creatures''' (alternately called the ''Blaschka sea creatures'', ''glass marine invertebrates'', and ''Blaschka invertebrate models'') are works of [[glass art]]ists [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]]. The spiritual predecessors of the [[Glass Flowers]], the sea creatures were the output of the Blaschkas' successful mail-order business of supplying museums and private collectors around the world with sets of [[glass]] models of [[marine invertebrates]].

Between 1863 and 1880, the Blaschkas – working in [[Dresden]] – executed at least 10,000 of these highly detailed glass models, representing some 700 different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Sarakas, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/art/2016/08/06/corning-exhibit-peeks-undersea-world-glass/87749928/ Corning exhibit shows sea creatures in glass], ''[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]]'' (August 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of large collections of the models are held by museums and other academic institutions. [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] holds 430 items in its Blaschka Glass Invertebrate Collection and displays about 60 at any given time).&lt;ref name="dm.cmog.org"&gt;[http://mcz.harvard.edu/collections/blaschka_coll.html Blaschka Glass Invertebrate Collection], [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], [[Harvard University]] (2016),&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cornell University]] has about 570 items in its collection and has restored some 170 of these,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/ Out of the Teeming Sea: The Cornell Collection of Blaschka Invertebrate Models], [[Albert R.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden.tif|thumb|Rudolf (standing), Caroline, and Leopold Blaschka in the garden of their Dresden home]]

In 1853, shortly after the death of his father and wife Caroline, the latter to a cholera epidemic, Leopold Blaschka – grief stricken and in need of a vacation – traveled to the United States. En route, however, and the ship was becalmed and lay still upon the sea for two weeks.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/article/blaschkas-glass-models-invertebrate-animals-1863-1890 Corning Museum of Glass: Blaschkas' Glass Models of Invertebrate Animals (1863–1890)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of forced idleness, Leopold studied and sketched the local marine [[invertebrate]] population, intrigued by the transparency of their bodies which was next of kin to the glass his family had long worked.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urania-dresden.de/Blaschka_engl.html |title=Förderverein "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst Blaschka-Haus e. V". (The Promotional Association "Scientific Glass Art – Blaschka-Haus e. V.") |publisher=Urania-dresden.de |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011548/http://www.urania-dresden.de/Blaschka_engl.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }} &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Short title: "Blaschka – English version". Translation by Peter Silbernagl. Lead sentence: "In September 2000, an association was founded in Dresden-Hosterwitz with the aim to establish a museum-type memorial for the work of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka and to treasure the memory of those two glass-artists." &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Earliest English-language title: The Association "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst – Blaschka-Haus e.V.". Johanna Dühning, Chairman of the Association; translation by Benjamin Pentzold ().&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Leopold felt a sense of quiet, inspirational, wonder at these luminescent ocean dwellers, a sense which he recorded and has been since translated by a Henri Reiling: ''"It is a beautiful night in May. Hopeful, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt;

This sense of wonder would fuel his later work but, in the meantime and upon his return to [[Dresden]], Leopold focused on his family business which was the production the glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master [[Lampworking|Lampworker]] could accomplish;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; plus the task of furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka. However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled ''Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants'' (otherwise known as the Glass Flowers), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Yet, unsurprisingly given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de [[House of Rohan|Rohan]] who, being something of a naturalist himself, commissioned the Blaschkas to craft 100 glass [[orchid]]s for his private collection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...}". Design Museum (designmuseum.org). Retrieved 2015-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally the Prince was more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, and "between 1860 and 1862, the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,"&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another – man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Professor [[Ludwig Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"&gt;[http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/a-tale-of-two-glassworkers-and-their-marine-marvels/ A Tale of Two Glassworkers and Their Marine Marvels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichenbach's request==
[[File:Reichenbach Ludwig 1793-1879.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Professor Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach]]
Director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach was faced with an annoying yet seemingly unsolvable problem in regards to showing marine life. Land-based flora and fauna was not an issue, for it was a relatively simple matter to exhibit mounted and stuffed creatures such as gorillas and elephants, there lifelike poses attracting and exciting the museums visitors. Invertebrates, however, and by their very nature, posed a problem.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/intro.php Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/research/library/collections/digital/blaschka The Blaschka Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, Prof. Reichenbach wanted something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; And, per remarkably coincidence, in 1863 "saw an exhibition of highly detailed, realistic glass flowers created by a Bohemian lampworker named Leopold Blaschka."&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive/&gt;

[[File:Blaschka 1.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of sea anemones]]

Enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own showcasing issue, in 1863&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L. Blaschka, Dresden, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; These marine models, hailed as "an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,"&lt;ref&gt;https://museum.wales/articles/2007-05-15/Sea-creatures-of-the-deep---the-Blaschka-Glass-models/&lt;/ref&gt; were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and [[papier-mâché]] or wax models.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, Anne Collins, and Weitekamp, Margaret A. Analyzing Art and Aesthetics. Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology ; v. 9. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and exactly what Prof. Reichenbach needed. Moreover they, at last, provided an outlet for the wonder Leopold had felt all those years ago when observing the phosphorescent ocean life. The key fact, though, was that these glass marine models were, as would soon be acknowledged, "perfectly true to nature,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; and as such represented an extraordinary opportunity boh for the scientific community and the Blaschkas themselves. Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/leopold-rudolf-blaschka |title=Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...} |publisher=[[Design Museum]] (designmuseum.org) |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advice which would prove wise and fateful both economically and scientifically, for Leopold did as the Dresden natural history museum director suggested.

==A successful business==
[[File:Blaschka 4.jpg|thumb|left|Blaschka model of jellyfish]]
Unlike the eventual Glass Flower, a private commission to a single University's museum, the Blaschka glass sea creatures were a global enterprise; and not just for museums and other such educational institutes, for "as popular interest in the history and sciences of the natural world burgeoned during the latter half of the 19th century, the sea became particularly alluring. The spread of home aquariums and the advent of deep-sea diving revealed a new frontier, filled with wondrous and unusual creatures."&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"&gt;[http://news.wisc.edu/glass-menagerie-museum-unearths-exotic-stash-of-glass-sea-creatures/ University of Wisconsin–Madison: ‘Glass menagerie:’ Museum unearths exotic stash of glass sea creatures]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, for the first time since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], there was great universal interest in the natural world, and it became a sign of culture, of worldliness and sophistication, to exhibit examples of life in one's drawing rooms and parlors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence private individuals were after these extraordinary models as well, and the Blaschkas, knowing this and knowing that Reichenbach was correct in that many museums would want them, made a mail-order business out of it. This business was hugely successful and they ended up making and selling a believed 10,000 of glass invertebrates dispersed in a diaspora of shipments all across the globe.&lt;ref name="dm.cmog.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models"&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-delicate-glass-sea-creatures-of-leopold-and-rudolf-blaschka&lt;/ref&gt; and yet they were available via so common a means as mail-order per one's local card catalog; for example, [[Ward's Natural Science]] would sell a small glass octopus for approximately $2.50.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had – for natural history museums directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; In short, Blaschka invertebrate models mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reason: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species,&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; and his reputation quickly spread.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

As Leopold truthfully wrote in an English-language trade catalog (which the Rakow Research Library at The Corning Museum of Glass has thankfully preserved):''"[Models of invertebrate animals] have been purchased by... museums and scholastic establishments in all the quarters of the globe... in New Zealand... in Tokio [sic], Japan... for the Indian Museum in Calcutta... in the United States of America by Professor Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York; for the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts; for the Boston Society of Natural History; the University of Cornell; the Wellesley Female College... In Great Britain, Scotland and Ireland, copies have been conveyed to London, Edinburgh and Dublin... In Austria, orders have not only been made for the Imperial Royal Court collection, but also for the universities in Innsbruck, Graz, Czernovitz, and so forth. In Germany, purchases have been made for the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Koenigsberg, Jena, Leipzig, Rostock and many other museums."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; Furthermore, Leopold gradually extended his range of work by studying marine animals from the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Mediterranean]],&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;  and later constructed an aquarium at his house, in order to keep live specimens from which to model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Yet the fate of the marine invertebrate mail-order business was ultimately to be tied to those bought by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. At some time after the museum's founding in 1859, a collection of 430 glass sea creatures were purchased by either Professor [[Louis Agassiz]], the first director, or his son and successor [[Alexander Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; This set was not the largest ever sold and the models were no different from any of the others made by the Blaschkas, but, again, their affect was to be greater than all the rest combined.

==From invertebrates to flowers==
{{main article|Glass Flowers}}
[[File:PSM V39 D594 George Lincoln Goodale.jpg|thumb|Professor George Lincoln Goodale|left|150px]]
Paradoxically and in historically circular twist, the reason that the glass sea creatures sold to Harvard were to prove so crucial was because the University would soon, and did, open its new [[Harvard University Herbaria|Botanical Museum]] in 1888. Given in effect a series of empty rooms and invited to make a museum for teaching botany, the first director, Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]], faced a familiar problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study and, as such, Prof. Goodale wanted the best for his students, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled botanical specimens – a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In fact, Goodale's problem was essentially the same as Reichenbach's had been, but applied to botany rather than marine biology for, in both cases, the practiced method of exhibition robbed the specimens of color and three-dimensional form.

[[File:GlassFlowers2HMNH.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A glass model of a cactus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History]]

Moreover and also like Prof. Reichenbach, Prof. Goodale first learned of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschkas' skill per an exhibition – that being the glass marine invertebrates belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. And, like Reichenbach, upon seeing the Blaschkas' work Goodale was instantly sure that they held the answer to his showcasing problem. Thus, in yet another direct historical parallel, in 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard. Naturally Leopold was initially unwilling as, again, his current business of selling glass marine invertebrates was booming; but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; the fragments convinced Goodale that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. Thus, with the generous sponsorship of Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter [[Mary Lee Ware|Mary]], the initial contract was signed and dictated that the Blaschkas need only work half-time on the models, thus allowing them to continue their production of the Glass sea creatures. However, in 1890, they and Goodale – acting on behalf of the Wares – signed an updated version that allowed Leopold and Rudolf to work on them (the Glass Flowers) full-time;&lt;ref name=schultes&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982.

Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas' Glass Models. Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the production and time of the Glass sea creatures was over, their fame as well as the attention of their makers shifting to the Glass Flowers – a project that, fifty years later, ended with the death of Rudolf Blaschka (Leopold having died thirty-nine years earlier).

==The models today==
Today, over a century after their making, the Glass sea creatures live in the shadow of their younger botanical cousins, so much so that many of those well aware of the Glass Flowers have never even heard of them. The fact is that, "gradually, these glass animals began to disappear, their habitats shifting into dusty closets and museum storage. People began to forget that these incredible glass creations had existed in the first place."&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"/&gt;

===Corning===
With a collection 700 models bought in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; the Corning Museum of Glass boasts the largest known stash of Blaschka sea creatures. Displayed (at least in part) in an exhibition named ''Fragile Legacy'', "researchers at Cornell are using the collection as a time capsule for seeking out and documenting the creatures still living in our oceans today." In addition, Corning's exhibit allows visitors to try their own hands at crafting glass sea slugs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/fragile-legacy Fragile Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as view subsequent works inspired by the Blaschkas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/set/inspired-blaschka Inspired by Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit is open through January 8, 2017. Finally, Corning Museum of Glass has produced a movie entitled [http://fragilelegacy.info/ Fragile Legacy] exploring the related topics of the Glass sea creatures and the living ones they represent.

===Harvard===
[[File:The_front_view_of_Harvard's_temporary_exhibit_which,_for_the_first_time,_displayed_both_the_Blaschka's_Glass_Flowers_and_marine_invertebrates_in_together.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of Harvard's temporary renovation exhibit]]
Even those specimens purchased by Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) suffered a degree of neglect; they were not forgotten, but they were scattered much as the quote above describes, across several departments, and it was believed that the University only possessed 60-70 models (rather than the actual 430).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Harvard has restored and, to best of their abilities, repaired the Glass sea creatures with the hired and instrumental help of Preservation Specialist and Glass Worker Elizabeth R. Brill of Corning, New York, a marine biologist and daughter of a glass chemist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/07/undersea-life-clear-as-glass/ Undersea life, clear as glass]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brill later [https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Creatures-Glass-Blaschka-Animals/dp/1785510436/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483050809&amp;sr=1-1 co-authored a book] about the Glass sea creatures.) Today they form the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] ''Sea Creatures in Glass'' display which, when combined with the Glass Flowers, form the largest Blaschka collection on display in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Harvard's renovation exhibit====
For a several month period beginning in 2015 and set to end in the early summer of 2016, the HMNH set up a "temporary display highlighting twenty-seven of the most popular plant models as well as some items from the Blaschka archives"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glass Flowers Renovation Project Frequently Asked Questions (Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries)&lt;/ref&gt; while the main Glass Flowers exhibit was under renovation. This exhibit was unique because it was the first recorded time that the Glass Flowers have been jointly exhibited with the Glass sea creatures in a major and equal display.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The renovation exhibit was dismantled when, on May 21, 2016, the main Glass Flowers exhibit reopened. The Glass sea creatures remained as a permanent exhibit.

===Cornell===
In 1885 Andrew Dixon White, first president of [[Cornell University]], authorized purchase of 570 glass marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"&gt;http://fragilelegacy.info/&lt;/ref&gt; "some of which are on exhibit at Corson Mudd Hall and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, making Cornell one of the few universities in the world where students and the public can view these wondrous creations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/history.php Cornell University: History of the Blaschka Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; However and like so many of their counterpart collections, they were neglected after a time and, in this case, remained forgotten under dust and grit until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"/&gt; Currently Cornell has restored approximately 170 of the models thus far and "restoration work will continue as funding allows."&lt;ref&gt;http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Museum of Ireland===
The [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural History Museum]] branch of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] was among the Blaschkas' "earliest customers and initially commissioned 85 glass models, paying the then significant sum of £15. It went on to purchase 530 models from the Blaschkas" – making it the largest collection of Blaschka Invertebrate Models in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-glass-menagerie-1.1005588 The glass menagerie (The Irish Times)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Dead Zoo, as Ireland's Natural History Museum is sometimes called,&lt;ref name="archiseek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |title=Natural History Museum, Merrion Square, Dublin |last=Clerkin |first=Paul |work=Architecture of Ireland |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=2009-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035015/http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/27/d605272103134.htm|title=Notes on Dublin|last=Hoque|first=Abeer|date=2006-05-27|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; "has undertaken research on the conservation of these delicate objects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/The-Collections/Natural-History/The-Collections/Blaschka-Glass-Models Blaschka Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Noteworthy in that, like Corning, they have forever taken excellent care of the Sea Creatures, the National Museum of Ireland is another center of learning regarding the Blaschkas; a fact proven in that, in 2006, they hosted (alongside [[University College Dublin]]) the [[Dublin Blaschka Congress]], "conceived as a gathering to bring together the diverse scholarly disciplines that are uniquely, if eccentrically, joined in the study of scientific glass models."&lt;ref&gt;Sigwart, Julia D. "Crystal creatures: context for the Dublin Blaschka Congress." Historical Biology 20.1 (2008): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially and naturally, the Congress dealt with the Glass Flowers no less than their older maritime cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Dublin Blaschka Congress, special issue, Historical Biology 20 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Wisconsin–Madison===
In 2007 the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] Zoological Museum accidentally uncovered their hitherto forgotten 50-model collection in a "series of keyholes under the exhibit cases along a first-floor corridor&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt; Paula Holahan, one of the curators and the one who made the incredible discovery, correctly states that "It's not uncommon to find things packed away in any museum that is over 100 years old." But, regardless, the years have taken their toll and the specimens, currently too brittle to be publicly displayed, must remain in storage until conservation measures are funded and completed. Sadly though these funds are not materializing, so the museum hopes to one willing to sponsor the restoration before the effects of age become irreversible.&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt;

===Natural History Museum, Wollaston Hall, Nottingham, England===
There is a large display of marine invertebrates  and also two models of single cell animals living in fresh water.

==Lost works==
Many of the Glass sea creatures are yet to be located; the Leopolds' record books tell where many of the shipments went,&lt;ref&gt;https://dm.cmog.org/blaschka/blaschka_web.html&lt;/ref&gt; yet the condition and current whereabouts of the majority of these collections remains unknown. The original six glass sea anemones purchased by Professor Reichenbach in 1863 as well as the rest of that first collection were destroyed in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L.

'''Harlem Children Society''' (HCS) is a [[non-profit organization]] that arranges for students from under-resourced and under-served communities to be placed as interns at academic research labs during a summer research program.  In addition to the lab experience, students receive a stipend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/harlem-children-society-searches-for-the-einstein/81123/|title=Harlem Children Society Searches for the Einstein of the Bronx|work=The New York Sun|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participating institutions include [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].

Students undertake their own research, which is presented during a street science fair in their own community, under the guidance of scientists. The students are able to pursue their scientific investigations during the following school semester in an after-school program.  Additionally, these students attend weekly lectures on a variety of topics ranging from incorporating science into communities to financing a college education, while also having the option to visit college campuses and to receive help preparing for the SATs.

==History and origins==
Satyajit Bhattacharya founded HCS on June 5, 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By 2010, the program had expanded to 12 countries, serving more than 750 students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/07/education-taking-science-into-the-streets/|title=EDUCATION: Taking Science into the Streets {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of their mentees in the United States, as of 2010, 40% are African-American, 26% are of Hispanic descent, and 16% are Native Americans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

HCS aims to increase awareness in the sciences, medicine, engineering and mathematics.  It provides an opportunity for under-privileged high school aged students throughout to world succeed academically as well as in all other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stacey |first1=Georgia |title=Worms May Hold Clues to Neurological Disorders |url=https://www.livescience.com/11034-worms-hold-clues-neurological-disorders.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krueger |first1=Liz |title=Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the Harlem Children Society |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/resolutions/2015/j2958 |website=The New York State Senate |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
HCS as of the 2013 serves about 60 students from over 15 schools doing hands-on science research with over 20 mentors in more than 10 reputed institutions. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Program has three components: Students and research projects; seminars and training; and local, regional and national professional conferences and community science street fairs.  Family involvement and post-program follow-up provide students with support to plan their futures and mediate the transitions----academic, emotional, and social----to college and post-academic pursuits. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Depending on their interests and availability of recruited mentors, students are matched with a mentor willing to commit to the summer program.  These students enter the program at the beginning of the summer with an orientation, and spend about eight 25-hour weeks starting their research and some receive training in lab techniques and safety.  During the academic year, a fraction of the participating students put in 12–24 hours each month at their internship sites and attend weekly seminars when made available. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A fraction of the students stay committed to the program for at least two years, and are requested to work as part of HCS staff by Bhattacharya as volunteer interns with an unfixed stipend every year. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Highlights==
The Harlem Children Society has had a number of accomplishments:

'''Heritage Malta''' ({{lang-mt|'''Patrimonju Malta'''}}) is the [[Malta|Maltese]] national agency for museums, conservation practice and cultural heritage. Created by the Cultural Heritage Act, enacted in 2002, the national agency replaced the former Museums Department.

Originally Heritage Malta was entrusted with the management of museums, sites and their collections but in 2005, the agency was also charged with the take over of the former Malta Centre for Restoration to become the national agency responsible for conservation.

As the national agency responsible for museums, cultural heritage and conservation, Heritage Malta is governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the Minister. The Board is headed by a Chairman and is usually appointed for successive three year terms.

'''Higher education in Sri Lanka''' is an optional final stage of [[formal learning]] following [[secondary education]]. [[Higher education]], also referred to as tertiary education occurs most commonly [[university|universities]] or degree-granting institutions. These may be [[public university|public universities]], public and private degree-granting institutions which award their own degrees or degrees from foreign universities.&lt;ref name="island1"&gt;[http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=77951 The role of state universities in the knowledge hub in Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt; High visibility issues include limited capacity of public universities to cater for the demand and opposition to private universities from certain segments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/higher-education-in-sri-lankan-universities-today/ Higher Education In Sri Lankan Universities Today]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Types of universities and institutions==
{{See|List of universities in Sri Lanka}}
===State universities===
There are only 15 state universities in Sri Lanka under the direct administration of the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] which controls funding and appointments. The prominent ones are [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Peradeniya]], [[University of Kelaniya]], [[University of Sri Jayawardhenapura]] [[University of Moratuwa]] and [[University of Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name="island1"/&gt;

===Other government universities===
Apart from the state universities controlled by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]], there are several other universities administrated directly by several government ministries.

===Degree awarding institutions===
In recent years, with amendments to the University Act, a few institutes have been given permission to grant their own degrees: The most prominent is the government-owned [[Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology]].&lt;ref name=ravgaya&gt;{{cite news|last1=කමලදාස|first1=නිශාන්ත|title=පුද්ගලික විශ්වවිද්යාල නිදහස් අධ්යාපනයේ මළගමද?|url=http://ravaya.lk/?p=10691|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=Ravaya|date=15 November 2015|language=Sinhala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional institutions===
There are many local and foreign [[professional bodies]] active in Sri Lanka such as [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]], [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]], [[British Computer Society]], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]], etc. There are institutions provide entrance to professions such as the [[Sri Lanka Law College]]. 

===Vocational training===
Vocational education and training in Sri Lanka are managed by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of the Ministry of Vocational &amp; Technical Training. Training includes course based curriculum at vocational technical training centers and apprenticeship at private or public organizations. Higher education in vocational fields could be archived though several universities. The National Vocational Qualifications Systems in Sri Lanka (NVQSL) provides a structured seven levels of qualifications from Level 1 to Level 7. Vocational education and training is carried out for degree level at the [[Open University, Sri Lanka]] and the [[University of Vocational Technology]], as well as at diploma level at [[Technical College (Sri Lanka)|37 technical colleges]], [[Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sliate.ac.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=53|title=About Us |last= |first= |publisher=Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education|date= |website= |access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sri Lanka School of Agriculture.

==History==
The beginnings of modern higher education in Ceylon commenced in 1870 with the establishment of the [[Ceylon Medical School]], followed by [[Colombo Law College]] (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the [[Government Technical College]] (1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jayasundara |first=N.  |date=February 2014 |title=Higher Education Policy in Sri Lanka: Implementation in State Universities |journal=Scientific Research Journal (SCIRJ),|volume=2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the modern university system in Sri Lanka dates back to 1921 when a [[University college]], the Ceylon University College was established at the former premises of [[Royal College Colombo]], and was affiliated with the [[University of London]]. The college provided courses of study in art and humanities, science and medicine prepared undergraduates for examination at the University of London. 

In 1942 the first university was established in the country was the [[University of Ceylon]] which had several campuses island wide, Colombo (established 1942), Peradeniya (established 1949), [[Vidyodaya]] (established 1959), Vidyalankara (established 1959) and Katubedda (established 1972). [[Vidyodaya]] and Vidayalankara were established under the Vidyodaya and Vidayalankara University Act No 45 of 1958. The University of Ceylon was modelled on the [[Oxbridge]] formula, at its inception the university only accommodated 904 students, which later expanded to cover a number of universities and it remained as an elite-oriented university as stated by Sir [[Ivor Jennings]], catering to a small number of students and exclusively residential. It was dissolved in 1972 to establish the [[University of Sri Lanka]]. In 1974 the Jaffna campus was added to the [[University of Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Silva |first=K. M.|title=The [[University System]] of Sri Lanka|publisher=|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A People's University - A Romantic Story of Peradeniya|publisher=ICES|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual report 1972|publisher=Planning and Research Unit, University of Ceylon|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change of the government in July 1977 led to dismantling of the single university apparatus with the plan of establishing independent universities. With the promulgation of the Universities Act. No 16 of 1978, state university status was restored to the six separate campuses. The [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) was also created to plan and coordinate the state university education. After that, a number of state universities were created. All these state universities are registered under the University Grants Commission, but a few come under the auspices of ministries other than the [[Ministry of Higher Education]], in which the UGC is a part of. Most of the state universities depend on funds given by the University Grants Commission, as it is their primary and sometimes only source of funding. Therefore, the UGC has a direct control over these universities and administer the undergraduate intake. The UGC is subordinate to the Ministry of Higher Education.

==Legislation==
Universities in the Sri Lanka have generally been instituted by Special Presidential Decree, University Orders, Acts of Parliament and the Higher Education Act 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yong |first1=Zhao |last2=Ramanathan|first2=Hema  |date=2010|title=Handbook of Asian Education: A Cultural Perspective |url= |location=New York|publisher=Routledge|page=584 |isbn=1136721290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance===
*Ceylon University Ordinance No.20 of 1942 

===Acts of Parliament===
*Ceylon University (Amendment) Act No.36 1956
*[[Vidyodaya University]] and Vidyakara University Act No.45 of 1958
*Higher Education Act No.20 of 1960
*University of Ceylon Act No.01 of 1972
*Universities Act No.16 of 1978 (this Act established the University Grant Commission and a University Service Appeals Board provided for the administration of universities with their campuses and outset the six campuses of the single University of Sri Lanka, the set up under the previous Act No.1 of 1972, were converted to six independent universities on 1 January 1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickaramasinghe |first=N.|title=University Space and Values Three Essays|publisher=International Center for Ethnic Studies Colombo Sri Lanka|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission process== 
Undergraduate education in state universities is free but entrance is extremely competitive, limited and un-standardized. Fewer than 16% (less than 16,000 students) of those who qualify get admission to state universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/091101/FinancialTimes/ft34.html|title=8% of Sri Lankan students study abroad – University don|author=Jagdish Hathiramani}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of that only half graduate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugc.ac.lk/statistics/Student/Enrolment%20MIS%20Pub-2007.pdf Undergraduate statistics 2000-2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144831/http://www.ugc.ac.lk/statistics/Student/Enrolment%20MIS%20Pub-2007.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the university system is based on the highly competitive [[Advanced Level (SL)|GCE Advanced Level]] examination. Selection of students is done on the basis of rank order on average Z Scores obtained by candidates at the [[Advanced Level (SL)|GCE Advanced Level]] to replicate a district basis representation. Only the top students from each district get admissions, as appose to their overall island rank.

==Funding==
All state universities are funded through the government and undergraduate education is free in these universities. All postgraduate education is fee-levied, unless sponsored by the government. Government also provides grants for students through the [[Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund]].   

==Criticism==
===Z score===
Due to the limited intake into state universities, admissions are based on the student's rank order on average Z Scores obtained by candidates at the [[Advanced Level (SL)|GCE Advanced Level]] to replicate a district basis representation. The top students from urban and rural districts get the chances of having tertiary education. However, top students who got qualified under the minimum Z Scores requirements for admissions from remote districts may get in with relatively lower marks than those from urban districts. As a result, many students who are not granted admission find other means of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/03/21/news3.html|title=Over 7,000 go overseas annually for studies, Island|author=Lakshmi de Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate unemployment===
Sri Lanka has a large number of [[graduate unemployment|unemployed graduates]] numbering 43,000 in 2017. Low economic growth, limited vacancies in public sector as well as unemployable skill set of graduates who have studied aesthetics subjects, while there is a major shortage of technical knowledge. Calls for reform of the university system has been called for to address these issues and the successive attempt to grant government jobs to these graduates mainly in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceylontoday.lk/print20170401CT20170630.php?id=23436 Unemployed graduates Cry for jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2017/05/21/unemployed-graduates-left-on-the-streets/ Unemployed Graduates Left On The Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragging===
{{See|Ragging in Sri Lanka}}
[[Ragging in Sri Lanka|Ragging]] has been widespread in Sri Lankan universities. Certain student groups such as the [[Inter University Students' Federation|IUSF]] uses ragging as a means of attracting a following among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wsws.org/articles/2010/apr2010/sril-a19.shtml | title=Sri Lankan government revives law to suppress student protests | publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]] | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Student groups claim that ragging served as a social equalizer in the universities, but there have been several student death associated to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/14294 | title=The Fundamental Threat to Sri Lankan University Education: Prof. Shantha K. Hennayake | publisher=Asian Tribune | year=2008 | accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic standards===
The academic standards of Sri Lankan universities have been questioned as they fare extremely low in international rankings with the University of the Colombo ranked 801 in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] and 8 in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/130901/news/sri-lanka-universities-of-international-standards-to-attract-foreign-students-60153.html Sri Lanka Universities of international standards to attract foreign students]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">The '''International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation''' is an interdisciplinary English-language [[master's degree]] program offered at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]].  

== History ==
The International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation, founded in October 2009, teaches students from around the world the fundamentals of conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="References"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/studying-conflict-resolution-living-the-conflict-1.364744 'Studying conflict resolution, living the conflict', Profile of the International Program, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of three consecutive semesters, the International Program aims to provide students with the insight and skills needed to address the assessment, management, and resolution of conflicts in the international arena.

The first semester exposes students to a comprehensive survey of conflicts and their resolution from diverse perspectives, including international law, psychology, political science, anthropology and economics. The second and third semesters gives students the chance to choose from a variety of courses according to their interests. Throughout the semesters, special focus is placed on combining practical experience to the theoretical knowledge through interactive teaching, culminating in the intensive mediation workshop taught in smaller groups and through simulations.

Academic trips are planned throughout the year, visiting various sites around Israel in conjunction with the curriculum. In addition, speakers from the United Nations, the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]], embassies, NGOs and visiting professors are invited each week to share their experiences and research, and provide students with professional networking opportunities.

Courses reflect the relevant in the field of conflict resolution, in addition to the resources in Israel and the Middle East: core courses on Middle East History and Israeli politics; framing coursework to focus on international approaches; and offering a greater variety of interdisciplinary elective courses.

Courses are taught in the afternoon, four days per week, allowing students to pursue volunteering and internship opportunities, as well as language courses in [[Hebrew]] and colloquial [[Arabic]].

'''Kenneth Maryboy''' (born May 13, 1961) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] for [[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan County]], [[Utah]], and was [[Navajo Nation]] [[Navajo Nation Council|Council Delegate]]. Kenneth is a former San Juan [[County commission|County Commissioner.]]  Maryboy was the third [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in a row to have been elected to the Commissioner District 3 position since its inception in 1984 that divided the county into three districts. Kenneth was replaced on the commission in 2015 by Rebecca M. Benally

Kenneth Maryboy is the brother of [[Mark Maryboy]] who served the Navajo Nation Council Delegates for 16 years and also served as the [[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan County]] Commissioner for four terms. Kenneth also shares the same Navajo Nation council representation as [[Davis Filfred]], in the Utah Section of the reservation.

He also works alongside Rebecca M. Benally and the San Juan School Board for the Utah Navajo student curriculum, and Bruce Adams for the San Juan County affairs.

Maryboy was once again reelected during the 2010 National Midterm/Navajo Nation Elections in the positions of San Juan County Commissioner District Three and as a Council Delegate in the newly reduced 24 member Navajo Nation Tribal Council respectively.

== Early life ==
At age 18, he was living with his mother and younger brother on the reservation near [[Bluff, Utah]]. They were barely making ends meet on his meager wages as a welder. Although times were rather harsh, Kenneth managed to improve his skills at Welding, as time progressed he learned to Electrician's trade and from there advanced to other markets which were in demand of his skills

Later in life Maryboy, known as a "Medicine Man" among people living on land encompassing the Four-Corners Region of the United States, ministers to the physical, mental and spiritual needs of his people. Maryboy bridges the gap between the old ways of the Navajo, and the current life in America.

He also was routinely desired for a natural another talent, which was an Announcer. During Rodeo seasons he would be asked to announce for many different events and venues.

=== KTNN radio announcer ===
In April 1993, [[KTNN|KTNN 660 AM]], a Navajo Language AM radio station, broadcasting from [[Window Rock, Arizona]], began commentaries for the NBA team, the [[Phoenix Suns]].

Kenneth Maryboy, a rodeo announcer, along with the KTNN Sports Director, L.A. Williams did the play-by-play for their first Suns game. This was a first amongst Navajo Broadcasting stations to be affiliated with a Major League Basketball team.

=== Navajo Santa===
Invoking his own happy childhood memories of the celebration of Christmas at St. Christopher's Mission, Maryboy created a program, the Navajo Santa, to help serve his people with the spirit of Christmas all year long. He adapted the concept of Santa Claus to meet the needs of the Native Americans who are among the most impoverished people in the U.S. The program provides gifts of food, clothing, blankets, and toys, medical care, and other services. He provides hope for everyone served by his joyful program. [http://www.rd.com/stories/everyday-miracles/real-people-real-miracles-2007/article.html]

[[Image:Navajo Santa Event.jpg|thumb|left|200px|December 2007 Navajo Santa Event]]

&lt;sub&gt;''"I would like to see that the understanding and the caring will continue on—that people will understand togetherness and what caring means to other people I still envision a lot more things that I might be able to do, not only in the Navajo Nation but maybe in a broader area as well where there is need."''&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A non-profit organization, Navajo Santa was created to bring food, blankets, warm clothing, toys, and other necessities to Navajos in need on the reservation in southeastern Utah. Entirely volunteer supported, Navajo Santa provides an exchange of culture and support between Navajos and non-Navajos.[http://www.rd.com/stories/everyday-miracles/real-people-real-miracles-2007/article.html]

Kenneth is now 49 and commissioner for San Juan County. His solo Christmas Eve visits have grown into an annual Navajo feast with gifts of clothing, tools and toys for over 700 people. Kids who can't make it to the event because they're sick or lack transportation get a personal visit from Kenneth or one of his elves.

"My grandfather taught me that you learn to be a man and a warrior by sharing and by keeping promises," he says.

===Caring Institute Award===

On November 18, 2002,  Kenneth went to Washington, D.C., to receive the Caring Institute Award, an honor previously given to [[Mother Teresa]], President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Rosalynn Carter, and this year to Paul Newman. Other winners include former Senator [[Bob Dole]] and Reverend [[Billy Graham]].

== Navajo Nation Council Delegate ==
[[Image:Kenneth Maryboy Rally.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Council Delegate Maryboy informing his supports of former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald's endorsement of his reelection campaign]]

In 2000, Maryboy was elected into the legislative body of [[Navajo Nation]] Government as a Navajo Nation Council Delegate for the Mexican Water, Aneth and Red Mesa Chapters. These areas expand the [[Arizona]]n and Utahn borders with a constituency of nearly 10,000 people.

Upon election, Kenneth positioned himself in the Navajo Economic Development committee where he serves as the Vice Chair for the Navajo Nation Nation Council.

===Navajo Nation Council Reduction===
On Dec. 15, 2009, Tribal members voted to reduce the Navajo Tribal Council from 88 to 24 members, and the Navajo Nation Supreme Court ordered immediate implementation of the redistricting in a May 28, 2010 decision. With this Navajo Nation-wide action, it resulting in pitting Councilman Maryboy against fellow Councilman, Davis Filfred during the November 2, 2010 General Elections.

Councilman Maryboy defeated Councilman Filfred for a newly redistricted "Shiprock Agency" section on the Navajo Reservation.

[[2010 Investigation into Navajo Nation Lawmakers Discretionary Funds]]

In October 2010, Navajo tribal officials, were charged in an investigation of slush funds just weeks before the November election. '''Not Guilty''' was what was pleaded for the Councilmen charged for fraud, conspiracy and theft.

Washington D.C.-based  Special prosecutor Alan Balaran reported results on the investigation in which he filed criminal complaints against current Vice President/President-Elect, Ben Shelly, and at least 77 members of the 88-delegate Council as part of a sweeping investigation into the use of discretionary funds that Davis Filfred and Maryboy were named in as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily-times.com/ci_16546829 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095534/http://www.daily-times.com/ci_16546829 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }} Navajo tribal scandal runs deep&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissionership Issues==

=== Conflicting Dual-Elected Positions Issues ===
After being elected as the San Juan County Commissioner and as the Navajo Nation Council Delegate, questions arose as to the Legitimacy and the Ethical position as an elected official of both seats. Members elected to maintain service to two governments bodies was a hot button issue; Kenneth Maryboy fell exactly in this position which was the subject of concern.

Following the October 16, 2007 [[Navajo Nation Council]] vote, granting delegates to maintain service as Councilmen &amp; County Representatives, Maryboy to was allowed to maintain his positions as both the San Juan County Commissioner and Navajo Nation Council Delegate for the Aneth, Red Mesa, and Mexican Water Chapters [http://www.daily-times.com/news/ci_7199132]

===The Navajo Voice of San Juan===
Kenneth Maryboy has to balance his role as a Navajo leader with duties as a San Juan County commissioner, taking office in January. His brother, Mark Maryboy, made history when he was elected in 1986 as the first American Indian county commissioner, also in San Juan, in Utah's history. The county has had one Navajo county commissioner ever since.

''"More than 55 percent of registered voters in San Juan County are Native Americans, and they need to be represented, which is something that maybe Anglo commissioners had not had that perspective before."'' - Bruce Adams (San Juan Commissioner Dist. 1)

==Utah Navajo issues ==
[[Image:Map of Utah highlighting San Juan County.svg|thumb|left|200px|Utah Navajo Strip: located in Southeast Utah]]
Historically, [[Utah]] Navajos were ignored not only by the county and state governments but also by the [[Navajo Nation]].

Located in the Four-Corners regions of the United States, the narrow Utah strip that is home to 8,000 of the Navajo Nation's 300,000 citizens. San Juan County officials long believed Utah Navajos were primarily the responsibility of the tribe. The Council, on the other hand, held that their Utah kin could fend for themselves after a 1933 federal mandate awarded them 37.5 percent of royalties from the rich oil fields near Aneth on Utah's portion of the reservation.

===Utah Navajo Trust Fund===
[[Image:Apachean present.png|thumb|right|350px|Utah Navajo: Northernmost section of the Navajo Nation (in Orange)]]
But between 1933 and 1990, the Utah Navajo Oil Trust Fund was plundered of $150 million, according to a Utah legislative auditor's report. The Navajos' lawsuit against the state is still pending. The State of Utah is the only state in the Nation administering a trust fund for the benefit of American Indians whose lands are within state boundaries. The Utah Navajos have sought to have a more active role in the distribution of the royalties and this would present that opportunity. Legislative leadership has committed to provide a way to make the transition process as seamless as possible for the beneficiaries.[http://www.utah.gov/governor/news/2007/news_11_13_07.html]

'''Trust Fund to Sunset'''

Currently since, Utah's Navajo Trust Fund statute is set to sunset in 2008. Utah Governor [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and Legislative Leadership in 2007 have joined together in asking Congress to create a new disbursement system for the royalties. The Utah Legislative leadership are now actively working with the Utah Navajo Element in regards to controlling of these royalties. [http://www.utah.gov/governor/news/2007/news_11_13_07.html]

Utah Senate Minority Leader Mike Dmitrich saying ''Our congressional delegation must create a vehicle to distribute these monies in a way that all of the Chapter Houses have input.''

Kenneth Maryboy and Davis Filfred have been active in the Utah Navajo Trust fund as well as helping the transition between Utah's Primary role in control the Utah Navajo Trust to the Utah Navajos themselves.

=== Lack of Navajo Nation Infrastructure on Utah Navajoland ===
According to Kenneth's he feels his position and mission for his constituents are to help bring basic services to the people in his district. In fact, the Navajo Nation services which are not on the Utah side of the reservation include:

• Navajo Division of Public Safety Locations: 30 in Arizona, 13 in New Mexico

&lt;ref&gt;http://indian.senate.gov/public/_files/KennethMaryboytestimony.pdf Testimony to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
at the December 9, 2009 hearing on S.1690&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utah Navajo Oil Revenues===
Recently Counsel Delegates Kenneth Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and Former Counsel Delegate Mark Maryboy have been actively working to ensure that the Aneth Oil Royalties stay with the Utah Navajo people.

However such causes are not without competition, the Navajo Nation itself has been working counter to the Utah Navajo people in taking over the Aneth Oil Revenues. It presents a significant problem with a line of issues Kenneth is up against.

On June 16, 2008, Kenneth Maryboy, Mark Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and the honorable Phil Lyman of [[Blanding, Utah]] will travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] to present a working model of how an easy transition from the State of Utah handling Utah Navajo royalty money, to a functioning Utah Navajo organization before Congress.

Also, December 8, 2009, The U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee conducted two hearings that Wednesday morning. The back-to-back hearings which took place in Room 628 Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C.

=== Senate Bill 1690 ===

The first hearing was on [[Senate Bill 1690]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313142722/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s1690/text], which would transfer trustee authority and resources for the Utah Navajo Trust Fund from the state of Utah to the [[Utah Dineh Corporation Inc]]. The second hearing is an oversight hearing to examine the chronic backlog of Indian land transaction decisions at the Interior Department. The backlog effectively blocks many tribes from using their lands, often for years, until those decisions are made. [http://indian.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=057fcd7f-9ab5-49e5-9d26-10f24404da74&amp;Month=12&amp;Year=2009]

Locally, the biggest issue is an emotional tussle over a trust fund that holds royalties from oil and gas leases in and around Aneth. That fund's assets doubled to more than $52 million this year when Utah agreed to settle a lawsuit over alleged abuses during the decades that the state oversaw it.

Utah gave up its oversight role two years ago, and no projects to benefit the Utah Navajos — many of whom have no electricity or running water — can be initiated until Congress picks a new trustee. The Navajo Nation, which receives 62.5 percent of the royalties, wants control of the whole fund.

"Hell no," says Kenneth Maryboy, one of the council candidates and a San Juan County commissioner. "Keep the money in Utah."

=== Navajo Relationship with the State of Utah ===
[[File:Kenneth Shelly Shelly.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Navajo Nation Delegation to Utah State Legislature]]

On Jan. 27, 2009, A Navajo delegation attended Indian Caucus Day. Utah Navajo Delegates Maryboy and Davis Filfred attended the Indian Caucus Day at the Utah State Capitol to advocate on behalf of Navajo constituents living in the state of Utah.

Elected leaders from the Utah's five tribes met with former Utah State Gov. [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon M. Huntsman Jr.]], [[Gary Herbert|Gov. Gary R. Herbert]], [[Mark Shurtleff|Attorney General Mark Shurtleff]] and a number of program directors to emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate funding for programs which provide direct services to tribal citizens.

Thestate of Utah announced major budgetary problems for the upcoming fiscal year and has proposed possible cuts of 15 percent for state agencies. At the caucus, tribal leaders urged Utah state leaders to recognize the limitation in state services currently available to Utah tribes and asked for specific programs to be maintained, despite the economic challenges faced by the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navajonationcouncil.org/Press%20Release/012709_Utah_Indian_Caucus_Day.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Navajo Council delegates attend Indian Caucus Day at Utah State Capitol&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Maryboy went on to state, "''With proposed budgetary cuts, it is important as tribal leaders that we are clear about what state programs we believe are most important to retain. It is also pertinent we are clear about what our goals are in terms of strengthening state and tribal relations''." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.navajonationcouncil.org/Press%20Release/012709_Utah_Indian_Caucus_Day.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life away from politics ==
Currently, although politics does take up much of Kenneth's time, he has found hobbies and activities to help balance out the fast pace public service life. With his family collectively joining him, Kenneth spends time with ATVs and hunting as a side passion. The Maryboy family is quite closely involved with many outdoor racing venues such as mudbogging and drag racing. In fact the Maryboy family runs a racing club called Whiterock Racing.

As with most [[New Democrats|Western Democrats]], Kenneth enjoys a sustaintial amount of time utilizing his time with taking advantage of the immensely rural southwestern environment with such activities like hunting and fishing. The southern Utah area is filled with a variety of outdoor activities for most people who reside in the area and Kenneth maintains that tradition as most Utans do.

Many southern Utahns enjoy the offers that [[Lake Powell]] has to provide. Kenneth and his family enjoy the many opportunities that the lake does provide that many other Utahns and ''Southwestern'' Americans take advantage of as well.

'''Lisa Ullmann''' (17 June 1907, in [[Berlin]] &amp;ndash; 25 January 1985, in [[Chertsey]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[United Kingdom|British]] dance and movement teacher, predominantly remembered for her work in association with dance pioneer [[Rudolf Laban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Davies |first=Eden |title=Beyond Dance: Laban's Legacy of Movement Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRp4cfSxnPsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Lisa+Ullmann&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wHekUtqaHoHZ0QXKmICICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lisa%20Ullmann&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=Routledge |pages=20–21 |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-97728-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ullman was born in Berlin in 1907. She was intending to be a painter but at the suggestion of her father she studied dance at the Berlin Laban School which was run by [[Hertha Feist]]. There she joined the movement choir and heard [[Rudolf Laban]] talk.,&lt;ref name=hodgson&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=John|title=Mastering movement : the life and work of Rudolf Laban|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0878300805|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0878300805}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1929. She taught in [[Nuremberg]] and at the [[Essen]] Folkwang School, where she worked for [[Kurt Jooss]]. She left [[Nazi]] Germany in 1933 and went to England with Jooss and his company. In 1935 she established at [[Plymouth]] the first [[movement choir]] in the country, under the auspices of the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. She taught at [[Dartington Hall]] until 1940, lectured regularly and choreographed extensively. [[Rudolf Laban]] also left for Britain, and for twenty years (1938–58) Ullmann was his long-term partner and the main collaborator in his dance work. She was cofounder of the Laban Art of Movement Guild in 1945, now known as [[The Laban Guild for Movement and Dance]]. In 1946 she also cofounded the [[Art of Movement Studio]] in [[Manchester]], which became the centre for educational dance in England.  The curriculum was based on Laban's space harmonies and his theories of the exploration of expressive movement through effort patterns. She was also responsible for revising several books written by Laban and for cataloguing the Laban Archives. She was still teaching up until the year of her death, imparting her expert knowledge of Laban's theories in courses run by LInC (Laban International Courses).

There is a Lisa Ullmann Travelling Scholarship Fund (Registered Charity No: 297684). Set up 1987, this fund awards travel scholarships with the aim of "Supporting individual journeys in movement and dance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73495">The '''Master of [[Business Administration]]''' ('''MBA''' or '''M.B.A.''') degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought [[scientific management|scientific approaches to management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as [[accounting]], [[applied statistics]], [[business communication]], [[business ethics]], [[business law]], [[finance]], [[managerial economics]], [[management]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[marketing]] and [[operations management|operations]] in a manner most relevant to management [[analysis]] and strategy.

Most programs also include [[elective course]]s and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about sixty [[Course credit|credits]], nearly twice the number of credits typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the [[Master of Economics]], [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Science in Marketing]] and [[Master of Science in Management]].

The MBA is a [[terminal degree]] and a [[Professional school|professional degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |title=Getting Your Master's Degree |publisher=Peterson's |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2014 | quote=A master's degree comes in only two options: a professional, or "terminal" master's degree, or an academic master's degree...A terminal degree is a means to an end; it will prepare you for entrance into a specific type or group of jobs. A terminal degree implies there is no need for any further education, thus the word "terminal." Degrees from professional master's programs are usually marked by specific initials that denote their area of specialty, such as a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) or Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) degree...Conversely, an academic degree centers on research and scholarly studies in a specific area. These degrees are more likely to lead to continued education at the doctoral level where you can specialize in a very specific area of that field...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Maier| first = Christopher| title = Complete Book of Graduate Programs in the Arts and Sciences| publisher = Random House| location = New York| date = 2005| page = 4| isbn = 0-375-76432-1|quote="PhD" and "terminal degree" are not synonymous.  A number of master's degrees lead students directly to, well, the end of the formal educational line.  One such example is the MFA, which is earned by practicing artists in fields such as creative writing, visual arts, and theater.  In the world of business administration degrees, an MBA is terminal.  Although a little research might turn up a handful of PhD options in the creative arts or business, these are different monsters; they don't take away from the fact the person with the MFA or the MBA has a terminal degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School accreditation|Accreditation]] bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, [[corporate title|executive]] (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and [[distance learning]] students, many with specialized concentrations.

==History==
The first school of business in the [[United States]] was [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|The Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established in 1881 through a donation from [[Joseph Wharton]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1900, the [[Tuck School of Business]] was founded at [[Dartmouth College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/history/|title=Tuck School of Business History|work=Tuck.dartmouth.edu|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferring the first [[advanced degree]] in business, specifically, a Master of Science in Commerce, the predecessor to the MBA.&lt;ref name="Stabile2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Stabile|title=Economics, Competition and Academia: An Intellectual History of Sophism Versus Virtue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQNI7BUvYs4C&amp;pg=PA101|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-716-6|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] established the first MBA program in 1908, with 15 faculty members, 33 regular students and 47 special students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Andreas | year = 2014 | title = European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools | url = | journal = European Management Journal | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  529–534| doi = 10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/about/history.html|title=History – About Us – Harvard Business School|work=Hbs.edu|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first-year curriculum was based on [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]’s scientific management. The number of MBA students at Harvard increased quickly, from 80 in 1908, over 300 in 1920, and 1,070 in 1930.&lt;ref name="Leach 1993 288"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=PA288}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, only American universities offered MBAs. Other countries preferred that people learn business on the job.&lt;ref name="Leach 1993 288"/&gt;

Other milestones include:
* 1930: First management and leadership education program for executives and mid-career experienced managers (the [[Sloan Fellows]] Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sloan Legacy|url=http://www.london.edu/newsandevents/news/2009/11/The_Sloan_Legacy_1046.html|work=London.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT's contributions to business and economics|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/economics/|work=boston.com|date= 15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==

===United States===
[[Business school]] or MBA program accreditation by external agencies provides students and employers with an independent view of the school or program's quality, as well as whether the curriculum meets specific quality standards. The three major accrediting bodies in the United States are:
* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), 
* [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP), and
* [[International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education]] (IACBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | ssrn=2144954 | first1 = Kyle E. | last1 = Brink | first2 = Clair | last2 = Smith | title = A Comparison of AACSB, ACBSP, and IACBE Accredited U.S. Business Programs: An Institutional Resource Perspective | journal = Business Education &amp; Accreditation | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages=1–15 | date = 2012 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these groups also accredit schools outside the US. The [[ACBSP]] and the [[IACBE]] are themselves recognized in the United States by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chea.org/programmatic-accrediting-organizations|title=CHEA Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations}} Retrieved 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; MBA programs with specializations for students pursuing careers in healthcare management also eligible for accreditation by the [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME).

US MBA programs may also be accredited at the institutional level. Bodies that accredit institutions as a whole include:
* [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] (MSA),
* [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC),
* [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC),
* [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] (NWCCU),
* [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS), and
* [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Other countries===
Accreditation agencies outside the United States include the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), a UK-based organization that accredits MBA, DBA and MBM programs worldwide, government accreditation bodies such as the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE), which accredits MBA and Postgraduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) programs across India. Some of the leading bodies in India that certify MBA institutions and their programs are the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). A distance MBA program needs to be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC) in India. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) in South Africa, the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] operates the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS) for mostly European, Australian, New Zealand and Asian schools, the [[Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation]] (FIBAA), and [[Central and East European Management Development Association]] (CEEMAN) in Europe.

==Programs==
Full-time MBA programs normally take place over two academic years (i.e. approximately 18 months of term time). For example, in the Northern Hemisphere they often begin in late August or early September of year one and continue until May or June of year two, with a three to four month summer break in between years one and two. Students enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students. A typical full-time, accelerated, part-time, or modular MBA requires 60 credits (600 class hours) of graduate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Business Schools | title=How Long Does it Take to Get an MBA? | url=https://www.allbusinessschools.com/mba/length-of-mba-program/ | date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerated MBA programs are a variation of the two-year programs. They involve a higher course load with more intense class and examination schedules and are usually condensed into one year. They usually have less down time during the program and between semesters. For example, there is no three to four-month summer break, and between semesters there might be seven to ten days off rather than three to five weeks vacation. Accelerated programs typically have a lower cost than full-time two-year programs.

Part-time MBA programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings after normal working hours, or on weekends. Part-time programs normally last three years or more. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who take a light course load for a longer period of time until the graduation requirements are met.

Evening (second shift) MBA programs are full-time programs that normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours, or on weekends for a duration of two years. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who can not leave their work to pursue a full-time regular shift MBA. Most second shift programs are offered at universities in India.

Modular MBA programs are similar to part-time programs, although typically employing a lock-step curriculum with classes packaged together in blocks lasting from one to three weeks.

{{Anchor|Executive MBA (EMBA)}}Executive MBA (EMBA) programs developed to meet the educational needs of managers and executives, allowing students to earn an MBA (or another business-related graduate degree) in two years or less while working full-time. Participants come from every type and size of organization – profit, nonprofit, government – representing a variety of industries. EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students. In response to the increasing number of EMBA programs offered, The Executive MBA Council was formed in 1981 to advance executive education.

Full-time executive MBA programs are a new category of full-time 1 year MBA programs aimed at professionals with approx. 5 years or more. They are primarily offered in countries like India where the 2-year MBA program is targeted at fresh graduates with no experience or minimal experience. These full-time executive MBA programs are similar to 1 year MBA programs offered by schools like Insead and IMD.

[[Distance learning]] MBA programs hold classes off-campus. These programs can be offered in a number of different formats: [[correspondence course]]s by [[postal mail]] or email, non-interactive [[broadcast video]], pre-recorded video, live [[teleconference]] or [[videoconference]], offline or online computer courses. Many schools offer these programs.

Blended learning programs combine distance learning with face-to-face instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=de l'Etraz, Paris |title=What Can an Online Program Do for You? |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=BizEd Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040945/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs typically target working professionals who are unable to attend traditional part-time programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Hebert-Maccaro | title=Blended MBA Programs: An Optimized Form of Learning | url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/business/info/learning/images/pedagogy.pdf | date=8 September 2011 | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA dual degree programs combine an MBA with others (such as an MS, MA, or a [[Juris Doctor|JD]], etc.) to let students cut costs (dual programs usually cost less than pursuing 2 degrees separately), save time on education and to tailor the business education courses to their needs. This is generally achieved by allowing core courses of one program count as electives in the other. Some business schools offer programs in which students can earn both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] and an MBA in five years.

[[Mini-MBA]] is a term used by many non-profit and [[for-profit]] institutions to describe a [[training]] regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit so that they may be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option to complete a full-time MBA degree program at a later period, if they elect to do so.

==Admissions criteria==
Many programs base their admission decisions on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole.

The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MBA programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MBA programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. In rare cases, some MBA degrees do not require students to have an undergraduate degree and will accept significant management experience in lieu of an undergraduate degree. In the UK, for example an HND or even HNC is acceptable in some programs.

Depending on the program, type and duration of work experience can be a critical admissions component for many MBA programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You Should Work Before Pursuing an MBA|url=http://www.bangalorean.co.in/2013/06/why-you-should-work-before-pursuing-mba.html|work=Bangalorean|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many top-tier programs require five or more years of work experience for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MBAapplicant.com |title=Number 5 – YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE:  |url=http://www.mbaapplicant.com/5_experience.htm |date=31 July 2009 |publisher=MBA Applicant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SMU Cox|title=Part Time MBA Programs – Side By Side Comparison |url=http://www.cox.smu.edu/web/guest/side-by-side-comparison |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=SMU Cox School of Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA admissions consulting services exist to counsel MBA applicants to improve their chances of getting admission to their desired Business Schools. These services range from evaluating a candidate's profile, GMAT preparation, suggesting the schools to which they can apply, writing and editing essay, conducting mock interviews as preparation for MBA admission interviews, as well as post-MBA career counseling.

==Content==
In general, MBA programs are structured around core courses (an essentially standard curriculum&lt;ref name="Core Courses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"/&gt;) and elective courses that (may) allow for a subject specialty or concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graduate Management Admission Council|GMAC's]] [http://www.mba.com/schools-and-programs/evaluating-schools/curriculum-and-course-selection.aspx Curriculum and Course Selection].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 
in the program's first year (or part), students acquire both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills required for these, while in the second year (part), students pursue elective courses, which may count towards a specialization.  (Topics in [[business ethics]] may be included at the generalist or specialist level.) After the first year, many full-time students seek [[internship]]s. The degree culminates with coursework in [[business strategy]], the program capstone. A [[dissertation]] or [[Project#School and university|major project]] is usually a degree requirement after the completion of coursework.  Many MBA programs end with a comprehensive exit examination; see below.

For Executive MBA programs, the core curriculum is generally similar, but may seek to leverage the strengths associated with the more seasoned and professional profile of the student body, emphasizing leadership, and drawing more from the specific experience of the individual students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutgers.edu.sg/emba-program/executive-mba-emba-vs-traditional-mba-full-timepart-time Executive MBA (EMBA) vs. Traditional MBA], rutgers.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insead.edu/m-programmes/MBA-vs-EMBA EXECUTIVE MBA VS MBA: THE DIFFERENCE], insead.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs are designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; Courses include lectures, case studies, and team projects; the mix though, will differ by school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/|title=Is the MBA Case Method Passé?|first=Ronald|last=Yeaple|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[#Programs|by format]]. Theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[professor|academic faculty]], and is reinforced through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker. Similar to real world business situations, cases include both constraints and incomplete information. Practical learning (field immersion) often comprises [[management consulting|consulting projects]] with real clients, and is generally undertaken in teams{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} (or "syndicates"). The practical elements (as well as the case studies) often involve [[Clinical professor|external practitioners]]—sometimes business executives—supporting the teaching from academic faculty. (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].)

As above, courses begin with underlying topics&lt;ref name="Core Courses"&gt;See: [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB's]] [http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/business/standards/aol/standard15.asp Standard 15: Management of Curricula]; [[Association of MBAs|AMBA's]] [http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria New Accreditation Criteria]; [[Educational Testing Service|ETS's]] [http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/mba Major Field Test for the MBA].&lt;/ref&gt; and then progress to more advanced functional topics where these are applied; see aside.

The analytic skills required for management are usually covered initially.  The accounting course(s) may treat [[financial accounting|financial]] and [[management accounting]] separately or in one hybrid course.  Financial accounting deals mainly in the preparation of financial statements while management accounting deals mainly in analysis of internal results. [[Managerial economics]] is a technical course that mainly focuses on product pricing as influenced by many micro-economic theories and principals, while the aggregate or macro-economics course deals with topics like the banking system, the money supply, and inflation. [[Operations Research]] and statistics are sometimes combined as "Managerial Decision-Making" or "Quantitative Decision-Making"; organizational behavior and human resource management may similarly be combined. In many programs, applicants with appropriate background may be exempt from various of the analytical courses.

As regards the functional courses, some programs treat the curricula here in two parts: the first course provides an overview, while the second revisits the subject in depth (perhaps as specializations); alternatively, the first addresses short-term, tactical problems, while the second addresses long-term, strategic problems (e.g., "Financial Management I" might cover [[working capital management]], while part II covers [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|capital investment decisions]]).  An [[Information systems]] / [[Information technology|technology]] course is increasingly included as a core functional course rather than an elective. Ethics training is often delivered with coursework in corporate social responsibility and corporate governance. Note that courses here, although technical in content are, ultimately, oriented toward corporate management. (For example, the principal finance course may cover the technicalities  of financial instrument valuation and [[Capital market|capital raising]], but is in fact focused on [[managerial finance|managerial-]] and [[corporate finance]].)  Technically-oriented courses, if offered, will be via a specialization.

Programs may also include (coursework-based) training in the skills needed at senior levels of management:  [[soft skills]], such as (general) leadership and negotiation; hard skills, such as [[spreadsheets]] and project management; [[Outline of thought#Creative processes|thinking skills]] such as [[innovation]] and creativity. Training in areas such as [[multiculturalism]] and corporate social responsibility is similarly included. Company visits (including overseas travel), and guest lectures or seminars with CEOs and [[Business guru|management personalities]] may also be included. These, with the core subjects, provide the graduate with breadth, while the specialty courses provide depth.

For the business strategy component, the degree capstone, the focus is on finding [[competitive advantage]] and the long-term positioning and management of the entity as a whole.  Here, the key functional areas are thus synthesized or integrated into an overall view and the strategy course depicts how the various sub-disciplines integrate to tell one continuous story with each discipline complementing the others.  Corresponding training in [[entrepreneurial leadership|business leadership]] may also be scheduled and participation in a [[business simulation]] or [[business game|game]] is also a common degree requirement. "Strategy" may be offered as a sequence of courses, beginning in the first part (planning) and culminating in the second (execution), or as a single intensive course, offered during the second part. Some programs offer a specialization in "strategy", others in management consulting which substantially addresses the same issues.

The MBA dissertation (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, comprise the following in some combination:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kangis | first1 = Peter | last2 = Carman | first2 = Robert | year = | title = Research, Knowledge and Method: the purpose and role of MBA dissertation | url = http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/bmaf/documents/publications/ijme/vol1no2/kangis_purpose_of_mba_dissert.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The International Journal of Management Education | volume = 1 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[literature review|discussion of the literature]], providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a [[case study]] that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project.&lt;ref name="degree.net"/&gt; Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an [[action learning]] orientation, these may be practically oriented.&lt;ref name="degree.net"&gt;[http://www.degree.net/resources/degree-level/mba-degree-guide_201002182375.html MBA degree-guide], degree.net&lt;/ref&gt; Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.

===Exit examination===
Many MBA programs culminate in a [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exit examination]]. The national [[standardized exam]] known as the [[Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration|Major Field Test for MBAs]] (MFT-MBA) has been administered in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT-MBA Test Description |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by [[Educational Testing Service]]. Another prominent option for comprehensive exit exams is the Common Professional Component Comprehensive Exam for MBAs (CPC COMP Exam for MBAs) owned by Peregrine Academic Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.peregrineacademics.com/media.ashx/exam-summary-business-compgraduatefinal29oct2014.pdf |title=Business Administration CPC-Based COMP Exam Summary: Masters Level |publisher=Peregrine Academic Services |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs choose to administer their own in-house exam rather than a standardized test.

==Honor societies==

Honor societies recognize individuals for high achievement in MBA programs.  These honor societies include:
* Beta Gamma Sigma - membership requires one to be in the top 20% of their program's class after completing half of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.betagammasigma.org/about/invitation-process | title =Invitation Process| website =Beta Gamma Sigma | publisher =Beta Gamma Sigma  | access-date =April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers==
An MBA prepares individuals for many types of careers.  According to a survey by the Graduate Management Admissions Council, 64% of year 2012 MBA graduates used their MBA to change careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zlomek |first=Erin |title=More MBA Grads Are Switching Careers as Job Market Improves |publisher=Businessweek |date=20 August 2014 |url=http://businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-18/more-mba-grads-are-switching-careers-as-job-market-improves |accessdate=20 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824113842/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-18/more-mba-grads-are-switching-careers-as-job-market-improves |archivedate=24 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more common jobs an MBA prepares one for include:

== Europe ==
{{main article|List of business schools in Europe}}

===History===
In 1957, INSEAD (French name "Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires", or European Institute of Business Administration) became the first European university offering the MBA degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kaplan A.: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[EDHEC]] Business School in 1959 and [[ICADE]] in 1960 (who had started offering in 1956 a "Technical Seminary for Business Administration"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icade.es/presentacion/pres_hist.aspx?nivel=3&amp;id=90 Historia de la Universidad Pontificia Comillas].

Vlerick.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1969 by the [[HEC School of Management]] (in French, the École des Hautes Études Commerciales) and the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]. In 1972, Swiss business school [[IMEDE]] (now [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]]) began offering a full-time MBA program, followed by [[IE Business School]] (in Spanish, Instituto de Empresas) in 1973, and AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland in 1974. In 1991, [[IEDC-Bled School of Management]] became the first school in the ex-socialist block of the Central and Eastern to offer an MBA degree.

===Bologna Accord===
In Europe, the recent [[Bologna Accord]] established uniformity in three levels of higher education: Bachelor (three or four years), Masters (one or two years, in addition to three or four years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (an additional three or four years after a Master). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]].

===Accreditation standards===
Accreditation standards are not uniform in Europe. Some countries have legal requirements for accreditation (e.g. most German states), in some there is a legal requirement only for universities of a certain type (e.g. Austria), and others have no accreditation law at all. Even where there is no legal requirement, many business schools are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by independent bodies voluntarily to ensure quality standards.

===Austria===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In Austria, MBA programs of [[private university|private universities]] have to be accredited by the Austrian Accreditation Council (''Österreichischer Akkreditierungsrat''). State-run universities have no accreditation requirements, however, some of them voluntarily undergo accreditation procedures by independent bodies. There are also MBA programs of non-academic business schools, who are entitled by the Austrian government to offer these programs until the end of 2012 (''Lehrgang universitären Charakters''). Some non-academic institutions cooperate with state-run universities to ensure legality of their degrees.

===Czech Republic===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
January 1999 saw the first meeting of the Association of the Czech MBA Schools (CAMBAS). The association is housed within the Centre for Doctoral and Managerial Studies of UEP, Prague. All of the founding members of the association to have their MBA programs accredited by partner institutions in the United Kingdom or United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The university of Finance and administration Prague|url=http://www.shortcoursesportal.eu/universities/1176/the-university-of-finance-and-administration-prague.html#tab:about|journal=Shortcoursesportal.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and French speaking countries===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In France and in the [[Francophone]] countries such as Switzerland, Monaco, Belgium, and Canada, the MBA degree programs at the public accredited schools are similar to those offered in the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] countries. Most French Business Schools are accredited by the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)|Conférence des Grandes Écoles]], which is an association of higher educational establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public education system.

===Germany===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Germany was one of the last Western countries to adopt the MBA degree. In 1998, the ''Hochschulrahmengesetz'' (Higher Education Framework Act), a German federal law regulating higher education including the types of degrees offered, was modified to permit German universities to offer master's degrees. The traditional German degree in business administration was the [[Diplom]] in ''Betriebswirtschaft'' (Diplom-Kaufmann) but since 1999, bachelor's and master's degrees have gradually replaced the traditional degrees due to the [[Bologna process]]. Today most German business schools offer the MBA. Most [[States of Germany|German states]] require that MBA degrees have to be accredited by one of the six agencies officially recognized by the German ''Akkreditierungsrat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akkreditierungsrat.de/index.php?id=44&amp;L=1|work=Akkreditierungsrat.de|title=Accreditation Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; (accreditation council), the German counterpart to the American [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation|CHEA]]. The busiest of these six agencies (in respect to MBA degrees) is the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA). All universities themselves have to be institutionally accredited by the state (''staatlich anerkannt'').

===Italy===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Italian MBAs programs at public accredited schools are similar to those offered elsewhere in Europe. Italian Business Schools are accredited by EQUIS and by ASFOR.

===Poland===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
There are several MBA programs offered in Poland. Some of these are run as partnerships with American or Canadian Universities. Others rely on their own faculty and enrich their courses by inviting visiting lecturers. Several MBA programs in Poland are also offered in English.

===Portugal===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Several business schools offer highly ranked MBA programs in Portugal. Portuguese MBA programs are increasingly internationally oriented, being taught in English.

===Spain===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Spain has a long history in offering MBA programs with three MBA programs frequently being ranked in the Top 25 worldwide by several international rankings. Spanish MBAs are culturally diverse and taught in English.

===Switzerland===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
There are several schools in Switzerland that offer an MBA as full-time, part-time and executive education programs. Some business schools that offer MBA programs with specializations such as Finance and Healthcare, technology management, and others. As a country with four different national languages (German, French, Italian and Romansh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/switzerland_how_to/daily_life/Languages.html?cid=29177618|title=SwissInfo.ch|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland offers most of its programs in English to attract international students to the country.

===Ukraine===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Recently MBA programs appeared in [[Ukraine]] where there are now about twenty schools of business offering a variety of MBA programs. Three of these are subsidiaries of European schools of business, while the remaining institutions are independent. Ukrainian MBA programs are concentrated mainly on particulars of business and management in Ukraine.
For example, 2/3 of all case studies are based on real conditions of Ukrainian companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbastrategy.ua/content/view/1078/312/lang,Eng/|title=MBA in Ukraine - MBA, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS,  бизнес-школы, Pre-MBA, бизнес образование.|website=www.mbastrategy.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
The UK-based [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA) was established in 1967 and is an active advocate for MBA degrees. The association's accreditation service is internationally recognised for all MBA, DBA and [[Masters in Business and Management (MBM)]] programs. AMBA also offer the only professional membership association for MBA students and graduates. UK MBA programs typically consist of a set number of taught courses plus a dissertation or project.

==Africa==
The Financial Times in its Executive Education Rankings for 2012 included 5 African business schools.

===Nigeria===

Business schools administered as colleges within the traditional universities offer a variety of MBA programs. In addition, a few standalone business schools allied with foreign business schools exist in Nigeria.

==Asia-Pacific==
{{main article|List of business schools in Asia}}
International MBA programs are acquiring brand value in Asia. For example, while a foreign MBA is still preferred in the Philippines, many students are now studying at one of many "Global MBA" English language programs being offered. English-only MBA programs are also offered in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. For international students who want a different experience, many Asian programs offer scholarships and discounted tuition to encourage an international environment in the classroom.

Rankings have been published for Asia Pacific schools by the magazine [[Asia Inc.]] which is a regional business magazine with distribution worldwide. The importance of MBA education in China has risen, too.&lt;ref&gt;Alon, Ilan and John R. McIntyre, eds.

There is little use of GMAT. The Business Schools conduct their own admission tests instead. Classes are taught in English.

===India===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

There are many business schools and colleges in India offering two-year MBA or PGDM programs accredited by AICTE or [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]].

The [[Indian Institutes of Management]] are among the world's most selective schools according to Bloomberg magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Erin Zlomek|title=India's IIM-A, the World's Toughest B-School to Get Into|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-04-18/indias-iim-a-the-worlds-toughest-b-school-to-get-into|accessdate=4 May 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They offer a post graduate degree in management.

===Japan===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

In Japan 2 business schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The concept of an MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies have been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The New York Times | title=M.B.A.s in Japan Struggle for Respect

===Pakistan===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

Pakistan first offered an MBA program outside the United States in 1955 in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania.

===Australia===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
{{main article|List of business schools in Australia}}

In Australia, 42 Australian business schools offer the MBA degree (16 are AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS accredited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accredited Business Schools in Australia|url=http://www.mba.today/schools/australia|website=MBA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Universities differentiate themselves by gaining international accreditation and focusing on national and international rankings. Most MBAs are one to two years full-time. There is little use of GMAT, and instead each educational institution specifies its own requirements, which normally entails several years of management-level work experience as well as proven academic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infozee.com/channels/mba/australia/mba-australia.htm | title=Business Schools in Australia (MBA) | publisher=INFOZEE | accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graduate Management Association of Australia]] carries out ratings for Australian MBAs and annually publishes [[Australian MBA Star Ratings]].
The Financial Review Boss carries out biennial rankings of Australian MBAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.afr.com/it-pro/boss-2013-mbaranking-the-table-20131010-j0en3 | title=Boss 2013 MBA Ranking: the table | work=AFR Boss | date=12 September 2013 | accessdate=26 April 2015 |author1=Uther, Beverley |author2=Suchy, Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

In New Zealand, most universities offer MBA classes, typically through part-time arrangement or evening classes.  Only two universities offer full-time programs to international students - University of Otago (Otago MBA) and Auckland University of Technology (AUT).  The Otago MBA is the longer established of the two, offering a 240 points program while AUT MBA is a 180-point program.

=== South Korea ===
Korean universities offer full-time and part-time MBA programs that usually consist of a two-year curriculum. The first MBA program was offered in 1963 by Korea University Business School (KUBS). In 2007, the Korean Government established "BK21," a project that supports Korean universities in order to develop their competitiveness in the global MBA market. Korea University Business School topped the evaluation of BK21 professional business graduate schools for six consecutive years. In the meantime, only two universities in Korea ranked in the "2015 Global Top 100 Executive MBA (EMBA) Rankings" conducted by UK Financial Times (Korea University Business School and Yonsei University ranked 27th and 45th worldwide, respectively).

Since 1967, publications have ranked MBA programs using various methods.&lt;ref name="whatswrong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong With MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |year=1993 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |accessdate=22 July 2011 |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Gourman Report]]'' (1967–1997) did not disclose criteria or ranking methods,&lt;ref&gt;Selingo, Jeffrey. [http://chronicle.com/free/v44/i11/11a00101.htm A Self-Published College Guide Goes Big-Time, and Educators Cry Foul]. ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (7 November 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and these reports were criticized for reporting statistically impossible data, such as no ties among schools, narrow gaps in scores with no variation in gap widths, and ranks of nonexistent departments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bedeian, Arthur G.]] [http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/tipjan02/07bedeian.aspx Caveat Emptor: The Gourman Report]. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist'' (June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 ''The Carter Report'' ranked MBA programs based on the number of academic articles published by faculty, the ''Ladd &amp; Lipset Survey'' ranked business schools based on faculty surveys, and ''MBA Magazine'' ranked schools based on votes cast by business school deans.&lt;ref name="whatswrong" /&gt;

Today, publications by the [[Aspen Institute]], ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''  make their own rankings of MBA programs. Schools' ranks can vary across publications, as the methodologies for rankings differ among publications:

* The [[Aspen Institute]] publishes the ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' rankings which are based on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Rankings from a small sample of well-known schools are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=18 June 2011|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Business Week''{{'}}s rankings are based on student surveys, a survey of corporate recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2006/bs20060420_4380.htm#MBA1|title=MBA Rankings: Updated October 2006|accessdate=18 December 2007|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|work=Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], published in ''The Economist'', surveys both business schools (80%) and students and recent graduates (20%). Ranking criteria include GMAT scores, employment and salary statistics, class options, and student body demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mba.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=wmba_rank_method|title=Rankings methodology|accessdate=19 December 2007|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Financial Times'' uses survey responses from alumni who graduated three years prior to the ranking and information from business schools. Salary and employment statistics are weighted heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How to read the rankings: How the raw data are processed|accessdate=25 December 2007|date=29 January 2007|work=The Financial Times |author=Milton, Ursula|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217140636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html |archivedate=17 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Forbes'' considers only the return of investment five years after graduation. MBA alumni are asked about their salary, the tuition fees of their MBA program and other direct costs as well as opportunity costs involved. Based on this data, a final "5-year gain" is calculated and determines the MBA ranking position.&lt;ref name="Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/08/03/the-best-business-schools/|accessdate=3 August 2011|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] ''QS Global 200 Business Schools Report'' compiles regional rankings of business schools around the world. Ranks are calculated using a two-year moving average of points assigned by employers who hire MBA graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topmba.com/mba-rankings/global-200-business-schools-report/survey-sample-and-methodology/ |title=Global Business Schools Report Methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of hiring professionals. The ranking is calculated through a weighted formula of quality assessment (40%), placement success (35%), and student selectivity (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=18 December 2007|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''UT-Dallas Top 100 Business School Research Rankings'' ranks business schools on the research faculty publish, similar to ''The Carter Report'' of the past.&lt;ref name="Does The World Need Another B-School Ranking?"&gt;{{cite web|title=The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings: Research Ranking Overview|url=http://jindal.utdallas.edu/the-utd-top-100-business-school-research-rankings//|publisher=UT Dallas|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Wall Street Journal'', which stopped ranking full-time MBA programs in 2007, based its rankings on skill and behavioral development that may predict career success, such as social skills, teamwork orientation, ethics, and analytic and problem-solving abilities.&lt;ref name="How the Rankings were Compiled"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Rankings were Compiled|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204251404574344784066900244|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caution and Controversy |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |accessdate=6 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, INSEAD, Wharton and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hemel |first=Daniel J |title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=12 April 2004 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 |accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can approximately duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would use objective measures of program quality and be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt; National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.

==Criticism==
The media raised questions about the value and content of business school programs after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In general, graduates had reportedly tended to go into finance after receiving their degrees.&lt;ref name="retrain"&gt;{{cite news|author=Holland, Kelley | title=Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/y15/business/15school.html | date=14 March 2009 | newspaper=Th York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial professionals are widely seen as responsible for the global economic meltdown, anecdotal evidence suggests new graduates are choosing different career paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stossel, John | title=The New Normal | publisher=ABC News | newspaper=20/20 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deans at top business schools have acknowledged that media and public perception of the MBA degree shifted as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="overhaul"&gt;{{cite news | author=Bradshaw, Della | title=Deans fight crisis fires with MBA overhaul | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2353870-53c4-11de-be08-00144feabdc0.html | date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles have been written about public perceptions of the crisis, ranging from schools' acknowledgment of issues with the training students receive&lt;ref name="retrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overhaul"/&gt; to criticisms of the MBA's role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Stewart, Matthew | title=RIP, MBA | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29895258 | date=25 March 2009 | publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MBA title has acquired a mixed reputation in that the MBA curriculum tends to educate students in the "[[greed]] is good" direction based on various simplistic assumptions about human behaviour.&lt;ref name="Parker 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Parker | first=Martin | title=Why we should bulldoze the business school | website=the Guardian | date=2018-04-27 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school | access-date=2018-05-24|quote=There are 13,000 business schools on Earth.

The '''National Literacy Mission''' ('''NLM''') is a nationwide program started by [[Government of India]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/spotlight/spotlight_archive.php?id=20  National Literacy Mission] [[Government of India]] portal.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to educate 80 million adults in the age group of 15 - 35 over an eighty-year period. By "[[literacy]]", the NLM means not only learning how to read, write and count but also helping people understand why they are deprived and helping them move towards change.

== History ==
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
National Literacy Mission (NLM) was set up by the Indian government on 5 May, 1988. NLM works under the guidance of the National Literacy Mission Authority, an independent wing of the [[Minister of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resources and Development]].

NLM initially had two flagship programs - "Total Literacy" and "[[Post literacy]]". The initiative was revitalized on 30 September, 1999, when they were combined as a single program: 'Literacy Campaigns and Operation Restoration'.

The NLM initiated its first successful campaign in [[Kottayam]] city of [[Kerala]] followed by [[Ernakulam district]]. Up until November 2002, 596 districts out of the total 640 districts of the country had been covered under Total Literacy. 191 were in the post literacy phase while 238 were in the continuing education phase.

In 1999 [[UNESCO]] conferred upon it their [[Noma Literacy Prize]]. It received jury appreciation for the teaching material it had produced and for raising the awareness of quality primary education in schools.

NLM works with [[NGO]]s across the country, providing financial assistance for those that actively participate.

In India, 81% of youths from ages 15–24 and 63% of all adults are literate, based on a 2005 - 2010 UNESCO study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/uil/litbase/?menu=9&amp;programme=132]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the [[Socratic dialogue]] by [[Xenophon]]|the similarly named treatise sometimes said to be written by [[Aristotle]]|Economics (Aristotle)}}
The '''''Oeconomicus''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Οἰκονομικός}}) by [[Xenophon]] is a [[Socratic method|Socratic]] dialogue principally about [[household]] [[management]] and [[agriculture]]. 

It is one of the earliest works on [[economics]] in its original sense of household management, and a significant source for the social and intellectual history of Classical [[history of Athens|Athens]]. Beyond the emphasis on household economics, the dialogue treats such topics as the qualities and relationships of men and women, [[rural]] vs. [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slavery]], [[religion]], and [[education]].

[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] states that the ''Oeconomicus'' can actually be seen as a treatise on success in leading both an army and a state.

Scholars lean towards a relatively late date in Xenophon's life for the composition of the ''Oeconomicus'', perhaps after 362 BC. [[Cicero]] translated the ''Oeconomicus'' into [[Latin]], and the work gained popularity during the [[Renaissance]] in a number of translations.

==Summary==
The opening framing dialogue is between  Socrates and Critoboulus, the son of [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]]. There Socrates discusses  the meaning of wealth and identifies it with usefulness and well-being, not merely possessions. He links [[moderation]] and hard [[manual labour|work]] to success in household management. The dramatic date of this part of the work can be no earlier than 401 BC, as the [[Battle of Cunaxa]] is referred to at 4.18.

When Critoboulus asks about the practices involved in household management, Socrates pleads ignorance on the subject but relates what he heard of it from an Athenian  [[gentleman]]-[[farmer]] (''[[kalokagathia|kaloskagathos]]'') named Ischomachus. In the discussion related by Socrates, Ischomachus describes the methods he used to educate his wife in [[housekeeping]], their practices in [[governance|ruling]] and [[training]] slaves, and the [[technology]] involved in farming. Approximately two thirds of the dialogue concerns the discussion between Socrates and Ischomachus. There is no final reversion to further discussion with Critoboulos.

==Commentary and interpretation==
[[Leo Strauss]] wrote a [[political]]-[[philosophical]] commentary on the dialogue. He took the ''Oeconomicus'' as a more [[irony|ironic]] examination of the nature of the gentleman, [[virtue]], and domestic relationships.

[[Michel Foucault]] devoted a chapter in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976–1984) to "Ischomachus' Household". He took Xenophon's depiction of the relationship between Ischomachus and his wife as a classical expression of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[ideology]] of [[political power|power]], according to which a man's control of his [[emotions]] was externally reflected in his control of his wife, his slaves, and his political subordinates. 

Following Foucault, [[feminist]] [[scholars]] and [[social history|social historians]] such as [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]] have explored the ''Oeconomicus'' as a source for Greek attitudes to the relationship between men and women, but successive interpretations have differed. Some see Xenophon's attitude toward women as [[misogynist]] and [[patriarchal]], while others maintain that he was a proto-feminist in certain ways.  

Some have taken Xenophon's use of Ischomachus as a supposed [[expert]] in the education of a wife as an instance of anachronistic irony, a device used by [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogues]]. This ironic line of interpretation sees Ischomachus as a target of [[satire]] rather than a stand-in for Xenophon. Some have suggested that the Ischomachus of the dialogue is the same man whose family became the subject of ridicule in Athenian political oratory. After this Ischomachus died, his widow moved in with her daughter and son-in-law Callias and soon became pregnant with the man's child, which eventually led to the daughter's [[suicide]] attempt. Callias was frequently parodied in Athenian comedies for his [[Human sexuality|sexual]] excesses and [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]].

The import of such irony has also been the subject of much contention: are his wife's actions a sign of a bad education or just the inevitable result of the loss of the controlling influence in her life? How responsible was Ischomachus for his daughter's marriage to a man of such poor [[moral character|character]]?

'''Pakistan studies curriculum''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|مطالعہ پاکستان}}}}  ''{{transl|ur|Muṭāla e-Pākistān}}'') is the name&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan - EDITORIAL: Good news about curriculum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan: School curriculum ‘enlightened’; Two-Nation Theory explained: ‘Muslim deprivation, not religion, led to independence’"/&gt; of a curriculum of academic research and study that encompasses the [[Culture of Pakistan|culture]], [[Demographics of Pakistan|demographics]], [[Geography of Pakistan|geography]], [[History of Pakistan|history]], and [[Politics of Pakistan|politics]] of [[Pakistan]]. The subject is widely researched in and outside the country. Several [[List of universities in Pakistan|universities]] in Pakistan have departments and research centers dedicated to the subject, whereas many independent [[List of Research Institutes in Pakistan|research institutes]] carry out multidisciplinary research on Pakistan Studies. There are also a number of [[international organisation|international organization]]s that are engaged in collaborative teaching, research, and exchange activities on the subject.

== International organizations ==
As the second largest [[South Asia]]n country, and one of the major actors in the politics of the [[Muslim world]], Pakistan is a focus of multidisciplinary studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan Workshop (2007) [http://www.psg.anthropology.ac.uk/workshop2007/psg_meeting_07.html Conference programme and paper abstracts]. Workshop organised by [http://psg.anthropology.ac.uk/ Pakistan Studies Group] at [[University of Leeds]].  Retrieved on 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Various universities in the United States and the United Kingdom have research groups busy in academic and research related activities on Pakistan Studies. One such example is the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|American Institute of Pakistan Studies]] (AIPS) at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], established since 1973. An affiliate of the [[Association for Asian Studies]], the institute regularly holds events such as seminars, public lectures, and conferences on various topics related to the Pakistan Studies. It also offers annual international fellowships for the research on materials relating to the history and culture of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;See the official website of the institute at http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org/ Retrieved on 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2004, AIPS organized an international workshop on the [[Salt Range]] Culture Zone of Pakistan at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;ref&gt;Meister, M.W. (2006). [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/arth/meister/pakistan.html Salt Range Temples, Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608095736/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/arth/meister/pakistan.html |date=8 June 2008 }}. Retrieved on 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The event provided the international audience with an opportunity to understand the [[Archaeology of Pakistan|archaeological]] and [[Pakistani architecture|architectural]] heritage of the country.

Another academic initiative is the British Association for Pakistan Studies that was established in 1989. The forum has wider views on the topic than the common [[historiography|historiographical]] contexts, and encourages research and dialogue that involves both the academics and practitioners. The forum acknowledges that the topic has not received the sort of individual attention that the country and its society deserve, and therefore strives to increase international awareness on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Malik, I.H. (1996). [http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn7/south/baps.html The British Association for Pakistan Studies]. International Institute for Asian Studies. Newsletter 7. Retrieved on 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also larger multinational and multicultural organizations that provide pluralist platforms for the discussions and debates on Pakistan Studies within the wider contexts of Asia. [[The Asia Foundation]], for example, has launched specific projects for a diverse understanding of the subject through actions on local governance, civil society, human rights, and healthcare&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiafoundation.org/project/projectsearch.php?country=pakistan Pakistan Projects] at [http://asiafoundation.org/ The Asia Foundation] website. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as political, economic, [[Court system of Pakistan|judicial]], and foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;AF (2000).

=== Curriculum ===
Pakistan Studies is one of the few heritage subjects&lt;ref&gt;CIE (2006). [http://www.cie.org.uk/docs/countries/UK/CIE_response_DfES_consultation_IGCSE Education and Skills consultation on IGCSE]. p.6. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Ordinary Level|O-level]]&lt;ref&gt;CIE (2008a).[http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/middlesec/olevel/subject?assdef_id=929 Cambridge International O Level]. Retrieved on 4 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IGCSE]] qualifications governed by [[Cambridge International Examinations]]. The syllabus covers Pakistan's history, cultural heritage, [[National symbols of Pakistan|national identity]], geography, economy, and environment, as well as the challenges and opportunities faced by the country.&lt;ref&gt;CIE (2008b).[http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/middlesec/igcse/subject?assdef_id=876 Cambridge IGCSE]. Retrieved on 4 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, the subject is one of the three compulsory courses (along with the [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[English language]] courses) at the [[Secondary School Certificate|Secondary School]] and [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|Higher Secondary]] school levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;AKDN (2004). ''[http://www.agakhanschools.org/pakistan/akhsshunza/curriculum.asp Curriculum for the Aga Khan Higher Secondary School, Hunza]''. Aga Khan Development Network. Retrieved on 4 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is also taught as a degree course at most of the [[Social Science]] departments in many universities. There are also university departments dedicated to the education and research in Pakistan Studies.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.fuuast.edu.pk/english/departments/gc/pakst/default.asp Department of Pakistan Studies] at [[Federal Urdu University]], [[Karachi]]. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these departments provide degree programmes for in-depth studies, as well as research facilities for [[M.Phil]] and [[PhD]] scholars. Courses broadly range from the history, politics and [[Languages of Pakistan|linguistics]] to the country's geography and economics, and from [[Foreign relations of Pakistan|foreign affairs]] and [[Religion in Pakistan|religion studies]] to the social relations and [[Pakistani literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bzu.edu.pk/pakstudies/index.asp Department of Pakistan Studies] at [[Bahauddin Zakariya University]], [[Multan]]. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The focused attention on the subject at higher education levels means a wider scope for the research, thus making the subject an increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] one.

=== Curriculum issues ===
The variable political history of Pakistan shows the country being ruled alternately by the civilian and [[Pakistani Armed Forces|military]] leaderships. This lack of political succession has had its effects on the way the history was depicted in the curricula of Pakistan Studies until 2006, which increasingly portrayed what Rubina Saigol termed as 'glorification of military'.&lt;ref&gt;Saigol, R. (1995). ''Knowledge and Identity – Articulation of Gender in Educational Discourse in Pakistan''. ASR. [[Lahore]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the occasional attempts to alter the historical texts did not escape criticisms from the academics and scholars in Pakistan and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pervez Hoodbhoy|Hoodbhoy, P.A.]] and [[A H Nayyar|Nayyar, A.H.]] (1985). [http://www.sacw.net/HateEducation/1985HoodbhoyNayyar06022005.html Rewriting the History of Pakistan]. In A. Khan (ed.) ''Islam, Politics and the State: The Pakistan Experience''. Zed Books. London. pp. 164–177.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ayesha Jalal]] in her 1995 article also raised concerns over the trends of official [[historiography]] in Pakistan's history textbooks.
&lt;ref&gt;Jalal, A. (1995). [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438(199502)27:1%3C73:CPHAOI%3E2.0.CO;2-0 Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining]. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies''. 27(1). pp. 73–89.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Yvette Rosser]], in an article based on her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Rosser, Y.C. (2003). ''[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/rosseryc036/rosseryc036.pdf Curriculum as Destiny: Forging National Identity in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911035259/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/rosseryc036/rosseryc036.pdf |date=11 September 2008 }}''. PhD dissertation. [[The University of Texas at Austin]]. August. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; regards such curriculum as a composite of patriotic discourses. She identifies significant defects, inherent contradictions and inaccurate information within educational syllabus in general and the Pakistan Studies textbooks in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser, Y.C. (2005). [http://www.electronicpublications.org/stuff.php?id=110 Cognitive Dissonance in Pakistan Studies Textbooks: Educational Practices of an Islamic State]. ''Journal of Islamic State Practices in International Law''. 1(2). pp. 4–15&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]] in Pakistan published a report that had emerged from a survey of text books of [[Urdu]], [[English language|English]], [[Social Studies]] and [[Civics]] subjects being taught at the secondary and higher secondary school levels.&lt;ref name=sdpi&gt;Nayyar, A.H. and Salim, A. (eds.)(2003). [http://www.sdpi.org/whats_new/reporton/State%20of%20Curr&amp;TextBooks.pdf The subtle Subversion: A report on Curricula and Textbooks in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109090607/http://www.sdpi.org/whats_new/reporton/State%20of%20Curr%26TextBooks.pdf |date=9 November 2005 }}. Report of the project ''A Civil Society Initiative in Curricula and Textbooks Reform''. Sustainable Development Policy Institute, Islamabad.&lt;/ref&gt; The survey identified inaccuracies of fact and omissions that appeared to distort the significance of actual events in the country's history. Some of the prominent issues included the lack of understanding towards the civil society, religious diversity, and gender relations. The report recommended for major structural reforms and establishment of a National Education Advisory Board to centralise the curriculum development and carry out regular revisions.&lt;ref&gt;Nayyar and Salim (2003). pp. ix–xi&lt;/ref&gt; 

About the international perception of the subject, Burzine Waghmar of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] argues that Pakistan Studies is increasingly perceived with sonorous sessions on weapons control, [[civil unrest]], [[bonded labour]], [[gender inequality]] and the like.&lt;ref name="waghmar"&gt;Waghmar, B. (2005). ''[http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050227/books4.htm Pakistan Studies: The State of the Craft]''. [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]. 27 February. p. 5. Retrieved on 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are considered among major hurdles to the wider international interest in the subject. Waghmar concludes that Pakistan and India, among other [[oriental]] societies, are plagued by visceral [[nationalism]] and post-imperial neurosis where state-sanctioned dogmas suppress eclectic historical readings.&lt;ref name="waghmar" /&gt;

According to the [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]] report 'Associated with the insistence on the Ideology of Pakistan has been an essential component of hate against India and the Hindus.  For the upholders of the Ideology of Pakistan, the existence of Pakistan is defined only in relation to Hindus, and hence the Hindus have to be painted as negatively as possible'&lt;ref name=sdpi/&gt;  A 2005 report by the National Commission for Justice and Peace a non profit organization in Pakistan,  found that Pakistan Studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy-makers have attempted to inculcate towards the Hindus. 'Vituperative animosities legitimise military and autocratic rule, nurturing a siege mentality.  Pakistan Studies textbooks are an active site to represent India as a hostile neighbour' the report stated. 'The story of Pakistan’s past is intentionally written to be distinct from, and often in direct contrast with, interpretations of history found in India. From the government-issued textbooks, students are taught that Hindus are backward and superstitious.'  Further the report stated 'Textbooks reflect intentional obfuscation. Today’s students, citizens of Pakistan and its future leaders are the victims of these partial truths'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C04%5C25%5Cstory_25-4-2006_pg7_26 Hate mongering worries minorities], [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]], 2006-04-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times Report: In Pakistan's Public Schools, Jihad Still Part of Lesson Plan - The Muslim nation's public school texts still promote hatred and jihad, reformers say."&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/18/world/fg-schools18 In Pakistan's Public Schools, Jihad Still Part of Lesson Plan – The Muslim nation's public school texts still promote hatred and jihad, reformers say.] By Paul Watson, Times Staff Writer; 18 August 2005; [[Los Angeles Times]]. 4 Page article online Retrieved on 2 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outlook India Magazine Report: Primers Of Hate - History or biology, Pakistani students get anti-India lessons in all their textbooks; 'Hindu, Enemy Of Islam' - These are extracts from government-sponsored textbooks approved by the National Curriculum Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education."&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003427/http://www.outlookindia.com/fullprint.asp?choice=2&amp;fodname=20051010&amp;fname=Pakistan+(F)&amp;sid=1 Primers Of Hate – History or biology, Pakistani students get anti-India lessons in all their textbooks; 'Hindu, Enemy Of Islam' – These are extracts from government-sponsored textbooks approved by the National Curriculum Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education.] By AMIR MIR; 10 Oct 2005; [[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook India Magazine]] Retrieved on 2 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jul/16guest.htm Noor's cure: A contrast in views]; by Arindam Banerji; 16 July 2003; [[Rediff.com|Rediff India Abroad]] Retrieved on 2 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in Pakistan's oldest newspaper [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] commenting on a report in [[The Guardian]] on Pakistani Textbooks noted 'By propagating concepts such as [[jihad]], the inferiority of non-Muslims, India’s ingrained enmity with Pakistan, etc., the textbook board publications used by all government schools promote a mindset that is bigoted and obscurantist. Since there are more children studying in these schools than in [[madrassahs]] the damage done is greater. '&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-curriculum-of-hatred--03 Curriculum of hatred], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-05-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn: ‘School texts spreading more extremism than seminaries’"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/national/school-texts-spreading-more-extremism-than-seminaries-959 ‘School texts spreading more extremism than seminaries’] By Our Special Correspondent; Tuesday, 19 May 2009; [[Dawn Newspaper]]. Retrieved 1 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the historian Professor [[Mubarak Ali]], textbook reform in Pakistan began with the introduction of Pakistan Studies and Islamic studies by [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] in 1971 into the national curriculum as compulsory subject.  Former military dictator Gen [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] under a general drive towards Islamization, started the process of historical revisionism in earnest and exploited this initiative.  'The Pakistani establishment taught their children right from the beginning that this state was built on the basis of religion – that's why they don't have tolerance for other religions and want to wipe-out all of them.'&lt;ref name="Dawn: ‘School texts spreading more extremism than seminaries’"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/18/pakistan-textbooks-religious-extremism The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts], [[The Guardian]], 2009-05-18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], a physics professor at [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] in [[Islamabad]], the [[Islamization|Islamizing]] of Pakistan's schools began in 1976 when an act of parliament required all government and private schools (except those teaching the British O-levels from Grade 9) to follow a curriculum that includes learning outcomes for the federally approved Grade 5 social studies class such as: 'Acknowledge and identify forces that may be working against Pakistan,' 'Make speeches on Jihad,' 'Collect pictures of policemen, soldiers, and national guards,' and 'India's evil designs against Pakistan.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0121/p04s03-wosc.html?page=1 Pakistan: Do school texts fuel bias?], [[Christian Science Monitor]], 2009-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to [[NCERT]]'s extensive review of textbooks in India in 2004, Verghese considered the erosion of plural and democratic values in textbooks in India, and the distortion of history in Pakistan to imply the need for coordination between Bangladeshi, Indian, and Pakistani historians to produce a composite history of the [[South Asia]] as a common reader.&lt;ref&gt;Verghese, B.G. (2004). ''[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/06/23/stories/2004062301721000.htm Myth and hate as history]''. [[The Hindu]]. 23 June. Retrieved on 7 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, international scholars also warn that any attempt for [[Education reform|educational reforms]] under international pressure or market demands should not overlook the specific expectations of the people at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, M.J. (2006). [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/as.2006.46.5.699?cookieSet=1 Muslims, Markets, and the Meaning of ‘A Good Education’ in Pakistan]. ''Asian Survey''. 46(5). pp. 699–720.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curriculum reforms ===
Following the extensive media debate and academic reiteration on the need to update the curriculum at all levels of education, the [[Government of Pakistan]] carried out measures in 2006 to improve the national curriculum for Pakistan Studies.&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan - EDITORIAL: Good news about curriculum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan: School curriculum ‘enlightened’; Two-Nation Theory explained: ‘Muslim deprivation, not religion, led to independence’"&gt;Irfan Ghauri (2006), [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\12\07\story_7-12-2006_pg1_1 School curriculum ‘enlightened’; Two-Nation Theory explained: ‘Muslim deprivation, not religion, led to independence’ – * New Pak Studies syllabus ‘eliminates prejudice against non-Muslims’ – * Includes concept of ‘enlightened moderation’, economic and privatisation policies, October 1999 coup]; [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] – A new voice for a new Pakistan, 7 December. Retrieved on 3 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
These actions were based on the earlier studies and recommendations by the former [[University Grants Commission (Pakistan)|University Grants Commission]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;UGC (2001). [http://www.hec.gov.pk/AcademicAffairs/Curriculam_Revision/download/Curriculms_pdf/Pak_studies_optional.pdf Revised Curriculum of Pakistan Studies]. ''Curriculum Development Project''.

Retrieved on 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and then later by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC) in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;HEC (2003).

[[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)]]. Islamabad. Retrieved on 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new curriculum, for secondary and higher school certificates, was implemented from 2007 to include the political history from pre-independence to the modern times, international relations, evolution of the country's economy and demographics, diversity of regional cultures and languages, and the status of religious groups with specific reference to [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]’s views that he expressed at his speech of 11 August 1947.&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan: School curriculum ‘enlightened’; Two-Nation Theory explained: ‘Muslim deprivation, not religion, led to independence’"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinnah, M.A. (1947). ''[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/speech03.htm Presidential Address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]''. 11 August. Retrieved on 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It also eliminates prejudice against non-Muslims, efforts have been made to exclude all such material that promotes prejudice against the non-Muslims of pre-independence India.&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan - EDITORIAL: Good news about curriculum"&gt;EDITORIAL (2006), [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\12\07\story_7-12-2006_pg1_1 Good news about curriculum]; [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]] – A new voice for a new Pakistan, 8 December. Retrieved on 3 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan: School curriculum ‘enlightened’; Two-Nation Theory explained: ‘Muslim deprivation, not religion, led to independence’"/&gt; 

Subsequently, the need was also realised to standardise the subject framework across the [[university degree]]s. As a result, in 2007, the Curriculum Division at the HEC revised the syllabus for the degrees of [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Science]] in Pakistan Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Interface (2007). ''[http://www.interface.edu.pk/students/Nov-07/Pakistan-Studies-curriculum.asp HEC revises curriculum of Pakistan Studies]''. 21 November.

Curriculum Division. Higher Education Commission. Islamabad. Retrieved on 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations also imply the needs for training the teachers to improve their communication skills in accordance with the new structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">The '''Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security (PHP)''' is an open source website reference compilation, research project, and analysis nexus sparked by the progressive increase in the declassification of [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet bloc]] documents related to [[Cold War]] activities, as viewed by both sides. Currently, research into Soviet bloc archives has expanded the project's scope to the Global Cold War, with views specifically on the [[Subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]] and Southeast Asia.

According to the site:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[PHP] seeks to collect, analyze, and interpret these premier sources for the study of contemporary international history.  By relating them to current security issues, the PHP enhances their understanding by highlighting how they differ from the recent past. It explores how the different alliance experiences have influenced the attitudes and behavior of the present members of the enlarged NATO and the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Parallel History Project is based at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] and is run in partnership with the [[International Relations and Security Network|International Relations and Security Network (ISN)]] and the [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]]. [[Vojtech Mastny]] has been the project's coordinator.

'''Record type''' is a family of [[typeface]]s designed to allow [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts (specifically those from England) to be published as near-[[facsimile]]s of the originals. The typefaces include a large number of special characters intended to replicate the various [[scribal abbreviation]]s and other unusual [[glyph]]s typically found in such manuscripts. They were used in the publication of [[archive|archival texts]] between 1774 and 1900.

==History==

Record type was originally developed in the 1770s when plans were under way for the [[publication of Domesday Book]]. Early experiments in using special typefaces were not successful, but in 1773 the printer [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] designed a record type for an extract from Domesday to be included in [[John Hutchins (antiquary)|John Hutchins]]' ''History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset'' (published in 1774). He was so pleased with the result that he and the co-editor of Domesday, [[Abraham Farley]], persuaded the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] that the typeface should be adopted for the main Domesday project. It was consequently used in [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley's edition (1773–1783)|Farley's edition of Domesday Book]], published in 1783. Nichols regarded the design as among his greatest achievements, stating that "on the correctness and beauty of this important Work, I am prepared to stake my typographical credit".&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 377–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original Domesday type was destroyed in the fire at Nichols' office in 1808,&lt;ref&gt;Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 379n.&lt;/ref&gt; but a modified form of record type was widely used during the first half of the 19th century in the publications of the [[Record Commission]]. It was subsequently used in the publications of the [[Pipe rolls#Publication|Pipe Roll Society]] from 1884 until 1900; and in 1890 in a single volume published by the [[Selden Society]] (despite the misgivings of the society's founder, [[Frederic William Maitland|F. W. Maitland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=William Paley |editor-last=Baildon |title=Select Civil Pleas: Volume 1, A.D. 1200–1203 |series=Selden Society |volume=3 |publisher=Selden Society |place=London |year=1890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=D. E. C. |last1=Yale |first2=J. H. |last2=Baker |author2-link=John Baker (legal historian) |title=A Centenary Guide to the Publications of the Selden Society |publisher=Selden Society |place=London |year=1987 |pages=22, 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Selden Society's experiment was not repeated, and at a General Meeting held in 1903 the Pipe Roll Society decided to abandon record type in favour of publishing its texts "''in extenso''" (i.e. with all abbreviations extended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Roll of the Pipe for the Twenty-Second Year of the Reign of King Henry the Second: A.D. 1175–1176 |series=Pipe Roll Society |volume=25 |place=London |year=1904 |pages=vii–viii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Record type fell out of favour because its merits (primarily the fact that, given accurate transcription, the reader was presented with exactly what appeared on the manuscript page) were increasingly felt to be outweighed by its disadvantages: the high costs of typesetting and proofreading, and the challenges to the reader presented by a text prepared with minimal editorial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, technical advances by the late 19th century meant that, in cases where there was a genuine argument for facsimile publication, this could be achieved more satisfactorily, cheaply and accurately by means of [[photozincography]] and other photographic printing techniques. 

Paul Harvey regards record type as falling "badly between two stools, giving less than a facsimile on the one hand, less than an extended text on the other".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, L. C. Hector has argued that the modest amount of rationalisation and standardisation required to set a manuscript in record type resulted in a "half-way stage towards the interpretation of the abbreviations" that remains a useful tool to assist the novice in medieval [[palaeography]].&lt;ref&gt;Hector 1966, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Trice Martin's ''The Record Interpreter'' (first edition 1892; second edition 1910), which remains a standard handbook for the interpretation of English medieval manuscript texts, employs a version of record type to present abbreviated words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Trice Martin |title=The Record Interpreter: a collection of abbreviations, Latin words and names used in English historical manuscripts and records |edition=2nd |year=1910 |place=London |publisher=Stevens and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuing desire in the digital age to represent the special characters of medieval texts in typographical form is demonstrated by the establishment in 2001 of the [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative]], which aims to coordinate the encoding and display of such characters.

'''''Rise of Industry''''' is a business [[tycoon game]], developed by British indie team Dapper Penguin Studios and published by Kasedo Games. The game sees players build and manage their industrial empire as they attempt to grow and expand in the early 20th century. 

The game was released to [[early access]] on February 9, 2018, primarily through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com|GOG]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Gameplay ==
In ''Rise of Industry'', players begin with a sum of money and a map on which to build which is shared with several AI controlled towns and villages. It is your aim as the player to build an industrial empire by supplying these towns and villages with the products they demand.

There are currently two main game modes, Career and Sandbox. In career mode, the player must choose a specialism in which to begin their empire. There are four specialisms to choose from: Gathering, Farming, Industry and Logistics. While all remain open for the player to use, the chosen specialism will grant more Research &amp; Development points, which are used to upgrade in the tech tree. In Sandbox mode, all unlocks are available and the player can build without research and financial limitations.

A game is played on a map which is broken up into regions, each requiring the player to buy a permit in order to build within that region. There are two permit types; a full build permit which enables you to build anything within that region and a logistical permit which will allow the placement of network elements such as railway tracks and roads but not buildings. The player can then start to place buildings such as factories, farms, gatherers etc and then sell products to towns and villages requiring them. The price paid for your products is set by a global supply and demand system. The more of a product that is available, the less money you will receive, however towns will pay a premium for good that aren't as plentiful. The towns won't just rely on the player to get produce though. They will look to either produce a demanded item themselves, or look for a trade connection with neighbouring towns. 

Trade routes play a large part in the game as a function to move your products from A to B. The player can create a trade route for a variety of transport including trucks, boats, trains and zeppelins with each mode of transport having an advantage over an other depending on the distance and capacity needed for each route.

== Development ==
The game was originally named ''Project Automata'' in early development. Its name was changed to ''Rise of Industry'' in early 2017.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

''Rise of Industry'' was released as a [[pre-alpha]] version on indie video game store, [[itch.io]] in order to gain player feedback in order to improve gameplay before the official [[early access]] release. During this time, Rise of Industry became the most purchased game of 2017 on Itch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/itch-io-had-a-bumper-2017-adding-100000-new-projects/|title=Itch.io Had A Bumper 2017, Adding 100,000 New Projects|date=2018-01-05|work=Kotaku Australia|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itch.io/blog/19998/itchio-year-in-review-2017|title=itch.io year in review 2017 - itch.io|website=itch.io|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun|''Rock Paper Shotgun'']] said that ''Rise of Industry''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s early access release was "full of neat ideas" but that "they might wait until further updates to play again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/27/rise-of-industry-early-access-review/#more-520439|title=Premature Evaluation: Rise of Industry|date=2018-02-27|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called it a "fairly deep sim", although they thought that the lack of flexibility in the game "could put people off".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/production-sim-rise-of-industry-enters-early-access/|title=Production sim Rise of Industry enters Early Access|last=|first=|date=|work=PC Gamer|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' however praised Dapper Penguin Studios for "their total openness to their community" and "great willingness to listen to player feedback", stating "this is exactly how an Early Access release should be handled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/02/12/get-deep-into-logistics-with-rise-of-industry/289885/|title=Get Deep into Logistics with Rise of Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=Hardcore Gamer|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Kent "Bobby" Gooch''' (September 26, 1893 &amp;ndash; May 22, 1982) was an [[American football]] player and [[track and field|track]] athlete. Gooch was a [[quarterback]] for the [[Virginia Cavaliers football]] team of the [[University of Virginia]].  He was named a [[Rhodes Scholar]], but the [[First World War]] interrupted his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.artsandsciences.virginia.edu/sites/college.artsandsciences.virginia.edu/files/Bio-Robert.K.Gooch.pdf|title=Robert Kent Gooch|author=Hernando Herrera}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Gooch served with the American Ambulance Corps with the French forces on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] front, and was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdxKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP29 |title=Bobby Gooch Given French War Cross|journal=Virginia|page=77|volume=5|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the namesake of the Robert Kent Gooch Scholarship, for second and third-year college students who have a record of outstanding academic achievement and a record of outstanding service to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.artsandsciences.virginia.edu/gooch|title=Robert Kent Gooch Scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years Gooch was a [[political science]] professor at UVA, writing several books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Gooch%2C%20R.%20K.%20%28Robert%20Kent%29%2C%201893-1982|title=Gooch, R.

==Early years==
Gooch was born on September 26, 1893 in [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] to William Stapleton Gooch, a lawyer, and Mary Stuart Anderson. His ancestry was English and French; a descendant of [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9pKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252|title=Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the family moved to Louisa Court House, VA.

===University of Virginia===
[[File:Gooch.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Gooch in 1914.]]
Gooch played quarterback for Virginia from [[1912 Virginia Cavaliers football team|1912]] to [[1914 Virginia Cavaliers football team|1914]].

'''Schoolhouse Home Education Association''', more commonly referred to as '''''Schoolhouse''''', is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] based in [[Scotland]] which provides support and information to parents about [[Home education]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscr.org.uk/CharityIndexDetails.aspx?id=SC026965 Charity registration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoolhouse was set up in [[Dundee]] in 1996 by parents who identified the shortage of clear, accurate information on home educating in Scotland where the law and practices in relation to Home Education differ significantly from the other nations within the [[United Kingdom]].

Schoolhouse works in close cooperation with its counterpart support organisation Action for Home Education (AHEd) which operates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The '''Science and Engineering Challenge''' [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|(SEC)]] is a non-profit, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] outreach program run throughout the schools year in [[Australia]]. The goal of the program is to challenge student’s perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment.&lt;ref name="Challenge Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-engineering-and-built-environment/science-and-engineering-challenge|title=About Us|date=19 November 2014|website=Newcastle.edu.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the [https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-information-technology/community-outreach/smart S.M.A.R.T] outreach program.

==History==
The SEC began at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering.  Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the year 2000, as an activity for [[National Science Week]]. Throughout 2001, events were held around the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] area and other parts of [[NSW]].

2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of [[NSW]], this took place in [[Canberra]]. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final.

In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved.
Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.

== Discovery Days ==

In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

== Programs ==

#The Little Scientists program: Train preschool teachers to incorporate STEM into their lessons
#SMART program of science shows and workshops: Infants and Primary-aged students
#Discovery Days: Mini-Challenge Days for students in years 5-6
#Build a Future Days: A fascinating on-campus experience for year 7-8 students
#Challenge Days (our premier event): National STEM competition for year 9-10 students
#Casual work and Internships with the SEC Team
#Teacher Professional Development: For School Teachers

In the '''self-blended model of learning''' (or '''self-blend model of learning'''), students take [[online course]]s in addition to their traditional face-to-face [[learning]]. This model of [[blended learning]] is commonly practiced among American [[high school student]]s, and students follow this approach because it gives them the freedom to supplement what they have learned and what they have been taught in class.&lt;ref name="dreambox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreambox.com/blog/6-models-blended-learning|title=6 Models of Blended Learning - DreamBox Learning|publisher=dreambox.com|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The self-blended model of learning is generally approached by the students opting to take online courses outside of the time they spend on the traditional courses. It tackles the problem of the courses or subjects which are not provided by the school due to various reasons such as lack of funding, lack of student interest or lack of time. Students take online courses either in a [[brick-and-mortar]] campus or offsite.&lt;ref name="charterschoolconference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf|date=13 November 2013|title=An Innovation Sensation: Shifting Charter Schools from traditional to Blended Learning Models|author=Dr. Aline Sarria and Elizabeth Carrandi Molina|accessdate=2015-09-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926043046/http://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessary to have computers at home for the students who use the self-blended model of learning, as they can access the internet at their own school computer labs or they can head to local [[libraries]] to complete their work. They can also go to nearby [[Internet café|cyber lounge]]s.

== Use ==
The self-blend learning model is often used by high school students, as it requires students to monitor their learning process and take initiatives, which the younger students may have difficulty managing. Therefore, it differs in this way from the rotational model of learning which is quite often used in [[elementary school]]s, whereas many high school students are taking additional [[Mathematics education|math]], English and [[social studies]] courses online in addition to their courses offered at school.&lt;ref name="dreambox"/&gt;

== Advantages ==
There are a number of advantages to the self-blend model of learning:
#It is very helpful for [[High school dropouts|dropout students]] to recover, earn college/[[Advanced Placement|AP]] credit or to recover credits.
#It not only enhances the classroom learning but it also provides access to the online course which are otherwise not offered in the school due to various reasons, such as lack of funds, time and resources.
#In addition to the access to the online courses, it also enhances the [[digital literacy]] of the students, useful for students entering a 21st century workforce.
#Taking online courses is more affordable for the students.
#It provides opportunities to take up specialized courses, like college preparatory skill and [[life skills]] courses.
#It can be used for [[professional development]] as well as for instructional purposes.

== Disadvantages ==
The main disadvantage of the self-blend model is that the students will not receive face to face instruction for that particular course.
It also involves a lack of formal structure for the undisciplined and unmotivated students.&lt;ref name="dreambox"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">'''SimulTrain''' is a [[Project Management Simulator]] used in [[project management]] training programs. SimulTrain is a simulation of the planning and execution phases of a medium-sized [[project]], that involves all of the events that occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-management-27448701 What Is Project Management?]&lt;/ref&gt;
SimulTrain is a computer-based multimedia tool which allows the participants to learn: 
* to structure a project; 
* to control the progress of a project; 
* to use project management tools.

==Overview==

[[Image: RACIQ_Chart_-_Responsibility_Assignment_Matrix.jpg |thumb| RACI Chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/responsibility-assignment-matrix-raci-chart-explained What Is Responsibility Assignment Matrix RACI?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first version of SimulTrain was released in 1996. This [[educational software]] has been constantly improved. The recent version includes an expert system that analyses the managers' behaviour and provides them with detailed feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Using Business Simulation to Analyse Project Management Decision Making. Proceedings of 45th Conference of the International Simulation and Gaming Association. Dornbirn, Austria, 2014, page 213 - 318  http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/using-business-simulation-to-analyse-project-management-decision-making&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 the 11th version of SimulTrain was released. It includes Resource Leveling exercise, RACI Matrix, and Risk Register.

[[File: SimulTrain12RiskRegister.JPG|thumb| The example of the Risk Register for a  project that includes 4 steps: Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management What Is Risk Management?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The project management simulation SimulTrain is based on Dr. Roland Sauter‘s PhD thesis ''La modélisation des facteurs humains dans la gestion de projets. (1996)''. A model of human factors in project management was validated by a survey of 900 project managers. In 1996 the simulator was developed based on this model.

The first version ran on Macintosh. Since then a new version with numerous new features was released regularly every two years. Version 9 released in October 2012 runs on various operating systems (Windows, Macintosh, Linux) and is available both as online version and desktop version.

By 2015 over 150,000 people across 50 countries, have been trained with SimulTrain. The simulation has been translated into 22 languages.

Resource Leveling exercise is a new feature added in 2013. This is an example of Resource leveling for a mid-size project.&lt;ref&gt;SimulTrain Resource Leveling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcOD_ViGJYg&lt;/ref&gt; The chart shows the number of people involved in a project and its change with time. 
[[File:SimulTrainResourceLeveling.jpg|thumb|Resource Leveling optimizes histogram of resources usage on a project.]]

==Pedagogic concept==

Training is done in small groups of 4 people in two sessions of 3–4 hours each. Each group has one computer with the simulation program. The participants thus learn how to work and make decisions as a team. The simulator allows the group to work on the progress and execution of the project. It confronts the learners with many situations requiring the ability of making fast decisions and of taking all of the project parameters into account (costs, deadlines as well as human factors). The feedback and consequences of the different decisions are immediately made visible. The simulator involves multimedia technology: the participants receive many phone calls, e-mails and voice-mails, thus immersing them in surrounding them in a realistic project atmosphere.

The trainees have to complete the project within the deadline and budget. Their main tasks as project managers include: 
* setting up the project team, hiring employees with the proper qualifications at the right time 
* showing team members their tasks
* making adequate decisions when facing difficulties, overrunning the budget or failing to meet the deadline
* maintaining a good team dynamic

With the simulation attendees learn in two ways:
* from the reactions of the people involved in the project to the decisions made. (Feedback).
* from the potent interactions that develop in the four-person groups as each person plays a very precise role (such as supervising the schedule, costs, quality, and motivation).

SimulTrain's only requirement is a general knowledge about project management, including the [[Gantt chart]] and the Activity Network. Both online and desktop versions of the simulator are available.

==Scenarios==

===IT service deployment project===

In accordance with the marketing strategy defined at the beginning of the year, the management wishes to provide its customers with an on-line interactive service. This will allow customers to follow up and control orders without the intervention of either the customer service or accounting departments. For this project a tentative schedule has been written with the list of activities, budget and time required. The core-team has been established.

===Production project===

Plastoceram is the leading firm in manufacturing special packages made of composite materials. One of its clients that produces pacemakers cannot find any appropriate solution for the case of its latest ultra-miniature model. A case thus needs to be developed for this client within a very short time. It should be made of a resistant, very thin and easy-to-fashion material.

===Marketing project===

Your company has devised a new all-in-one Smartphone. This high performance appliance includes many innovative features, which makes it very attractive for listeners on the go and consumers who enjoy new technologies. The product conception is almost finished and its launch on the market must now be prepared. For this project tentative specifications have been written with the list of activities, budget and time required. The core-team has been established.

===Organizing a sport event===

The International Lausanne Football Tournament will gather some of the most important European youth football clubs. The National Federation is organizing the event for the first time. An organization specialized in sport events allocates all its resources to the event. The project "ILFT phase B" is a part of the preparation process. The preparation must be finished 2 weeks before the opening day. The core team and budget have been established. Other resources of the Federation are available for the project.

===Agile hybrid software development===

The management wishes to provide our customers with an online interactive service. This will allow customers to follow-up and control orders without the intervention of either the customer service or accounting departments. The customer representative is the Product owner. List of product backlog tasks, budget and time required have been defined. The scenario includes elements of waterfall planning and flexibility of the agile software development.

===Portfolio Management Simulation===

[[File: Net_Present_Value_vs_Payback_time_Portfolio_Management_Simulation.jpg|thumb| The example of the Net Present Value vs Payback Time and Strategic Value for a portfolio of projects.]]

SimulTrain&amp;reg;+ &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-portfolio-management What Is Project Portfolio Management?]&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the project management simulation to Project Portfolio Management. With the serious game the trainees acquire such skills as prioritizing / balancing a portfolio of projects under resources, funding scarcity. The trainee use such key indicators as Strategic Value, Strategic Objectives, Net Present Value, Payback time, workload, risk, cash credit, and others.

'''Speech-Language Pathology''' is a field of expertise practiced by a [[clinician]] known as a '''speech-language pathologist''' ('''SLP'''), also sometimes referred to as a '''speech and language therapist'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''speech therapist'''. SLP is considered a "related health profession" along with [[audiology]], optometry, [[occupational therapy]], [[Psychologist|clinical psychology]], [[physical therapy]], and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" SLPs are legally permitted to conclude to certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of [[communication disorders]] ([[Speech disorder|speech disorders]] and [[Language disorder|language disorders]]), cognitive-communication disorders, [[voice disorders]], and [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency are only two facets of the work of an SLP, however. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|first=|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include:
* [[phonation]] (producing sound)
* [[resonance]]
* [[fluency]]
* [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]]
* [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] variance;
* [[Human voice|Voice]] (including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]])
The components of [[language]] include:
* [[Phonology]] (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* [[Syntax]] (constructing sentences according to the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of a target language);
* [[Semantics]] (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* [[Pragmatics]] (social aspects of communication).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E.

Primary pediatric speech and language disorders include: [[Receptive language|receptive]] and [[expressive language disorder]]s, [[speech sound disorder]]s, childhood [[apraxia of speech]] (CAS), [[stuttering]], and [[Language-based learning disability|language-based learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speechsf.com/#!Speech-and-Language-Disorders/f9wnb/571e725f0cf232b075cde672|title=Speech and Language Disorders|last=Weeks|first=Katie|date=July 12, 2016|website=Speech SF|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech pathologist not only work with adolescents with speech and language impediments, but also those that are elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/public/Who-Are-Speech-Language-Pathologists/|title=Who Are Speech-Language Pathologists, and What Do They Do?|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional [[dysphagia]] and [[feeding disorder]]s. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/|title=Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The profession==
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech ([[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates [[voice therapy]] to be especially helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Factor|first1=Stewart|last2=Weiner|first2=William|title=Parkinson's disease: Diagnosis &amp; clinical management : Second edition|date=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=9781933864006|pages=77–83|edition=2nd, rev. and updat;2; ed.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* sensory awareness related to communication, swallowing, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes, such as a stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Emma|title=Communication and swallowing problems after stroke|journal=Nursing and Residential Care|date=June 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=282–286|doi=10.12968/nrec.2012.14.6.282}}&lt;/ref&gt; brain injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Editors, Nathan D.

===Multi-discipline collaboration===

SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to [[audiologist]]s, [[physician]]s, neonatal specialists &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Mathisen, B. A., Carey, L.

London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781785922206|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[parent]]s as dictated by the individual client's needs.  For example, the treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]], often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.&lt;ref name="revistaOMF"&gt;

===Working environments===

SLPs work in a variety of clinical and [http://www.txsource.com educational settings]. SLPs work in public and private [[hospital]]s, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, [[hospice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pollens R |title=Role of the speech-language pathologist in palliative hospice care |journal=J Palliat Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=694–702 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15588361 |doi= 10.1089/jpm.2004.7.694|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA's) 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

===Education and training===
====United States====
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level [[professional degree]] field. [[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

===Salary information===
Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years. The median salary for pathologists jumped from $66,920 in 2010 to $74,680 in 2016, according to the BLS. The best-paid speech-language pathologists earned more than $116,810 in 2016, while the lowest-paid earned less than $47,070.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the basic salary that a Graduate SLP would earn is estimated at $59,500 Australian dollars rising to $120,000 for Private SLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/AU/Job=Speech_Pathologist/Salary|title=Speech Pathologist Salary (Australia)|website=www.payscale.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of assessment==
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  {{details|Speech and language assessment}}

==Clients and patients==
Speech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.

In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]]. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://asha.org/telepractice/&lt;/ref&gt; Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://vocalsaints.co.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/helping-your-childs-speech.aspx#close&lt;/ref&gt; If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.

'''State schools''' (also known as '''public schools''' outside England and Wales)&lt;ref group=note&gt;In [[England]] and [[Wales]], some [[Education in England#Independent schools|independent schools]] for 13- to 18-year-olds are known as 'public schools'.&lt;/ref&gt; are generally primary or secondary [[educational institution|schools]] mandated for or offered to all children without charge, funded in whole or in part by [[tax]]ation. These schools are generally&lt;!--emphasis on GENERAL, not withstanding selective state schools such as certain grammar schools--&gt; inclusive (non-[[selective school|selective]]) in admitting all students within the geographical area that they serve.

While state schools are to be found in virtually every country, there are significant variations in their structure and educational programs. State education generally encompasses primary and secondary education ([[kindergarten]] to [[twelfth grade]], or equivalent), as well as [[Higher education|post-secondary]] educational institutions such as [[University|universities]], colleges, and technical schools that are funded and overseen by government rather than private entities. The [[Education|education system]], or lack thereof, prior to the establishment of government-funded schools impacts their role in each society. In many instances there was an established educational system which served a significant, albeit often elite, sector of the population; these systems were often funded by religious institutions. The introduction of state schools in some cases was able to build upon this established system, while in others both systems have continued to exist, sometimes in a parallel and complementary relationship and other times less harmoniously.

== General characteristics ==

State education is inclusive, both in its treatment of students and in that enfranchisement for the government of public education is as broad as for government generally. It is often organised and operated to be a deliberate model of the civil community in which it functions. Although typically provided to groups of students in classrooms in a central school, it may be provided in-home, employing visiting teachers, and/or supervising teachers. It can also be provided in non-school, non-home settings, such as shopping mall space.

State education is generally available to all. In most countries, it is compulsory for children to attend school up to a certain age, but the option of attending private school is open to many. In the case of [[private school]]ing, schools operate independently of the state and generally defray their costs (or even make a profit) by charging parents [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]]. The funding for state schools, on the other hand, is provided by tax revenues, so that even individuals who do not attend school (or whose dependents do not attend school) help to ensure that society is educated. In poverty stricken societies, authorities are often lax on compulsory school attendance because [[child labour]] is exploited. It is these same children whose income-securing labour cannot be forfeited to allow for school attendance.

The term "public education" when applied to state schools is not synonymous with the term "publicly funded education". Government may make a public policy decision that it wants to have some financial resources distributed in support of, and it may want to have some control over, the provision of private education. Grants-in-aid of private schools and vouchers systems provide examples of publicly funded private education. Conversely, a state school (including one run by a school district) may rely heavily on private funding such as high fees or private donations and still be considered state by virtue of governmental ownership and control.

State primary and secondary education often involves the following:
# [[Compulsory education|compulsory student attendance]] (until a certain age or standard is achieved);
# certification of teachers and curricula, either by the government or by a teachers' organisation;
# testing and standards provided by government.

In some countries (such as Germany), private associations or churches can operate schools according to their own principles, as long as they comply with certain state requirements. When these specific requirements are met, especially in the area of the school curriculum, the schools will qualify to receive state funding. They are then treated financially and for accreditation purposes as part of the state education system, even though they make decisions about hiring and school policy (not hiring atheists, for example), which the state might not make itself.

== By country and region ==
{{See also|List of education articles by country}}

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|Education in Australia}}
Government schools (also known as public schools) are free to attend for Australian citizens and permanent residents, whereas independent schools usually charge attendance fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studyinaustralia.gov.au/Sia/en/Help/NorthAmerica/study/Australian_school_fees.htm|title=School fees in Australia|publisher=Study in Australia|accessdate=9 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409173302/http://studyinaustralia.gov.au/Sia/en/Help/NorthAmerica/study/Australian_school_fees.htm|archivedate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be divided into two categories: open and [[selective school]]s. The open schools accept all students from their government-defined catchment areas. Government schools educate approximately 65% of Australian students, with approximately 34% in Catholic and independent schools.&lt;ref name="absyear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/93EB4563583425CCCA25773700169C91?opendocument |title=Primary and Secondary Education |year=2008 |work=Year Book Australia |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qvDapIMe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abs.gov.au%2FAUSSTATS%2Fabs%40.nsf%2F0%2F93EB4563583425CCCA25773700169C91%3Fopendocument |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=2 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether a school is part of the Government or independent systems, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks of their state or territory. The curriculum framework however provides for some flexibility in the syllabus, so that subjects such as [[religious education]] can be taught. Most school students wear uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/settle-in-australia/everyday-life/education/whatforme.htm|title=What schooling and training is there for my family and me?|publisher=[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]|accessdate=16 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415213947/http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/settle-in-australia/everyday-life/education/whatforme.htm|archivedate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
{{Main article|Education in Bangladesh}}
Public or Government funded schools are found throughout [[Bangladesh]]. These schools mostly teach students from Year 1 to 10, with examinations for students in years 5, 8, and 10. All public schools follow the National Board Curriculum. Many children, especially girls, drop out of school after completing the 5th Year in remote areas. In larger cities such as [[Dhaka]], however, this is fairly uncommon. Many good public schools conduct an entrance exam, although most public schools in the villages and small towns usually do not. Public schools are often the only option for parents and children in rural areas, but there are large numbers of private schools in Dhaka and [[Chittagong]]. Many Bangladeshi private schools teach their students in English and follow curricula from overseas, but in public schools lessons are taught in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|Education in Canada}}
[[File:Old Scona Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Old Scona Academic High School|Old Scona High School]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]].]]
Per the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], public-school education in Canada is a provincial responsibility and, as such, there are many variations among the provinces. Junior kindergarten (or equivalent) exists as an official program in only Ontario and Quebec while kindergarten (or equivalent) is available in every province, but provincial funding and the level of hours provided varies widely. Starting at grade one, at about age six, there is universal Crown-funded access up to grade twelve (or equivalent). Schools are generally divided into elementary schools (kindergarten to Grade 6), junior high schools (Grades 7 to 9), and high schools (Grades 10 to 12). However, in many areas [[Middle school#Canada|middle schools]] are also provided and in some schools, particularly in rural areas, the elementary and middle levels can be combined into one school. In 2003, Grade 13 (also known as the Ontario Academic Credit or "OAC" year) was eliminated in Ontario; it had previously been required only for students who intended to go on to university. Children are required to attend school until the age of sixteen in most provinces, while students in Ontario and New Brunswick must attend schools until the age of eighteen.

Some Canadian provinces offer segregated-by-religious-choice, but nonetheless Crown-funded and Crown-regulated, religiously based education. In [[Ontario]], for example, Roman Catholic schools are known as "Catholic school" or "Separate school", not "Public school", although these are, by definition, no less "public" than their secular counterparts.

=== People's Republic of China ===
{{Main article|Education in the People's Republic of China}}
In [[China|the PRC]], state schools are funded and administered by the education sector within the government. Although some, especially high schools, have started to charge a fair portion of parents of students an additional tuition fee, due to the increased places offered by the schools in recent years. Top state schools are often very selective, however. Students who miss their entrance requirement may still gain places if they meet a relatively lower requirement and their parents are willing to pay for the additional fees. Some parents appreciate the idea as they may send their children to good schools even though they may not be academically qualified, while others believe that it is not fair for someone who has a background of poverty.

The public spending on schools in China has been uneven due to insufficient investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Democracy in Education: Lessons from Social Realities|last=Apple|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138714502|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is in favor of urban schools and it is promoted by past policies such as the mandate for rural public schools to have a higher student-to-teacher ratio.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educating Migrant Children in Urban Public Schools in China: Unravelling the Implementation Paradox|last=Hu|first=Bo|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9789811311475|location=Singapore|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inequality of resources is exacerbated by the way public schools in urban areas enjoy more support since local governments have more developed economies. Aside from the disparity between urban and rural public schools, there was also the dichotomized system adopted since 1978, which divided schools into two groups: [[Education in China#Key schools|key schools]] (''zhongdianxiao'') and non-key schools (''putongxiao'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Key schools receive more funding due to the goal of developing first-class education in a limited number of schools in a short period of time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=You|first=Yongheng|date=April 2007|title=A deep reflection on the “key school system” in basic education in China|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11516-007-0019-6|journal=Frontiers of Education in China|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=229–239|doi=10.1007/s11516-007-0019-6|issn=1673-341X|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key school system was canceled by the 2006 amendment to the Compulsory Education Law, along with the introduction of reforms that address education inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2006-06/30/content_323219.htm|title=China adopts amendment to Compulsory Education Law|website=www.gov.cn|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Denmark ===
{{Main article|Education in Denmark}}
The [[Denmark|Danish]] School system is supported today by tax-based [[government]]al and [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipal]] funding from [[Danish pre-school education|day care]] through primary and [[Secondary education in Denmark|secondary education]] to [[Education in Denmark#Post-secondary education|higher education]] and there are no [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]] for regular students in public schools and [[List of universities and colleges in Denmark|universities]].

The Danish public [[primary school]]s, covering the entire period of compulsory education, are called ''[[Danish Folkeskole Education|folkeskoler]]'' (literally 'people's schools' or 'public schools'). The ''Folkeskole'' consists of a pre-school class (mandatory since 2009), the 9-year obligatory course and a voluntary 11th year. It thus caters for pupils aged 6 to 17.

It is also possible for parents to send their children to various kinds of [[private school]]s. These schools also receive government funding, although they are not public. In addition to this funding, these schools may charge a fee from the parents.

=== France ===
{{Main article|Secondary education in France}}
[[File:Rue St Jacques Louis Le Grand DSC09316.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|La Sorbonne]]

The French educational system is highly centralised, organised, and ramified. It is divided into three stages:
* primary education (''enseignement primaire'');
* secondary education (''enseignement secondaire'');
* tertiary or college education (''enseignement supérieur'')

Schooling in France is mandatory as of age 6, the first year of primary school. Many parents start sending their children earlier though, around age 3 as [[kindergarten]] classes (''maternelle'') are usually affiliated to a borough's (''commune'') primary school. Some even start earlier at age 2 in ''pré-maternelle'' or ''garderie'' class, which is essentially a [[Day care|daycare]] facility.

French secondary education is divided into two schools:
* the ''collège'' for the first four years directly following [[primary school]];
* the ''lycée'' for the next three years.

The completion of secondary studies leads to the ''baccalauréat''.

The ''[[baccalauréat]]'' (also known as ''bac'') is the end-of-''lycée'' diploma students sit for in order to enter [[university]], a ''[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]]'', or professional life. The term ''baccalauréat'' refers to the diploma and the examinations themselves. It is comparable to British [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]], American [[SAT]]s, the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] and German [[Abitur]].

Most students sit for the ''baccalauréat général'' which is divided into 3 streams of study, called ''séries''. The ''série scientifique'' (S) is concerned with [[mathematics]] and [[natural science]]s, the ''série économique et sociale'' (ES) with [[economics]] and [[social science]]s, and the ''série littéraire'' (L) focuses on [[French language|French]] and [[language|foreign languages]] and [[philosophy]].

[[File:Montpellier PetitBard Ecole.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|One of the schools in France]]

The ''[[Grandes écoles]]'' of France are higher education establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public [[university|universities]]. They are generally focused on a single subject area, such as [[engineering]], have a moderate size, and are often quite (sometimes extremely) selective in their admission of students. They are widely regarded as prestigious, and traditionally have produced most of France's scientists and [[Corporate title|executives]].

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|Education in Germany}}
[[File:Osterholzschule.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A school in Germany]]
Education in Germany is provided to a large extent by the government, with control coming from state level, ''([[States of Germany|Länder]])'' and funding coming from two levels: federal and state. Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through the respective state's [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] of education. Decisions about the acknowledgment of private schools (the German equivalent to accreditation in the US) are also made by these ministries. However, public schools are automatically recognised, since these schools are supervised directly by the ministry of education bureaucracy.

Although the first kindergarten in the world was opened in 1840 by [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]] in the German town of [[Bad Blankenburg]], and the term kindergarten is even a [[loanword]] from the [[German language]], they are not part of the German school system. Article 7 Paragraph 6 of the German constitution (the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'') abolished pre-school as part of the German school system. However, virtually all German kindergartens are public. They are either directly run by municipal governments, or contracted out, most often, to the two largest [[Christian]] churches in Germany. These municipal kindergartens are financed by taxes and progressive income-based customer fees, but are not considered part of the public school system.

[[File:PIR Goethe-Schule (01) 2005-09.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|School named after Goethe]]
A German public school does not charge tuition fees. The first stage of the German public school system is the ''Grundschule''. (Primary School – 1st to 4th grade or, in [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]], 1st to 6th grade) After Grundschule (at 10 or 12 years of age), there are four secondary schooling options:
* ''[[Hauptschule]]'' (the least academic, much like a modernised Volksschule) until 9th or, in Berlin and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], until 10th grade. The students attending those type of school may be awarded the Hauptschulabschluss or in some cases also the [[Mittlere Reife]]
* ''[[Realschule]]'' (formerly Mittelschule) until 10th grade, usually awards the [[Mittlere Reife]]
* ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (high school) until 12th grade or 13th grade, with [[Abitur]] as exit exam, qualifying for admission to university.
* ''[[Comprehensive school|Gesamtschule]]'' (comprehensive school) with all the options of the three "tracks" above.

[[File:LLGEing1994.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|More modern school in Germany]]
A Gesamtschule largely corresponds to an American high school. However, it offers the same school leaving certificates as the other three types of German secondary schools: the Hauptschulabschluss (school leaving certificate of a Hauptschule after 9th Grade or in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia after 10th grade), the Realschulabschluss, also called [[Mittlere Reife]], (school leaving certificate of a Realschule after 10th grade) and Abitur, also called Hochschulreife, after 13th or seldom after 12th grade. Students who graduate from Hauptschule or Realschule continue their schooling at a vocational school until they have full job qualifications.
This type of German school, the ''Berufsschule'', is generally an upper-secondary public vocational school, controlled by the German federal government. It is part of Germany's [[dual education system]]. Students who graduate from a vocational school and students who graduate with good [[Grading in education|GPA]] from a Realschule can continue their schooling at another type of German public secondary school, the ''Fachoberschule'', a vocational high school. The school leaving exam of this type of school, the ''Fachhochschulreife'', enables the graduate to start studying at a [[Fachhochschule]] (polytechnic), and in [[Hesse]] also at a university within the state. The Abitur from a Gesamtschule or Gymnasium enables the graduate to start studying at a polytechnic or at a university in all states of Germany.

A number of schools for mature students exists. Schools such as the [[Abendrealschule]] serve students that are headed for the [[Mittlere Reife]]. Schools such as the [[Aufbaugymnasium]] or the [[Abendgymnasium]] prepare students for college and finish with the [[Abitur]]. These schools are usually free of charge.

In Germany, most institutions of higher education are subsidised by German states and are therefore also referred to as ''staatliche Hochschulen.'' (public universities) In most German states, admission to public universities is still cheap, about two hundred Euro per semester. In 2005, many states introduced additional fees of 500 Euro per semester to achieve a better teaching-quality; however, all of these states (except Lower Saxony, which will follow in 2014/15) have abolished tuition fees as of autumn 2013. Nevertheless, additional fees for guest or graduate students are charged by many universities.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Main article|Education in Hong Kong#School types}}
In [[Hong Kong]] the term ''government schools'' is used for free schools funded by the government.

There are also subsidised schools (which are the majority in Hong Kong and many of which are run by religious organisations), "[[Direct Subsidy Scheme]]" schools, private schools and international schools in Hong Kong. Some schools are international schools, which are not subsidised by the government.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Education in India}}
During British rule, a number of state higher education establishments were set up (such as Universities in [[Chennai]], [[Kolkata]], and [[Mumbai]]), but little was done by the British in terms of primary and secondary schooling. Other indigenous forms of education are being revived in various ways across India. According to current estimates, 80% of all Indian schools are government schools&lt;ref name="manabadi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aptsmanabadiresults.in/p/telangana-ts-results.html|title=Telangana State Schools 10+2 Results Page|date=28 February 2017|publisher=manabadi results}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the government the major provider of education. However, because of the poor quality of public education, 27% of Indian children are privately educated.
According to some research, private schools often provide superior educational results at a fraction of the unit cost of government schools.&lt;ref name="creaking"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749787|title=A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is India’s biggest handicap|date=11 December 2008|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gprg.org/pubs/workingpapers/pdfs/gprg-wps-071.pdf|title=The progress of school education in India|author=Geeta Gandhi Kingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher to student ratio is usually much lower in private schools than in the government ones, creating more competitive students.
Education in India is provided by the public sector as well as the private sector, with control and funding coming from three levels: federal, state, and local. The Nalanda University was the oldest university-system of education in the world.[2] Western education became ingrained into Indian society with the establishment of the British Raj.

=== Ireland ===
{{Main article|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], post-primary education comprises secondary, community and comprehensive schools, as well as community colleges (formerly vocational schools). Secondary schools are privately owned and managed. Community colleges are state-established and administered by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), while community and comprehensive schools are managed by Boards of Management of differing compositions.&lt;ref name="education.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/Post-Primary/|title=Post Primary Education|work=education.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately owned and managed secondary schools receive a direct grant from the state, and are subdivided into fee-paying and non fee-paying schools. The vast majority of these schools are operated by religious organisations, primarily the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of Ireland]]. The charging of fees is a decision of the individual school. The Irish Constitution requires the State to "endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral formation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the_irish_education_system/constitution_and_education.html|title=Constitution and education|work=citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, most people are educated by Catholic institutions as there are few alternatives in much of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/a-new-problem-in-ireland-where-to-find-a-non-catholic-school/280225/|title=A New Problem in Ireland: Where to Find a Non-Catholic School?|author=Aaron Schrank|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non fee-paying secondary schools are usually considered to be public or state schools, while private school and fee-paying schools are considered synonymous. This is colloquial and not technically accurate.

All schools which are provided for by the State, including privately run and fee-paying secondary schools, teach the national curriculum. All students are expected to take the standardised Junior Certificate examination after three years.&lt;ref name="education.ie" /&gt; An optional non-academic Transition Year is provided by most but not all schools immediately following the Junior Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Curriculum-and-Syllabus/Transition-Year-/Transition-Year.html|title=Transition Year|work=education.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students subsequently take one of three Leaving Certificate programmes: the traditional Leaving Certificate, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) or the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA).&lt;ref name="education.ie" /&gt; The vast majority of students in Ireland take the traditional Leaving Certificate. Both the traditional Leaving Certificate and the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme can lead to third-level education, with LCVP more focused on practical skills.

[[Koryo Dynasty]] (고려)

The first public education system on record was put in place during Koryo Dynasty. The national school system was put in place under Hak-Je (학제 | 學制 | Education Policy) enacted by King [[SeongJong]] which was modelled after the public education systems of Song Dynasty and Tang Dynasty, China. Hak-Je involved operating national universities, called [[Gukjagam]] and DongSeoHakDang in the capital and called HyangAk in other regions. In King SeongJong Year 6, 987 A.D., a pair of a medical doctor and a scholarly doctor were appointed to administer academic systems and curriculums at Hyang-Ak: scholarly education included subjects of geography, history, math, law, and others. In King SeongJong Year 11, 992 A.D., the first known national public schools called Ju-Hak (주학 | 州學) were opened in each Ju and Gun, states and counties, to improve nationwide academic performances.

[[Joseon]] Dynasty (조선)

Joseon changed the name of the university to [[Seonggyungwan]] (성균관).

Dae-Han-Je-Guk (대한제국)

Im-Si-Jeong-Bu (임시정부)

Dae-Han-Min-Guk (대한민국, a.k.a. South Korea)

After the seize fire agreement for the civil war was declared, north and south states of Korea established their own education system.

In [[South Korea]], education in public schools (1-12) is compulsory with the exception of kindergarten. All aspects of public education are the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, which executes administration of schools, allocation of funding, certification of teachers and schools, and curriculum development with standardised textbooks across the country.

In the year 2000, South Korea spent 4.2% of its GDP in education. As of 2007 UN Education Index, South Korea is ranked 8th in the world.

=== Malaysia ===
[[File:Smjkchiomin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Chio Min Secondary School]] (government-sponsored schools) in [[Kulim]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]].]]
Education in [[Malaysia]] is overseen by two government ministries: the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] for matters up to the secondary level, and the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]] for tertiary education. Although education is the responsibility of the federal government, each [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] has an Education Department to help co-ordinate educational matters in their respective states. The main legislation governing education is the Education Act of 1996.

Education may be obtained from government-sponsored schools, [[private school]]s, or through [[homeschooling]]. By law, [[primary education]] is [[compulsory education|compulsory]]. As in other Asian countries such as Singapore and China, [[standardised test]]s are a common feature.

=== Latin America ===
{{Main article|Education in Latin America}}
In some countries, such as [[Brazil]] and Mexico, the term "public schools" (''escuelas públicas'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''escolas públicas'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used for educational institutions owned by the federal, state, or city governments which do not charge tuition. Such schools exist in all levels of education, from the very beginning through post-secondary studies.  Mexico has nine years of free and compulsory primary and secondary education.

[[File:Colegio Nacional Bragado.jpg|thumb|Secondary School in the pampas city of [[Bragado]]. Argentina's secondary schools belong to a provincial system.]]
[[Education in Argentina]] is a responsibility shared by the national government, the provinces and federal district and private institutions, though basic guidelines have historically been set by the Ministry of Education. Closely associated in Argentina with President Domingo Sarmiento's assertion that "the sovereign should be educated" ("sovereign" referring to the people), education has been extended nearly universally and its maintenance remains central to political and cultural debate. Even though education at all levels, including universities, has always been free, there is a large number of private schools and universities.

=== Russia ===
{{Main article|Education in Russia}}

Education in Russia is provided predominantly by the state and is regulated by the Ministry of Education and Science. Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws. Russia's expenditure on education has grown from 2.7% of the GDP in 2005 to 3.8% in 2013, but remains below the OECD average of 5.2%.

{{Main article|Education in Scotland}}

The [[Church of Scotland]] was established in 1560, during the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] period as the official state religion in Scotland, and in the following year it set out to provide a school in every [[parish]] controlled by the local kirk-session, with education to be provided free to the poor, and the expectation that church pressure would ensure that all children took part. In the year of 1633 the [[Parliament of Scotland]] introduced local taxation to fund this provision. Schooling was not free, but the tax support kept fees low, and the church and charity funded poorer students. This had considerable success, but by the late 18th century the physical extent of some parishes and population growth in others led to an increasing role for "adventure schools" funded from fees and for schools funded by religious charities, initially [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and later [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

In 1872 education for all children aged 5 to 13 was made compulsory with "[[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]" (in the Scots meaning of schools for the general public) under local school boards. The leaving age was raised to 14 in 1883, and a Leaving Certificate Examination was introduced in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education. School fees were ended in 1890. The [[Scottish Education Department]] ran the system centrally, with [[local authority|local authorities]] running the schools with considerable autonomy. In 1999, following devolution from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to the new [[Scottish Parliament]], central organisation of education was taken over by departments of the [[Scottish Executive]], with running the schools coming under [[Subdivisions of Scotland|unitary authority districts]].

In Scotland, the term ''public school'', in official use since 1872, traditionally means "a state-controlled school run by the local burgh or county education authority, generally non-fee-paying and supported by contributions from local and national taxation".&lt;ref name="Scottish National Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?query=public+AND+school&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=entry&amp;dtext=both Scottish National Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914003251/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?query=public+AND+school&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=entry&amp;dtext=both |date=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to the earlier introduction of state-administered universal education in Scotland and opposed to the rest of the United Kingdom, the term became associated with state schools. The designation was incorporated into the name of many of these older publicly run institutions.

Children in Scottish state schools (or public schools) typically start [[primary school]], or attend a junior school, aged between four and a half and five and a half depending on when the child's birthday falls. Children born between March and August would start school at the age of five years and those born between September and February start school at age four-and-a-half. Pupils remain at primary school for seven years completing Primary One to Seven.

Then aged eleven or twelve, pupils start [[secondary school]] for a compulsory period of four years, with a final two years thereafter being optional. Pupils take [[Standard Grade]] examinations at the age of fifteen/sixteen, sometimes earlier, most often for up to eight subjects. These include compulsory exams in English, [[mathematics]], a [[foreign language]], a [[science]] subject and a social subject. It is now a requirement of the Scottish Government that all pupils have two hours of physical education a week. Each school may arrange these compulsory requirements in different combinations. The minimum school leaving age is generally sixteen, after completion of Standard Grade examinations. Pupils who continue their school education after the age of sixteen, may choose to study for [[Scottish Qualifications Authority#National Qualifications|Access]], [[Intermediate 1|Intermediate]] or [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher Grade]] and [[Advanced Higher]] exams.

The [[Curriculum for Excellence]] was introduced to secondary schools in session 2012/2013. The assessment of pupils' attainment will change, with 'National' qualifications replacing most Standard Grade and Intermediate Grade qualifications.&lt;ref name="BBC Scotland News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/curriculum_for_excellence.shtml |title=Scotland's Curriculum For Excellence-An Introduction |date=16 August 2011 |publisher=BBC Scotland News |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{Main article|Education in South Africa}}

In [[South Africa]], a state school or government school refers to a school that is state-controlled. These are officially called public schools according to the South African Schools Act of 1996, but it is a term that is not used colloquially. The Act recognised two categories of schools: public and independent. [[Independent school]]s include all private schools and schools that are privately governed. Independent schools with low tuition fees are state-aided and receive a subsidy on a sliding-scale. Traditional private schools that charge high fees receive no state subsidy.

State schools are all state-owned, including section 21 schools (formerly referred to as "model C" or semi-private schools) that have a governing body and a degree of budget autonomy, as these are still fully owned and accountable to the state.

{{Main article|Education_in_Sri_Lanka}}

Most of the schools in [[Sri Lanka]] are maintained by the government as a part of the free education. With the establishment of the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments. However the old schools which had been around since the colonial times were retained by the central government, thus creating three types of government schools: National Schools, Provincial Schools, and Piriven.

National Schools come under the direct control of the Ministry of Education therefore have direct funding from the ministry. Provincial Schools consists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka which are funded and controlled by the local governments. Piriven are monastic college (similar to a seminary) for the education of Buddhist priests. These have been the centres of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today these are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education.

=== Sweden ===
{{Main article|Education in Sweden}}

Swedish state schools are funded by tax money. This goes for both primary schools (Swedish: ''grundskola''), and secondary school (Swedish: ''gymnasium'') and universities. When studying at a university, however, you might have to pay for accommodation and literature. There are private schools as well who also receive funding from the government, but they may charge a fee from the parents.

Compulsory education starts at seven years of age, with an optional year in ''förskola'' (pre-school). The Swedish primary school is split into three parts; ''Lågstadiet'' – “the low stage”, which covers grades 1 to 3. This is where you learn the basics of the three main subjects – in Swedish called ''kärnämnen'' – Swedish, English and mathematics. It also includes some natural science. ''Mellanstadiet'' – “the middle stage”, which covers grades 4 to 6, introduces the children to more detailed subjects. [[Woodworking|Woodwork]] and [[needlework]], social and domestic science, and even a second, foreign language in grade 6, a ''B-språk'' (B-language). The languages available are usually [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[German language|German]] depending on the school. ''Högstadiet'', “the high stage”, is the last stage of the compulsory education, between grades 7 and 9. This is when studies get more in-depth and are taken to an international level.

Swedish children take national exams at grades 3, 6 and 9. Children at grade 3 take these exams in two of the three main subjects: [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[mathematics]]. In grade 5 the exams extend to the third main subject, English, and in grade 9 the exams also extend to [[natural science]], [[foreign language]]s, and one of the four subjects in "Samhällsorientering" ([[geography]], [[history]], [[religious studies]], and [[civics]]). They first receive grades in grade 6. The grading system is letter-based, ranging from A-F, where F is the lowest grade and A is the highest. F means "not approved", while all other ratings above F mean "approved". There are only objectives for E, C and A; D means the person has met most (but not all) objectives for C, while B means the person has met most objectives for A. When applying to ''gymnasium'' (high schools) or universities, a ''meritvärde'' (“meritous point value”) is calculated. E is worth 10 points, D 12.5 points, C 15 points, and so on. Children not being approved in Swedish, English and mathematics will have to study at a special high school program called the “individual program”. Once they are approved, they may apply to an ordinary high school program. Swedes study at high school for three years, between the ages of 16 and 18.

{{See also|State-funded schools (England)}}

In the United Kingdom, the term "state school" refers to government-funded schools which provide education free of charge to pupils. The contrast to this are fee-paying schools, such as "[[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent (or private) schools]]" and "[[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]".

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the term "public school" is used to refer to fee-paying schools. "Public" as in they are open to anyone who can meet the fees, distinguished from religious schools which are open only to members of that religion. Some people call only the older fee-paying schools, "public schools" (for example, schools such as [[Eton College]] and [[Charterhouse School]]), while others use the term for any such school.

In Scotland, where the educational system is completely different from the rest of UK, the [[Church of Scotland]] was established in 1560, during the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] period as the official state religion, and in the following year it set out to provide a school in every [[parish]] controlled by the local kirk-session, with education to be provided free to the poor, and the expectation that church pressure would ensure that all children took part.

Throughout education in the UK, the vast majority of state-funded schools are under the control of local councils ([[local education authority|local education authorities]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]] in [[Northern Ireland]]), and are referred to in official literature as "maintained schools".  The exceptions are a minority of secondary schools in England funded directly by central government, known as [[academy (English school)|academies]] and [[City Technology College]]s.

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] is followed in all local council maintained schools in England, [[Northern Ireland]] and Wales. State schools in Wales, including Welsh-medium schools, are controlled by the [[Welsh Government]]. Academies, which are state schools, but not maintained by local authorities, have more freedom to adapt the National Curriculum{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. In Northern Ireland [[Secondary education|secondary-level]] schools are divided into [[grammar school]]s, [[Secondary modern school|secondary schools]] and Catholic-[[Voluntary aided school|maintained schools]], with an increasing number of [[Integrated education|Integrated schools]]. There are also a small number of voluntary [[Irish language|Irish-language]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1181819|title=Home – BBC News|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some state schools, known as [[Faith school (United Kingdom)|faith schools]], have formal links with religious organisations, and are permitted to promote a particular religious ethos and to use faith criteria in their admissions. Some maintained schools are partially funded by religious or other charitable bodies; these are known as [[voluntary controlled school]]s, [[voluntary aided school]]s or [[foundation school]]s.

The oldest state school in England is [[Beverley Grammar School]], which was founded in 700 AD.

=== United States{{anchor|United States}} ===
{{Main article|Education in the United States}}
In the United States, the term "state school" is colloquial for [[State university system|state university]], a college, or a university in a state university system. Instead, the term "public school" is used for elementary, middle, and high schools funded and/or run by a governmental entity. "Private school" generally refers to primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions that are not government-owned; in practice the term is generally used to refer to non-sectarian schools.

Elementary, middle, and high schools that are operated by a religious organisation are commonly called "[[parochial school]]s" (though, in practice, the term is generally used to refer only to schools operated by the [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic Church]] or some other mainline denomination; the term "Christian school" is generally used to refer to schools operated by Evangelical, Pentecostal/Charismatic, or Fundamentalist Christian churches).

The role of the federal government in education is limited and indirect. Direct control of education is a power reserved to the states under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] because the Constitution does not explicitly or implicitly give the federal government authority to regulate education. However, any public or private school that accepts educational funding from the federal government, including participation in collegiate federal financial aid programs (such as [[Pell Grant]]s and [[Stafford Loan]]s), by accepting the funds or participating in a particular federal program, subjects itself to federal jurisdiction to the extent of that participation.

The [[United States Department of Education]] supervises the role of the federal government in education. Direct regulation of public, private and parochial schools is done by state and territorial governments, in [[Washington, D.C.]], by the District Government. Broad regulation of public schools is typically accomplished through a [[state education agency]] and a state department of education. There is usually a Superintendent (education)|state superintendent of schools, who is appointed or elected to co-ordinate the state department of education, the state ''board'' of education, and the state legislature itself. Statewide education policies are disseminated to school "districts" or their equivalents. They are associated with counties, or with groups of counties, but their boundaries are not necessarily coterminous with county boundaries.  The intermediate school districts encompass many local school districts.  The local school districts operate with their own local boards, which oversee operations of the individual schools within their jurisdiction.

In most states, the county or regional "intermediate" school districts merely implement state education policy and provide the channels through which a local district communicates with a state board of education, state superintendent, and department of education. They do not establish county or regional policies of their own.

Local [[school district]]s are administered by local [[Board of education|school boards]], which operate public [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[Secondary school|high schools]] within their boundaries. Public schools are often funded by local taxpayers, and most school boards are elected. However, some states have adopted new funding models that are not dependent upon the local economy.

[[File:Seattle - Seward School 01.jpg|thumb|The Seward School, [[Seattle, Washington]].]]
Public schools are provided mainly by local governments. Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards by jurisdiction over school districts. The school districts are [[Special district (United States)|special-purpose districts]] authorised by provisions of state law. Generally, state governments set minimum standards relating to almost all activities of elementary and high schools, as well as funding and authorisation to enact local school taxes to support the schools, primarily through real property taxes. The federal government funds aid to states and school districts that meet minimum federal standards. School accreditation decisions are made by voluntary regional associations. The first free public school in America was the [[Syms-Eaton Academy]] (1634) in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and the first tax-supported public school in America was in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], founded by [[Ralph Wheelock|Rev. Ralph Wheelock]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Wheelock's Cure", by Christopher Gleason Clark, published in the July 1998 issue of  "The New England Historical and Genealogical Register", July 1998, Volume 152&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 88% of students attend public schools, compared with 9% who attend [[parochial school]]s, 1% who attend private [[independent school]]s, and 2% who are [[Homeschooling in the United States|homeschooled]].

Public school is normally split up into three stages: [[elementary school|elementary]] school ([[kindergarten]] to 5th or 6th grade), [[middle school|middle]] ("intermediate" or junior high school) from 5th, 6th, or 7th grade to 8th or 9th grade, and [[Secondary school|high school]] (9th or 10th to 12th grade).

The middle school format is increasingly common in which the elementary school contains kindergarten or 1st grade to 5th or 6th grade and the middle School contains 6th or 7th and 8th grade. In addition, some elementary schools are splitting into two levels, sometimes in separate buildings: [[elementary school]] (usually K-2) and intermediate (3-5).

The K-8 format is also an emerging popular concept in which students may attend only two schools for all of their K-12 education. Many [[charter school]]s feature the K-8 format in which all elementary grades are housed in one section of the school, and the traditional junior high school students are housed in another section of the school. Some very small school districts, primarily in rural areas, still maintain a K-12 system in which all students are housed in a single school.  A few 7-12 schools also exist.

In the United States, institutions of [[higher education]] that are operated and subsidised by the [[U.S. state|states]] are also referred to as "public." However, unlike public high schools, [[public university|public universities]] charge tuition, but fees are usually much lower than those charged by [[private university|private universities]], particularly for students who meet in-state residency criteria. [[Community college]]s, [[State university system|state colleges]], and state universities are examples of public institutions of higher education. In particular, many state universities are regarded as among the best institutions of higher education in the US but usually are surpassed in ranking by certain private universities and colleges, such as those of the [[Ivy League]], which are often very expensive and extremely selective in the students they accept. In several states, the administrations of public universities are elected via the general electoral ballot.

'''''The Brains Trust''''' was a popular informational [[BBC]] radio and later television programme in the United Kingdom during the 1940s and 1950s, on which a panel of experts tried to answer questions sent in by the audience.

== History ==
The series was created by BBC producers [[Howard Thomas]] and [[Douglas Cleverdon]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Howard ''With An Independent Air'' London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1977 {{ISBN|0-297-77278-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme started on the Forces radio service in January 1941, the first series under the name ''Any Questions?'' (a name later reused for [[Any Questions?|a different radio programme]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/great_moments/archive/january.shtml "The BBC Story – The Brains Trust"], ''bbc.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently renamed ''The Brains Trust'', it continued for 84 weeks continuously from its initial broadcast and became one of the most popular of informational programmes. Because of its popularity, it was moved to the peak time on Sunday afternoons. It was typically heard by around 29% of the UK population and generated four to five thousand letters each week from the general public. During the early war years it helped raise morale on the Home Front, and the verbal sparring between its three original panel members, especially [[Julian Huxley]] and [[C. E. M. Joad|Cyril Joad]], made it one of the most popular programmes with listeners.(2)

The radio programme ended in May 1949 and transferred to [[BBC television]] in the 1950s. The soundtrack was broadcast on the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] during the week following the television broadcast.

==Revival in the early 2000s==

The programme enjoyed a brief revival in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when it was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]]. It was then presented by [[Joan Bakewell]]. It featured a variety of guests, including [[Theodore Zeldin]], Ian Stewart, [[A.S. Byatt]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Angela Tilby]].

== Members ==
The original three members of the broadcasting team were [[C. E. M. Joad]] ([[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]), [[Julian Huxley]] ([[biologist]]) and Commander [[A. B. Campbell]] (retired [[naval officer]]). The chairman was [[Donald McCullough (broadcaster)|Donald McCullough]]. Later participants included: [[Edward Andrade]], [[Noel Annan, Baron Annan|Noel Annan]], [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Jacob Bronowski]], [[Collin Brooks]], [[Violet Bonham Carter, Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury|Violet Bonham Carter]], [[Alan Bullock]], [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], [[Kenneth Clark]], [[Margery Fry]], Commander [[Rupert Gould]], [[Will Hay]], Bishop [[Joost de Blank]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[John Maud]], [[H. L. A. Hart|Herbert Hart]], [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] (chairman), [[Anna Neagle]], [[Egon Ronay]], [[Bertrand Russell]], Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], [[Hannen Swaffer]], [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)]], [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]] (as chairman), [[Lord Dunsany]], [[Barbara Ward]] and [[Tom Wintringham]].

[[Norman Fisher (educationalist)|Norman Fisher]] was a later chairman of the panel.&lt;ref name="BBC-p00lk25p"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lk25p|title=A History of the Brain, The Brain's Trust - Dr W. Grey Walter|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Ross Williamson was also on the panel on occasion and was Chairman in 1955

== Format ==

The concept was simple. Listeners or viewers sent in questions on subjects ranging from practical conundrums to moral dilemmas for the panel members to answer. The panellists were chosen for the unique contributions each could bring to the subject matter – from the most erudite and serious to the most irreverent and comedic. One question which has become a classic example of its kind was 'How does a fly land on a ceiling? Does it loop the loop, or what?'. Although questions on religion and politics were initially included, these were banned as the programme progressed, following complaints from the Church{{which?|date=January 2018}} and Government. Concern also arose with the BBC itself. One controller, A.P.Ryan, wrote to the Director-General complaining of the programme's political bias. The Controller of Programmes analysed the political attitudes of contributors and calculated a proportion of
twenty-five left-wing and twenty-eight right-wing along with three 'doubtfuls'. He agreed, however, that two of the three regulars, Joad and Huxley,
were left-wing. They were also agnostics, a matter of irritation to Dr J.W. Welch, the Director of Religious Broadcasting. In June 1941 the Controller of Programmes instructed the panel to 'avoid all questions involving religion, political philosophy or vague generalities about life'. In June of
the following year the Board of Governors came down with full force on religion: 'questions about religion were in future to be excluded from the Brains Trust programmes'.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Thomas, ''With an Independent Air'', London : Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1977, 81-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversation was free-wheeling, unscripted and unrehearsed, relying on the skills of the presenters to fashion cogent responses in the time available. This produced an 'edge-of-the-seat' feel to the performance which did much to add to its popularity.

== American version ==
An American version of this programme, devised and produced by then television producer/director Jeff Smith, aired on [[WTTW]] Channel 11, the [[PBS television]] outlet in Chicago in the early sixties with an original revolving "cast" of [[Alec Sutherland]], Director of Continuing Education at the University of Chicago; [[Paul Haggerty]], a former [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]], musician and [[Storytelling|raconteur]]; [[Robin Pearce]], an artist, film maker, lecturer on the fine arts and a world traveller; [[Paul Schilpp]], a professor of philosophy at [[Northwestern University]]; [[Dick Applegate (journalist)|Dick Applegate]], foreign correspondent, TV newsman and commentator; [[Dan Q Posin]], [[DePaul University]] Professor and host of his own television programme on WTTW, "Dr. Posin’s Universe"; [[Nathan Schwartz]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and raconteur; [[Ralph Eisendrath]], lawyer and civic leader; and moderator [[DJR Bruckner]], at that time a labour writer for the Chicago Sun Times and for many years after that, a theater critic for the New York Times. Only four panellists plus the moderator appeared on each programme.

In contrast to the British programme, the questions for the American spin-off were revealed to the team beforehand so that they could have some time to think about them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11380">'''The First-Year Experience (FYE)''' (also known as the '''Freshman-Year Experience''' or the '''Freshman Seminar Program''') is a program at many [[United States|American]] [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] designed to help students prepare for the transition from [[high school]] to college. FYE programs often foster the participation of students in co-curricular events such as [[Common reading|common reads]], concerts, art exhibits, and guest lectures.

Depending on the school, the course can last anywhere from two weeks to a full school year. Some larger universities, such as the [[University at Albany, SUNY]], through their Project Renaissance Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm "Project Renaissance Program,"] SUNY Albany website.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222220622/http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm |date=December 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;create a "small college" feel by allowing freshmen to do their first-year courses in one section of the university. 

While the origins of the program remain unclear, many people attribute the start of the First-Year Seminar to the [[University of South Carolina]], which houses the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition and holds a series of workshops for colleges and universities to better their own first-year programs.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

== History ==
Originally, Boston College was where the first Freshman Orientation class was offered in the year 1888. Reed College, based in Portland, Oregon, was the first institution to offer a course for credit when, in 1911, they offered a course that was divided into men-only and women-only sections that met for 2 hours per week for the year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigger|first1=Jessica|title=Improving the Odds for Freshman Success|url=http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advising-first-year-students.aspx|website=Nacada Clearinghouse|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, [[University of South Carolina]] President Thomas Jones faced campus unrest and violence. In the aftermath he vowed to create a new course designed to "bond students to the institution and transform the way that undergraduate students were taught."&lt;ref name=FYE-history&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/fye/center/history.html "Our History,"] University of South Carolina National Resource Center for The First-Year Experience and Students in Transition website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Carolina introduced "University 101," designed to "improve the educational experiences of first-year college students."&lt;ref name=FYE-history /&gt;

Carolina's program became a model for colleges and universities across the country, and in 1982, representatives from 175 schools came to Carolina to meet about the first-year experience. In 1983, Carolina's University 101 faculty director, John N. Gardner, organized the first Annual Conference on the Freshman Year Experience. 

In 1986, Carolina partnered with the [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic]] to produce the first International Conference on the First-Year Experience. Also in 1986, Carolina established the National Resource Center; as it broadened its focus it underwent a number of name changes, settling on the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition in 1998. As the Center states on its website:
{{blockquote|Today, the Center collaborates with its institutional partner, University 101 Programs, in pursuit of its mission to advance and support efforts to improve student learning and transitions into and through higher education. Through its work with conferences and continuing education, a full complement of publications, the pursuit of a research agenda, and the creation and dissemination of online resources, the Center has grown to become the trusted expert, internationally recognized leader, and clearinghouse for scholarship, policy, and best practice for the first-year experience and all post-secondary student transitions.&lt;ref name=FYE-history /&gt;}}

== Typical structure  ==
Many of the colleges and universities that use the program require that all incoming freshmen take the freshman seminar; other schools have the program as optional, but recommended. Most first-year seminars are a semester long and start at [[student orientation]]. From orientation, students enroll in the course, which gives them a variety of college experiences, from tours of the campus to a breakdown of how to study for tests. Many schools even offer students help with purchasing books from the school's bookstore.

For instance, as part of [[Mitchell College]]'s First-Year Experience (FYE) program for transitioning into college, first-year students are assigned to Freshman Interest Groups (FIGs) in their first semester according to a common academic interest or major. These groups explore the topics and issues related to their chosen path. Those who arrive at Mitchell undecided about their academic route are also grouped together to allow for a broader survey of options. Students are encouraged to communicate their unique perspective and make connections through co-curricular activities.

[[Colby College]]'s outdoor orientation COOT (Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips) program is designed to ease new students' transition into college and introduce them to [[Maine]]'s cultural and natural resources. COOT features an on-campus orientation and a variety of trips, including hiking trips at [[Acadia National Park]] and [[Mount Katahdin]] canoe trips on the [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] and Moose Rivers, and other trips around the state. There are over 60 different trips, designed to appeal to incoming students with a variety of interests and fitness levels, and more "front country" trips have been added in recent years, including service- and arts-oriented options such as an organic farm stay and a challenge course.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/dos/coot/index.cfm "Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips,"] Colby College website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; COOT leaders are chosen from upperclass students who apply for these positions, and are expected to help the students both during and after the trip with the adjustment to campus life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In 1991, [[Norman Adler]] initiated the Penn Reading Project at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an integrative introduction to liberal learning for college freshmen newly arriving on campus. Subsequently, Freshman [[Common reading|Reading Projects]] have been adopted widely as part of the first-year experience at many college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.www.upenn.edu/themeyear/proof/prp-archive-overview.html "PRP Archive,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713154132/https://secure.www.upenn.edu/themeyear/proof/prp-archive-overview.html |date=2015-07-13 }} University of Pennsylvania website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program credits ==
As a standard for most first-year seminars, many colleges give students one to two credits for completing the program, such as [[UC Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freshmanseminar.uci.edu/ "Freshman Seminar Program,"] UC Irvine website. Accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools, such as the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]] in [[Old Westbury, New York]], merge the program into a second course which helps to satisfy [[New York (state)|New York]]'s general education requirement.{{cn|date=May 2015}} In addition, the school recently introduced its Civic Engagement program, which is designed to allow students to participate in [[community service]] as a part of its First-Year Experience program.

== Workshops and training ==
The University of South Carolina hosts a seminar every year in which the many colleges and universities which have the First-Year Program get together to improve their own programs,  and to offer suggestions to their colleagues on how they might also improve. The workshop is usually a week long and attendance is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/univ101/ "University 101 Programs,"] University of South Carolina website. Accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
The [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]'s [[First-Year Experience]] program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101). The program aims to assist students in discovering their purpose, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with a plan for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six [[appreciative advising]] stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, B.L; Atwood, J.A. (November 2006). "Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first-semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first-semester GPA of 2.72.

J.N. Gardner, member of The Journal of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers and author of The freshman-year experience, emphasized the importance of having courses that focus on the first few weeks of college. During this time is most likely when students will make the decision to drop-out, due to the increase of feeling personal independence and habit forming, as well as forming relationships that they will continue throughout their college careers.  Gardner also suggested that things such as curriculum modifications, academic advisement, faculty led freshmen level courses instead of graduate student led, living/learning environments, peer counseling, and special freshmen administrative units improve the student’s freshman year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigger|first1=Jessica|title=Improving the Odds for Freshman Success|url=http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advising-first-year-students.aspx|website=Nacada Clearinghouse|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Substitute 2: School's Out''''' is a 1998 straight-to-DVD [[action film|action]]-[[crime film|crime]]-[[thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[film]] directed by Steven Pearl and starring [[Treat Williams]] as Carl Thomasson (later spelled Karl in the sequels), a mercenary who masquerades as a teacher in order to enter a tough urban school and wreak his revenge upon his brother's killer. 

The film has very little connection to ''[[The Substitute]]'', other than Joey Six (protagonist Jonathan Shale's only surviving mercenary in the first film, this time portrayed by Angel David instead of [[Raymond Cruz]]) aiding Thomasson during the course of the movie. A reference early in the film indicates, through a photograph and short conversation between Thomasson and Joey Six, that Shale and Jane Hetzko (Shale's girlfriend) had married and now teach in foreign nations as part of the [[Peace Corps]]. It is also noted that Shale and Thomasson had served in the Army, as well as working as mercenaries together.  

==Plot==
Randall Thomasson is gunned down while attempting to talk his way out of a carjacking. His brother, Karl, attends his funeral and attempts to make amends with his niece, who is angry that Karl never contacted her or her father.

Karl decides to investigate his brother's death, and goes undercover as a teacher, facing cynical and reluctant faculty, violent and disruptive students, and a system that—to Karl's eyes—has become broken from the inside, all while attempting to protect his teenage niece.

Recruiting Joey Six, and a rather unorthodox janitor, Thomasson turns the school into an after-hours battleground, fighting against well-armed gang members, and—eventually—the school's auto-repair teacher ([[B. D. Wong]]), who is also involved in the gang's 'chop-shop' operation.

'''''University of the Air''''' was an educational radio programme produced by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] from the late 1950s until 1965, consisting of recorded lectures on various subjects.

In 1965, both this programme and another CBC radio programme, ''[[The Learning Stage]]'', were replaced in favour of a new show, ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'', which is still broadcast on [[CBC Radio One]].
