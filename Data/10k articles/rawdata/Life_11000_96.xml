      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10905">'''Atsuko Natsume''', known as Nuku Nuku ([[English language|English]]: "snuggly-wuggly"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Helen|authorlink=Helen McCarthy|title=500 Manga Heroes &amp; Villains|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]]|year=2006|location=Hauppauge, NY |page=283|isbn=978-0-7641-3201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the main protagonist of the ''[[All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku]]'' [[OVA]], TV series, and DASH OVA. In the DASH series, Atsuko is named Atsuko Higuchi, rather than Atsuko Natsume, but retains the Nuku Nuku nickname. In all three, her Japanese voice actress is [[Megumi Hayashibara]] and her English voice actress is [[Allison Keith]].

In the OVA and TV series, Nuku Nuku is shown as a green-eyed, magenta-haired young girl of around fourteen to sixteen with a large bust, while in DASH, she is depicted as a nineteen-year-old girl, with green hair and golden eyes. In all three incarnations, Nuku Nuku will often have robotic cat ears pop out of her head.

==Description==
Atsuko Natsume is an alias that Nuku Nuku was given to pass as a real girl; she prefers to be called Nuku Nuku which is considered her true name. In truth, she is a biotech-type android of sorts with the brain (or nervous system as some sources claim) of a cat inserted inside. She was originally a cat until an incident (differs depending on each series) caused her brain to be transferred into the body of a war robot built by Mishima Industries. In the OVA and TV series, Nuku Nuku was created by Kyusaku Natsume, while in DASH, she was created by a friend of his. Regardless of which series, Nuku Nuku lives with Akiko, Kyusaku and their son, Ryuunosuke, who she considers her family.

In the OVA, Nuku Nuku acts as the protector for Ryunosuke while he's in the middle of a custody battle between Kyusaku and his wife, Akiko, the granddaughter of the weapons-producing Mishima Industries. They parted when they argued about the usage of his NK-1124 android (who would become Nuku Nuku), and Kyusaku took their son with him.

In the TV series, Nuku Nuku's role as protector changes, since Akiko and Kyusaku live together (albeit dysfunctionally and always arguing). Instead, she's protecting her family and her classmates from the machinations of Mishima Industries (whose president is different in this series).

In DASH, Nuku Nuku's role as protector degrades, only using her powers to stop berserk machines of Mishima, or occasionally their human agents, as she is programmed to protect all life. Like in the TV series, Akiko and Kyusaku also live together (still slightly dysfunctional) But, like Nuku Nuku, they have more mature natures as Akiko still works for Mishima Industries but in a lesser capacity and wears glasses. In this series, Ryunosuke is now 14 years old and has an immense crush on Nuku Nuku, who in this series is referred to by the name Atsuko Higuchi.

==Abilities==

Nuku Nuku possesses incredible physical abilities. Since her body was constructed as a military project, she is technically a combat cyborg. Her strength is nothing short of superhuman, easily capable of lifting hundreds of pounds with ease, throwing punches that can disable armored military vehicles, and leaping dozens of feet through the air. Her stamina is equally impressive, enabling her to utilize her amazing strength for long periods of time-one use for which she commonly uses this ability is to ride her bicycle on the highway, easily outrunning most automobiles. Her greatest asset (due to her peaceful nature) is her amazing resiliency, she has survived falls from aircraft and direct hits from heavy artillery. As her [[brain]] is that of a cat's, Nuku Nuku's reflexes, dexterity and balance are equally impressive.

Throughout the OVA and TV series, Nuku Nuku has survived being shot with a rocket, thrown through walls, dropped from hundreds of feet, and even an explosion that decimated a good deal of the city. In DASH she has a Transformation sequence which causes her abilities become active and is sometimes called 'Super Dynamite Girl', though this name is never actually used in the series, although Ryuunosuke refers to her as both a 'super sexy mystery woman' and as 'Miss Sexy Dynamite' in DASH when she is in this form and it is not until the very final episode of the series that he learns that Nuku Nuku and 'Super Dynamite Girl' are the same person. Nuku Nuku's tactical form is referred to as 'Maneki City's famous Hyper Woman' during episode nine, which features the battle between Sangoku Bross and Soldat in a battle between giant robots that quickly turns deadly as the latter robot apparently malfunctions and takes the commentator for the battle hostage to win its battle with Bross.

In DASH, Nuku Nuku's abilities are downgraded for a more cybergirl archetype. Early on her Powers are only active during her transformation into 'Super Dynamite Girl'. Her superhuman endurance is still present, but reduced in its effectiveness, as she has been seen cut and bleeding, indicating that in DASH, she actually has some approximation of organs aside from her brain, as something must send blood through her body. She can create claws of energy from her hands. She also disperses blasts of heat and energy. According to the official insert for the 2003 release of DASH on DVD, these powers are explained as a weapon called 'Blast Breakers'. This is what causes her to be able to shoot what the insert describes as 'high vibration, high heat' bursts of energy and can use these breakers to literally claw right through various materials. These breakers also allow her to lift a heavy tank or punch through a one-meter thick steel plate.

The insert for DASH also includes a full list of the other powers this version of Nuku Nuku has in addition to the Blast Breakers as well as a list of four forms for Nuku Nuku. Mode One is listed as her normal form, in which she ordinarily appears. Mode Two is her Tactical Form, which is identified as Super Dynamite Girl. Mode Three is referred to as Battle Form and is listed as being 'for more intense battle', but this form, and Mode Four, her so-called 'Final Form'— which is listed only as 'classified' by the insert — are never seen in the course of the series.

Because of her mechanical structure, Nuku Nuku can be linked with special devices to enhance her power in the OVAs and Nuku Nuku TV. She may also have been capable of doing so in DASH, but was not shown doing so, though she did work side by side with the large robot called Sangoku Bross in episode nine of the series.

==Personality==

In all three series, Nuku Nuku is displayed as happy, caring, naive, and protective of her loved ones. But, In DASH She has a little more maturity.   Nuku is very attached to her "father", Kyuusaku, even going so far as to refer to him as "Papa-san". She generally prefers not to fight and does not display any aggression to people who have wronged her. For example, in the OVA, Nuku Nuku does not hate Akiko at all, and even calls her "Mama-san,". In the same series, another android known as Eimi tried to steal Nuku Nuku's body (and later just focused on destroying her), but Nuku Nuku took her actions as just simple playing. Nuku Nuku is also an amazing homemaker in all three series, shown by how she's always cooking and cleaning for her family and with a smile on her face. Nuku Nuku always feels she has to protect someone when they're in danger, whether they're her friends and her family. She will only fight when this happens. Due to her personality and attractive figure, Nuku Nuku is always the main attraction of many young boys. Once when she worked at a restaurant, she was the sole reason their business tripled from all the young men coming in to see her.

The strongest and more complex of Nuku Nuku's relations would be with Ryuunoske. In the OVA, Ryuunoske was the one who discovered her as a cat (shortly before she was injured, leading her to becoming an android). She is most protective of him, as a devoted older sister, which usually spurs on her powers. In the OVA, it is likely this is due to the kindness he showed her by taking her in when she was a stray cat. Nuku Nuku always wants to be there for Ryuunoske, once suggesting she'd go to his school instead because she'd thought he'd be lonely without her. Nuku Nuku always tries to make Ryuunoske happy; for example, when she damaged his bike by accident, she went to work to buy him a new one. In DASH, her relationship with Ryuunoske is changed to that of a young man with a crush on the cute girl. Still, they share a deep closeness rivaling their sibling one in the OVA and TV series, and by the end of the series, Nuku Nuku has found herself reciprocating Ryuunosuke's romantic feelings, though this revelation comes just as she essentially commits suicide to stop her homicidal sister Rei Rei, making the moment bittersweet for the both of them.

One of Nuku Nuku's most played-on quirks is the fact she's still technically a cat in mind. Often, she will get excited when she sees a mouse and will chase after it, though this is only seen in the OVAs, TV series and manga, while in DASH! she does not portray those characteristics, instead she will often paw at her face with a fist as if grooming herself. This is typically seen after mealtimes or just after waking up from the previous night's sleep. Nuku Nuku is also a sucker for catnip in all forms of animation and the manga except for her appearance in DASH, in which she and Kyuusaku make every effort to conceal her nature and origins until the very end of the series.

==Weakness==
If anything, Nuku Nuku's greatest weakness is her naivety. She never assumes danger until it's too late, and then often sees it as play instead. Only when someone she cares about is in danger will she actually take it seriously.

Another weakness Nuku Nuku possesses, though light, is a drunk-like state when she smells catnip. She'll stagger around and lick anyone who's covered in it.

Nuku Nuku is also unable to swim unless she is given a special mechanical upgrade. In the OVA, she sunk like a rock, while in the TV series, she was simply unable to swim, until she sensed Kyusaku and Ryuunoske both in danger. In DASH her powers are mostly inactive until she is activated in TACTICAL FORM or detects life is in danger. In DASH, she also had a form of selective memory loss caused by her creator Professor Higuchi, which blocked off most of her knowledge of herself, her true nature, and how her powers worked. She also could not aid anyone who was artificially created at first, however she overcame this limitation when Sangoku Bross was endangered, and she was able to activate her tactical form by sheer force of will and the desire to protect the larger machine.

The '''Bachelor of Powalgarh''', also known as the '''Tiger of Powalgarh''', was an unusually large [[Bengal tiger]], and is said to be 3.23 meters long when measured between pegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcats.com/2008/05/bengal-tiger.html |title=Bengal Tiger |publisher=Of Cats |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 to 1930, this male tiger was the most sought-after [[trophy hunting|big-game trophy]] in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]]. When the tiger was shot in the winter of 1930 by [[Jim Corbett]], he detailed the story in his book ''[[Man-Eaters of Kumaon]]'', published by [[Oxford University press]] in 1944.

==Sources==
Information about the male Bengal tiger comes from a documentary-style story written by [[hunter]], [[Conservation movement|conservationist]], and [[author]] [[Jim Corbett]] in his book ''[[Man-Eaters of Kumaon]]'', published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in [[India]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/India/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195622553 |title=Oxford University Press: Man-Eaters of Kumaon: Jim Corbett |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size and previous hunter attempts==
In 1923, Corbett first discovered the tiger in a steep ravine within a secure retreat.  Government rules prohibited night-time shooting, which inadvertently helped the highly sought after tiger survive.

Corbett took Commissioner Wyndham (who he said "knows more about tigers than any other man in India") and two experienced ''[[Hunter|shikaris]]'', to view the [[Pugmark|pug marks]] of the tiger. After the four examined and measured the pugmarks, Wyndham believed the tiger to be ten feet long between pegs. One shikari said he was 10'5" over curves, while the other said he was 10'6" or more. All four said they had never seen larger pugmarks.

Before Corbett, many attempts had been made to bag the animal, with no one having ever shot him. Two famous hunters, Fred Anderson and Huish Edye, came close, though small mistakes were the cause of their failures. Anderson described the tiger as "big as a Shetland pony," while Edye said it was as big as a donkey. A herder and former poacher, who was attacked by the tiger, said to Corbett that the Bachelor was a ''shaitan'', the Hindi word for 'devil', of a tiger, the size of a camel.

Seven years after the commissioner measured the pugmarks, Corbett and his sister measured the tiger's body twice, albeit without independent witnesses present to certify the measurements, which was 10'7" over curves.

==First encounter with the tiger==
In the winter of 1930, Corbett made his first hunt for the tiger, bringing his dog [[Spaniel|Robin]] with him. He followed the words of an old dak runner who said he saw the largest [[pugmark]]s he'd ever seen lead east to a well-wooded valley. The next morning, Robin picked up the scent of a tiger while Jim noticed large, fresh pugmarks. Fifty yards later, Robin located the tiger within a patch of [[clerodendron]] forty yards wide. Picking up Robin and entering the plants slowly, Corbett noticed the patch directly ahead swaying. After waiting for the tiger to leave the bush, Corbett went forward with his rifle drawn, but the tiger was nowhere in sight. Robin then signalled that the tiger had gone to the left, into a deep and narrow ravine. Not armed for dealing with a tiger in close quarters, and it being breakfast time, Corbett and Robin returned home.

After breakfast, Corbett returned alone, this time armed with a .450 rifle. He heard shouting and found a man up a tree, swinging an axe and yelling. The man told Corbett that he arrived in time to save him and his buffaloes from a tiger, the size of a camel, who had threatened the [[herder]] for hours. After retreating safely to his village, the man pleaded with Corbett to put his photography hobby aside for once and kill the tiger, which he said was big enough to eat a buffalo a day, and would wipe out his [[livestock]] in twenty-five. Corbett promised to do his best.

Returning to the plains in which he led the herder's buffaloes through, he heard the call of the bachelor searching for a mate. Corbett imitated a tiger call in reply, then laid down on his elbows in the open, waiting for the tiger to come. After Corbett gave another tiger call, the bachelor called back from a hundred yards away. Eighty seconds later, the tiger's head appeared above bushes four feet high, within ten yards to Corbett's right, and looking directly at him. Corbett slowly turned his rifle, and shot the tiger an inch under his right eye. Instead of dropping dead, as Jim expected, the big cat jumped straight into the air, well above the bushes, then out of panic attacked the tree beside him, tearing it to bits while roaring. Knowing that the tiger knew where he was, Corbett feared to reload his [[rifle]], lest the sound attract the bachelor's attention. He lay on the ground motionless for half an hour until the branches of the tree and nearby bushes stopped waving, and the roaring became less frequent. After all the sounds of thrashing had stopped, Corbett waited for thirty more minutes before slowly crawling thirty yards backwards and hiding in a nearby tree for shelter. After several more minutes, when he was sure that the tiger was gone, Corbett left for home.

==Tracking the tiger==
The next morning Corbett returned to the location, along with one of his men, an expert [[tree climbing|tree climber]]. After reaching the open grounds, the man climbed a tree, noticing many flattened [[clerodendron|bushes]] around, but no signs of the tiger itself. Corbett then instructed the man back in the tree to watch over him as he scoured the ground. Near the tree Corbett found blood profusely sprinkled everywhere, and two large pools of blood and a piece of bone two square inches, which was concluded to be the part of the tiger's skull. As a wounded tiger would growl or charge after hearing a gunshot again, Corbett fired a hundred rounds at bushes near a blood-stained tree, but to no avail. Not finding the tiger within the area, Corbett went home.

==Final encounter with the tiger==
The following morning the herder approached Corbett. He learned that the tiger was shot through the head and, upon his buffaloes finding dried spots of blood, concluded that the tiger must be dead. He offered Jim to use his buffaloes to find the tiger's body using their keen sense of smell, which Corbett agreed upon. Reaching the location where he shot the tiger, Corbett found a hollow filled with dead leaves, flattened with patches of blood around it. Corbett concluded the bachelor must have been lying in the same spot yesterday while he was expending a hundred cartridges. Being uncomfortable with the thought of possibly being between a wounded tiger and a herd of buffaloes, Corbett told the herder that the next day he will search for the tiger alone.

After four days of roaming the [[jungle]], Corbett found pugmarks of a big male tiger. Following the pugmarks led Corbett to a ''[[Bombax ceiba|semul]]'' tree, which was founded by tigers. After zig-zagging through nearby bushes for an hour or more, Corbett found a tiger, head and body hidden behind a tree with only a leg sticking out. Due to there being another tiger in the area, and not wanting to risk having to deal with two wounded tigers, Corbett choose not to shoot the tiger at that moment. The tiger then moved away. Upon inspecting the spot the tiger had been standing, Corbett found drops of blood, realizing that it was the bachelor all along.

While attempting to follow the tiger, Corbett heard a [[sambar deer|sambhar]] cry, then he heard a dry twig snap in the same spot as the cry, which was in a crowded bush area. Crawling on the ground, Corbett saw something red through the bushes. Crawling two yards to the right Corbett looked up to find the tiger in front of him, staring directly at him. Two bullet shots later the tiger fell to his side without a sound, ending the hunt for the province's most sought after [[trophy hunting|trophy]] of the decade. He didn't need to examine this tiger's pugmarks to know it was the Bachelor of Powalgarh, for his proportions were magnificent. The bullet wound from four days ago was hidden by a wrinkle of skin on the front of his head, while the back of the head had a large hole, surprisingly clean and healthy.

Knowing people heard his rifle, Corbett hurried home to relieve the anxiety of the villagers and to gather a carrying party. With his sister, Robin, and twenty men, Corbett returned to the spot where the tiger lay. Corbett measured the tiger twice, one on the spot and another at home, seven years after Wyndham and his men measured the tiger. Corbett and his sister found the tiger to be 10' 7" (322.58&amp;nbsp;cm), over curves.

'''Bridey Murphy''' is a purported 19th-century Irishwoman whom U.S. housewife '''Virginia Tighe''' (April 27, 1923 – July 12, 1995) claimed to be in a past life. The case was investigated by researchers and concluded to be the result of [[cryptomnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gravitz, M. A. (2002). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12116612 "The Search for Bridey Murphy: Implications for Modern Hypnosis"]. Am J Clin Hypn 45: 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 107. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypnotic regression==

{{Main|Past life regression}}

In 1952, Colorado businessman and amateur [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] '''Morey Bernstein''' put housewife Virginia Tighe (Ruth Simmons) of [[Pueblo, Colorado]], in a trance that sparked off startling revelations about Tighe's alleged past life as a 19th-century Irishwoman and her rebirth in the United States 59 years later. Bernstein used a technique called [[Past life regression|hypnotic regression]], during which the subject is gradually taken back to childhood. He then attempted to take Virginia one step further, before birth, and was astonished to find he was listening to Bridey Murphy.

Tighe's tale began in 1806, when Bridey was eight years old and living in a house in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. She was the daughter of Duncan Murphy, a barrister, and his wife Kathleen. At the age of 17, she married barrister Sean Brian McCarthy, who she claimed taught at [[Queen's University Belfast]], to which she moved. Tighe told of a fall that caused Bridey's death and of watching her own funeral, describing her tombstone and the state of being in life after death. It was, she recalled, a feeling of neither pain nor happiness. Somehow, she was reborn in America, although Tighe/Bridey was not clear how this event happened. Virginia Tighe herself was born in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] in 1923, had never been to Ireland, and did not speak with even the slightest hint of an Irish accent.

==Book publication and response==

[[File:Morey Bernstein hypnotist.png|thumb|Hypnotist Morey Bernstein with Virginia Tighe.]]

The biographical details related by Bridey were not fully checked before the publication of Bernstein's 1956 book ''The Search for Bridey Murphy''. However, once the book had become a bestseller, almost every detail was thoroughly checked by reporters who were sent to Ireland to track down the background of the elusive woman. It was then that the first doubts about her "reincarnation" began to appear. Bridey said she was born on December 20, 1798, in Cork and that she had died in 1864. There was no record of either event.&lt;ref&gt;Civil registration of all deaths in Ireland began on 1 January 1864. [http://www.groireland.ie/history.htm The General Register Office: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701133947/http://www.groireland.ie/history.htm |date=2010-07-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither was there any record of a wooden house called The Meadows in which she said she lived, just of a place of that name at the brink of Cork. Indeed, most houses in Ireland were made of brick or stone. She pronounced her husband's name as "See-an," but Seán is pronounced "Shawn" in Ireland. Moreover [[Queen's University Belfast]] did not exist at the time Tighe/Bridey claimed that Brian was working there.

Brian, which is what Bridey preferred to call her husband, was also the middle name of the man to whom Virginia Tighe was married. Some of the details did tally. For instance, her descriptions of the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] coastline were very accurate. So, too, was her account of a journey from Belfast to Cork. She claimed she went to a St. Theresa's Church. There was indeed one where she said there was, but it was not built until 1911. The young Bridey shopped for provisions with a grocer named Farr. It was discovered that such a grocer had existed.

The experts who examined the case of Virginia Tighe came to the conclusion that the best way to arrive at the truth was to check back not to Ireland but to Tighe's own childhood and her relationship with her parents. Morey Bernstein stated that Virginia Tighe (whom he called Ruth Simmons in the book) was brought up by a Norwegian uncle and his German-Scottish-Irish wife. However, it did not state that her actual parents were both part Irish and that she had lived with them until the age of three. It also did not mention that an Irish immigrant named Bridie Murphy Corkell (1892–1957)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census, April 1, 1930, State of Illinois, County of Cook, City of Chicago, enumeration district 1955, p. 19-A, family 428. U.S. Census, Jan.&amp;nbsp;1, 1920, State of Illinois, County of Cook, City of Chicago, enumeration district 1548, p. 12-B, family 331. Obituary of Bridie Corkell, ''Chicago Tribune'', August&amp;nbsp;10, 1957, part 1, p. . Bridie immigrated to the U.S. in 1908. Although Tighe claimed that she did not know Mrs. Corkell's maiden name, Bridie's spinster sister Margaret Murphy was living with the Corkells in the 1930 census.&lt;/ref&gt; lived across the street from Tighe's childhood home in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. Scientists{{who?|date=July 2018}} are satisfied that everything Virginia Tighe said can be explained as a memory of her long-forgotten childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (1957).

New York: Dover. pp. 315-320. {{ISBN|978-0-486-20394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They{{who?|date=July 2018}} are convinced that [[cryptomnesia]] accounted for the information.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011).

==Film adaptation==
''The Search for Bridey Murphy'' was also made into a 1956 movie of the same name. Produced by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], the film starred [[Teresa Wright]] (as Ruth Simmons), [[Louis Hayward]], and [[Nancy Gates]]. It was directed by [[Noel Langley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fowler|first1=Christopher|title=Invisible Ink: No 143, Noel Langley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/invisible-ink-no-143-noel-langley-8190747.html|publisher=Independent|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camilo Cienfuegos Gorriarán''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈmilo sjeɱˈfweɣoz ɣorjaˈɾan|lang}}; 6 February 1932 – 28 October 1959) was a [[Cuban revolution]]ary born in [[Havana]]. Along with [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Juan Almeida Bosque]], and [[Raúl Castro]], he was a member of the 1956 ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' expedition, which launched Fidel Castro's armed insurgency against the government of Cuban dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]]. He became one of Castro's top guerilla commanders, known as the "Hero of [[Yaguajay, Cuba|Yaguajay]]" after winning a key battle of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. His signature weapon was the [[Thompson submachine gun]].

He was appointed head of Cuba's armed forces shortly after the victory of Castro's rebel army in 1959. He was presumed dead when a small plane he was traveling in disappeared during a night flight from [[Camagüey]] to Havana later that year. Many have speculated and conspiracies have arisen concerning his mysterious disappearance. Cienfuegos, whose name translates in English to "a hundred fires," is revered in Cuba as a hero of the Revolution, with monuments, memorials, and an annual celebration in his honor.

==Early life==
Camilo Cienfuegos, born on 6 February 1932 in [[Havana]]'s Lawton district, grew up in a working-class family that had emigrated from [[Spain]] prior to the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] of 1936–39. His father, a tailor who worked a small shop in [[Havana]], had left-wing political principles.&lt;ref name=farber50&gt;{{cite book|last1= Farber|first1= Sanuel|title= The Origins of the Cuban Revolution Reconsidered |date= 2006 |publisher= University of North Carolina|pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistically inclined since early youth, Camilo enrolled in the [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes "San Alejandro"]] in 1950, but left his studies soon after due to financial problems. During this period he started working as a tailor apprentice in "El Arte," a fashion store in downtown Havana.

Around 1948 he became involved in politics, initially taking part in popular protests against rising bus-fares. In April 1953, Cienfuegos and a friend traveled to the U.S. on 29-day visitors' visas in search of work. They spent several months working low-paying jobs in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[San Francisco]] until immigration officials took them into custody and returned them to Cuba via Mexico. While in New York, Cienfuegos became involved with a Cuban political exile group and wrote a few articles for its newspaper, ''La Voz de Cuba'' ("The Voice of Cuba").&lt;ref name =  galvez&gt;{{cite book|title = Camilo: Señor de la Vanguardia | first = William | last = Gálvez | url = http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6016/6016_13.html |pages =  | location = Havana |year =  1979 | publisher = Editorial de Ciencias Sociales | accessdate = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In personality, writes one historian, Cienfuegos "exemplified the quintessential native, male, urban Cuban with his sense of humor, great interest in dancing and [[baseball]], good looks, love of women, and overall ''[[joie de vivre]]''".&lt;ref name=farber50/&gt; [[Rufo López-Fresquet]], who served as Minister of the Treasury for the first fourteen months of the revolutionary regime, described him as "a gay, happy-go-lucky, adventuresome sort".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political awakening==
In 1954, Cienfuegos became an active member of the underground student movement against autocratic President [[Fulgencio Batista]]. On 5 December 1955, the eve of the anniversary of the death of 19th-century Cuban independence hero [[Antonio Maceo Grajales|Antonio Maceo]], soldiers opened fire on Cienfuegos and other students who were returning to their Havana university after placing a wreath on Maceo's monument.&lt;ref name = I&amp;R&gt;Marel García-Pérez, Gladys: ''Insurrection &amp; Revolution: Armed Struggle in Cuba, 1952–1959''; Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998; {{ISBN|9781555876111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cienfuegos later described this as the moment in which he pledged himself to freeing Cuba from the Batista dictatorship. Jobless and harassed by police, he left Cuba in March 1956 and again traveled to the US, where he worked in [[Miami]] and San Francisco for a few weeks before heading to Mexico, intent on joining a small Cuban rebel army being organized by Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name = galvez/&gt; On arriving in Mexico, Cienfuegos befriended Castro and began training with the rebels. He was one of the 82 revolutionaries who set sail for Cuba aboard the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' in November 1956.

[[File:Camilio.jpg|right|thumb|Cienfuegos (right) with Fidel Castro in 1959 playing baseball. The team name ''Barbudos'' means "bearded ones"]]
Cienfuegos was not as "politically sophisticated" as the Castros or Guevara,&lt;ref name=farber50/&gt; and has been described as "ideologically an unknown quantity".&lt;ref name=bonsal107/&gt; He was not particularly dogmatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faria | first =Miguel| title =Fidel Castro and the 26th of July Movement| journal=Newsmax| date =27 July 2004| url =http://haciendapublishing.com/articles/fidel-castro-and-26th-july-movement| accessdate =24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the question of tactics, he departed from many others in the revolutionary movement in rejecting violence and revenge. In October 1958, when a Cuban [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] organization expressed concern that someone captured by the rebels might be tortured and killed, he replied:&lt;ref name=farber42&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farber|first1=Samuel|title=The Origins of the Cuban Revolution Reconsidered |date=2006 |publisher=University of North Carolina|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Your petition is unnecessary, because under no condition would we put ourselves at the same moral level as those we are fighting. ... We cannot torture and assassinate prisoners in the manner of our opponents; we cannot as men of honor and as dignified Cubans use the low and undignified procedures that our opponents use against us. The spirit of nobility and chivalry inculcated in each one of our soldiers, with respect for prisoners and for the military, is the reason why more than seven hundred of them, after twenty-three months of struggle against the tyranny, find themselves today in the bosom of their families.}}

==Guerrilla activities==
[[File:Luis Korda 02.jpg|left|thumb|Cienfuegos, left, entering [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] with [[Fidel Castro]] in January 1959.]]
The ''Granma'' arrived in Cuba on 2 December. After three days of swamps and mangroves, the rebels were surprised by Batista's forces at Alegría de Pío. The surviving rebels escaped in small dispersed groups and wandered for weeks in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains. Cienfuegos was one of the twelve who survived to rejoin Castro a month later.

In 1957, he became one of the leaders of the revolutionary forces, appointed to the rank of ''Comandante''. In 1958, after the collapse of the  government's [[Operation Verano]], Cienfuegos was put in command of one of three columns which headed west out of the mountains with the intention of capturing the provincial capital city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]]. Che Guevara was in command of another column and Jaime Vega was in command of the third. Vega's column was ambushed and defeated by Batista's forces.

Cienfuegos' and Guevara's columns reached the central provinces, where they combined their efforts with  other groups. Cienfuegos' column attacked an army outpost at [[Battle of Yaguajay|Yaguajay]] and, after a tough fight, forced the garrison to surrender on 30 December 1958. This earned him the nickname "The Hero of Yaguajay." Cienfuegos then advanced against Santa Clara in conjunction with Guevara's forces, and the other non-Castro forces from the Escambray front. Together, the two columns captured Santa Clara on 31 December. Most of the defenders surrendered without firing their weapons. Batista fled Cuba the next day, leaving the guerrilla fighters victorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas |first= Hugh |year= 1971 |title=The Cuban Revolution |publisher= Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn= 0-297-79037-4 |pages=238, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a rally on 8 January 1959, Castro interrupted his speech to ask Cienfuegos ''"¿Voy bien, Camilo?"'' ("Am I doing all right, Camilo?") His response ''"Vas bien, Fidel"'' ("You're doing fine, Fidel") was taken up by the crowd and became a [[slogan]] of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geyer|first1=Georgie Anne|title=Guerrilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro|date=1991|publisher=Andrews McMeel|location=Kansas City|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRhJGLnJjugC&amp;pg=PA201&amp; |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next several months, Cienfuegos served as Chief of Staff of the Cuban Army, helped defeat several anti-Castro uprisings, and played a role in implementing the regime's agrarian reforms.&lt;ref name="Sierra (2002)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/camilo.htm |first=J.A. |last=Sierra |title=Camilo Cienfuegos |work=Historyofcuba.com |date=28 October 1959 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
[[Huber Matos]], military chief of [[Camagüey]] province, had complained to Fidel Castro that communists were being allowed to occupy leadership positions in the revolutionary government and the army. Finding Castro unwilling to discuss his concerns, Matos, on 19 October, sent a letter to Castro resigning his command. Castro the next day denounced Matos. He sent troops to occupy key positions in  Camagüey, expecting incorrectly that Matos would lead a revolt, and named Cienfuegos to take command and to arrest Matos. Cienfuegos arrested Matos on 21 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faria |first= Miguel A. |year=2002 |title=Cuba in Revolution - Escape from a Lost Paradise |publisher= Hacienda Publishing |isbn= 0-9641077-3-2 |pages= 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the late evening of 28 October 1959, Cienfuegos' [[Cessna 310]] ('FAR-53') disappeared over the [[Straits of Florida]] during a night flight, returning from Camagüey to Havana. An immediate search lasted several days, but the plane was not found. By mid-November, the search was called off and Cienfuegos was presumed lost at sea. He quickly became a hero and martyr for the Cuban revolution.&lt;ref name=thomas1970&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas |first= Hugh |year= 1970 |title=Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom |publisher= Da Capo Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-306-80827-7 | pages= 842–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cienfuegos' disappearance remains unexplained. There is some debate in regard to Cienfuegos death, although Cuban government approved historians do not believe that there was any foul play by the government.&lt;ref name="Sierra (2002)"/&gt; There is speculation that Fidel was responsible, which Matos believes is the case. Despite the fact of Cienfuegos' evidently exceptional loyalty to Castro, he hesitantly supported the arrest of his friend Matos only days earlier. Che Guevara, who was close to Cienfuegos and named his son Camilo in his honor, dismissed the notion of Castro's involvement. Others offer the possibility that a Cuban air force fighter plane mistook Cienfuegos' plane for a hostile intruder and shot it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first= Jon Lee |year =1997 |title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life |publisher= Grove/Atlantic |isbn= 0-8021-3558-7 |page= 451}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of U.S. Ambassador [[Philip Bonsal]], Cienfuegos enjoyed Havana's nightlife and he "may have had a penchant for friendships and associations deemed undesirable by some of his more austere revolutionary comrades".&lt;ref name=bonsal107/&gt; There has also been speculation that Cienfuegos, unhappy with the move towards communism under Castro, faked his death and fled to [[Ybor City]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tampabay.com/hillsborough/the-time-a-dead-cuban-revolutionary-was-seen-in-tampa-20181121/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
[[File:Orden cubana de Cienfuegos.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The Order of Cienfuegos]]
Che Guevara stated about Cienfuegos the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Barrio |editor-first1= Hilda |editor-last2=Jenkins |editor-first2= Gareth | year= 2003 | title=The Che Handbook |publisher= St. Martin's Press |isbn= 0-312-32246-1 |page= 132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Few men have succeeded in leaving on every action such a distinctive personal mark. He had the natural intelligence of the people, who had chosen him out of thousands for a privileged position on account of the audacity of his blows, his tenacity, his intelligence, and unequalled devotion. Camilo practiced loyalty like a religion.}}

Cuba has named a [[Socialist Orders of Merit|socialist award]], the [[Order of Cienfuegos]], after him. On 28 October, school children throughout Cuba throw flowers into the sea or a river to honor Camilo Cienfuegos, repeating the spontaneous tribute of the Cubans who tossed flowers into the ocean when they heard his plane had been lost over the Cuba Florida Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 7 February 2016 | work = Miami New Times | date = 28 October 2009 | url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/who-killed-camilo-cienfuegos-6548166 | first = Jorge | last = Casuso | title = Who Killed Camilo Cienfuegos? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camilo is also remembered on the 20 [[Cuban peso]] bill and the 20 [[Cuban convertible peso]] bill. He was also pictured on the 40-cent coins, now discontinued. 
[[File:Homenaje a Camilo Cienfuegos en La Habana.jpg|right|thumb|Steel outline of Cienfuegos on the Ministry of Informatics and Communications, Havana, Cuba, 2011]]
The [[University of Matanzas]] bears the name "Camilo Cienfuegos." There are six military high schools named "Camilo Cienfuegos," which provide pre-military training to students aged 11 to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?169828-Cuban-Military-pictures/page19 |title=Cuban Military pictures - Page 19 |publisher=Militaryphotos.net |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood known until 1950 as "Central Hershey," in the municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, Havana, was renamed Central Camilo Cienfuegos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainsbury |first=Brendan |title=Lonely Planet Cuba |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5Wmz4oPcd4C&amp;pg=PA178&amp; |accessdate=15 September 2010 |year=2009 |editor=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781741049299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A museum dedicated to Cienfuegos –the Monumento y MuseoCamilo Cienfuegos– was built after his death in [[Yaguajay]], at the site of the barracks of the Batista's forces during the 1958 battle. The museum includes a diorama of the battle, as well as material relating to Cienfuegos' life before, during, and after the revolution. A large statue of him stands in front of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Museos de América Latina y el Caribe: Directorio | year=1991| publisher=Editorial José Martí}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 film ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]'', the character of Cienfuegos was "played with great verve" by [[Santiago Cabrera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 7 February 2016 | work = New York Times | title = Saluting the Rebel Underneath the T-Shirt | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/movies/12che.html | first = A.O. | last = Scott | date = 11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2009, to note the 50th anniversary of his death, a 100-ton steel outline of Cienfuegos' face and the words ''Vas bien, Fidel'' was added to the side of the Ministry of Informatics and Communications building on the [[Plaza de la Revolución]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | language = es | work = El Pais | accessdate = 7 February 2016 | date = 29 October 2009 | title = Cienfuegos ya tiene su sitio junto al 'Che' en La Habana | url = http://elpais.com/m/internacional/2009/10/29/actualidad/1256770822_850215.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canopic chests''' are cases used by [[Ancient Egyptians]] to contain the internal organs removed during the process of [[Mummy|mummification]]. Once [[canopic jars]] began to be used, in the late [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]], the jars were placed within canopic chests. Although the first proven canopic burials date from the Fourth Dynasty reign of [[Sneferu]], there is evidence to suggest that there were canopic installations at [[Saqqara]] dating from the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, Aidan, "Canopic Jars and Chests", in Redford, Donald B. (ed) (2001). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', vol. II, Oxford University Press. pp. 231–235&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections to Ancient Egyptian culture ==
[[File:Tutankhamun's canopic chest replica REM.JPG|thumb|Replica of [[Tutankhamun]]'s canopic chest on display at the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]].]]
Canopic chests had an important place in Egyptian culture. Canopic chests contained the internal organs ([[Viscus|viscera]]) of mummies, so they relate to the Egyptian belief that the afterlife is just as important as life on earth. Egyptians believed that everything had to be perfectly preserved to journey into the land after life and as part of the mummification process they removed viscera from the body. 

== Changes through history ==
The first canopic chests were simple and wooden, but as time went on they became more elaborate. Then, around the 21st Dynasty (1069-945 BCE) the Egyptians decided to leave the viscera inside mummies. But because they had been using canopic chests for thousands of years they kept putting them in tombs, just without anything in them. Canopic chests fell out of use during the [[Ptolemaic period]].

== Style and materials ==
The style and materials were different at different times, though always reflected the Egyptian ideal of perfectly measured and precise beauty.

=== Ptolemaic period ===
The tall wooden shrine-like chests had bright painting on their sides and a falcon crouching on top. Craftsmen coated the wood with [[gesso]] to prepare it for the pigment they then painted it with. All the decoration tells us something about Egyptian religion. The falcon on top represents [[Seker|Sokar]], a funerary god and picture on the sides show the chest’s owner worshiping Osiris, god of the afterlife; Ra-Horakhty, a combination of the gods Horus and Ra; four sons of Horus, each of whom guards one of the viscera traditional removed during mummification; the dyed pillar, which represents Osiris, and the [[tyet]], which represents Isis. The painting is not as perfectly measured and precise as earlier Egyptian art, because Egyptian civilization was decaying when it was made.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. Rapid progress has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990, with the global under-5 mortality rate declining by over half between 1990 and 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; However, despite advances, there are still 15,000 under-five deaths per day from largely preventable causes.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; About 80 per cent of these occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and just 6 countries account for half of all under-five deaths: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 45% of these children died during the first 28 days of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Li|last2=Oza|first2=Shefali|last3=Hogan|first3=Dan|last4=Chu|first4=Yue|last5=Perin|first5=Jamie|last6=Zhu|first6=Jun|last7=Lawn|first7=Joy E|last8=Cousens|first8=Simon|last9=Mathers|first9=Colin|title=Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000–15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616315938|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Child mortality refers to number of child deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 live births. However, the child mortality could be simplified into more specific terms such as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]], [[Prenatal development|perinatal]], [[Neonatal]], [[Infant|infancy]] and [[Under 5 Infant Mortality|under 5]]. Prenatal: child death before the birth, Perinatal: child death before one week of birth, Neonatal: child death before 28 days of birth, Infancy: child death before 1st birthday, and child mortality under 5 refer to any deaths from birth to the 5th birthday.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884617656|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=1944-|first=Weeks, John Robert,|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth |location=Boston, MA|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perinatal mortality rate: Number of child deaths within first week of birth/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Neonatal mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 28 days of life/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Infancy mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 12 months of life/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Child Mortality vs Fertility Rate.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Child mortality is high in countries where women have many children (high [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]]). Wealthy countries have lower child mortality rates than poor ones.]]
{{Further|Infant mortality}}
The leading causes of death of children under five include:

* [[Preterm birth]] complications (18%)
* [[Pneumonia]] (16%)
* Interpartum-related events (12%)
*[[Neonatal sepsis]] (7%)
*[[Diarrhea]] (8%)
*[[Malaria]]  (5%)
*[[Malnutrition in children|Malnutrition]] and Under nutrition

There is variation of child mortality around the world; countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode ([[Demographic transition model|DTM]]) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth state of the DTM. [[Chad]] infant mortality is about 96 per 1,000 live births. And developed country such as Japan [[infant mortality]] is about 2.2 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; In 2010, there were estimated to 7.6 million child deaths around the world and most of it occurred in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and 4.7&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/1023015914?pq-origsite=summon|title=Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; million died from infection and disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Child mortality isn’t only caused by infection and disorder, it is also caused by premature birth, birth defect, new born infection, birth complication, and disease like [[malaria]], sepsis, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/health-news-stories/child-mortality-causes-solutions|title=Child mortality: Top causes, best solutions {{!}} World Vision|date=2016-01-13|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less developed countries, [[malnutrition]] is the main source of child mortality.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 child deaths before the age of 5 and nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-survival/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

{{Further|Infant mortality}}

Child survival is a field of [[public health]] concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival 
interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include [[diarrhea]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and neonatal conditions.  Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. In 2015, the MDGs were replaced with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which aim to end these deaths by 2030. In order to achieve SDG targets, progress must be accelerated in more than 1/4 of all countries (most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa) in order to achieve targets for under-5 mortality, and in 60 countries (many in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) to achieve targets for neonatal mortality.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns.

=== Low-cost interventions ===
Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html|title=UNICEF  - Goal: Reduce child mortality|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oral rehydration therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/|title=WHO - New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf|title=Surveys - UNICEF MICS|website=www.childinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and [[diarrheal diseases]] can be reduced by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=May 2003|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. The UN Vaccine division as of 2014 supported 36% of the world's children in order to best improve their survival chances, yet still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children despite success in reducing polio, tetanus, and measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-05-01|title=Role of vaccine manufacturers in developing countries towards global healthcare by providing quality vaccines at affordable prices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601749|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|language=en|volume=20|pages=37–44|doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12568|issn=1198-743X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 for each capsule and given 2–3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt;

Essential newborn care - including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. [[Improved sanitation]] and access to clean [[drinking water]] can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic [[sanitation]], and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water.&lt;ref name="UNICEF WASH"&gt;[web=https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efforts ===
Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include [[UNICEF]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s; major child survival donors worldwide include the [[World Bank]], the British Government's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. In the United States, most non-governmental child survival agencies belong to the [[CORE Group]], a coalition working, through collaborative action, to save the lives of young children in the world's poorest countries.

== Epidemiology ==
Child mortality has been dropping as each country reaches a high stage of DTM. From 2000 to 2010, child mortality has dropped from 9.6 million to 7.6 million. In order to reduce child mortality rates, there needs to be better education, higher standards of healthcare and more caution in childbearing. Child mortality could be reduced by attendance of professionals at birth and by breastfeeding and through access to clean water, sanitation, and immunization.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In 2016, the world average was 41 (4.1%), down from 93 (9.3%) in 1990.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; This is equivalent to 5.6 million children less than five years old dying in 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

===Variation===

Huge disparities in under-5 mortality rates exist. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Furthermore, approximately 80% of under-5 deaths occur in only two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; India and Nigeria alone account for almost a third (32 per cent) of the global under-five deaths.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607200429/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as [[fertility rate]] and [[income distribution]]; the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate, where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html|work=TED talks|publisher=TED Conferences|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18061">'''Cy-Kill''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] from the [[Gobots]], [[Robo Machine]]s and Transformers toy line and fiction. Introduced as a toy in 1983, he is leader of the Renegade Gobot faction and the main antagonist of the animated series, where he was voiced by Bernard Erhard. He was the main villain of the ''Challenge of the Gobots'' animated series, who later appeared in the Gobots feature film. After the Gobots properties were purchased by Hasbro he made an appearance in a Transformers story. Hasbro has also used the name Cy-Kill for supporting characters in Transformers fiction.

In ''[[Challenge of the Gobots]]'', '''Cy-Kill''' was the leader of the evil [[Renegades (GoBots)|Renegades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954424,00.html | work=Time | title=Living: Hot Toys with a Special Twist | date=October 1, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | title = News | journal = Computer &amp; Video Games| volume = 1 | issue = 61 | page = 8 | date = |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100008.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally a member of the Guardians and friend of [[Leader-1]]. He wanted to be the sole ruler of Gobotron to better protect it (since he felt he was the mightiest guardian), but Leader-1 believed in democracy. This led Cy-Kill to break away from the Guardians and become the leader of the Renegades.&lt;ref&gt;"New licenses, categories, and items turn Tonka toward tomorrow". ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings magazine]]'', March 1, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to conquer the Gobot homeworld and have all the power for himself. He was very ruthless and a thorn in the side of the Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1-4402-1282-1 | pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Cy-Kill attempted to invade [[Earth]] with the help of crooked Unicom scientist [[Doctor Braxis]], but his plans were thwarted by the Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Battle for Gobotron|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Alan Burnett, Jeff Segal and Tom Ruegger |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= September 8, 1984 |season= 1|number= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardians were able to eventually capture him. Unfortunately he used his wheels against the guards to aid his escape (since his weapons were disconnected), causing the release of his lieutenant [[Fitor]] (also a former Guardian). Because of Fitor's aid, Cy-Kill was able to escape to his massive mobile base, [[Roguestar]], and threaten Gobotron once again. Although an attempted coup by the [[Master Renegade]] allowed the Guardians to assemble the [[Power Warrior Courageous (Gobots)|Courageous]] and save both Earth and [[Gobotron]], Cy-Kill would remain at large, threatening both planets.

The Guardians set up a lab to test their power suits on Earth. With [[Defendor (Gobots)|Defendor]] and [[Blaster (Gobots)|Blaster]] patrolling the lab [[Baron Von Joy]] and [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]] tested a new suit on [[Dozer (Gobots)|Dozer]]. Cy-Kill captured and tried to brainwash [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]], making him sabotage the lab and self destructing. [[Rest-Q]] check out Scooter, but Scooter refused to be examined. Eventually Scooter was freed from Renegade control. Cy-Kill, [[Cop-Tur]], [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]], [[Geeper-Creeper]], [[Pincher (Gobots)|Pincher]], and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attacked the lab, but it was defended by Leader-1, Baron Von Joy, Blaster, Dozer, [[Dumper (Gobots)|Dumper]], [[Road Ranger (Gobots)|Road Ranger]], Scooter, [[Scratch (Gobots)|Scratch]] and [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]]. Although the Guardians were winning the battle, an accidental backfire from Baron Von Joy's weapon allowed the Renegades to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= It's The Thought That Counts|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cy-Kill, [[Cop-Tur]], [[Crasher (Gobots)|Crasher]] and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attacked [[Leader-1]], [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]], [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]]. Crasher wounded Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians the Renegades retreated. Using the recordings Cy-Kill had [[Herr Fiend]] program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating the [[Space Bender]] weapon to Unicom, Leader-1 learned that the Renegades were attacking Washington. The Renegades ambushed Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the [[Command Center (Gobots)|Command Center]] back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then released duplicates of [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]], [[Rest-Q]], [[Van Guard]] and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter were able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends were being held. Cy-Kill then replaced [[Good Night (Gobots)|Good Night]]. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrated the Renegade base, freed the captured Guardians and escape from [[Spoons (Gobots)|Spoons]] and [[Fitor]]. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter used a hologram of [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]] to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians were attacked by the Guardian duplicates.

===Books===
Cy-Kill was featured in the 1986 children's book ''Collision Course Comet - Robo Machine Featuring The Challenge Of Gobots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collision Course Comet - Robo Machine Featuring The Challenge Of Gobots |author=Hanna-Barbera |year=1986 |ISBN=978-0-7235-7858-1 |publisher=Egmont Books |url=http://www.redshirt.co.uk/media/collision-course-comet/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521190903/http://www.redshirt.co.uk/media/collision-course-comet/ |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cy-Kill appeared in the 1985 Robo Machine book ''[[The Wagner Sirens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn=0-7235-7813-3|title=The Wagner Sirens|publisher=World International Publishing| year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robo Machines===
In the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' comic strip ''[[Robo Machines (comic)|Robo Machines]]'', Cy-Kill was a petty criminal on Robotron, already known to the Security Forces, before submitting himself to Stron-Domez' Robo Machine process, which added a transformation mechanism to his cybernetic body. While the initial attempt to assassinate the planet's president failed, Cy-Kill at least aided Stron-Domez' escape. He was modified on arrival on Earth, given a new fission cannon weapon by Stron-Domez. However, he held feelings of contempt for fellow Robo Machine Tank, and these bubbled over during their attack on Cholkham, when Cy-Kill was tricked into fighting his Renegade comrade. When the Security Forces tracked the Renegades to their [[Birmingham]] factory, Cy-Kill was the only Robo Machine to escape, carrying Stron-Domez to safety. He then performed an operation on his master to convert him into [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]].

Cy-Kill then coerced a variety of human tramps and vagrants to work in Zod's new factory, situated on the outskirts of London. However, he began to dislike Zod after the monster stole the pleasure of killing the SF Robo Machine [[Carry-All]] from him. Cy-Kill also grew more ambitious, and modified the brain of the Devil Invader [[Vamp (Gobots)|Casmodo]]n so it would obey him over Zod. He was briefly disabled by [[Leader-1|Leader One]] at the scrapyard. He showed his contempt for Zod by abandoning his damaged ersatz creator in the scrapyard, intending to observe and support Casmodon's attack on [[London]]. However, he was detained fighting the SF robot [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] outside the city. Scooter, with the aid of human Charlie Brampton, managed to trick him into being hit by a train, delaying him while Casmodon was defeated. He attempted to shoo them down once he extricated himself, but was driven off by Leader One. Frustrated at the Devil Invader's damage, he set off after the remaining SF forces by himself, and his attack was enough to cause the depleted Guardians to withdraw from Earth. At the end of the series, Cy-Kill was left on Earth, seemingly with Casmodon at his disposal.

===Fun Publications===
Cy-Kill appeared among the group investigating the Cataclysm destroying their universe in ''Fun Publications'' story "Withered Hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Withered Hope|author=S. Trent Troop &amp; Greg Sepelak|year=2008|publisher=The Transformers Collector’s Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Transcendent" [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]], [[Landquake]] and [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] arrive on a parallel [[Transtech]] [[Cybertron]], in the city of [[Axiom Nexus]]. They are greeted by that world's [[Cheetor]] and [[Silverbolt]], and are worried that [[Cliffjumper]] has gone missing. The arrivals are told that they are among many to arrive on this world and are brought to "processing". Among those waiting in processing are [[Autoceptor]], [[Bad Boy (Gobots)|Bad Boy]], [[Charger (Transformers)|Charger]] with [[Fire Beast]], [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], Cy-Kill, [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]], ''Universe'' [[Repugnus]], [[Sky-Byte]], [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]] and [[Treds]].

=== Toys ===
*'''''Gobots'' Cy-Kill''' (1983)
:The toy of Cy-Kill was originally [[Bandai]]'s ''Bike Robo'' from their [[Machine Robo]] toyline. Bike Robo was a heroic character in red, white, and blue colors. [[Tonka]], however, decided to make this character a villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycaw8JX_yFk&amp;feature=related |title=GoBots Toy Commercial 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=oAAuAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=Katsushi+Murakami |title=Patent US4571203 - Form-convertible toy robot - Google Patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:This toy was sold by itself and also in a gift pack with Snoop and Stinger.

*'''''Gobots'' Cy-Kill Redeco'''
:The Tonka version was originally released in the red, white, and blue, but in the final year of the toy line this was changed to a more "evil" black and green color scheme. The animated version, however, had already been drawn in the original colors and so he stayed that way on TV.

*'''''Gobots'' Super Cy-Kill'''
:A larger "Super GoBot" Cy-Kill was later released, based on the Bandai ''Big Bike Robo'' figure. As one of the lead characters from the TV series, Cy-Kill featured on numerous items of merchandise as well.

*'''Gobots Model Cy-Kill'''
:[[Monogram Models]] released [[Gobots model kits]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyarchive.com/Gobots/Models.html |title=STA: Go-Bots: Model Kits:Monogram Convertible Model Kits |publisher=Toyarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which actually converted, and contained a Cy-Kill model among 7 others. This toy was a redeco of a Cyclone motorcycle from the Mospeada anime.

Since 2002, Cy-Kill (as well as other GoBots) has made several cameo appearances in the ''[[Transformers franchise|Transformers]]'' comics. He is constantly destroyed as a [[running gag]], in most of these appearances (and in a story that had the Autobots as the antagonists, ''Leader-1'' was killed instead); this itself would be parodied by the webcomic ''Shortpacked''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortpacked.com/index.php?id=866 |title=Shortpacked! by David Willis - 2009 March |publisher=Shortpacked.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Cy-Kill made three appearances in [[Dreamwave Productions]] ''Transformers'' comic book series. The first was in the ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'' comic as one of the unnamed [[Decepticon]]s killed by the [[heralds of Unicron]]. The second, in the ''War and Peace'' miniseries, has Shockwave is overseeing the reactivation of the smelting pools; the two robots being executed within them are Cy-Kill and Leader-1. Lastly, in a flashback in the ongoing ''Generation One'' series, he was a gladiator who was defeated by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]].

===IDW Publishing===
In a nod to Dreamwave Production's portrayal of Cy-Kill as Megatron's opponent, [[IDW Publishing]] also featured a clash between the two of them in the second issue of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]''. In the rebooted origin of the [[Decepticon]]s, both Megatron and Cy-Kill are combatants in the illegal gladiatorial games held in Kaon. This version of Cy-Kill is much taller and designed to fit in more with the general look of the other Cybertronians. He meets a gruesome fate as, after being impaled and crushed under Megatron, he is executed with his own weapon.

Footage of the '''death of Neda Agha-Soltan''' ({{lang-fa|ندا آقاسلطان}}&amp;nbsp;– ''Nedâ Âghâ-Soltân''; 23 January 1983&amp;nbsp;– 20 June 2009) drew worldwide attention after she was shot dead during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]]. Agha-Soltan, a student of philosophy, was participating in the protests, accompanied by her music teacher, and was walking back to her car when she was fatally shot in the chest.

The murderer of Neda is disputed. According to Western media outlets such as [[CNN]], the [[BBC]] and [[Fox News]], she was shot by the [[Basij]], a paramilitary organization. Her death was captured on video by bystanders and broadcast over the Internet, and the video became a rallying point for the opposition. Agha-Soltan's death became iconic in the struggle of Iranian protesters against the disputed election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://100photos.time.com/photos/death-of-neda The Death of Neda | 100 Photographs | The Most Influential Images of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Nedā'' (ندا) is a word used in [[Persian language#Classic Persian|Classic Persian]] and modern [[Persian language|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;'''ندا''' has been borrowed from the same [[Classical Arabic]] word (a verb in Arabic) meaning "get together", "meet with", then "gather", "come together", "call together", "rally". It is a synonym of ''اجتمع''. A lot more meanings are given in dictionaries like ''Wörterbuch der Klassischen Arabischen Sprache (Dictionary of Classical Arabic)'', by Manfred Ullmann, Edward William Lane, the Arabic and Persian ''Moungued dictionaries -قواميس المنجد'' and many more.&lt;/ref&gt; to mean "voice", "calling" (sometimes understood as a "divine message", but this is not the etymological sense of ''ندا''), and she has been referred to as the "voice of Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |issn=0040-781X |last=Chua-eoan |first=Howard |title=What the World Didn't See in Tehran |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906040,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran TV says 10 died in protests |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8111352.stm |quote=Witness accounts on Saturday suggested police used live rounds, batons, tear gas, and water cannon to break up demonstrations that went on late into the night.

==Biography==
Agha-Soltan was the middle child of a middle-class family of three children,&lt;ref name="times-booth1"/&gt; whose family resided in a fourth floor flat on Meshkini Street in the [[Tehranpars]] district of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondent in Tehran (24 June 2009).

''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is a civil servant and her mother is a homemaker.&lt;ref name="times-booth1"/&gt; She was graduating from [[Islamic Azad University]], where she had studied Islamic theology as well as secular philosophies, but she withdrew after two semesters of study for two reasons, one being a disagreement with her husband Amir and his family, and the other being the atmosphere and the pressure of the authorities towards her appearance and dress in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Connett, David (28 June 2009).[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-online-around-the-world-in-60-minutes-1722467.html Iran online: Around the world in 60 minutes]. ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; She was divorced, and according to her mother, had difficulty in finding work because of how employers perceived her.&lt;ref name=Mother&gt;Wayne Drash and Octavia Nasr (5 November 2009).

Agha-Soltan was an aspiring [[underground music|underground musician]], who was studying her craft through private voice and music lessons.&lt;ref&gt;May, Rachel (22 August 2003).[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0822/p08s02-wome.html In Iran, no men allowed at women's music fest].

Those who knew her maintain that Agha-Soltan had not previously been very political&amp;nbsp;– she had not supported any particular candidate in the 2009 Iran elections&lt;ref name="latimes2009june23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/13/iran-demonstrations-viole_n_215189.html |title=Live-blogging the uprising |work=The Huffington Post |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |last=Pitney |first=Nico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– but that anger over the election results prompted her to join the protest.&lt;ref name="times-booth1"/&gt; Her [[voice teacher|voice]] and [[music teacher]], Hamid Panahi, who was accompanying Agha-Soltan during the protest and can be seen on the video trying to comfort the dying woman, told the media: "She couldn't stand the injustice of it." Panahi went on to state: "All she wanted was the proper vote of the people to be counted."

===Confusion regarding identity===
Her name is often miscited as "Neda Soltani". [[Neda Soltani]] is a different woman, whose Facebook profile photo was mistakenly published in many articles about the incident. She tried in vain to remove her photo from the internet. Claims from both sides have been made, including claims from the Iranian government that she was the same person as Agha-Soltan and had faked her own death; and others who claimed that she was herself an agent of the Iranian government impersonating Agha-Soltan to sully her memory.&lt;ref name=bbc2012-11-14/&gt; Within two weeks, she had fled from Iran and was granted [[asylum in Germany]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/iran-neda-soltani-id-mix-up|title=Iranian fugitive: identity mix-up with shot Neda wrecked my life|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 2012|author=Tracy McVeigh|accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[David Schraven]], [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/32571 ''Das zweite Leben der Neda Soltani''], Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, Heft 05/2010.

On 20 June 2009, at around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Neda Agha-Soltan was sitting in her [[Peugeot 206]] in traffic on [[Kargar Avenue]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="CNNRally"&gt;{{cite news |title='Neda' becomes rallying cry for Iranian protests |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=22 June 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/21/iran.woman.twitter/ |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/06/22/neda-soltan-young-woman-hailed-as-martyr-in-iran-becomes-face-protests/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8113552.stm |title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Middle East&amp;nbsp;— Death video woman 'targeted by militia' |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by her music teacher, Hamid Panahi.&lt;ref name="latimes2009june23"&gt;{{cite news |last=Daragahi |first=Borzou |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-neda23-2009jun23,0,366975,full.story |title=Family, friends mourn 'Neda,' Iranian woman who died on video |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_0623"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/world/middleeast/23neda.html |title=In a death seen around the world, a symbol of Iranian protests |last=Fathi |first=Nazila |date=22 June 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were on their way to participate in the protests against the results of the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neda Agha Soltan's story touches everyone except Iran's rulers |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6565497.ece |work=The Times |year=2009 |accessdate=2009 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neda: Latest iconic image to inspire |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/24/neda.iconic.images/ |last=Ravitz |first=Jessica |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's air conditioner was not working well, so she stopped her car some distance from the main protests and got out on foot to escape the heat.

Iranian state TV alleged that Neda Agha-Soltani was carrying blood in a concealed vessel within her mouth, a common practice of the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|MKO]], which she then broke to resemble internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;Golnaz Esfandiari, [https://www.rferl.org/a/Iran_State_TV_Suggests_Iconic_Protest_Death_Faked/1923414.html "Iran State TV Suggests Neda's Iconic Death Was 'Faked'"] – [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neda non graphic.jpg|thumb|A frame from the video of Agha-Soltan's death by gunfire]]
The videos spread across the internet [[Viral video|virally]], quickly gaining the attention of international media and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Langendonck, Gert Van (23 June 2009). [http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2280315.ece/Iconic_Iran_video_was_posted_in_the_Netherlands Iconic Iran video was posted in the Netherlands]. ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about the incident on Twitter, using a [[hashtag]] of #neda, became one of the "'trending topics'" by the end of the day on 20 June 2009.&lt;ref name="CNNRally"/&gt; The incident was not originally reported by the state-controlled Iranian media, but was instead first reported on by international media. The video was shown on [[CNN]] and other news networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youtube&amp;nbsp;– Neda's Death Becomes Iranian Symbol: News Current |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrB2FOLqiE |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three videos depicting her death. One shows her collapsing to the ground, apparently still conscious.&lt;ref name="video1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Young girl being killed by plain-clothes |accessdate=22 June 2009 |url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0db_1245519048 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second shows her only after she appears to lose consciousness and begins to bleed heavily.&lt;ref name="video2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Girl shot by police&amp;nbsp;– Second Angle |url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=fe5_1245534854 |accessdate=22 June 2009 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third video shows her just as she begins to bleed profusely.&lt;ref name="video3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran&amp;nbsp;– New Footage of Neda's Death (Graphic)&amp;nbsp;– Third Angle |url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b1d_1276271267 |accessdate=17 June 2010 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first video, the cameraman approaches a group of people huddled together in front of a parked car at the side of the street. As he moves closer, she can be seen collapsing to the pavement with a large bloodstain at her feet. Two men, Hamid Panahi and Arash Hejazi, are seen trying to revive her. As seconds pass, her eyes roll to one side and she appears to lose consciousness. Blood begins to pour from her nose and mouth, and screams are heard.&lt;ref name="video1"/&gt; The man next to her can apparently be heard speaking in the first video, saying her name: &lt;blockquote&gt;Neda, don't be afraid. Neda, don't be afraid. [obscured by others yelling] Neda, stay with me. Neda stay with me!&lt;ref name="video1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second video, the cameraman approaches her and the two men; the camera passes over them and centers on her face; her stare is blank and she is bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth. Loud screaming can be heard.&lt;ref name="video2"/&gt;

Agha-Soltan's death was "probably the most widely witnessed death in human history," according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neda Agha Soltan |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1945379_1944701_1944705,00.html |last=Mahr |first=Krista |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos were awarded the [[George Polk Award]] for Videography in 2009.&lt;ref name="guardian-george-polk-award"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous video of Neda Aghan-Soltan's death wins Polk award |last=Bunz |first=Mercedes |publisher=[[The Guardian]]: PDA The Digital Content Blog |date=16 February 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/feb/16/george-polk-awards/ |accessdate=13 June 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged killer==
The man accused by opposition sources of killing Neda Agha-Soltan was identified as [[Abbas Kargar Javid]], a Basij government militiaman, after photographs of the Basiji's ID cards appeared on the internet, according to ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The face of Abbas Kargar Javid&amp;nbsp;– man accused of killing Neda Soltan |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6802669.ece |accessdate=21 May 2011 |newspaper=The Times |date=20 August 2009 |author=Martin Fletcher |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition critics and pro-government sources allege that Western intelligence agencies carried out the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Verlo, [http://notmytribe.com/2009/who-killed-neda-soltani-88127.html "Who Killed Neda Agha-Soltan?"] – Not My Tribe, 22 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mackey, [https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/iranian-tv-sees-conspiracy-in-neda-video/ "Iranian TV Sees Conspiracy in Neda Video"] – [[The New York Times]], 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golnaz Esfandiari, [https://www.rferl.org/a/Iran_State_TV_Suggests_Iconic_Protest_Death_Faked/1923414.html "Iran State TV Suggests Neda's Iconic Death Was 'Faked'"] – [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Grave of Neda.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Grave site immediately following burial]]
After being pronounced dead at Shari'ati hospital, Agha-Soltan was buried at the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] cemetery in southern Tehran; she was denied a proper funeral by government authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weissenstein |first=Michael |last2=Johnson |first2=Anna |title=Amateur video turns woman into icon of Iran unrest |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=22 June 2009 |date=22 June 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090622/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election_icon |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625133045/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090622/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election_icon |archivedate=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities had allegedly set aside empty graves&lt;!--already dug, or simply unoccupied plots?--&gt; for those killed during the protests.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and other news sources speculated that because of the widespread attention given to Āghā-Soltān's story by [[social media]] networks and mainstream news organizations, she is already being hailed as a [[martyr]].&lt;ref name="guardian-tait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_0623"/&gt; There was also speculation that the [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] cycle of [[mourning]] on the third (23 June), seventh (27 June), and 40th (30 July) day after a person's death may give the protests sustained momentum, in similar fashion to the [[Iranian Revolution]], where each commemoration of a demonstrator's death sparked renewed protests, resulting in more deaths, feeding a cycle that eventually resulted in the overthrowing of [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran's monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Robin |title=In Iran, one woman's death may have many consequences |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=23 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June, Iranian presidential candidates [[Mehdi Karroubi]] and [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], who were contesting the validity of the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], called upon Iranian citizens to commemorate Āghā-Soltān. Karroubi announced his appeal on Facebook, asking demonstrators to gather in the center of the Iranian capital at 4:00 pm local time. The chief of the Tehran Police announced that his department had no involvement in the fatal incident.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;Hendelman-Baavur, Liora (25 June 2009).

===Funeral===
About 70 mourners gathered outside Niloufar mosque in [[Abbas Abad (Tehran)|Abbas Abad]], where the Āghā-Soltān family attended services. A leaflet posted on the mosque's door read, "There is no commemoration here for Nedā Āghā-Soltān." Many in the crowd wore black. Some recited poems. After about ten minutes, paramilitary forces arrived on motorcycles and dispersed the attendees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/06/the-world-mourns-neda.html Political Punch]; ABC News, 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, it was reported that, to prevent Āghā-Soltān's family's home from becoming a place of pilgrimage, government authorities told the family to remove the black mourning banners from outside the home.&lt;ref name="times-booth2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian authorities scramble to negate Neda Soltan 'martyrdom' |work=[[The Times]] |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |first=Jenny |last=Booth |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6561253.ece |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grave desecration====
[[File:Graveyard.jpg|thumb|Neda Agha-Soltan's gravesite in Beheshte-Zahra, 2011]]
On 16 November 2009, supporters of the Iranian regime desecrated her grave and removed her gravestone.&lt;ref name="Times Hejazi"/&gt; Later, on 31 December 2009, supporters of the Iranian government defaced the portrait on her grave by shooting at it multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6979914.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Neda Soltans grave defaced as Iran issues new internet restrictions |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIA conspiracy theory===
Iran's ambassador to [[Mexico]], Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri, suggested in an interview on 25 June 2009 that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] could have been involved in Āghā-Soltān's death. Ambassador Ghadiri questioned how the shooting was video taped so effectively, asserting that the incident occurred away from other demonstrations. He also stated that using a woman would be more effective in accomplishing the goals the CIA is purported to desire.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Andrew (25 June 2009). [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/06/neda-cia-cnn-killing.html Iran ambassador suggests CIA could have killed Neda Agha-Soltan]. Los Angeles Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Ghadiri said "the bullet that was found in her head was not a bullet that you could find in Iran." (he thought she was shot in head.) The account of Doctor Hejazi was that Āghā-Soltān was shot in the chest from the front, as there was no exit wound, and the video evidence showing a wound to the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Iran doctor tells of Neda's death |work=BBC |accessdate=2 July 2009 |date=25 June 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8119713.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hejāzi was the man seen in the video placing his hands on Āghā-Soltān's chest to staunch her bleeding (as described above under section [[#Circumstances of death|Circumstances of death]]). Wolf Blitzer was incredulous that Ghadiri would so boldly offer a [[conspiracy theory]] or obvious [[disinformation]] as an explanation:

{{blockquote|1=
BLITZER: ..You're a distinguished diplomat representing Iran. This is a very serious accusation that you're making, that the CIA was responsible for killing this beautiful, young woman.

GHADIRI (through interpreter): I'm not saying that the CIA had done this. There are different groups. Could be intelligence services, could be CIA, could be the terrorists. However, these are the people who do these things. You could ask Mr. Andreotti, who was an Italian diplomat, whether [[Operation Gladio|Gladiators]] were a secret group related to CIA or not...

Iran's police chief, brigadier general Āhmadi-Moghaddam told the press on 30 June 2009 that the Iranian police and [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Ministry of Intelligence]] filed an arrest warrant for [[Interpol]] to arrest Ārash Hejāzi, an eyewitness of Nedā's death, for poisoning the international atmosphere against the Iranian government and telling misinformation about Nedā's death by giving his account of the incident to foreign news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2009/07/090701_ka_ir88_hejazi_ahmadimoghadam.shtml|script-title=fa:فرمانده نیروی انتظامی: شاهد مرگ ندا تحت تعقیب وزارت اطلاعات و پلیس بین الملل است |language=Persian |publisher=[[BBC Persian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian government's claims of video fabrication==
[[Ezzatollah Zarghami]], the head of [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]], told the press on 4 July 2009 that the videos of Nedā's death were all made by [[BBC]] and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tabannews.net/totla.php?id=4642|script-title=fa:ضرغامی: در انتخابات ونزوئلا هم یک نفر مثل "ندا" را کشتند! |language=Persian |publisher=Taban News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.iranuk88.com/article.php?id=39219|script-title=fa:ادعاي عجيب ضرغامي: تصوير قتل ندا آقاسلطان ساختگي است |language=Persian |publisher=Iranian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ayandenews.com/fa/pages/?cid=9643|script-title=fa:ضرغامی:در ونزوئلا هم ندا کشتند تا بگویند رای چاوز هم ساختگی است |language=Persian |publisher=Ayande News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Iranian state television aired a report about Āghā-Soltān's death, portraying it as a western plot.  In the programme, it was argued that Āghā-Soltān simulated her death with accomplices, and that she was killed afterwards, having no knowledge of her partners' intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Shp7HE2YA_c|title=Nedas Death&amp;nbsp;– The other Side of the Coin,''Press TV''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government pressure for confession===

According to ''The Times'', quoted from Mākān and Āghā-Soltān's parents, officials tried to get them to confess that it was opposition protestors that had killed Nedā, and not government militiamen. They were given incentives such as declaring Nedā to be a martyr and giving the family a pension if they complied. Makan and Nedā's family refused the offer.&lt;ref name="Times Hejazi"/&gt; Panāhi was later forced by the government to change his story. The new version of events were retold by Panāhi on state television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/deathintehran/view/ A Death in Tehran], at PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusation of security forces===

In December 2009, her family accused the security forces of killing her, although even most western press accounts so far have stopped short of calling it a targeted political assassination. This was the strongest statement the family of Nedā Āghā-Soltān made since her death. This accusation followed the spread of an Iranian government-proposed theory blaming a "conspiracy of western governments" for the killing. Her father told the [[BBC]]'s Persian service by telephone from Iran: "I openly declare that no one, apart from the government, killed Nedā. Her killer can only be from the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8396052.stm |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Neda Agha Soltan's family accuse Iran of her killing |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

The Neda Agha-Soltan&lt;!-- College does not use accents on the letter in her name, see http://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/news/endowment-of-neda-agha-soltan-scholarship --&gt; Graduate Scholarship is a scholarship for post-graduate philosophy students at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], with preference given to students of Iranian citizenship or heritage.

'''Debbie Purdy''' (4 May 1963 – 23 December 2014)&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/debbie-purdy-campaigner-who-fought-tirelessly-for-clarification-of-assisted-suicide-laws-9950559.html |title= Debbie Purdy: Campaigner who fought tirelessly for clarification of assisted suicide laws |date= 30 December 2014 |accessdate= 30 December 2014 |first= Marcus |last= Williamson |work= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British music journalist&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/aug/02/debbie-purdy-assisted-suicide-omari-puente&lt;/ref&gt; and political activist from [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]],  with primary progressive [[multiple sclerosis]], notable for her challenge to the [[English law|law]] in [[England and Wales]] as relates to [[assisted suicide]].&lt;ref name="HouseLords"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/lawreports/joshuarozenberg/3098209/Popular-QC-appointed-to-House-of-Lords.html|title=Popular QC appointed to House of Lords|work=Telegraph | accessdate=2008-09-29 | location=London | first=Joshua | last=Rozenberg | date=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2009, it was announced that guidelines on assisted suicide law would be published by the UK Government. The guidelines for England and Wales "come after a legal battle won by Debbie Purdy", as "Law Lords accepted earlier this year that [Purdy] had a right to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he helped her to travel abroad to commit suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8265304.stm|title= New guidance on assisted suicide|work=BBC News | accessdate=2009-09-20 | date=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purdy's case==
Debbie Purdy and her counsel [[David Pannick]] QC argued that the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] ([[Ken Macdonald]] QC) was infringing on her human rights by failing to clarify how the [[Suicide Act 1961]] is enforced.&lt;ref name=HouseLords/&gt; The DPP counsel took the position that the law does not require the DPP to make any further clarification of the Act: they argue that the Act and further information contained in the [[Code for Crown Prosecutors]] provide sufficient information.

Purdy's particular concern was to discover if any actions her husband, [[Omar Puente]], took in assisting her suicide would lead to his prosecution.&lt;ref name=HouseLords/&gt; The penalty for those who "aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another" is a maximum of 14 years.&lt;ref name="DontJail"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/dont-jail-my-husband-if-he-helps-me-to-die-pleads-ms-sufferer-927090.html|title= Don't jail my husband if he helps me to die, pleads MS sufferer|work=The Independent | accessdate=2008-09-12 | location=London | date=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; No family member of the 92 Britons who have gone abroad for an assisted suicide has been prosecuted but some have been charged and have had to wait for months before hearing the charges have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/death-assistedsuicide|title= Dying for guidance|work=The Guardian | accessdate=2008-10-13 | location=London | first=Yvonne | last=Roberts | date=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdy said that if her husband would be exposed to prosecution for helping her travel to [[Switzerland]] to a [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]] clinic to die, she would make the journey sooner whilst she was able to travel unassisted.&lt;ref name="LaunchesCase"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/latest/2008/10/02/ms-sufferer-launches-assisted-suicide-case-115875-20766954/|title= MS sufferer launches assisted suicide case|work=Mirror| accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would save her husband from exposure to the law but would have forced Purdy to make her decision on dying before she felt it was absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name=LaunchesCase/&gt; 

The hearing began on 2 October 2008 and was complete soon after. The venue was the [[High Court of Justice]]. It proceeded before [[Lord Justice]]  [[Scott Baker (judge)|Scott Baker]] and Mr [[Justice Aikens]]. In court the DPP said that Purdy could not be given any reassurance that her husband would not be prosecuted as the law was clear that assisting suicide is an offence.

On 10 December 2008 [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]] broadcast a programme on which a man with [[motor neurone disease]] was shown committing suicide with assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;BBC Newsnight: TX 10 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been the UK case of a Mr James who went to Switzerland with the aid of his parents after being paralysed whilst playing [[rugby (sport)|rugby]] and the Department of Public Prosecutions determined that to prosecute the parents would be against the public interest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; These two events led to the issue of assisted suicide making the first story on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]''. Purdy appeared to debate the issue and denied that it is society that makes disabled people wish to kill themselves and reasserted her belief that it is right to be able to seek assistance when one is physically incapable of committing suicide oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Purdy met her husband [[Omar Puente]] in Singapore when he was playing with a band,&lt;ref name=DontJail/&gt; and they married in 1998.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after she found her feet felt heavy when out dancing. She later used a wheelchair for mobility and both her sight and hearing began to deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/3089249/Right-to-die-campaigner-Debbie-Purdy-vows-to-take-fight-to-House-of-Lords.html|title=Right-to-die campaigner Debbie Purdy vows to take fight to House of Lords MS sufferer launches assisted suicide case|work=Telegraph| accessdate=2008-10-02 | location=London | first1=David | last1=Barrett | date=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4836537.ece|title=The way we live|work=TimesOnline| accessdate=2008-10-02 | location=London | first=Margarette | last=Driscoll | date=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdy entered the [[Marie Curie Hospice]] in [[Bradford]] in June 2013 and in December 2013 she began to intermittently refuse food. She described the length of time it was taking to die as "agonising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Debbie Purdy: Right-to-die campaigner dies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-25741005 |website=BBC |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdy died on 23 December 2014, aged 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-30626698 |title= Debbie Purdy: Right-to-die campaigner's battle |date= 29 December 2014 |accessdate= 29 December 2014 |work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dennis Hof''' (October 14, 1946 – October 16, 2018) was an [[United States|American]] [[brothel]] owner, entrepreneur, restaurateur, politician and star of the [[HBO]] series [[Cathouse: The Series|''Cathouse'']]. He was best known as the owner of seven [[Prostitution in Nevada|legal brothels]] in [[Nevada]]. Several of his brothels are in [[Moundhouse, Nevada]], a few minutes outside [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. His best-known brothel is the [[Moonlite BunnyRanch]]. Hof wrote an autobiography, ''The Art Of The Pimp''. He was posthumously elected to the [[Nevada Assembly]] less than one month after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Price |first1=Michelle L. |title=A Dead Nevada Brothel Owner Won His Election Tuesday Night |url=http://time.com/5447734/dead-nevada-brothel-owner-won-election/ |accessdate=2018-11-09 |work=Time |date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hof owned gas stations, first in Arizona and later in Nevada, before going into the brothel business.&lt;ref name="fortin"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fortin |first1=Jacey |title=Dennis Hof, the Pimp Who Won a Nevada State Primary, Dies at 72 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/dennis-hof-dead-brothel-nevada.html |accessdate=2018-10-20 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moonlite Bunny Ranch===
{{main page|Moonlite BunnyRanch}}

Hof purchased and remodeled The Moonlite BunnyRanch in 1992, which had been founded in 1955; he then purchased a second brothel, Kitty's, and renamed it The Love Ranch North. Hof purchased two additional brothels from longtime [[Nye County]] brothel proprietor Joe Richards: the Cherry Patch in Crystal, Nevada, renamed the Love Ranch Vegas, and the Cherry Patch II in [[Amargosa Valley, Nevada]], renamed the Alien Cathouse. On September 8, 2018, it was announced that the Alien Cathouse had been sold to business owner Raman Sharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nevadabrothels.co/alien-cathouse-has-a-new-owner/ |title=Alien Cathouse Has A New Owner {{!}} Nevada Brothels |date=September 9, 2018 |work=Nevada Brothels |access-date=September 13, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to other Nevada brothel owners, who prefer to keep a low profile,{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} and despite Nevada laws banning brothel advertising,&lt;ref&gt;"Unlawful advertising of prostitution", [http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-201.html#NRS201Sec430 NRS 201.430 and 201.440]&lt;/ref&gt; Hof maintained a high profile to create publicity for his brothels{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=6815445&amp;page=1|title=Rough Recession Tests Brothel Boundaries|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=October 14, 2015|date=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gregarious man, Hof was the president of the [[Nevada Brothel Owners' Association]], and its lobbyist; the Bunny Ranch is the closest brothel to the state capital, [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]].

Hof operated a website;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunnyranch.com/main.php|title=Official Bunny Ranch Homepage – Bunny Ranch Girls Pics and Videos –  BunnyRanch in Las Vegas|work=bunnyranch.com|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "working girls" are encouraged to cultivate online relationships with both potential and past clients. He often appeared on talk shows, including Oprah Winfrey, The Today Show, The View, Fox News, Howard Stern, Lex and Terry, and many others. Hof employed [[porn stars|adult film stars]], including [[Sunset Thomas]] with whom he also had a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2013/jun/17/suit-against-sunset-thomas-offers-new-wrinkle-olde/ |title=Suit against Sunset Thomas offers new wrinkle in the oldest profession |author=John Katsilometes |work=LasVegasSun.com |accessdate=October 14, 2015 |date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave free offers to soldiers returning from duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nevada brothel offers free sex to returning troops |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/06/03/offbeat.brothel.reut/ |accessdate=October 14, 2015 |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, due to [[Late 2000s recession|the recession]], State Senator [[Bob Coffin]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) proposed legalizing prostitution statewide for tax purposes. Hof was prominently featured in a number of media reports saying he would expand into [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] given the opportunity, and was looking at some closed casinos as property.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, the [[Nevada]] lawmakers chose not to consider the proposal of statewide legal prostitution during that legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29181044/ MSNBC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215202936/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29181044/ |date=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Series====
Hof and the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel were featured in the HBO series ''[[Cathouse: The Series|Cathouse]]'', which ran from 2002 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0359056|title=Cathouse (2002)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two documentary series followed: ''[[Cathouse: The Series]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0472944|title=Cathouse: The Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiered in 2005, and ''[[Cathouse 2: Back in the Saddle]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0395496|title=Cathouse: Back in the Saddle}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 2007. Hof also was the producer of the Showtime series ''Working Girls in Bed''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Both featured a look at the inner workings of a legal house of prostitution as well as the life of a number of the working girls, borrowing some techniques from [[reality television]], such as camera-only interviews and staged spontaneity.

===Filmography===
Hof appears as himself in an "underground" mall shop called "Pro-Life Sex" in the 2014 indie film ''Alongside Night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1667061|title=Alongside Night}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Hof was in the [[Hughes Brothers]] documentary ''[[American Pimp]]'' where notably he was the only caucasian the brothers interviewed. At one point in the documentary he very nearly accurately predicted his own death, ''going out getting the best piece of pussy''.&lt;ref&gt;''American Pimp'' IMDb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
Hof released a book, ''The Art of the Pimp'', in March 2015. The memoir includes personal accounts from women who worked for him, in which they detail sexual abuse at his hands. It also includes a psychological profile of Hof from psychotherapist Dr. Sheenah Hankin. Dr. Hankin found him to be a narcissist with no empathy, and states of his relationships with his employees, "Like any pimp, he exploits them. This is sadistic behavior, and it is both unrecognized and denied."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/08/the-bizarre-memoir-of-americas-most-famous-legal-brothel/ |title=The bizarre memoir of America's most famous pimp |work=The New York Post |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
In 1999, Lyon County sheriff's deputy Brian Putzer filed a police report accusing Hof of death threats.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/former-prostitutes-allege-unwelcome-sexual-contact-from-brothel-owner-dennis-hof |title=Former prostitutes allege unwelcome sexual contact from brothel owner Dennis Hof |work=The Nevada Independent |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deputy Putzer, the threats were spurred when Putzer did a routine walk-through check of one of Hof's brothels and discovered documents showing that Hof was setting up sexual encounters in counties where prostitution is illegal. Putzer states that his superiors "didn't want to challenge Hof" as the county is poorly funded and Hof's brothels were a major contributor to the local economy.

In 2016, a woman who had formerly worked for Hof, Jennifer O'Kane, publicly accused Hof of nonconsensual sexual contact, rape, sexual harassment, and having sex with his workers without a condom.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; O'Kane stated that Hof regularly gets away with the sexual abuse of his employees due to their status as sex workers, and that she had reported the rape to the D.A.'s office in 2011, but nothing had been pursued. The accusations were similar to statements made in Hof's own memoir by former Hof employees Krissy Summers and Cami Parker, who noted abusive behavior and coerced sexual encounters in the brothel.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A detective interviewed O'Kane regarding the accusations but charges were not pursued as there were no other direct witnesses and Hof was running for political office at the time. Deputy District Attorney Katrina Samuels again declined to prosecute the case in 2018, stating that the statute of limitations had passed.

In December 2017, another former employee, Diana Grandmaison, reported a non-consensual sexual encounter with Hof to the same detective who had investigated the O'Kane case.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Grandmaison stated that Hof regularly initiated such encounters with the young girls who worked for him and detailed other forms of work abuse. No further action was taken.

==Politics==
Hof endorsed [[Ron Paul]] in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21973236/ns/politics-decision_08/t/ron-paul-endorsed-nevada-brothel-owner/|title=Ron Paul endorsed by Nevada brothel owner|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=October 14, 2015|date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/03/moonlite-bunnyranch-endorses-ron-paul_n_1181575.html|title=The Moonlite BunnyRanch Endorses Ron Paul For President|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=October 14, 2015|date=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/elections/nevada-brothel-owner-says-he-might-run-us-senate|title=Nevada brothel owner says he might run for U.S. Senate|author=BEN BOTKIN LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/09/the-libertarian-party-is-supporting-a-brothel-owner-and-yes-it-supports-legal-prostitution/|title=The Libertarian Party is backing a brothel owner. And yes, it supports legal prostitution.|author=Amber Phillips|date=July 9, 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, he became a "Trump Republican".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dennishof.com/hof-bolts-libertarians-joins-trumps-republicans/|title=Hof Bolts Libertarians, Joins Trump's Republicans|author=Richard Hunter|date=December 7, 2016|work=Press Release|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 and 2018, he ran for a seat in the Nevada state legislature, the former as a Libertarian and the latter as a Republican; he lost the first race to [[James Oscarson]] but beat him in the GOP primary in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/finance/news/legal-pimp-defeats-nevada-lawmaker-070355548.html|title=Nevada pimp wins GOP primary, rejoices with Hollywood madam|website=www.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He prevailed in the primary after Nye County officials attempted to remove Hof's campaign signs. However, in an emergency motion before the Federal District of Nevada, Hof prevailed in a First Amendment claim against the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/federal-judge-orders-nye-county-to-return-hofs-political-sign/|title=Federal judge orders Nye County to return Hof's political sign|date=June 12, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was represented in that matter by First Amendment attorney, [[Marc Randazza]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. After winning the primary Hof styled himself as the "Trump from Pahrump."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/24/politics/dennis-hof-nevada-brothel-owner-trump/index.html|title=CNN: 'I'm riding the Trump wave. He's Christopher Columbus,' says Nevada pimp running for office|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Hof was running for the [[Nevada Assembly]]'s 36th District.&lt;ref name="fortin"/&gt; Hof, whose name remained on the ballot (with polling places posting public signage stating that Hof was deceased), posthumously won election to the seat over his Democratic opponent, Lesia Romanov, by a 68.3 to 31.7 percent margin; under the laws of the state of Nevada, the seat will be declared vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2018/11/07/dead-brothel-owner-dennis-hof-wins-nevada-election/|title=Voters choose dead pimp over Democratic opponent|first=Joe|last=Tacopino|work=The New York Post|date=November 7, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; County commissioners from Lincoln, Nye and Clark counties will conduct a weighted vote to determine Hof's replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/dennis-hof-deceased-brothel-owner-wins-nevada-assembly-race-1521112/|title=Dennis Hof, deceased brothel owner, wins Nevada Assembly race|date=November 7, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In ''Cathouse: The Musical'', Hof revealed that he only dated prostitutes. "I don't date civilians [non-working girls]." The documentary series showed several of his relationships with employees, such as adult film star [[Sunset Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1171227/ Cathouse: The Musical]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heidi Fleiss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a33930/Dennis-hof-book-interview/|title=Dennis Hof Interview - Dennis Hof on 'The Art of the Pimp'|author=Kenny Herzog|work=Esquire|accessdate=October 14, 2015|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Hof disclosed a lack of interest in monogamy and detailed how every one of his relationships ended due to his own infidelity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Hof was a close friend of Fox News personality [[Tucker Carlson]]. He once stated that he communicated with Carlson daily to give him ideas for his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/dennis-hof-tucker-carlson-w521499/|title=A Wild Conversation with the 'Pimp' Who Won a Nevada Primary|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 27, 2018|date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hof died in his sleep at his [[Dennis Hof's Love Ranch|Love Ranch South]] in Crystal, Nevada, on October 16, 2018, following a party for his 72nd birthday that had been attended by [[Joe Arpaio]], Heidi Fleiss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/dennis-hof-dies-72-spent-final-hours-ron-jeremy-heidi-fleiss-recognizable-names-002852978.html|title=Dennis Hof dies at 72: He spent his final hours with Ron Jeremy, Heidi Fleiss, and other recognizable names|website=www.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grover Norquist]] and [[Ron Jeremy]], the last of whom found Hof unresponsive.&lt;ref name=deathreport&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Brian |last2=Damon |first2=Anjeanette |last3=Spillman |first3=Benjamin |last4=DeHaven |first4=James |title=Dennis Hof, Nevada's bombastic legal pimp and Assembly candidate, has died |url=https://eu.rgj.com/story/news/2018/10/16/dennis-hof-pimp-and-legislative-candidate-nevada-dead/1661304002/ |publisher=Reno Gazette Journal |accessdate=October 16, 2018 |date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police did not suspect foul play at the time of his death, and no one who was with him the night before noticed any signs of ill-health.&lt;ref name=deathreport/&gt; Hof's legislature campaign manager Chuck Muth said that Hof was "having the time of his life" that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nypost.com/2018/10/16/gop-candidate-brothel-owner-dennis-hof-found-dead/amp/|title=Brothel owner-turned-politician Dennis Hof found dead at Love Ranch|date=October 16, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duchess Frederica of Württemberg''' ({{lang-de|Friederike Elisabeth Amalie Auguste von Württemberg}}; 27 July 1765 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1785) was a daughter of [[Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]] and [[Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt]].

==Family==
Frederica was born on 27 July 1765 in [[Treptow an der Rega]], [[Farther Pomerania]] (now [[Trzebiatów]], [[Poland]]) as the seventh child and second daughter of [[Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]] and his wife [[Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt]].&lt;ref name=lundy&gt;{{Cite web

Among her siblings were [[Frederick of Württemberg|King Frederick of Württemberg]], [[Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg|Sophia Dorothea, Empress of Russia]], and [[Duchess Elisabeth of Württemberg|Elisabeth, Archduchess of Austria]].

Frederica's paternal grandparents were [[Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg]] and [[Maria Augusta of Thurn and Taxis]].

Her maternal grandparents were [[Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt]] and [[Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia]], sister of [[Frederick the Great]].

==Marriage and issue==
On 6 June 1781, Frederica married [[Peter I, Grand Duke of Oldenburg|Prince Peter Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp]].&lt;ref name=lundy/&gt; The marriage was meant to strengthen relations between Russia and Württemberg (Frederica's sister was married to [[Paul I of Russia]], a member of the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp]]). They had two sons: [[Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg|Augustus]] (born in 1783) and [[Duke George of Oldenburg|George]] (born in 1784).

==Death==
At the age of twenty, Frederica died from childbirth in [[Vienna]] on 24 November 1785.&lt;ref name=lundy/&gt; Her widowed husband Peter never remarried. He would succeed his cousin [[William, Duke of Oldenburg|William]] as [[Grand Duke of Oldenburg]] in 1823, many years after Frederica's death.

'''FAM63B''' is a [[protein]] which in humans is encoded by the [[gene]] FAM63B. This gene is highly expressed in humans. The FAM63B gene is also highly conserved throughout evolutionary history. The discovered function of FAM63B is an interaction with the kinesin-1 light chain and the transportation of [[Vaccinia|vaccinia virus]] from the nucleus to the cell periphery.

== Gene ==

=== Locus ===
FAM63B is located at 15q21.3-q22.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC Genome Browser|url=https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&amp;lastVirtModeType=default&amp;lastVirtModeExtraState=&amp;virtModeType=default&amp;virtMode=0&amp;nonVirtPosition=&amp;position=chr15%3A58770007-58856406&amp;hgsid=491653739_Mbxka4ZJG2vt43tYvakMCyt1i2AF}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning 90,707 base pairs on [[chromosome 15]].&lt;ref name="nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?LinkName=nuccore_gene&amp;from_uid=1003088783|title=FAM63B family with sequence similarity 63 member B [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FAM63B locus.jpg|FAM63B locus]]

=== Alternative Names ===
The full name of FAM63B is family with sequence similarity 63, member B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=FAM63B&amp;keywords=FAM63B|website=GeneCards|title=Aliases for FAM63B Gene}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAM63B is also listed by its alias, KIAA1164, in some publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=FAM63B&amp;keywords=FAM63B&lt;/ref&gt;

== mRNA ==

=== Isoforms ===
The FAM63B gene encodes a primary transcript that can be alternatively spliced into 9 protein variants. FAM63B variant a is the most common isoform found in humans.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"/&gt;

=== Structure ===
[[File:FAM63B protein structure.jpg|thumb|right|Structure of FAM63B protein showing the domain of unknown function, bipartite tryptophan binding motif, hydrophobic stretchm, and KDEL signal.]]

==== Primary Structure ====
FAM63B is a member of the [[Pfam]] super family, and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF544) that is homologous within the protein family.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"/&gt; FAM63B protein variant an also contains a [[wikt:bipartite|bipartite]] tryptophan binding motif from W476 to W533.&lt;ref&gt;Dodding, M. P., Mitter, R., Humphries, A. C., &amp; Way, M. (2011). A [[Kinesin|kinesin-1]] binding motif in [[vaccinia]] virus that is widespread throughout the human genome. The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; Variant a of the protein also contains a hydrophobic stretch of alanine from 567 to 574 and a mixed charge sequence from residue 598 to 617.&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt; FAM63B protein may contain a signal sequence specifying return to the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) from residue 607 to 621 in variant a.

==== Secondary Structure ====
The secondary structure of FAM63B is a combination of coils, some [[α-helices]], and few [[β-sheets]].&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/phyre2_output/af64ab84316a975b/summary.html|title=Phyre 2 Results for Undefined|work=ic.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phyre 2 program predicts α-helices in 23% of the protein, β-strands in 9% of the protein, and the remaining 59% of the protein as disordered.&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"/&gt; The disordered regions coincide with the coiled regions predicted by other programs, and this results in the long stretch of coiled protein beginning at the N-terminus. According to the SOUSI program, there is a 16-amino acid-long span from residues 265 to 280 of FAM63B that could be a transmembrane sequence.&lt;ref name="expasy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expasy.org/proteomics/post-translational_modification|title=ExPASy: SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal - Categories|work=expasy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, transmembrane sequences generally need to be at least 20 amino acids long in order to be stable in the membrane, so a transmembrane sequence is unlikely. Therefore, FAM63B is not fixed in the membrane of any organelle and is free to move through the cell and between organelles.

==== Tertiary Structure ====
Not much is known about the tertiary structure of FAM63B. A predicted folding is shown.

=== Subcellular Location ===
FAM63B has predicted NES ([[nuclear export signals]]) at Val274 and Leu277.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/webface2.fcgi?jobid=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0&amp;wait=20|title=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0 expired|work=dtu.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a NLS ([[nuclear localization signal]]) is predicted for FAM63B at RKRK at residue 599.&lt;ref name="expasy.org" /&gt; In agreement, Reinhardt’s method for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination predicts FAM63B to be located in the nucleus with a reliability of 76.7%. The presence of both NLS and NES signals and [[O-GlcNAc]] post-translational modification of FAM63B supports the protein's location in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and the discovered protein function as a shuttle for vaccinia virus between the nucleus and the cell periphery.

== Expression ==

=== Expression Level ===
FAM63B has moderately-high to high expression and is constitutively expressed. FAM63B is likely [[ubiquitously]] expressed in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?UGID=2060133&amp;TAXID=9606&amp;SEARCH=FAM63B|title=Family with sequence similarity 63, member B (FAM63B)|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential Expression ===
Expression of FAM63B is high in the embryonic stem cells and differentiated tissues but low or off in [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] and other [[Progenitor cell|progenitor]] cells, such as the [[multipotent]] [[mesenchymal stem cells]]. It is likely that FAM63B is expressed during [[pluripotency]] and [[unipotency]] but is not important for differentiation, as is occurring in embryoid bodies, mesenchymal stem cells, and other progenitor cells.

=== Regulation of Expression ===

==== Transcriptional Regulation ====
The promoter of FAM63B is GXP_5885, located on the positive strand of chromosome 15 from (58770692, 58771462) and is 711 base pairs long.&lt;ref name="genomatix.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin//eldorado/eldorado.pl?s=40f88fb88bb64f3f83263645b98dcf85;SHOW_ANNOTATION=FAM63B;ELDORADO_VERSION=E30R1410|title=Genomatix: Annotation &amp; Analysis|work=genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interacting Proteins ==
FAM63B is shown to interact with one protein, [[KLC1|KLC-1]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dodding, M. P., Mitter, R., Humphries, A. C., &amp; Way, M. (2011). A kinesin-1 binding motif in vaccinia virus that is widespread throughout the human genome. The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; KLC-1, kinesin light chain 1, is a protein which recruits kinesin-1 via its cargo binding light chain and contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This motif is present in a vaccinia virus integral membrane protein, A36, that is required for transport of the virus from the perinuclear space to the cell periphery.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the absence of A36, proteins with a bipartite tryptophan binding motif can interact with the kinesin light chain, recruit KLC-1, and promote virus transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Function ==
The discovered function of FAM63B protein is a transporter of vaccinia virus in the human genome. FAM63B contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif between W476 and W533.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The motif also contains a [[Glutamine|Q residue]] at the +2 position, which was found to be a frequent occurrence in proteins that bind KLC-1 or KLC-2.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; FAM63B is among proteins studied that can rescue virus transport to the cell periphery when expressed in A36-deficient cells, successfully replacing the cytoplasmic domain A36 of vaccinia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Clinical Significance ==

=== Pathology ===
The specific pathology of FAM63B is unknown.

=== Disease Association ===
FAM63B is part of four networks regulated by miRNA, three of which are linked to neuronal differentiation and [[dopaminergic]] gene expression.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Aberg, K. A., et al. (2014). Methylome-Wide Association Study of Schizophrenia. JAMA Psychiatry, 71(3), 255–264. http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.3730&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that FAM63B could be used as a biomarker for the detection and treatment of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Furthermore, aberrant methylation of FAM63B may play a role in the development of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; FAM63B has also been ranked 13 of 25 on a list of associated genes relevant to [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Li, C., et al. (2008). A systematic method for mapping multiple loci: An application to construct a genetic network for rheumatoid arthritis. Gene, 408(1–2), 104–111. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2007.10.028&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology ==

=== Paralogs ===
FAM63B has one paralog, [[FAM63A]], which is a gene of unknown function. FAM63A gene encodes a protein that is 469 amino acids long and 76% similar to FAM63B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55793|title=FAM63A family with sequence similarity 63 member A [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orthologs ===
FAM63B has been found in all multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes, including plants but excluding protists and fungi. The gene has also been found in archaea but not bacteria.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distant Homologs ===
The most distant homolog of FAM63B is found in ''Thermoplasmatales archaeon'', an [[archaea]] that diverged from the human gene 4.25 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timetree.org/search/pairwise/9606/215775?|title=TimeTree|work=timetree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous Domains ===
FAM63B is a member of the Pfam super family, and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF544) homologous within the protein family.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt; This region of the protein is highly conserved through FAM63B homologs, as is the bipartite tryptophan binding motif of FAM63B and the C-terminus signal sequence.

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic tree below shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B.
[[File:FAM63B phylogenic tree.jpg|thumb|none|The phylogenetic tree from TimeTree shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B among humans (Has), prairie voles (Moc), polar bears (Uma), Western clawed frogs (Xtr), and Western Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae, Lch). The fish is the most diverged, followed by the amphibian, and the mammals, especially humans, are the least diverged. This is as expected in accordance with the evolutionary history of organisms on Earth, and FAM63B shows no great exception to the rule.]]

== Biography ==
Dyson was born in [[Measham]], near [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], Leicestershire, the son of the Rev Watson Dyson, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Frances Dodwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to [[Yorkshire]] in his youth. There he attended [[Heath Grammar School]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], and subsequently won scholarships to [[Bradford Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mathematics and astronomy, being placed [[Second Wrangler]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DY886FW|name=Dyson, Frank Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_mnras"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1894 he was given the post of Senior Assistant at Greenwich Observatory and worked on the [[Astrographic Catalogue]], which was published in 1905.&lt;ref name = "obit_obs"/&gt;
He was appointed [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] from 1905 to 1910, and Astronomer Royal (and [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]]) from 1910 to 1933. In 1928, he introduced in the Observatory a new [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|free-pendulum clock]], the most accurate clock available at that time and organised the regular wireless transmission from the GPO wireless station at Rugby of [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. He also, in 1924, introduced the distribution of the "[[Greenwich Time Signal|six pips]]" via the BBC. He was for several years President of the [[British Horological Institute]] and was awarded their Gold Medal in 1928.&lt;ref name = "obit_obs"/&gt;

Dyson was noted for his study of [[solar eclipse]]s and was an authority on the [[spectrum]] of the [[corona]] and on the chromosphere.  He is credited with organising expeditions to observe the 1919 solar eclipse at [[Brazil]] and [[Principe]], which he somewhat optimistically began preparing for prior to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]. Dyson presented his observations of the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]] to a joint meeting of the [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Astronomical Society]] on 6 November 1919. The observations confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory of the effect of gravity on light which until that time had been received with some scepticism by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Joint Eclipse Meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society | journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory: A Monthly Review of Astronomy]] | volume=42 | issue=545 | pages=389–398|date=November 1919|bibcode=1919Obs....42..389. | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1919Obs....42..389. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson died on board a ship while travelling from Australia to England in 1939 and was buried at sea.&lt;ref name = "obit_obs"/&gt;

==Family==

In 1894 he married Caroline Bisset Best (d.1937), the daughter of Palemon Best, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.

==Frank Dyson and Freeman Dyson==
Although Frank Dyson and theoretical physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] are not known to be related, their fathers Rev Watson Dyson and [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]] both hailed from [[West Yorkshire]] where the surname originates and is most densely clustered.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1309867/Why-the-Dysons-keep-faith-in-their-genes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman Dyson credits Sir Frank with sparking his interest in astronomy: because they shared the same last name, Sir Frank's achievements were discussed by Freeman Dyson's family when he was a young boy.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Inspired, Dyson's first attempt at writing was a 1931 piece of [[juvenilia]] entitled "Sir Phillip Robert's Erolunar Collision" – Sir Philip being a thinly disguised version of Sir Frank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">A '''genetic operator''' is an [[Operator (programming)|operator]] used in [[genetic algorithms]] to guide the algorithm towards a solution to a given problem. There are three main types of operators ([[Mutation (genetic algorithm) |mutation]], [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]]), which must work in conjunction with one another in order for the algorithm to be successful. Genetic operators are used to create and maintain [[genetic diversity]] (mutation operator), combine existing solutions (also known as [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosome]]s) into new solutions (crossover) and select between solutions (selection).&lt;ref name=ga-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Genetic Algorithms|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol1/hmw/article1.html|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book discussing the use of [[genetic programming]] for the optimization of complex problems, computer scientist [[John Koza]] has also identified an 'inversion' or 'permutation' operator; however, the effectiveness of this operator has never been conclusively demonstrated and this operator is rarely discussed.&lt;ref name=koza&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koza|first1=John R.|title=Genetic programming : on the programming of computers by means of natural selection|date=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-11170-5|edition=6. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gp-operators&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic programming operators|url=ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/hollick/public_html/genetic/node7.html#SECTION00023000000000000000|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation (or mutation-like) operators are said to be ''[[Unary operation|unary]]'' operators, as they only operate on one chromosome at a time. In contrast, crossover operators are said to be ''[[Binary operation|binary]]'' operators, as they operate on two chromosomes at a time, combining two existing chromosomes into one new chromosome.&lt;ref name=ga-operators&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic operators|url=http://kal-el.ugr.es/GAGS/gags-tutorial/node3.html|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operators==
Genetic variation is a necessity for the process of [[evolution]]. Genetic operators used in genetic algorithms are analogous to those in the natural world: [[survival of the fittest]], or [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]]; reproduction ([[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]], also called recombination); and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]].

===Selection===
{{main|Selection (genetic algorithm)}}
Selection operators give preference to better solutions (chromosomes), allowing them to pass on their 'genes' to the next generation of the algorithm. The best solutions are determined using some form of [[objective function]] (also known as a '[[fitness function]]' in genetic algorithms), before being passed to the crossover operator. Different methods for choosing the best solutions exist, for example, [[fitness proportionate selection]] and [[tournament selection]]; different methods may choose different solutions as being 'best'. The selection operator may also simply pass the best solutions from the current generation directly to the next generation without being mutated; this is known as ''elitism'' or ''elitist selection''.&lt;ref name=ga-intro /&gt;&lt;ref name=ga-intro2&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Genetic Algorithm|url=http://www.rennard.org/alife/english/gavintrgb.html|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossover===
{{main|Crossover (genetic algorithm)}}
Crossover is the process of taking more than one parent solutions (chromosomes) and producing a child solution from them. By recombining portions of good solutions, the genetic algorithm is more likely to create a better solution.&lt;ref name=ga-intro /&gt; As with selection, there are a number of different methods for combining the parent solutions, including the ''edge recombination operator'' (ERO) and the 'cut and splice crossover' and 'uniform crossover' methods. The crossover method is often chosen to closely match the chromosome's representation of the solution; this may become particularly important when variables are grouped together as [[Genetic algorithm#The building block hypothesis|building blocks]], which might be disrupted by a non-respectful crossover operator. Similarly, crossover methods may be particularly suited to certain problems; the ERO is generally considered a good option for solving the [[travelling salesman problem]].&lt;ref name=ero&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=George Mason University, June, 4 - 7, 1989. Ed.: J. David|title=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Genetic Algorithms|date=1991|publisher=Kaufmann|location=San Mateo, Calif.|isbn=1558600663|edition=2. [Dr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutation===
{{main|Mutation (genetic algorithm)}}
The mutation operator encourages genetic diversity amongst solutions and attempts to prevent the genetic algorithm converging to a [[local minimum]] by stopping the solutions becoming too close to one another. In mutating the current pool of solutions, a given solution may change entirely from the previous solution. By mutating the solutions, a genetic algorithm can reach an improved solution solely through the mutation operator.&lt;ref name=ga-intro /&gt; Again, different methods of mutation may be used; these range from a simple ''bit mutation'' (flipping random bits in a binary string chromosome with some low probability) to more complex mutation methods, which may replace genes in the solution with random values chosen from the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] or the [[Gaussian distribution]]. As with the crossover operator, the mutation method is usually chosen to match the representation of the solution within the chromosome.

==Combining operators==
While each operator acts to improve the solutions produced by the genetic algorithm working individually, the operators must work in conjunction with each other for the algorithm to be successful in finding a good solution. Using the selection operator on its own will tend to fill the solution population with copies of the best solution from the population. If the selection and crossover operators are used without the mutation operator, the algorithm will tend to converge to a [[local minimum]], that is, a good but sub-optimal solution to the problem. Using the mutation operator on its own leads to a [[random walk]] through the search space. Only by using all three operators together can the genetic algorithm become a noise-tolerant hill-climbing algorithm, yielding good solutions to the problem.&lt;ref name=ga-intro /&gt;

==Early life==
Gurbaksh Singh, the only son and heir of Jai Singh Kanhaiya, was born in 1759 to his wife Desan Kaur, who was the widow of Jhanda Singh.He was born into a [[Sandhu]] [[Jat]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Sir Lepel Henry|title=The Panjab Chiefs: Historical and Biographical Notices of the Principal Families in the Lahore and Rawalpindi Divisions of the Panjab|date=1890|page=158|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tRFPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=gurbaksh+singh+1759&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=desan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jai Singh, was the founder and leader of the Kanhaiya Misl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLeod|first1=LOUIS E.

She was married in 1796 to [[Ranjit Singh]], the successor of [[Maha Singh]], the leader of the [[Sukerchakia Misl]], who were a rival of the Kanhaiya Misl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Calcutta Review|date=1 January 1944|page=74|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lOFMAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mehtab+kaur+gurbaksh&amp;dq=mehtab+kaur+gurbaksh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp14_JpNPTAhXGkZQKHYOvBUgQ6AEIMTAD|accessdate=3 May 2017|publisher=University of Calcutta.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The Kanhaiyas, who had replaced the [[Bhangi Misl|Bhangis]] as the most powerful ''[[misl]]'', disputed Ranjit Singh's father's right to plunder [[Jammu]], and in one of the many skirmishes between the two ''misl''s, Gurbaksh Singh was killed in battle against Maha singh in February 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|first1=Joseph Davey Cunningham ; edited by H.L.O.|title=A history of the Sikhs from the origin of the nation to the battles of the Sutlej|date=1994|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788120609501|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of any heir, Gurbaksh Singh's widowed wife, Sada Kaur (an intelligent and ambitious woman) became the chief of the Kanhaiya Misl after her father-in-law's death in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Kaushik|title=Military Manpower, Armies and Warfare in South Asia|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317321286|page=82|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played an important role in Ranjit Singh's rise to power in [[Punjab]] and used to lend support of the Kanhaiya ''misl'' to Ranjit Singh till 1821, when she developed differences with him and as a consequence lost her territory to him.&lt;ref name="Singha" /&gt;

'''Hyejong of Goryeo''' (912 – 23 October 945) (r. 943–945) was the second [[Korean nobility|King]] of [[Goryeo]]. He was preceded by [[Taejo of Goryeo|King Taejo]] and succeeded by [[Jeongjong, 3rd Monarch of Goryeo]].
{{Goryeo monarchs}}
==Early life==
Hyejong was born to [[Taejo of Goryeo|King Taejo]] and his second wife, [[Janghwa]] of the "Oh" clan.  She was the daughter of the Magistrate of [[Naju]], [[Oh Daryeon]].  Taejo met and married her while serving in Naju as a general of [[Taebong]] under [[Gung Ye]].

In 921, Hyejong was proclaimed Crown Prince and Royal Successor with support from General [[Bak Sul-Hui]]. Almost immediately after being named Crown Prince, Hyejong followed his father Taejo into battle against [[Later Baekje]] and played a major role in numerous victories. In 943, Hyejong rose to the throne upon his father's death.

==Reign==
Hyejong's reign was marked with conspiracy and power struggles among Taejo's sons. The first of these conspiracies was led by Princes [[Jeongjong I of Goryeo|Wang Yo]] and [[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Wang So]], sons of Taejo and his third consort, Queen Sinmyeongsunseong of the [[Chungju]] Yu clan, which possessed considerable political influence. Upon realizing the conspiracy by the two princes, [[Wang Gyu]] warned Hyejong of the conspiracy, but plotted to put his grandson on the throne when Hyejong did nothing to stop the conspiracy of the two princes.

==Death==
Hyejong died in 945, during the second year of his reign from disease.  He was succeeded by his third brother [[Jeongjong, 3rd Monarch of Goryeo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4671">'''Interstitial revolution''' is a theoretical means of societal transformation through progressively and strategically enlarging spaces of social empowerment. Interstitial revolution (or transformation) builds on the concept of [[prefigurative politics]] which has a long history in anti-capitalist thinking, going back nearly two hundred years in the anarchist tradition. [[Prefigurativism]] is neatly summed up by the early twentieth century Constitution of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] which declared: "By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preamble to the IWW Constitution {{!}} Industrial Workers of the World|url = http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml|website = www.iww.org|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, prominent analytical Marxists (including [[John Holloway (sociologist)|John Holloway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/521.abstract|title = Interstitial Revolution: On the explosive fusion of negativity and hope|date = |access-date = |website = Capital and Class|publisher = Sage Journals|last = Dinerstein|first = Ana Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erik Olin Wright]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/ERU_files/ERU-CHAPTER-10-final.pdf|title = Interstitial Transformation|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Wright|first = Eric Olin}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have called attention to the lack of strategy for greater systemic change within [[prefigurativism]] and have attempted to construct models of societal transformation utilizing interstitial devices as an alternative to the traditional Marxist theory of revolution.

== Theory ==
Central to the concept of interstitial revolution is the perspective of seeing the state as a complex multitude of institutions organized by a dominant power structure, but not so integrated that it controls all activities within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Envisioning Real Utopias|last = Wright|first = Erik Olin|publisher = Verso|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-84467-618-7|location = London, New York|pages = 323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstitial theorists suggest that within this system, radically democratic collectives (such as [[Worker-owned cooperative|Worker owned cooperatives]]) have the opportunity to gain a foothold in the "cracks" of the capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moving Against-and-Beyond or Interstitial Revolution|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265227668_Moving_Against-and-Beyond_or_Interstitial_Revolution|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[egalitarian]] institutions, working on their own or in tandem, can then use their social and economic power along with traditional forms of struggle to outmaneuver and erode limits to their growth imposed by capitalist institutions, thereby creating more space for collective economic and political power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Envisioning Real Utopias|last = Wright|first = Erik Olin|publisher = Verso|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-84467-618-7|location = London, New York|pages = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstitial theorists state that over time, enough progressive struggles and victories could potentially lead to the overcoming of the capitalist state.

[[Erik Olin Wright]] points out that there may be boundaries to the growth of an interstitial movement in which the most adept strategies of collective economic and social pressure are not enough to overcome the power of capitalist hegemony. He suggests in this case it may be necessary to resort to a more traditional form of "ruptural" revolution. However, he stresses that a substantial network of democratically run organizations is a key foundation to any revolution that wishes to yield a result of deepening democracy and creating the conditions for human flourishing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanism ==
Wright suggests that the first stage of an interstitial revolution could be starting a cooperative bank. A cooperative bank would function as a normal bank with the exception that it would give loans primarily to organized workers who wished to collectively purchase their employer's company in order to start a worker owned cooperative. Wright says this could be both an answer to a coming small business succession crisis and an opportunity for democratically run companies to gain a foothold in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = LookLeft Forum: Erik Olin Wright|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4v1i8Y4tbc|date = 2013-03-04|accessdate = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Douglas "Jim" Morrison''' (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) was an American singer, songwriter and poet, best remembered as the lead vocalist of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[The Doors]]. Due to his poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in [[rock music]] history. Since his death, his fame has endured as one of [[popular culture]]'s most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap and youth counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-morrison-p13722/biography|title=Jim Morrison – Biography, Albums, Streaming Links – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison co-founded the Doors during the summer of 1965 in [[Venice, California]]. The band spent two years in obscurity until shooting to prominence with their #1 single in the United States, "[[Light My Fire]]", taken from their [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Morrison recorded a total of six studio albums with the Doors, all of which sold well and received critical acclaim. Though the Doors recorded two more albums after Morrison died, his death severely affected the band's fortunes, and they split up in 1973. In 1993, Jim Morrison, as a member of the Doors, was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Morrison was also well known for improvising [[spoken word]] poetry passages while the band played live. Morrison was ranked #47 on [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']]{{'}}s list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/jim-morrison-20101202|title=100 Greatest Singers: Jim Morrison|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 22 on [[Classic Rock (magazine)|''Classic Rock'' magazine's]] "50 Greatest Singers in Rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|journal=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] Magazine|title=50 Greatest Singers in Rock|date=May 2009|issue=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Manzarek]], who co-founded the Doors with him, said Morrison "embodied [[hippie]] [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] rebellion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Knopper, Steve|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-09/entertainment/ct-ott-1111-ray-manzarek-20111110_1_jim-morrison-doors-robby-krieger|title=Ray Manzarek's Doors |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
James Douglas Morrison was born on December 8, 1943 in [[Melbourne, Florida]], the son of Clara Virginia (née Clarke) and [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[George Stephen Morrison]], [[United States Navy|USN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivbc.free.fr/AA-Histoire-9999-99-96.htm|title=SOFT PARADE 6571|publisher=Ivbc.free.fr|accessdate=April 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213850/http://ivbc.free.fr/AA-Histoire-9999-99-96.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who commanded United States naval forces during the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]], which provided the pretext for the [[Vietnam War#Escalation and ground war|US involvement in the Vietnam War]] in 1965. Morrison had a younger sister, Anne Robin, who was born in 1947 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; and a younger brother, Andrew Lee Morrison, who was born in 1948 in [[Los Altos, California]].

His ancestors were Scottish, Irish, and English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm Dead Famous: Jim Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827015646/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930%3A2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm |date=August 27, 2008 }} ''[[The Biography Channel]]''. Retrieved December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2003-09-01-riding-the-storm-again-without-morrison|title=Riding the storm again – without Morrison &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Mail &amp; Guardian|publisher=Mg.co.za|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, when he was four years old, Morrison allegedly witnessed a car accident in the desert, during which a truck overturned and some Native Americans were lying injured at the side of the road. He referred to this incident in the Doors' song "[[Peace Frog]]" on their 1970 album ''[[Morrison Hotel]],'' as well as in the spoken word performances "Dawn's Highway" and "Ghost Song" on the posthumous 1978 album ''[[An American Prayer]]''. Morrison believed this incident to be the most formative event of his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend|publisher=[[Ebury Press]]|year=2004|page=8|quote=It was the first time I discovered death, he recounted many years later, as the tape rolled in a darkened West Hollywood Recording studio.|isbn=978-0-09-190042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made repeated references to it in the imagery in his songs, poems, and interviews.

His family does not recall this incident happening in the way he told it. According to the Morrison biography ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', Morrison's family did drive past a car accident on an [[Indian reservation]] when he was a child, and he was very upset by it. The book ''The Doors'', written by the surviving members of the Doors, explains how different Morrison's account of the incident was from that of his father. This book quotes his father as saying, "We went by several Indians. It did make an impression on him [the young James]. He always thought about that crying Indian." This is contrasted sharply with Morrison's tale of "Indians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death." In the same book, his sister is quoted as saying, "He enjoyed telling that story and exaggerating it. He said he saw a dead Indian by the side of the road, and I don't even know if that's true."&lt;ref name=gaar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaar|first1=Gillian G.|title=The Doors: The Illustrated History|date=2015|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=Minneapolis (US)|isbn=978-1-62788-705-2|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzLCCAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]], Morrison spent part of his childhood in San Diego, completed third grade at Fairfax County Elementary School [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], and attended Charles H. Flato Elementary School in [[Kingsville, Texas]], while his father was stationed at [[Naval Air Station Kingsville|NAS Kingsville]] in 1952. He continued at St. John's Methodist School in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and then Longfellow School Sixth Grade Graduation Program from San Diego, California.&lt;ref name=wrank&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wranker|first1=Ralph|title=The King's Highway Jim Morrison in Kingsville, Texas|url=http://www.taliesyn.com/ralph/morrison.htm|website=www.taliesyn.com|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Morrison attended [[Alameda High School]] in [[Alameda, California]], for his freshman and first semester of his sophomore year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudge|first1=Mary|title=Jack London's Neighborhood: A Pleasure Walker's and Reader's Guide to History and Inspiration in Alameda|date=2013|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4568-0934-8|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcIFAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} He finished high school in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], graduating from George Washington High School (now [[George Washington Middle School (Virginia)|George Washington Middle School]]) in June 1961.&lt;ref name=wrank /&gt; [[Cass Elliot]] also attended the school several years earlier.

===Literary influences===
[[File:JimMorrisonMugShot1963.jpg|thumb|Morrison was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida, after pulling a prank while drunk at a football game]]
A voracious reader from an early age, Morrison was particularly inspired by the writings of several philosophers and poets. He was influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose views on aesthetics, morality, and the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] duality would appear in his conversation, poetry and songs. Some of his formative influences were [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and the works of the French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], whose style would later influence the form of Morrison's short prose poems. He was also influenced by [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Louis Ferdinand Celine]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Molière]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], along with most of the French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers.&lt;ref name=gaar /&gt;&lt;ref name=More&gt;{{cite web|last1=More|first1=Thomas|title=The Verse of the Lizard King: An Analysis Of Jim Morrison's Work|url=http://www.returnofkings.com/21445/the-verse-of-the-lizard-king-an-analysis-of-jim-morrisons-work|website=Return of Kings|accessdate=December 1, 2015|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His senior year English teacher said, "Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher (who was going to the [[Library of Congress]]) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed. I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century [[demonology]]. I'd never heard of them, but they existed, and I'm convinced from the paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would've been the only source."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|author2=Jerry and Daniel Sugerman|title=[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]|publisher=[[Warner Books]]|year=1980|isbn=978-0-446-69733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison went to live with his paternal grandparents in [[Clearwater, Florida]], where he attended classes at [[St. Petersburg College]] (then known as a junior college). In 1962, he transferred to [[Florida State University]] (FSU) in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], where he appeared in a school recruitment film.&lt;ref name="fsufilm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University: Toward a Greater University|url=http://floridamemory.com/items/show/232390|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending Florida State University, Morrison was arrested for a prank following a home [[American football|football]] game.&lt;ref name="FSU arrest"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanez|first1=Luisa|title=Flashback: The Doors' Jim Morrison stage antics, arrest, trial|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1937284.html|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=July 11, 2017|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College experience in Los Angeles, 1964–65===
In January 1964, Morrison moved to Los Angeles to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Shortly thereafter on August 2, 1964, Morrison's father, [[George Stephen Morrison]], commanded a carrier division of the United States fleet during the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]], which resulted in the United States' rapid escalation of the [[Vietnam War]]. At UCLA, Morrison enrolled in [[Jack Hirschman]]'s class on [[Antonin Artaud]] in the Comparative Literature program within the UCLA English Department. Artaud's brand of [[surrealist]] theatre had a profound impact on Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lauerman|first1=Connie|title=Artaud: The 'Madman' Who Changed Theater|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-02-15/features/9602150259_1_antonin-artaud-paris-goodman-theatre|accessdate=December 1, 2015|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=February 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA's film school within the Theater Arts department of the College of Fine Arts in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-alumni-actors/|title=NOTABLE ALUMNI ACTORS|publisher=UCLA School of Theater, Film and television|accessdate=September 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006111604/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-alumni-actors/|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the graduation ceremony, he went to [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], and the university mailed his diploma to his mother at Coronado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Stephen|title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend|date=2004|publisher=Gotham Books|location=New York|isbn=1-59240-064-7|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrAXVNmSR4QC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several short films while attending UCLA. ''First Love'', the first of these films, made with Morrison's classmate and roommate Max Schwartz, was released to the public when it appeared in a documentary about the film ''Obscura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353825/|title=Obscura (2002)|author=|date=November 25, 2002|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these years, while living in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]], he befriended writers at the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'', for which he advocated until his death in 1971. He conducted a lengthy and in-depth interview with Bob Chorush and Andy Kent, both working for the Free Press at the time (approximately December 6–8, 1970), and was planning on visiting the headquarters of the busy newspaper shortly before leaving for Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Melissa Ursula Dawn Goldsmith|title=Criticism lighting his fire: perspectives on Jim Morrison from the Los Angeles Free Press, Down Beat, and the Miami Herald|url=http://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3871&amp;context=gradschool_theses|publisher=lsu.edu|accessdate=11 July 2017|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Doors==
{{Main|The Doors}}
[[File:Doors electra publicity photo.JPG|thumb|left|Promotional photo of the Doors in late 1966]]
In the summer of 1965, after graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Venice Beach. Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his old UCLA cinematography friend, Dennis Jacobs, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, the most notable being "[[Moonlight Drive]]" and "[[Hello, I Love You]]." According to Manzarek, he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months. Morrison and fellow UCLA student [[Ray Manzarek]] were the first two members of the Doors, forming the group during that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/24/185827139/remembering-ray-manzarek-keyboardist-for-the-doors|title=Remembering Ray Manzarek, Keyboardist For The Doors|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had met months earlier as cinematography students. The story claims that Manzarek was lying on the beach at Venice one day, where he accidentally encountered Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Brent|title=NPR interview with Ray Manzarek|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/24/185827139/remembering-ray-manzarek-keyboardist-for-the-doors|publisher=NPR – Publicly accessed|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was impressed with Morrison's poetic lyrics, claiming that they were "rock group" material. Subsequently, guitarist [[Robby Krieger]] and drummer [[John Densmore]] joined. Krieger auditioned at Densmore's recommendation and was then added to the lineup. All three musicians shared a common interest in the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s meditation practices at the time, attending scheduled classes, but Morrison was not involved in these series of classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bollinger|first1=Michael J.|title=Jim Morrison's Search for God|date=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-1101-7|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPppwQ8qj2IC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doors took their name from the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (a reference to the unlocking of doors of perception through [[psychedelic drug]] use). Huxley's own title was a quotation from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', in which Blake wrote: "If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite." Although Morrison was known as the lyricist of the group, Krieger also made significant lyrical contributions, writing or co-writing some of the group's biggest hits, including "[[Light My Fire]]," "[[Love Me Two Times]]," "[[Love Her Madly]]" and "[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Getlen|first=Larry|title=Opportunity Knocked So The Doors Kicked It Down|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20030616a1.asp|accessdate=August 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Morrison, who did not write most songs using an instrument, would come up with vocal melodies for his own lyrics, with the other band members contributing chords and rhythm. Morrison did not play an instrument live (except for [[maracas]] and [[tambourine]] for most shows, and [[harmonica]] on a few occasions) or in the studio (excluding maracas, tambourine, [[handclaps]], and [[whistling]]). However, he did play the [[grand piano]] on "[[The Lost Paris Tapes|Orange County Suite]]" and a [[Moog synthesizer]] on "[[Strange Days (The Doors song)|Strange Days]]."

In June 1966, Morrison and the Doors were the opening act at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in the last week of the residency of [[Van Morrison]]'s band [[Them (band)|Them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: Twin Morrisons of Different Mothers|publisher=waiting-forthe-sun.net|accessdate=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van's influence on Jim's developing stage performance was later noted by Brian Hinton in his book ''Celtic Crossroads: The Art of Van Morrison'': "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=Brian|title=Celtic Crossroads: The Art of Van Morrison|date=2000|publisher=Sanctuary|location=London|isbn=978-1-86074-505-8|page=67|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the final night, the two Morrisons and their two bands jammed together on "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|author=Corry Arnold|date=January 23, 2006|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|publisher=chickenonaunicyle.com|accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VanM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|title=Glossary entry for The Doors|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310195120/http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|archivedate=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doorshistory.com/doors1966.html|title=Doors 1966 – June 1966|publisher=doorshistory.com|accessdate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1966, Morrison and the Doors produced a promotional film for "[[Break on Through (To the Other Side)]]", which was their first single release. The film featured the four members of the group playing the song on a darkened set with alternating views and close-ups of the performers while Morrison lip-synched the lyrics. Morrison and the Doors continued to make short music films, including "[[The Unknown Soldier (song)|The Unknown Soldier]]", "[[Moonlight Drive]]" and "[[People Are Strange]]".

The Doors achieved national recognition after signing with [[Elektra Records]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Leopold|first=Todd|date=April 20, 2007|title=Confessions of a Record Label Owner|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/19/holzman.elektra/index.html|accessdate=November 18, 2010|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single "[[Light My Fire]]" spent three weeks at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in July/August 1967.

[[Ed Sullivan]] requested two songs from the Doors for the show, "[[People Are Strange]]" and "Light My Fire". Sullivan's censors insisted that the Doors change the lyrics of the song "Light My Fire" from "Girl we couldn't get much higher" to "Girl we couldn't get much better" for the television viewers; this was reportedly due to what was perceived as a reference to drugs in the original lyrics. After giving assurances of compliance to the producer in the dressing room, the band agreed and proceeded to sing the song with the original lyrics. Sullivan was not happy and he refused to shake hands with Morrison or any other band member after their performance. Sullivan had a show producer tell the band that they would never appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again. Morrison reportedly said to the producer, in a defiant tone, "Hey man. We just ''did'' the Sullivan Show!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors|title=The Doors|publisher=The Ed Sullivan Show (SOFA Entertainment)|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the release of their second album, ''[[Strange Days (album)|Strange Days]]'', the Doors had become one of the most popular rock bands in the United States. Their blend of [[blues]] and dark [[psychedelic rock]] included a number of original songs and distinctive cover versions, such as their rendition of "[[Alabama Song]]", from [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s opera, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''. The band also performed a number of extended concept works, including the songs "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]", "[[When the Music's Over]]" and "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]". In 1966, photographer [[Joel Brodsky]] took a series of [[Photography#Black-and-white|black-and-white]] photos of Morrison, in a photo shoot known as "The Young Lion" photo session. These photographs are considered among the most iconic images of Jim Morrison and are frequently used as covers for compilation albums, books, and other memorabilia of the Doors and Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2007/04/02/joel-brodsky.html|title=Album photographer Joel Brodsky dies – Arts &amp; Entertainment|date=April 2, 2007|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/node/630550|title=Photographer Brodsky dies|date=April 1, 2007|publisher=Sun Journal|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1967 at a concert in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], he was arrested on stage, an incident that further added to his mystique and emphasized his rebellious image.

In 1968, the Doors released their third studio album, ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]''. The band performed on July 5 at the Hollywood Bowl; this performance became famous with the DVD: ''Live at the Hollywood Bowl''. It's also this year that the band played, for the first time, in Europe. Their fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', was released in 1969. It was the first album where the individual band members were given credit on the inner sleeve for the songs they had written. Previously, each song on their albums had been credited simply to "The Doors". On September 6 and 7, 1968, the Doors played four performances at the Roundhouse, London, England, with [[Jefferson Airplane]] which was filmed by Granada for a television documentary ''[[The Doors are Open]]'' directed by John Sheppard. Around this time, Morrison—who had long been a heavy drinker—started showing up for recording sessions visibly inebriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinquemani|first1=Sal|title=The Doors: A Retro Perspective|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/the-doors-a-retro-perspective|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=July 11, 2017|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also frequently late for live performances.

By early 1969, the formerly svelte singer had gained weight, grown a beard and mustache, and begun dressing more casually — abandoning the leather pants and concho belts for slacks, jeans, and T-shirts. During a concert of March 1, 1969, at the [[Dinner Key Auditorium]] in Miami, Morrison attempted to spark a riot in the audience, in part by screaming "You wanna see my cock?" and other obscenities. He failed, but six [[arrest warrant|warrants]] for his arrest were issued by the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Dade County Police department]] three days later for [[indecent exposure]], among other things.&lt;ref name="Burks_12/10/2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burks|first=John|title=Jim Morrison's Indecency Arrest: Rolling Stone's Original Coverage|website=Rolling Stone|date=December 10, 2010|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jim-morrison-s-indecency-arrest-rolling-stone-s-original-coverage-20101210|accessdate=February 19, 2017|quote=[He] became the object of six arrest warrants, including one for a felony charge of "Lewd and lascivious behavior in public by exposing his private parts and by simulating masturbation and oral copulation."&lt;br /&gt; The five other warrants are for misdemeanor charges on two counts of indecent exposure, two counts of open public profanity and one of public drunkenness."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many of the Doors' scheduled concerts were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doors: Biography: Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thedoors/biography|accessdate=August 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906104133/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thedoors/biography|archivedate=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-doors-not-satisfied-with-morrison-pardon-want-formal-apology-20101223|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|title=The Doors Not Satisfied With Morrison Pardon, Want Formal Apology|date=December 23, 2010|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and profanity by a six-person jury in Miami after a trial that had 16 days of testimony.&lt;ref&gt;"Rock King Jim Morrison Found Guilty of Exposure", ''Palm Beach (FL) Post'', September 21, 1970, pD-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Morrison, who attended the October 30 sentencing "in a wool jacket adorned with Indian designs", silently listened as he was sentenced to six months in prison and had to pay a $500 fine. Morrison remained free on a $50,000 bond.&lt;ref name=DBMJ_10_30_1970 /&gt; At the sentencing, Judge Murray Goodman told Morrison that he was a "person graced with a talent" admired by many of his peers; Morrison remained free on $50,000 bond while the conviction was appealed.&lt;ref name="DBMJ_10_30_1970"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock Singer Sentenced|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7E4fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ndEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=630,7400652&amp;dq=jim+morrison|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=October 30, 1970|page=15|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His death eight months later made the appeal a moot point.

In 2007 [[List of Governors of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Charlie Crist]] suggested the possibility of a posthumous [[pardon]] for Morrison, which was announced as successful on December 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fla. officials pardon the late Jim Morrison|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/09/1965259/fla-officials-to-consider-pardon.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=December 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027212513/http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/09/1965259/fla-officials-to-consider-pardon.html |archive-date=October 27, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida pardons Doors' Jim Morrison|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B85UA20101209|agency=Reuters|accessdate=December 9, 2010|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[John Densmore]] denied Morrison ever exposed himself on stage that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B20CF20101203|title=Drummer says Jim Morrison never exposed himself|publisher=Reuters|date=December 2, 2010|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', the Doors released ''[[Morrison Hotel]]''. After a lengthy break, the group reconvened in October 1970 to record what would become their final album with Morrison, titled ''[[L.A. Woman]]''. Shortly after the recording sessions for the album began, producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]] — who had overseen all of their previous recordings — left the project. Engineer [[Bruce Botnick]] took over as producer.

==Poetry and film==
{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}

Morrison began writing in earnest during his adolescence. At UCLA he studied the related fields of theater, film, and [[cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Actors – UCLA School of Theater, Film and television|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/|accessdate=December 3, 2008|postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713125858/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/ |archivedate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He self-published two separate volumes of his poetry in 1969, titled ''The Lords / Notes on Vision'' and ''The New Creatures''. ''The Lords'' consists primarily of brief descriptions of places, people, events and Morrison's thoughts on cinema. ''The New Creatures'' verses are more poetic in structure, feel and appearance. These two books were later combined into a single volume titled ''The Lords and The New Creatures.'' These were the only writings published during Morrison's lifetime. Morrison befriended [[Beat generation|Beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]], who wrote the [[afterword]] for [[Danny Sugerman]]'s biography of Morrison, ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]''. McClure and Morrison reportedly collaborated on a number of unmade film projects, including a film version of McClure's infamous play ''The Beard'', in which Morrison would have played [[Billy the Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClure|first=Michael|title=Michael McClure Recalls an Old Friend|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Personal/mcclure_recalls.html|accessdate=September 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a further two volumes of Morrison's poetry were published. The contents of the books were selected and arranged by Morrison's friend, photographer Frank Lisciandro, and girlfriend [[Pamela Courson]]'s parents, who owned the rights to his poetry.

''The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison'' Volume I is titled ''Wilderness'', and, upon its release in 1988, became an instant ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller. Volume II, ''[[American Night|The American Night]]'', released in 1990, was also a success. Morrison recorded his own poetry in a professional sound studio on two separate occasions. The first was in March 1969 in Los Angeles and the second was on December 8, 1970. The latter recording session was attended by Morrison's personal friends and included a variety of sketch pieces. Some of the segments from the 1969 session were issued on the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''[[The Lost Paris Tapes]]'' and were later used as part of the Doors' ''[[An American Prayer]]'' album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Jim|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Prayer-Jim-Morrison-Doors/dp/B000002HJD|title=American Prayer: Jim Morrison &amp; The Doors: Music|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1978. The album reached #54 on the music charts. Some poetry recorded from the December 1970 session remains unreleased to this day and is in the possession of the Courson family. Morrison's best-known but seldom seen cinematic endeavor is ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral]]'', a project he started in 1969. Morrison financed the venture and formed his own production company in order to maintain complete control of the project. [[Paul Ferrara]], Frank Lisciandro, and Babe Hill assisted with the project. Morrison played the main character, a hitchhiker turned killer/car thief. Morrison asked his friend, composer/pianist Fred Myrow, to select the soundtrack for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Liner Notes for Diane Hildebrand's "Early Morning Blues and Greens|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/diane.html|accessdate=August 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as ''[[dressing down]]''. This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings. Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead (or claiming, as it has been widely misreported, that he was an only child).

This misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with the Doors' [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Admiral Morrison was not supportive of his son's career choice in music. One day, an acquaintance brought over a record thought to have Jim on the cover. The record was the Doors' self-titled debut. The young man played the record for Morrison's father and family. Upon hearing the record, Morrison's father wrote him a letter telling him "to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html|title=Love Them Two Times|accessdate=May 18, 2010|last=Soeder|first=John|date=May 20, 2007|work=Plain Dealer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613025902/http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the Florida Probation and Parole Commission District Office dated October 2, 1970, Morrison's father acknowledged the breakdown in family communications as the result of an argument over his assessment of his son's musical talents.

===Relationships===
Morrison was sought after by many as a photographer's model, confidant, romantic partner and sexual conquest. Throughout his life he had at least several serious, ongoing relationships, and many casual encounters. By many accounts, he could also be inconsistent with his partners,&lt;ref name=RiordanRel&gt;{{cite book | first =James | last =Riordan | authorlink = | author2 = Prochnicky, Jerry | year =1991 | month = | title =Break on through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | location =New York| isbn =0-688-11915-8 | url =| pages = 95, 381}}&lt;/ref&gt; displaying what some recall as "a dual personality".&lt;ref name=RiordanRel21&gt;{{cite book | first =James | last =Riordan | authorlink = | author2 = Prochnicky, Jerry | year =1991 | month = | title =Break on through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | location =New York| isbn =0-688-11915-8 | url =| page = 21 |quote = Even Morrison's on-again, off-again, relationship with Pamela Courson, his longtime girlfriend, was reflective of his dual personality.

A Jekyll and Hyde. When he was sober, he was Jekyll, the most erudite, balanced, friendly kind of guy ... He was Mr. America. When he would start to drink, he'd be okay at first, then, suddenly, he would turn into a maniac. Turn into Hyde."&lt;ref name=RiordanRel21/&gt;

Morrison spent the majority of his adult life in an open,&lt;ref name=RiordanRel21/&gt; and at times very charged and intense, relationship with [[Pamela Courson]]. They met while young, when both were attending college,&lt;ref name=bioT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jim-morrison-9415576#troubled-times-and-death|title=Troubled Times and Death|website=Biography.com|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she encouraged him to develop his poetry.

After Courson's death in 1974, and her parents petitioned the court for inheritance of Morrison's estate, the [[probate]] court in California decided that she and Morrison had once had what qualified as a [[common-law marriage]], despite neither having applied for such status, and the common-law marriage not being recognized in California.

One of Morrison's early significant relationships was with Mary Werbelow, whom he met on the beach in Florida, when they were teenagers in 1962. In a 2005 interview with the ''St. Petersburg Times'' she said Morrison spoke to her before a photo shoot for the Doors' fourth album and told her the first three albums were about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/25/Doors/Mary_and_Jim_to_the_e.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107032218/http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/25/Doors/Mary_and_Jim_to_the_e.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 7, 2005|title=Doors: Mary and Jim to the end|author=|date=|work=sptimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/jim-morrison/press/z-machine-starts-production-on-documentary-film-before-the-end-jim-morrison-comes-age|title=Z-machine Starts Production on Documentary Film, Before The End: Jim Morrison Comes Age|author=|date=|work=Contactmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://madameask.com/2014/10/06/interview-with-paul-ferrara-doors-photographer/|title=Interview with Paul Ferrara, Doors photographer|author=|date=|work=madameask.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810232101/https://madameask.com/2014/10/06/interview-with-paul-ferrara-doors-photographer/|archivedate=August 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weidman194"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rich Weidman|title=The Doors FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Kings of Acid Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjPcWkEPSR8C&amp;pg=PT194&amp;dq=jim+morrison+mary+werbelow|date=October 1, 2011|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-110-3|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Morrison had regular sexual and romantic encounters with fans (including "[[groupie]]s") such as [[Pamela Des Barres]],&lt;ref name="withtheband"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmyW7ns3ycgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jim+morrison++Pamela+des+barres#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20morrison%20%20Pamela%20des%20barres|title=I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie|author1=Pamela Des Barres|author2=Dave Navarro|website=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Women/des_barres.html|title=Lizard of Aaaahs: Pamela Des Barres Recalls Jim Morrison|website=Archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net|date=|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ongoing affairs with other musicians, writers and photographers involved in the music business. These included [[Nico]], the singer associated with [[the Velvet Underground]], a [[one-night stand]] with singer [[Grace Slick]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]], an on-again, off-again relationship with ''[[16 Magazine]]''{{-'}}s [[Gloria Stavers]], as well as an alleged alcohol-fueled encounter with [[Janis Joplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Women/nico.html|title=An Unholy Alliance – Jim Morrison and Nico|work=waiting-forthe-sun.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Crosby]] said many years later Morrison treated Joplin meanly at a party at the [[Calabasas, California]], home of [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] while Davidson was out of town.&lt;ref name="Crosby, David 2005 125"&gt;{{cite book|author=Crosby, David|author2=[[Carl Gottlieb]]|page=125|title=Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2005|isbn=0-306-81406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100590,00.html|title=People Weekly citation of 1988 book "Long Time gone" by David Crosby and Carl Gottlieb|publisher=People.com|date=November 28, 1988|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-02/local/me-2186_1_hard-rock|title=Los Angeles Times reference to Morrison/Joplin fight mentioned in #2 Barney's Beanery|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|date=March 2, 1992|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reportedly hit him over the head with a bottle of whiskey in retaliation during a fight in front of witnesses.&lt;ref name="Crosby, David 2005 125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E5Dc1io_hMC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=jim+morrison+janis+joplin+whiskey#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20morrison%20janis%20joplin%20whiskey|title=Scars of Sweet Paradise: The Life and Times of Janis Joplin|author=Alice Echols|page=179|website=Books.google.com|date=February 15, 2000|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First written about in ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', ''Break On Through'', and later in her own memoir, ''Strange Days - My Life with and without Jim Morrison'', Morrison participated in a [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic Pagan]] [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony with rock critic [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]].&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite book | first =Jerry | last =Hopkins | authorlink = | author2 = Sugerman, Danny | year =1980 | month = | title =No One Here Gets Out Alive | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher =Plexus | location = | isbn =0-85965-138-X | url =| page =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiordanH&gt;{{cite book | first =James | last =Riordan | authorlink = | author2 = Prochnicky, Jerry | year =1991 | month = | title =Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | location =New York| isbn =0-688-11915-8 | url =| pages =382–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Days1"&gt;{{cite book | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1992 | month = | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages = 169–180| publisher =[[Penguin Random House|Dutton/Penguin]] | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple signed a handwritten document, and were declared wed by a Celtic High Priestess and High Priest on Midsummer's Night in 1970, but none of the necessary paperwork for a legal marriage was filed with the state.&lt;ref name="Days1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Days1a"&gt;{{cite book | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1992 | month = | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages = photos plate 7| publisher =[[Penguin Random House|Dutton/Penguin]] | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had been friends, and then in a long distance relationship, since they met at a private interview for ''[[Jazz &amp; Pop]]'' magazine, in January 1969. The handfasting ceremony is described in ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'' as a "blending of souls on a karmic and cosmic plane." Morrison was also still seeing Pamela Courson when he was in Los Angeles, and later moved to Paris for the summer where Courson had acquired an apartment. In an interview in the book ''Rock Wives'', Kennealy says he turned "really cold" when she became pregnant, leading her to speculate that maybe he hadn't taken the wedding as seriously as he'd led her to believe.&lt;ref name=RiordanRel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balfour1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Balfour|title=Rock wives: the hard lives and good times of the wives, girlfriends, and groupies of rock and roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1NkKHV-R1MC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=probably+not+too+seriously|date=January 1987|publisher=Beech Tree Books p.149|isbn=978-0-688-06966-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-02/entertainment/ca-3273_1_rock-wives|title='Rock Wives': Happy Endings Amid The Dirt|date=February 2, 1986|author=ROBERT HILBURN|work=LA Times|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Days2&gt;{{cite book | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1992 | month = | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages = 188 | publisher =[[Penguin Random House|Dutton/Penguin]] | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 | url = }} The author notes the pregnancy was not her choice.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that his coldness and distance was during the trial in Miami, and that "he was scared to death.

Morrison seemed to be falling apart. He was back with Pam, he was severely alcoholic, and like many she feared he was dying.&lt;ref name=RiordanLet71/&gt;

At the time of Morrison's death, there were multiple paternity actions pending against him, although no claims were made against his estate by any of the putative paternity claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend|publisher=[[Ebury Press]]|year=2004|quote=At the time "Maggie M'Gill" was recorded, paternity suits against Jim Morrison were being defended by Max Fink's office.

The concluding [[stanza]]s of this poem convey disappointment for someone with whom he had had an intimate relationship and contain a further [[invocation]] of ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral#Billy|Billy]]''/the killer Hitchhiker, a common character in Morrison's body of work. "This is my poem for you, Great flowing funky flower'd beast, Great perfumed wreck of hell...Someone new in your knickers &amp; who would that be?

Other works relating to religion, [[mysticism]], ancient [[Mythology|myth]] and [[symbol]]ism were of lasting interest, particularly [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' also became a source of inspiration and is reflected in the title and lyrics of the song "Not to Touch the Earth."{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Morrison was particularly attracted to the myths and religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jim Morrison|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5221/is_2005/ai_n19141572/pg_2|accessdate=August 24, 2008|work=UXL Newsmakers|year=2005|postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613142621/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5221/is_2005/ai_n19141572/pg_2 |archivedate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was still at school, his family moved to [[New Mexico]] where he got to see some of the places and artifacts important to the [[American Southwest]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures. These interests appear to be the source of many references to creatures and places such as [[lizards]], snakes, [[deserts]] and "ancient lakes" that appear in his songs and poetry. His interpretation and imagination of the practices of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ceremonial people (which, based on his readings, he referred to by the anthropological term "[[shaman]]s") influenced his stage routine, notably in seeking trance states and vision through dancing to the point of exhaustion. In particular, Morrison's poem "The Ghost Song" was inspired by his readings about the Native American [[Ghost Dance]].

Morrison's vocal influences included [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], which is evident in his baritone [[Crooner|crooning]] style on several of the Doors' songs. In the 1981 documentary ''The Doors: A Tribute to Jim Morrison'', producer [[Paul Rothchild]] relates his first impression of Morrison as being a "Rock and Roll Bing Crosby". Sugerman states that Morrison, as a teenager, was such a fan of Presley that he demanded silence when Elvis was on the radio. He states that Sinatra was Morrison's favorite singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583|title=100 Greatest Singers: Jim Morrison|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207052622/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583|archivedate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to record producer [[David Anderle]], Morrison considered [[Brian Wilson]] "his favorite musician" and [[the Beach Boys]]' 1967 LP ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' "one of his favorite albums. ... he really got into it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Anderle |first1=David |last2=Williams |first2=Paul |authorlink1=David Anderle|authorlink2=Paul Williams (journalist)|title=Brian: Part Three |magazine=[[Crawdaddy!]] |date=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison was, and continues to be, one of the most popular and influential singer-songwriters and iconic frontmen in rock history.

[[Wallace Fowlie]], professor emeritus of [[French literature]] at [[Duke University]], wrote ''Rimbaud and Jim Morrison'', subtitled ''"The Rebel as Poet&amp;nbsp;– A Memoir"''. In this, he recounts his surprise at receiving a fan letter from Morrison who, in 1968, thanked him for his latest translation of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s verse into English. "I don't read French easily", he wrote, "...your book travels around with me." Fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives, philosophies, and poetry of Morrison and Rimbaud. The book ''The Doors'' by the remaining Doors quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisciandro as saying that too many people took a remark of Morrison's that he was interested in revolt, disorder, and chaos "to mean that he was an anarchist, a revolutionary, or, worse yet, a [[nihilism|nihilist]]. Hardly anyone noticed that Jim was paraphrasing Rimbaud and the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] poets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ben Fong-Torres|authorlink1=Ben Fong-Torres|title=The Doors|date=2006|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4013-0303-7|page=104|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Layne Staley]], the vocalist of [[Alice in Chains]], [[Eddie Vedder]], the vocalist of [[Pearl Jam]], [[Scott Weiland]], the vocalist of [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Velvet Revolver]], [[Julian Casablancas]] of [[the Strokes]], [[James LaBrie]] of [[Dream Theater]], as well as [[Scott Stapp]] of [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Ville Valo]] of [[H.I.M.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://kron.buzznet.com/user/journal/1082651/ville-valo-interview-transcribed/|title=Ville Valo Interview Transcribed on k-ron's Blog – Buzznet|publisher=Kron.buzznet.com|date=October 1, 2007|accessdate=April 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101104050/http://kron.buzznet.com/user/journal/1082651/ville-valo-interview-transcribed/|archivedate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all said that Morrison was their biggest influence and inspiration. [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Velvet Revolver]] have both covered "[[Roadhouse Blues]]" by the Doors. Weiland also filled in for Morrison to perform "[[Break on Through (To The Other Side)]]" with the rest of the Doors. Stapp filled in for Morrison for "[[Light My Fire]]," "[[Riders on the Storm]]" and "Roadhouse Blues" on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''; [[Travis Meeks]], of [[Days of the New]], also performed "The End." Creed performed their version of "Roadhouse Blues" with [[Robby Krieger]] for the [[Woodstock 1999|1999 Woodstock Festival]].

Morrison's recital of his poem "Bird of Prey" can be heard throughout the song "Sunset" by [[Fatboy Slim]]. Rock band [[Bon Jovi]] featured Morrison's grave in their "[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (Bon Jovi song)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]" video clip. The band [[Radiohead]] mentions Jim Morrison in their song "Anyone Can Play Guitar", stating "I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison". [[Alice Cooper]] in the liner notes of the album ''[[Killer (Alice Cooper album)|Killer]]'' stated that the song "Desperado" is about Jim Morrison. The leather trousers of U2's lead singer Bono's "[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]" persona for the ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' era and subsequent [[Zoo TV Tour]] is attributed to Jim Morrison. In 2012 electronic music producer [[Skrillex]] released "[[Breakn' a Sweat]]" which contained vocals from an interview with Jim Morrison.

Morrison was also referenced in the [[Lana Del Rey]] song "[[Gods &amp; Monsters (song)|Gods &amp; Monsters]]" in the line "living like Jim Morrison."

===In popular culture===
In June 2013, a fossil analysis discovered a large lizard in [[Myanmar]]. The extinct reptile was given the moniker ''[[Barbaturex morrisoni]]'' in honor of Morrison. "This is a king lizard, and he was the lizard king, so it just fit," said Jason Head, a [[paleontologist]] at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real-Life 'Lizard King' Named for Doors' Jim Morrison|url=https://news.yahoo.com/real-life-lizard-king-named-doors-jim-morrison-230359550.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jose  "Joeten" Camacho Tenorio''' (July 6, 1923 – November 5, 1993) was a Chamorro businessman who founded over 30 different companies during his lifetime, including [[Joeten Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|59}}

== History ==
Born to Juan Pangelinan Tenorio and Francisca Taimanao Camacho Tenorio, who both had died by the time Jose reached the age of twelve. Jose and his siblings were raised from that point by his oldest brother, who was 21 at the time.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tenorio |first1=Juan Cruz |title=Jose Camacho Tenorio "JOETEN": A Man for All Reasons |oclc=45371309 |date=1999 |location=Tamuning, Guam}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}

Joeten graduated from Japanese elementary school at the age of 13 and then attended a night school. Later, the [[University of Guam]] awarded Joeten with an honorary doctorate.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|27–31}}

In 1946 Joeten married Soledad Duenas Takai "Daidai". They would have six children.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|37}} In 1947, Jose started a beer and soft drinks business using $200 of personal savings.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Robert A. |authorlink1=Robert A. Underwood |title=Joeten Enterprises, Inc. |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r106:E15JY9-0013: |website=Congressional Record 106th Congress (1999-2000) |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=October 19, 2015 |date=July 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Joeten and his wife Soledad sold their house to convert a dentist office into a grocery store which would continue to expand and become the conglomerate [[Joeten Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

In the years 1950 and 1951, Joeten and his wife moved to Guam in response to a job offer from the [[Island Trading Group]]. During this time, Joeten gained more knowledge of operating a business enterprise and became an American citizen.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|58}}

In 1977 he ran for Governor of the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] but lost to [[Carlos S. Camacho]] by 129 votes.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|52}} During this time he also underwent open-heart surgery.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

Joeten died from internal bleeding while on a [[Continental Micronesia]] flight from Honolulu to Guam in November 1993. At this time he had 29 grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Joeten bio"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}}

'''Krishna Kumari'''  (1794 – 21 July 1810) was a Rajput princess of the [[Udaipur State]] in the [[Mewar]] region of India. A daughter of [[Bhim Singh of Mewar|Bhim Singh]] of Udaipur, she was [[engagement|engaged]] to [[Bhim Singh of Marwar|Bhim Singh]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] at a young age. After the premature death of the groom-to-be in 1803, she was sought by multiple suitors, including [[Man Singh of Marwar|Man Singh]] of Jodhpur and [[Jagat Singh of Amber|Jagat Singh]] of [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]].

The rivalry between her suitors ultimately escalated into a war involving the Rajput rulers of Udaipur, Jodhpur, and Jaipur; as well as [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]], [[Yashwant Rao Holkar]] of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Amir Khan (Nawab of Tonk)|Amir Khan]] [[Pindari]] of [[Tonk State|Tonk]]. In 1810, when Amir Khan Pindari attacked Udaipur on behalf of Man Singh, 16-year old Krishna agreed to be poisoned to death, to put an end to the war.

==Early life==

Krishna Kumari was one of the several daughters of [[Bhim Singh of Mewar|Bhim Singh]], the [[Rajput]] ruler of the [[Udaipur State|Udaipur]] princely state in the [[Mewar]] region.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=180}} In 1799, at the age of 5, she was engaged to [[Bhim Singh of Marwar|Bhim Singh]], the Rajput ruler of the [[Jodhpur State]] in the [[Marwar]] region.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=74}} However, the groom-to-be died prematurely in 1803.{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}}

== Conflict among suitors ==

After the death of Bhim Singh of Jodhpur, his cousin [[Man Singh of Marwar|Man Singh]] succeeded him on the throne. Man Singh revoked an [[appanage]] that his predecessor had granted to Kishan Singh, a relative of Krishna's father Bhim Singh. This annoyed Krishna's father, Bhim Singh of Udaipur.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=74}}

Bhim Singh [[arranged marriage|arranged]] Krishna's engagement with [[Jagat Singh of Amber|Jagat Singh]], the Rajput ruler of the [[Jaipur State]].{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}} Jagat Singh had become an adversary of Man Singh by supporting a rival claim to the throne of Jodhpur.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=180}} Man Singh argued that Krishna was engaged to the ruler of Jodhpur, and therefore, should be married to him instead of Jagat Singh.{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}} Krishna's father rejected Man Singh's demand, and sent representatives to Jaipur to finalize her engagement with Jagat Singh.{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}}

=== Sindhia's intervention ===

Man Singh then threatened to invade Mewar, and enlisted the support of [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]], the Maratha ruler of the [[Gwalior State]], by paying a [[tribute]]. With help of Sindhia's commander Sarjerao Ghatge, Man Singh threatened Amar Singh of [[Shahpura State|Shahpura]], a feudatory of Bhim Singh of Udaipur. At this time Bhim Singh's representatives were passing through Shahpura on their way to Jaipur, and Man Singh forced Amar Singh to send them back to Udaipur.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=75}}

Subsequently, Sindhia personally intervened in the dispute, hoping to play an active role in the Rajput politics. He advised Krishna's father Bhim Singh to give one of his daughters in marriage to Man Singh of Jodhpur and another to Jagat Singh of Jaipur. Sindhia also recommended that if the two suitors rejected this proposal, the dispute be resolved by involving the neighbouring rulers as arbitrators.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=180}} By this time, Jagat Singh's forces had reached Udaipur, which emboldened Bhim Singh into rejecting Sindhia's proposal. Sindhia then invaded the Udaipur kingdom, and forced Bhim Singh into signing a treaty at [[Nathdwara]] on 7 May 1806.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=76}}

At one point, Sindhia himself offered to marry Krishna, but the Rajputs disapproved of this proposal.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=76}} [[Baiza Bai]], one of Sindhia's wives, also opposed the proposal, arguing that the Rajputs would not agree to such a marriage without warfare.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=46}} Sindhia later withdrew his proposal to marry Krishna. [[Yashwant Rao Holkar]], the Maratha ruler of the [[Indore State]] and a rival of Sindhia, also decided to take advantage of this conflict to demand tributes from the Rajputs. This irked Krishna's father Bhim Singh, who refused to pay tribute to either of the Maratha rulers.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=180}} Sindhia retreated from the Udaipur kingdom, fearing hostility from the Rajputs as well as Holkar.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=76}}

=== Holkar's intervention ===

After Sindhia's retreat, Holkar offered to arbitrate the dispute. He advised that Krishna Kumari be married to someone other than Man Singh and Jagat Singh, but with the consent of these two rulers; in addition, Jagat Singh would marry a sister of Man Singh. However, Jagat Singh rejected this proposal, and insisted on marrying Krishna. Subsequently, he signed an agreement with Holkar, who promised not to object to his marriage to Krishna, and to support Jaipur against a possible attack from Sindhia.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=76}} Later, Jagat Singh also won Sindhia over to his side by promising him 1 million rupees. In addition, he enlisted the support of Surat Singh of [[Bikaner State]] and [[Amir Khan (Nawab of Tonk)|Amir Khan]] [[Pindari]] of [[Tonk State]].{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=180}} Man Singh tried to win over Holkar to his side, but Holkar decided to remain neutral.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=77}}

=== Outbreak of war ===

The dispute over Krishna was being closely monitored by the [[East India Company]]. The Company's Accountant General [[Henry St George Tucker]], in a March 1806 letter to [[Sir George Robinson, 1st Baronet|George Robinson]], had mentioned that the Rajput kings were about to "take up arms for the purpose of deciding their claims to the fair hand of the Princess". Tucker expressed the possibility of a conflict involving the Rajput states, as well as Sindhia and Holkar, which would "make a very desirable diversion" in the favour of the Company.{{sfn|Edward Thompson|2017|p=211}}

As predicted by Tucker, the conflict between Krishna's suitors ultimately escalated into a full-fledged war. Jagat Singh marched against Jodhpur, and declared Bhim Singh's [[posthumous child|posthumous son]] Dhonkal Singh as the rightful ruler of Jodhpur. He also convinced Holkar to remain neutral by offering a payment of 1 million rupees.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=77}} Although Jagat Singh suffered some initial reverses, his army ultimately besieged Jodhpur in May 1807.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|pp=77-78}} Man Singh escaped to [[Jalore]], and unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance with the East India Company. Soon after this, Jagat Singh's army was forced to leave Jodhpur because of scarcity of water, and because of defections by several [[Rathore]]s, Sarjerao Ghatge and Amir Khan.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=78}}

In January 1808, Jagat Singh's pro-Holkar minister Ratan Lal tried to secure Holkar's support by offering a tribute of 1 million rupees, but Holkar declined the offer.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=79}} Under his influence, Jagat Singh refused to pay a tribute to Sindhia, which prompted Sindhia to invade Jaipur and extract a heavy tribute.{{sfn|R.S. Chaurasia|2004|p=181}} Sindhia also attacked Udaipur, defeated the forces of Krishna's father Bhim Singh.{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}}

=== Amir Khan's invasion ===

Amir Khan, who had defected to Man Singh's side for money, helped consolidated Man Singh's control over the throne of Jodhpur.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=78}} In April 1810, Amir Khan demanded tribute from Udaipur and Jaipur, and invaded Udaipur. At that time, the prominent nobles of Udaipur were fighting among themselves for political power, and therefore, Udaipur forces could not put up a strong defence.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=79}} Amir Khan devastated and burned the villages of the Udaipur kingdom.{{sfn|Padmaja Sharma|1971|p=89}} He then sent a message to Krishna's father Bhim Singh demanding that Krishna be either married to Man Singh or killed, because as long as she lived, there would be no peace.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=79}} He threatened to destroy Bhim Singh's kingdom if this demand was not met.{{sfn|Padmaja Sharma|1971|p=89}}

According to a contemporary British account published in the ''Asiatic Annual Register for 1810-11'', Amir Khan came up with the suggestion to poison Krishna "as the only mode of at once settling all their pretensions, and terminating the ten years' war, which this second [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] had excited."{{sfn|R. K. Gupta|S. R. Bakshi|2008|p=284}} The [[Sisodia]] nobles of Mewar, who considered the [[Rathore]] clan of Jodhpur inferior in status, also advised Bhim Singh that it was better to let Krishna die than suffer the supposed dishnour of having her married into the Rathore family.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=79}}

==Death==

Bhim Singh determined that his daughter's death was necessary for establishing peace, and Krishna agreed to die by poisoning.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=80}} She died of poisoning on 21 July 1810.{{sfn|Kanchan Mathur|2004|p=76}} The ''Asiatic Annual Register'' report states that her aunt administered poison to her, with the knowledge of her father.{{sfn|R. K. Gupta|S. R. Bakshi|2008|p=284}} The report describes her death as "the most important political event which has lately occurred in [[Hindustan]]".{{sfn|R. K. Gupta|S. R. Bakshi|2008|p=283}}

After Krishna's death, Amir Khan, the [[Chundawat]] chiefs and the Marathas fought among themselves for control of Mewar. The Udaipur State ultimately sought help from [[East India Company|the British]], and agreed to become a British protectorate in January 1818.{{sfn|Tej Kumar Mathur|1987|p=81}} The other parties involved in the conflict also accepted British suzerainty within a decade of her death.

==News of the Princess Reaches London==
The circumstances of the princess's death were introduced to the British public by Major-General Sir [[John Malcolm]] in ‘A Memoir of Central India', 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Eclectic Review, VOL. XXII, July-December 1824, p. 128. From a review of ''A Memoir of Central India, including Malwa, and the adjoining Provinces; with the History and copious Illustrations of the past and present Condition of that Country.'' By Major-General Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B. K.L.S. 2 vols. 8vo. Second Edition. Map. pp. 1127. London, 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;. He states that his account was drawn from several persons who were on the spot at the time and he gives the princess's name as Kishen Kower. 

Another source of information in Britain was [[Muhammad Amir Khan]], an active participant as noted above, whose memoirs were translated from the Persian and published in 1832. He gives her name as Kishen Koomaree (probably the correct historical pronunciation of Kumari). Amir Khan's account of her final moments states that: 'Accordingly having bathed, and dressed herself in new and gay attire, she drank off the poison, and so gave up her precious life, earning the perpetual praise, and admiration of mankind.'&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of the Puthan Soldier of Fortune the Nuwab Ameer-Ood-Doulah Mohummud Ameer Khan, Chief of Seronj, Tonk, Rampoora, Neemahera, and Other Places in Hindoostan''. Calcutta, 1832. Book 8, Chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;

From these accounts it became common knowledge in Britain. The Asiatic Journal, June 1835, in an article on Oodipore refers to the 'well-known fate of the beautiful Kishen Kower, or Krishna Komari.'&lt;ref&gt;Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register, for British and Foreign India, China and Australasia. Vol. XVII.-New Series, May-August, 1835. June, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Literary Response in Britain==
The impact of this event on British culture is discussed by Máire ni Fhlathúin in her ''British India and Victorian Literary Culture''&lt;ref&gt;''British India and Victorian Literary Culture.'' Máire ni Fhlathúin, 2015, pp. 142-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded poem on the subject, entitled ''Kishen Kower'', is by Mrs. G. G. Richardson ([[Catherine Eliza Richardson]]) in her ''Poems'' of 1828&lt;ref&gt;Poems by Mrs G. G. Richardson, 1828, pp.109-112.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a fragment and only deals with Kishen Kower's death and what followed.

[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] tells the story within ''The Zenana'', again under the heading ''Kishen Kower''&lt;ref&gt;Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834. pp. 21-24.&lt;/ref&gt; (and giving apologises for the anachronism, as the main action of this long poem is set much earlier). She introduces the princess's taking of the poison with the lines:
{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834/Zenana - Kishen Kower|'Kishen Kower', a poem within 'The Zenana'&lt;br&gt;by L. E. L}}

* And the blood of her race rushes dark to her brow,&lt;br&gt;The spirit of heroes has entered her now.&lt;br&gt;'Bring the death-cup, and never for my sake shall shame&lt;br&gt;Quell the pride of my house, or dishonour its name.'

Máire ni Fhlathúin also includes versions by Anna Maria Mowatt (''Kishen Kowur''), [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]] (''Kishen Koomaree, Princess of Oodeepoor'') and Lieut.-Col. G. Poulett Cameron (in his The Romance of Military Life, 1853, ''Kishen Kower'').&lt;ref&gt;The Romance of Military Life being Souvenirs connecting with Thirty Years' Service by Lieut.-Col. G. Poulett Cameron C.B. K.C.T.S. &amp;&amp;, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other prose versions can be found. The first in the Court Journal for 1835 (as ''Kishen Kower'', anonymously)&lt;ref&gt;Court Journal. Vol. 7, 1835, pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;. In this version, the princess survives two cups of the poison but is then stabbed to death by a kinsman. A second, more extended version of the story, appeared in The East India Sketch-book, 1836 (Elizabeth Bruce Elton Smith), entitled ''The Three Moons''.&lt;ref&gt; ''The East India Sketch-book'' by Elizabeth Bruce Elton Smith, 1836, pp. 193-217&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Melvin Shockley''' (1941/1942 &amp;ndash; April 10, 1959) was a juvenile executed in the [[United States]] on April 10, 1959, for a murder committed when he was under the age of 18. Shockley, a black male, was executed in [[Maryland]] in a [[gas chamber]] for the murder of shopkeeper Sarah Hearne on January 16, 1958. Shockley (then 16) was involved in the robbery of a small shop in [[Dorchester County, Maryland]]. &lt;ref&gt;Stark, Mike.

[[File:NamUs UP 7097 Reconstruction 005c.jpg|thumb|[[Miss X (decedent)|Miss X]] is one of the most widely publicized unidentified decedent cases in the United States.]]

An [[unidentified decedent]], or UID, is a deceased person whose legal identity is unable to be determined by law enforcement. Although the majority of individuals are identified soon after their bodies are recovered, it is not uncommon for bodies to remain unidentified for years or even decades. There are approximately 40,000 unidentified decedents in the United States at any given time.&lt;ref name=coldcasesonline&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Abigail|title=Cold cases go online, with respect for victims|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/feb/10/cold-cases-go-online-respect-victims/|accessdate=August 11, 2014 |agency=Las Vegas Sun |date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bone&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Lise|title='Detective' will exhume bodies in victim identity hunt|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Detective-will-exhume-bodies-in-victim-identity-1691577.php|accessdate=December 8, 2014|work=Houston Chronicle|date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deceased body can be identified in several different ways. Most commonly, a relative of the deceased identifies the body by sight. However, if a body is decomposed, skeletal, or unrecognizable due to severe facial trauma at the time of recovery, other methods must be used. Some common modes of identification include fingerprint comparison, dental records, chest x-rays and comparing the deceased's DNA to the DNA sequence of relatives such as a parent or sibling. Since identification of a deceased individual is a legal matter, officials require a high degree of certainty in order to make a formal identification.&lt;ref name=lonelydeath&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kleinfeld|first1=N.R.|title=The Lonely Death of George Bell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-new-york-city.html|accessdate=October 18, 2014|work=New York Times|date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, after the passing of Grand Canyon photographer Emery Kolb, the remains of a John Doe were found in his garage. Although there was speculation that this was the remains of Glen Hyde who had vanished with his wife in 1928 [[Glen and Bessie Hyde]] this was not so.&lt;br&gt;The deceased died June 4, 1933 at Shoshone Point Grand Canyon. Suicide was determined to be the cause of death.

On September 10, 1990, a skeleton of a female between fifteen and twenty-five of slight to medium build was discovered in [[Manvel, Texas|Manvel]], [[Brazoria County, Texas]], between one and five years after the death occurred, underneath a tire and a pile of brush. Six rings and a pearl bracelet were found on the body, including a 1975 blue class ring that originated from [[Lee High School (Houston)|Robert E. Lee High School]]. Another was a gold ring containing several clear stones. The class ring, which was upsized twice to a size 9, is not believed to have originally belonged to her, as it pre-dated the period when she would have graduated from high school. She was likely white, but likely had someone of African descent in her ancestry.

The skeletonized remains of a female were discovered by a hunter on November 18, 1985 in Alleghany County, Virginia. Only the skull, which was found first, and torso of the subject were recovered. The hair color, eye color, height and weight could not be determined. She was, however, estimated to be a white female between the ages of twenty and forty-nine years old. She had died approximately four months before, as examination indicated. No clothing was found at the scene and it was not possible to recover her fingerprints, as the advanced state of decomposition prevented it. Although her dental information has never been recorded, her DNA was successfully extracted and developed into a suitable profile.

Little was available for a coroner to examine, yet a distinct-shaped tooth was noticed as well as some fillings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Doe 1990|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184375/1/screen|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the lower jaw from the skull was never located, those that reconstructed the John Doe consequently had to estimate how it may have appeared. No other remains of the subject were ever found, which prevented any estimation of his height and weight.

The female was between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five years old and was of an indeterminable race.

She wore a shirt of an unknown color and a pair of "athletic pants" that were dark in color and had three stripes visible.

The body of a female of African heritage was found floating near a dock in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 16, 1982. She may have been deceased for several months, but had been well preserved due to the low temperatures in the river. The girl is believed to have died at the age of fifteen to twenty-five, possibly as old as thirty-five. She was five feet four inches tall and weighed 137 pounds. Her hair was styled in an Afro and was black with reddish tints. Her face was reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2014 after her mortuary photographs were submitted. This was done due to her face being swollen from being in the water for a period of time. She had dental fillings and two root canals in her life and also had a scar leading from her abdomen to her pubic region. The victim's death is considered accidental, as there were no signs of foul play on her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luthern|first1=Ashley|title=Investigators trying to solve mystery of woman found in 1982|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/investigators-trying-to-solve-mystery-of-woman-found-in-1982-b99396464z1-284101131.html?ipad=y|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|agency=Journal Sentinel|date=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wore a brown coat, bluish-green socks, boots, tan hat, brown top and a sweater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man finds woman's body in river|url=http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyMedicalExaminer/PSMDS017.jpg?Large|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|agency=Journal Sentinel|date=March 17, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had died approximately one year prior, reinforcing the theory that the body belonged to River Guy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 4757|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/4757|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=July 6, 2015|date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic testing was eventually performed on the bones.

==Early life and career==
Born in  [[Jiangsu]] and of Haimen ancestry in 1883, Mao Zuquan studied in [[Japan]] as a student during his younger days before being appointed as a member of the Nationalist Party of China's Kuomintang National Assembly in 1912.  The National Assembly ({{zh|t=國民大會|p=Guómín Dàhuì}}) refers to several [[parliament]]ary bodies that existed in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] at this time.  He quickly rose through the ranks and became a prominent individual in the Chinese government and society and in 1924, he was chosen by China's Kuomintang Central Committee as a candidate for the position of the executive committee member.  In his later years, he served a number of positions in the Nationalist government.  He was appointed as the head of the Jiangsu Civil Administration on [[Mainland China]] under the rule of the government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].  He also served as [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist China]] Secretary of the Official Punishment Committee as well as the Secretary-General to the President of the Republic of China.  He also served as the Presidential National Policy Consultant and as Nationalist Republic of China's first Minister of the [[Ministry of Justice (Republic of China)]].&lt;ref name=nr/&gt;&lt;ref name=yu/&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927–49) forced the Nationalists to retreat to the island of [[Taiwan]] after the victory of the Chinese Communists in Mainland China.  Mao Zhuquan stayed behind on the mainland, rather than relocate with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his troops to the island with the rest of his family.  In 1950, he was arrested by the [[Communist Party of China]] while in [[Shanghai]] and subsequently imprisoned for refusing to cooperate with the Communists.  In 1952, he died in prison as a result of a [[hunger strike]] in opposition to the Communists.&lt;ref name=nr/&gt;&lt;ref name=yu/&gt;

His descendants now reside in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], as well as the United States in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]] and [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

'''''Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God''''' is a [[monodrama]] written by [[Charles Messina]] about the life and death of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]].  It presents Mercury in the moments just after his death, during which he is confronted with self-examination as he "seeks redemption before a God unimpressed by his celebrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messina|first=Charles|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|year=2009|publisher=Original Works Publishing|location=United States|isbn=978-1-934962-52-7|pages=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Farrokh Bulsara was a boy of Persian heritage who never quite fit into his skin or his teeth.  It wasn’t until he became a young man that he discovered his talent and true nature, and was reborn as Freddie Mercury.  After a brilliant career, with the arenas empty and the lights out, on the night of November 24, 1991, Freddie is forced to surrender his celebrity and face the frailty of his own humanity.  As he succumbs to AIDS, the worldwide icon seeks redemption before a God unimpressed with celebrity. In his ultimate struggle to make sense of his grim fate, Mercury realizes that his fame, fortune, and talents are no longer enough to sustain him; that beyond the darkness of his fears, shines a light far brighter than the star he was on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originalworksonline.com/store/monologues/mercury-the-afterlife-and-times-of-a-rock-god/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play debuted at the [[Sanford Meisner]] Theatre in [[New York City|New York City's]]  [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] district on November 24, 1997 at 6:48pm - the 6th anniversary of Mercury's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC On This Day: 24 November 1991: Giant of rock dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/24/newsid_2546000/2546945.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=November 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The part of Freddie was played by [[Khalid Gonçalves]] (né Paul Gonçalves).&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefkowitz |first=David |title=Freddie Mercury To Rise Again, Off-B'way, Nov. 24 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/35833-Freddie-Mercury-To-Rise-Again-Off-Bway-Nov-24 |publisher=Playbill.com |date=November 24, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021131502/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/35833-Freddie-Mercury-To-Rise-Again-Off-Bway-Nov-24 |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On opening night of the play, then-[[New York City Council]] member [[Tom Duane]] introduced the show.&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"/&gt;

The play ran every night until December 7.

== Second run ==

The play began its second run on February 14, 1998.

On February 17, rock musician [[Billy Squier]], a longtime friend of Freddie's, debuted a song that he wrote in memory of him titled ''I Have Watched You Fly'' on stage before a performance of the play.  He introduced the song by saying, "I knew Freddie as a friend.  I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was also performed every night during the second run, ending on March 8, 1998.

Proceeds from the ticket sales of both runs were donated to [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] and [[Mercury Phoenix Trust|The Mercury Phoenix Trust]].&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"/&gt;

On January 11, 2004, the play experienced a successful revival with a three-month run at the [[Triad Theater]], also in New York City, with Messina again as writer/director and featuring [[Amir Darvish]] in the role of Freddie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simonson|authorlink1=Robert Simonson |first=Robert |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Freddy Mercury Play Begins Performances Off Broadway, Jan. 11 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83716-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Freddy-Mercury-Play-Begins-Performances-Off-Broadway-Jan-11 |publisher=Playbill.com |date=January 11, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021131929/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83716-Bohemian-Rhapsody-Freddy-Mercury-Play-Begins-Performances-Off-Broadway-Jan-11 |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the play also had a special, limited engagement from August 30 to September 2 at The Art House in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God in Provincetown Art House August 30|url=http://provincetownjournal.com/events/entry/mercury-the-afterlife-and-times-of-a-rock-god-in-provincetown-art-house-aug/|publisher=ProvincetownJournal.com|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

In 2009, the play was published by Original Works Publishing.  Proceeds from the sale of the play will be donated to [[AmfAR|AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messina|first=Charles|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|year=2009|publisher=Original Works Publishing|location=United States|isbn=978-1-934962-52-7|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==

Both incarnations of the play have received favorable reviews from Queen fans and from the music and theater press, notably [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marone|first=Mark|title=On Stage|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=Goncalves&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#/archive/read?id=3gkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=frontcover&amp;query=1997&amp;date=1997-12-13|newspaper=Billboard|date=December 13, 1997|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Yorker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The New Yorker|date=January 26, 2004|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out New York]], [[Zagat Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zagat Survey New York City Theater Guide Spring Edition|year=2004|publisher=Zagat Survey|isbn=978-1-57006-587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Forbes|first=Harry|title=Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God|magazine=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|date=November 28, 2003|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4569275-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2011, the play was recognized by Flavorwire.com in their list of ''15 Artistic Tributes to Freddie Mercury.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Temple|first=Emily|title=The Show Must Go On: 15 Artistic Tributes to Freddie Mercury|url=http://flavorwire.com/235246/the-show-must-go-on-15-artistic-tributes-to-freddie-mercury/5|publisher=FlavorWire.com|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

There was no Queen or Freddie Mercury music in the play.

In a 1997 interview with [[Playbill.com]], Gonçalves said, "All the things I've seen about Mercury focus on the music, career and persona; very little has been discussed about the person. Not only did Charles write a play about Mercury, he captured the humanity." "Charles and I agreed that doing a musical about Mercury would take away from what we're trying to do in getting to the core of this person. The ultimate goal is to make a film of Mercury's life."&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz"/&gt;

Likewise, Darvish, in a 2004 interview with [[Access Hollywood]], stated that, "We wanted to stray away from the music.  We wanted to tell his story.  He has a story.  Everyone knows the music.  People are familiar with the music.  It's his story, and where he's come from, and what he's done that people don't know.&lt;ref name="BBCPres2008"&gt;{{Cite episode

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">A '''microfactory''' refers to a small dimension factory able to produce small dimension products. The term was proposed by the Mechanical Engineer Laboratory (MEL) of [[Japan]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Makoto Tanaka, Development of desktop machining microfactory. Riken Review N. 34 Focused on Advances on Micro-mechanical Fabrication Techniques, April, 2001.

Microfactory - concept, history, and developments. Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, pages 837–844, 2004.

Due to their reduced dimensions, microfactories should be highly automated.  They might contain automatic machine tools, assembly systems, quality inspection systems, material feed systems, waste elimination systems, a system to evaluate tool deterioration and a system to replace tools.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kussul et al. Development of micromachine tool prototypes for microfactories, Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, V. 12. N. 6. November 2002. pp.795-812. Available in the WEB at http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0960-1317/12/6/311&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one proposed microfactory is being designed to make many of its own parts, i.e., is a partially [[self-replicating machine]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Moise''' (died 29 August 1530) was a [[Voivode]] ([[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]]) of [[Wallachia]] from January or March 1529 to June 1530, son of [[Vladislav III]]. His rule marks the willingness of the [[boyars]] to compromise, in order to prevent rules like that of [[Basarab VI]] - in which the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] appointed the Prince and profited of his submission. 

Moise initially maintained a close relationship with [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]: on Turkish orders, he sent an embassy to [[Sibiu]] demanding that the [[Transylvania]]n city submit to Ottoman [[vassal]] [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] [[John Zápolya]]; when refused, Moise's army, placed under the leadership of [[Seneschal]] '''Drăgan din Merişani''' and '''Neagoe din Periş''' (the assassins of [[Radu de la Afumaţi]] and, possibly, of Basarab V) attacked and plundered the outskirts.

After the [[Siege of Vienna]], the Prince attempted to cut off his country's links to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] and align it with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] and Ferdinand's regional ally, [[Moldavia]]n [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Petru Rareş]]. This move was backed by the [[Craioveşti]] family, but by few other boyars. On February 13, 1530, Moise ordered the murder of several in the opposition, including Drăgan and Neagoe, during his wedding to a sister of a Craioveşti [[Ban (title)|Ban]]; the rest took refuge in Ottoman lands and elected [[Vlad Înecatul]] as the new Prince, with Ottoman recognition. Vlad stormed the country in May, and, by early June, Moise had to take refuge in Sibiu. The officials in [[Poienari Castle|Poienari]] were sent by Vlad to ask that Moise be turned over or killed - since he was now an ally, Sibiu refused.

On August 24, with [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] backing, Moise re-entered Wallachia through the [[Rucăr-Bran Passage]]; he was joined by Craioveşti troops at [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]], and fought Vlad Înecatul at '''Viişoara''' (in [[Teleorman]]), on 29 August. He suffered a major defeat and was killed on the spot.

'''Monotremes''' are one of the three main groups of living [[mammal]]s, along with placentals ([[Eutheria]]) and marsupials ([[Metatheria]]). The monotremes are typified by [[Oviparity|laying egg]]s rather than bearing live young, and by structural differences in their brains, jaws, digestive and reproductive tracts, and other body parts compared to the more common mammalian types. However, like all mammals, the female monotremes nurse their young with [[milk]].

Monotremes are traditionally referred to as the mammalian subclass [[Prototheria]]. The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] although there is evidence that they were once more widespread including some extinct species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascual|first=Rosendo|last2=Archer|first2=Michael|last3=Jaureguizar|first3=Edgardo Ortiz|last4=Prado|first4=José L.|last5=Godthelp|first5=Henk|last6=Hand|first6=Suzanne J.|date=1992-04-23|title=First discovery of monotremes in South America|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v356/n6371/abs/356704a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=356|issue=6371|pages=704–706|doi=10.1038/356704a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing monotreme species are the [[platypus]] and four species of [[echidna]]s. There is currently some debate regarding monotreme [[#Taxonomy|taxonomy]].

The word ''monotreme'' comes from the Greek μονός, ''monos'' ("single") and τρῆμα, ''trema'' ("hole"), referring to the [[cloaca]].

==General characteristics==
Like other mammals, monotremes are [[endotherm]]ic with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals; see below); have [[hair]] on their bodies; produce [[milk]] through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three [[Middle ear|middle-ear]] bones.

In common with reptiles and [[marsupial]]s, monotremes lack the connective structure ([[corpus callosum]]) which in placental mammals is the primary communication route between the right and left brain hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/monotremata/order.htm|title=Animal Bytes&amp;nbsp;– Order Monotremata}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anterior commissure]] does provide an alternate communication route between the two hemispheres, though, and in monotremes and marsupials it carries all the [[commissural fiber]]s arising from the [[neocortex]], whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ann B. |last=Butler |first2=William |last2=Hodos |title=Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kGARvykJKMC&amp;pg=PA361 |date=2005 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-73383-6|pages=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have a "tribosphenic" form of [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s (with the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|occlusal]] surface formed by three [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s arranged in a triangle), which is one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials,&lt;ref name=Luo01/&gt; although this hypothesis remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weil A |journal=Nature |title=Mammalian evolution: Relationships to chew over |volume=409 |issue=6816 |pages= 28–31|doi=10.1038/35051199 |date=4 January 2001 |pmid=11343097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooth loss in modern monotremes might be related to their development of [[electrolocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Masakazu Asahara |author2=Masahiro Koizumi |first3=Thomas E. |last3=Macrini |first4=Suzanne J. |last4=Hand |first5=Michael |last5=Archer |title=Comparative cranial morphology in living and extinct platypuses: Feeding behavior, electroreception, and loss of teeth |journal=Science Advances |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e1601329 |year=2016 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1601329 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotreme jaws are constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in [[cynodont]]s and other premammalian [[synapsida|synapsid]]s; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and [[theria]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rich |first1=T.

The sequencing of the platypus genome has also provided insight into the evolution of a number of monotreme traits, such as venom and [[electroreception]], as well as showing some new unique features, such as the fact that monotremes possess 10 sex chromosomes and that their X chromosome resembles the sex chromosome of birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080507131453.htm |title=Platypus Genome Explains Animal's Peculiar Features; Holds Clues To Evolution Of Mammals |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the two sex chromosomes of marsupial and placental mammals evolved more recently than the split from the monotreme lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Veyrunes et al.

The monotremes also have extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an [[interclavicle]] and [[coracoid]], which are not found in other mammals. Monotremes retain a reptile-like gait, with legs on the sides of, rather than underneath, their bodies. The monotreme leg bears a spur in the ankle region; the spur is not functional in echidnas, but contains a powerful [[platypus venom|venom]] in the male platypus. This venom is derived from b-defensins, proteins that are present in mammals that create holes in viral and bacterial pathogens. Some reptile venom is also composed of different types of b-defensins, another trait shared with reptiles.&lt;ref name="Myers 2008"&gt;Myers, Pz.

===Reproductive system===

The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals gives them their  name; ''monotreme'' means “single opening” in Greek, referring to the single duct (the [[cloaca]]) for their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems. Monotremes, like reptiles, have a single cloaca; marsupials also have a [[Marsupial#Reproductive system|separate genital tract]]; whereas most placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction (the [[vagina]]), urination (the [[urethra]]), and defecation (the [[anus]]). In monotremes, only semen passes through the penis; urine is excreted through the cloaca.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mervyn Griffiths|title=The Biology of the Monotremes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7nu16_DkTgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2 December 2012|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-323-15331-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotreme penis is similar to that of turtles, and is covered by a preputial sac.&lt;ref&gt;Grützner, F., B. Nixon, and R. C. Jones.

Monotreme [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are retained for some time within the mother and receive nutrients directly from her, and they generally hatch within 10 days after laying, much shorter than the incubation period of [[sauropsida|sauropsid]] eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Cromer, Erica (14 April 2004).

Retrieved 18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arkiveTGA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.arkive.org/short-beaked-echidna/tachyglossus-aculeatus/biology.html | title = Short-beaked echidna (''Tachyglossus aculeatus'') | publisher = Arkive.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newborn monotremes are larval and fetus-like, much like newborn marsupials (and perhaps all non-placental mammals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael L. |last=Power |first2=Jay |last2=Schulkin |title=The Evolution of the Human Placenta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfffGC3hjPoC |date=2012 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0870-5 |pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and like them have relatively well-developed forelimbs that enable them to crawl around. In fact, given that monotremes lack nipples, their puggles crawl about more frequently than marsupial joeys in search of milk; this difference raises questions about the supposed developmental restrictions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} on marsupial forelimbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schneider |first=Nanette Y. |title=The development of the olfactory organs in newly hatched monotremes and neonate marsupials |journal=J.

Monotremes lactate from their [[mammary gland]]s via openings in their skin, rather than through [[nipple]]s. All five extant species show prolonged parental care of infants, with low rates of reproduction and relatively long life-spans.

Monotremes are also noteworthy in their zygotic development. Most mammal zygotes go through holoblastic [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], meaning that after fertilization, the ovum splits into multiple, divisible daughter cells. In contrast, the zygotes of monotremes, like those of birds and reptiles, undergo meroblastic (partial) division. This means the cells at the yolk's edge have cytoplasm continuous with that of the egg, which allows the yolk and embryo to exchange waste and nutrients with the surrounding cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Myers 2008"/&gt;

Monotremes may have less developed [[thermoregulation]] than other mammals, but recent research shows that they easily maintain a constant body temperature in a variety of circumstances, such as the platypus in icy mountain streams. Early researchers were misled by two factors: firstly, monotremes maintain a lower average temperature than most mammals; secondly, the [[short-beaked echidna]], much easier to study than the reclusive platypus, maintains normal temperature only when active; during cold weather, it conserves energy by "switching off" its temperature regulation. Understanding of this mechanism came when reduced thermal regulation was observed in the [[hyrax]]es, which are [[Eutheria|placental mammals]].

The echidna was originally thought to experience no [[rapid eye movement sleep]].&lt;ref name="MREM"&gt;{{Cite journal

The echidna spurs are vestigial and have no known function, while the platypus spurs contain venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whittington|first=Camilla|last2=Belov|first2=Katherine|last3=Whittington|first3=Camilla M.|last4=Belov|first4=Katherine|date=April 2014|title=Tracing Monotreme Venom Evolution in the Genomics Era|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/6/4/1260|journal=Toxins|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1260–1273|doi=10.3390/toxins6041260|pmc=4014732|pmid=24699339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular data show that the main component of platypus venom emerged before the divergence of platypus and echidnas, suggesting that the most recent common ancestor of these taxa was also possibly a venomous monotreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whittington|first=Camilla|last2=Belov|first2=Katherine|last3=Whittington|first3=Camilla M.|last4=Belov|first4=Katherine|date=April 2014|title=Tracing Monotreme Venom Evolution in the Genomics Era|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/6/4/1260|journal=Toxins|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1260–1273|doi=10.3390/toxins6041260|pmc=4014732|pmid=24699339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Monotremes are conventionally treated as comprising a single order '''Monotremata''', though a recent classification&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Malcolm C., and Susan K. Bell (1997). ''Classification of Mammals Above the Species Level.'' New York: Columbia University Press. 631 pp. {{ISBN|0-231-11013-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes to divide them into the orders [[Platypoda]] (the [[platypus]] along with its fossil relatives) and [[Tachyglossa]] (the [[echidna]]s, or spiny anteaters). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass [[Prototheria]], which was extended to include several [[fossil]] orders, but these are no longer seen as constituting a group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a [[clade]] termed [[Australosphenida]].&lt;ref name=Luo01&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Z.-X. | last2 = Cifelli | first2 = R.L. | last3 = Kielan-Jaworowska | first3 = Z. | year = 2001 | title = Dual origin of tribosphenic mammals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6816| pages = 53–57 | doi=10.1038/35051023 | pmid=11343108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Z.-X. | last2 = Cifelli | first2 = R.L. | last3 = Kielan-Jaworowska | first3 = Z. | year = 2002 | title = In quest for a phylogeny of Mesozoic mammals | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional "[[theria]] hypothesis" states that the divergence of the monotreme lineage from the [[Metatheria]] ([[marsupial]]) and [[Eutheria]] (placental mammal) lineages happened prior to the divergence between marsupials and placental mammals, and this explains why monotremes retain a number of [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] traits presumed to have been present in the [[synapsid]] ancestors of later mammals, such as egg-laying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry A. |last=Vaughan |first2=James M. |last2=Ryan |first3=Nicholas J. |last3=Czaplewski |title=Mammalogy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD1nDlzXYicC&amp;pg=PA80 |date=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-6299-5|pages=80 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/monotreme.html |title=Introduction to the Monotremata |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/Lecture3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most morphological evidence supports the theria hypothesis, but one possible exception is a similar pattern of tooth replacement seen in monotremes and marsupials, which originally provided the basis for the competing "marsupionata hypothesis" in which the divergence between monotremes and marsupials happened later than the divergence between these lineages and the placental mammals. An analysis by Van Rheede in 2005 concluded that the genetic evidence favors the theria hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Rheede | first1 = Teun | year = 2005 | title = The Platypus Is in Its Place: Nuclear Genes and Indels Confirm the Sister Group Relation of Monotremes and Therians | url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/23/3/587#SEC1 | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 587–597 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msj064 | pmid=16291999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this hypothesis continues to be the more widely accepted one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tolweb.org/treehouses/?treehouse_id=4430 |title=Monotremes |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.4.1276 |publisher=Tolweb.org |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time when the monotreme line diverged from other mammalian lines is uncertain, but one survey of genetic studies gives an estimate of about 220 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Madsen|first=Ole |editor-last=Hedges |editor-first=S. Blair |title=The Timetree of Life |chapter=Mammals }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils of a jaw fragment 110 million years old were found at [[Lightning Ridge]], [[New South Wales]]. These fragments, from the species ''[[Steropodon galmani]]'', are the oldest known fossils of monotremes. Fossils from the genera ''[[Teinolophos]]'', and ''[[Obdurodon]]'' have also been discovered. In 1991, a fossil tooth of a 61-million-year-old platypus was found in southern [[Argentina]] (since named ''Monotrematum'', though it is now considered to be an ''Obdurodon'' species). (See fossil monotremes below.)

The precise relationships among extinct groups of mammals and modern groups such as monotremes are uncertain, but [[cladistics|cladistic]] analyses usually put the [[Most recent common ancestor#MRCA of different species|last common ancestor]] (LCA) of placentals and monotremes close to the LCA of placentals and [[Multituberculata|multituberculates]], whereas some suggest that the LCA of placentals and multituberculates was more recent than the LCA of placentals and monotremes .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Benton |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1LkOL1CijEC&amp;pg=PA300 |date=2004 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Matthew T. |last=Carrano |first2=Richard W. |last2=Blob |first3=Timothy J. |last3=Gaudin |first4=John R. |last4=Wible |title=Amniote Paleobiology: Perspectives on the Evolution of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uNMCqSRQ9gC&amp;pg=PA358 |date=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-09478-6 |pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil monotremes==
{{See also|Evolution of mammals}}
The fossil record of monotremes is relatively sparse. The first Mesozoic monotreme to be discovered was ''Steropodon galmani'' from Lightning Ridge, New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Ashwell, K|year=2013 |title= Neurobiology of Monotremes|publisher= CSIRO Publishing|location=Melbourne|isbn= 9780643103115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although biochemical and anatomical evidence suggests that the monotremes diverged from the mammalian lineage before the marsupials and placental mammals arose, only a handful of monotreme fossils are known from before the [[Miocene]] epoch. The known [[Mesozoic]] monotremes are ''[[Steropodon]]'' and ''[[Teinolophos]]'', all from Australian deposits in the [[Cretaceous]], so monotremes had already diversified by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/monotremefr.html |title=Fossil Record of the Monotremata |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A platypus tooth has been found in the [[Palaeocene]] of Argentina, so one hypothesis is that monotremes arose in Australia in the [[Late Jurassic]] or [[Early Cretaceous]], and that some migrated across [[Antarctica]] to [[South America]], both of which were still united with Australia at that time.;&lt;ref name=VertPal&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Benton |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GDxXb_ZPJEC&amp;pg=PA303 |date=1997 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-632-05614-9 |pages=303–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, several genetic studies suggest an origin in the [[Triassic]].&lt;ref name="monotremedivergence"&gt;http://timetree.org/pdf/Madsen2009Chap68.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=September 2014}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
On April 10, 2007, the [[National Football League]] introduced a new '''conduct policy''' to help control off-field behavior by its players and preserve the league's public image.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-new-conduct-policy_N.htm?csp=34 Goodell strengthens NFL player conduct policy] ''USA Today'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, introduced by NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], implements a tougher, new personal-conduct policy, and under conditions of the previous policy handed down two of the harshest suspensions in NFL history for off-field misdeeds.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"&gt;Bell, Jarrett. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-pacman-henry-suspensions_N.htm Conduct unbecoming: NFL sets new standard with suspensions] ''USA Today'', April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Each player that has been suspended must reapply for reinstatement.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"&gt;[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=playerconduct&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns CB Jones suspended for 2007 season, WR Henry banned eight games] ''Yahoo Sports Ticker'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy only applies to the player's personal lives and image in the public spotlight. The NFL conducts separate investigations for drug and alcohol abuse and performance enhancement.

As of December 2011, seven players have been suspended for an extended period by the NFL due to conduct off the field.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is important that the NFL be represented consistently by outstanding people as well as great football players, coaches, and staff. We hold ourselves to higher standards of responsible conduct because of what it means to be part of the National Football League. We have long had policies and programs designed to encourage responsible behavior, and this policy is a further step in ensuring that everyone who is part of the NFL meets that standard. We will continue to review the policy and modify it as warranted."

On September 1, 2006, just days prior to the start of the [[2006 NFL season]], [[Roger Goodell]] assumed the office of Commissioner of the National Football League. Goodell was met with expectations of enforcing the National Football League's image to the media. In the months leading up to Goodell's ascension, nine players from the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"&gt;Wilner, Barry. (Associated Press) [http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2007/04/10/goodell_gets_tough_protects_nfl_brand/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+Sports+%2F+Football+%2F+New+England+Patriots Goodell gets tough, protects NFL brand] ''Boston Globe'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell and the [[National Football League Players Association]] decided that teams will be responsible for the conduct of their employees, and will be subject to discipline for any transgressions.

Goodell had consulted with [[Gene Upshaw]], former executive director of the NFLPA, and also created a six-man player advisory committee to discuss conduct, discipline and other topics.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

The first (players) to feel the teeth of the new policy were [[Tennessee Titans]] [[cornerback]] [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] [[wide receiver]] [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], college teammates at [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] whose first two years in the NFL were marred by arrests.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"/&gt; The third player suspended was [[Chicago Bears]] [[defensive tackle]] [[Tank Johnson]]. On August 24, 2007, [[Atlanta Falcons]] starting [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]] filed a [[plea agreement]] and pleaded guilty in his involvement in illegal dog fighting and [[euthanasia|euthanization]], and was suspended indefinitely without pay; his reinstatement occurred in time for him to play in the 2009-2010 season.

==Suspended players==

===Adam "Pacman" Jones===
{{details|Adam Jones (American football)#Las Vegas shooting case and suspension}}
Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, facing felony charges in two states, was suspended for the entire 2007 season and given specific conditions to meet before he is reinstated, and he can be reinstated after the Titans' eleventh game.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; There were 10 occasions in which Jones was interviewed by police, the most recent during the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star weekend]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Police there recommended felony and misdemeanor charges against Jones after a fight and shooting at, what Jones refers to as a "strip club", left one man paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Jones later appealed his suspension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/10119161 NFL Suspends Pacman Jones, Bengals' Henry] ''NFL.com'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; saying he was "just being rebellious", but withdrew the request just weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/06/12/bc.fbn.pacmansuspension.ap/index.html Pacman Jones drops appeal], ''Sports Illustrated'', June 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2007, the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] District Attorney's office announced that Jones will face two felony charges stemming from the strip club melee that occurred on February 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2910497 Pacman faces felony charges in shooting that paralyzed man] ''ESPN.com'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the charges have since been dropped, Jones still faces civil actions, and his reinstatement was not to be considered until after the [[2008 Pro Bowl]]. On June 2, 2008, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] cleared Jones to participate in preseason workouts for the [[Dallas Cowboys]], who had traded for him during his suspension, and also said that a decision on Jones' reinstatement for the regular season would be made by September 1, six days before the Cowboys' first 2008 regular-season game. The league announced at that time that Jones' full reinstatement would depend on "demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=3422983 |title='Pacman' can join Cowboys for workouts |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26 Jones found himself fully reinstated, only to be suspended indefinitely on October 14 after an altercation with his bodyguard in a Dallas hotel.

===Chris Henry===
{{details|topic=Chris Henry's legal troubles|Chris Henry (wide receiver)}}
Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry, arrested five times in three states between December 2005 and April 2008,&lt;ref name="Bengals cut Henry"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3327235 Bengals cut Henry, say they'll no longer tolerate his conduct] ''ESPN.com'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was suspended for the first eight games of the 2007 season.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; He also had to comply with several conditions before returning.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; Henry was arrested four times in a 14-month span, and received a two-game league suspension last year.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; He was one of nine Bengals arrested in nine months.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Henry was required to not get into further trouble with the law and had to cooperate fully with required counseling, education and treatment assigned to him under league programs.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"/&gt;

Henry returned for the second half of the 2007 season but played a minor role on an 7-9 Bengals team. In April 2008, the Bengals released Henry after he was charged with misdemeanor and criminal damaging. He was accused of punching an 18-year-old male in the face and breaking a window in the individual's car. A warrant for Henry's arrest was issued and he surrendered the following day, a police spokesman said.&lt;ref name="Bengals cut Henry"/&gt; In August 2008, the Bengals re-signed Henry. On December 17, 2009, Henry died from injuries sustained from an accident stemming from a [[domestic dispute]] between him and his fiancee.

===Tank Johnson===
{{details|topic=Terry Johnson's legal troubles|Tank Johnson}}
On April 30, Terry "Tank" Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge as part of an arrangement with prosecutors that will keep him from serving additional jail time.

===Michael Vick===
{{details|topic=Michael Vick's involvement in dog fighting|Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation}}

Beginning on April 25, 2007, a large house and surrounding {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property Michael Vick owned in rural [[Surry County, Virginia]] where his 26-year-old cousin Davon T. Boddie had been residing became part of a continuing police investigation for possible operation of an illegal [[dog fighting]] ring. The action came after police executed a [[search warrant]] following two narcotics arrests of Boddie within a week in the [[Virginia Peninsula]] cities of Newport News and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] (each about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away from the Surry County property) earlier in April. Boddie had given the address of Vick's property in Surry County as his home address when arrested. Earlier, in February 2007, Boddie was convicted in the [[Norfolk, Virginia|City of Norfolk]] of disorderly conduct. At that time, he was carrying a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] driver's license giving his address as a house in [[Duluth, Georgia]] which was once owned by Vick.&lt;ref name="Involvement"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Greg Moore |title=If Vick Is Involved, How Many Others Are With Him? |publisher=BlackAthlete Sports Network |date=May 30, 2007 |url=http://www.blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |accessdate=July 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603140222/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |archivedate=June 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ESPN]], during the April 25 narcotics-related search of Vick's home and property at 1915 Moonlight Drive in the southeastern portion of Surry County, police discovered a large number of animals, and evidence which they felt indicated dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Progressing"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Associated Press |title=Prosecutor says dog fighting investigation at Vick's property 'moving forward' |publisher=ESPN |date=May 25, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2883048 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called animal-control officers, who saw what they said was evidence that dogfights had taken place there. Police obtained another search warrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Bill Geroux |title=Dogfighting: The Vick case |publisher=inRich |date=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0114.html |accessdate=July 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003537/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0114.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with the help of animal control officials from several localities, removed 66 dogs, 55 of them [[pit bull]]s, and seized equipment and some physical evidence that could be associated with dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Progressing"/&gt; [[WAVY-TV]] reported that detectives also seized guns, illegal ammunition magazines, suspected marijuana and paperwork on dog fighting.&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"&gt;{{Cite web|title=UPDATE - Vick claims no knowledge of situation on his property |publisher=WAVY-TV |date=March 28, 2007 |url=http://www.wavy.com/Global/story.asp?S=6428206 |accessdate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick, along with three others, was indicted by a federal grand jury on July 17, 2007 for "conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture".&lt;ref name="indictmentespn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2940065|title=Falcons' Vick indicted by grand jury in dogfighting probe|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2007|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/sportsline/main3067633.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Michael Vick Indicted By Grand Jury | date=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four face $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the federal charges. The operation was based at Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property near [[Smithfield, Virginia]], valued at over $700,000, which could conceivably be forfeited to the government, as the indictment also puts them on notice that the government intends to take possession of property used in the illegal operations and any proceeds.

In late April 2007, Vick denied his involvement and told ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' "I'm never at the house...I left the house with my family...They just haven't been doing the right thing... It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on."&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"/&gt;

Vick appeared in court on July 26, 2007 and pleaded [[innocence|not guilty]], the same date that the Atlanta Falcons began [[NFL Training Camp|training camp]].&lt;ref name="Vick indicted"&gt;Weir, Tom.

===Ben Roethlisberger===
{{details|Ben Roethlisberger#Milledgeville, Georgia}}
On July 17, 2009, a civil suit was filed in Washoe County, Nevada District Court accusing [[Ben Roethlisberger]] of sexually assaulting Andrea McNulty, 31, in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in Lake Tahoe for a celebrity golf tournament. No charges were filed in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger’s civil sexual assault lawsuit settled|url=https://nypost.com/2012/01/21/steelers-qb-ben-roethlisbergers-civil-sexual-assault-lawsuit-settled/|website=Ny Post|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2010, it was revealed that a woman from [[Milledgeville, Georgia]] had accused Roethlisberger of sexual assault.

This was the first time in league history a player has been suspended under the personal conduct policy without being charged with a crime.  Roethlisberger and Ezekiel Elliott are the only two players to have been suspended under this policy without being charged with a crime.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On August 22, 2013, Aaron Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Odin Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Hernandez indicted in death of semi-pro football player|url=http://www.wcvb.com/news/local/boston-south/aaron-hernandez-indicted-in-death-of-semipro-football-player/-/9848842/21576582/-/phv0vaz/-/index.html|publisher=WVCB TV|accessdate=22 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822164420/http://www.wcvb.com/news/local/boston-south/aaron-hernandez-indicted-in-death-of-semipro-football-player/-/9848842/21576582/-/phv0vaz/-/index.html|archivedate=August 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, Hernandez was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. He was held without bail, but reserved the right to request bail later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hernandez pleads not guilty to murder indictment|url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/06/hernandez-pleads-not-guilty-to-murder-indictment/|publisher=NY Post|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder, as well as five weapon charges, automatically being sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

While on trial for Lloyd's murder, Hernandez was indicted for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado; he was acquitted of the double homicide after a 2017 trial. Five days after the acquittal, Hernandez was found dead in his cell by hanging, which was ruled a suicide. Due to the fact that his death occurred while the murder conviction was under appeal, the conviction was vacated.·§

===Daryl Washington===

====Banned substance abuse====
On April 3, 2013, the NFL announced that [[Daryl Washington]] would be suspended for the first four games of the {{NFL Year|2013}} season for violating the league's substance policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000157077/article/daryl-washington-suspended-for-four-games-by-nfl|title=Daryl Washington suspended for four games by NFL|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2014, the NFL announced that Washington would be suspended for at least the 2014 season for once again violating the league's substance policy bringing his personal credibility and character into question after his statement from the 2013 violation: "I promise to work even harder and to not let you guys down anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000354739/article/daryl-washington-suspended-for-at-least-one-year|title=Daryl Washington suspended for at least one year|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault====

[[Phoenix Police Department|Phoenix Police]] accuse him of pushing her with two hands, causing her to fall and break her right collarbone.

===Jonathan Dwyer===
On Wednesday September 17, 2014 [[Jonathan Dwyer]] was arrested because of two incidents at Dwyer's home in southeast Phoenix on July 21 at 8 a.m. and July 22 at 4 p.m., according to the Phoenix Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11544985/jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-arrested-two-counts-suspicion-aggravated-assault&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents concerned attacks against his wife and 18-month-old child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Cardinals player formally charged in domestic violence case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/justice/jonathan-dwyer-indictment/|website=CNN Justice|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwyer was booked into Maricopa County Jail on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault. He was freed the next morning on a $25,000 cash bond and ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device. He was also banned from any contact with the alleged victims, travels outside of Arizona and any involvement with weapons, drugs or alcohol.

Dwyer admitted to the incidents during interviews with detectives but denied physically assaulting his wife and baby son.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/17/us/nfl-jonathan-dwyer-alleged-domestic-violence/&lt;/ref&gt; According to police, a search warrant was executed at his home.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11547511/police-report-says-jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-head-butted-punched-wife-struck-young-son-shoe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martavis Bryant===
Before the start of the [[2015 NFL season]], [[Martavis Bryant]] was suspended for four games in August for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He would return and play the rest of the season with the [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]. During the suspension, he spent time in rehab in [[Houston, TX|Houston]]. Bryant was charged with violating the substance abuse policy again, and suspended, this time for the entire [[2016 NFL season]].

===Ezekiel Elliott===
On August 11, 2017, the NFL suspended [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[running back]] [[Ezekiel Elliott]] for the first six games of the 2017 season, despite the lead NFL investigator in the case reportedly recommending no suspension. His suspension stems from various off the field incidents including being accused of [[domestic violence]] in 2016 by his ex-girlfriend who claimed on five different occasions he assaulted her. Despite never being charged, the NFL launched a year long investigation into the allegations. In March 2017, Elliott was captured on video pulling down woman's shirt exposing her breasts while watching a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade in Dallas. Four months later in July 2017 he was allegedly involved in an altercation at a nightclub during which a DJ’s nose was broken. Dallas police eventually suspended the investigation after they were unable to locate the victim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20302469/ezekiel-elliott-dallas-cowboys-suspended-six-games|title=Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott suspended six games for conduct|last=Archer|first=Todd|publisher=''ESPN.com''|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL Domestic Violence Policy==
A Domestic Violence Policy has been put into effect after the Ray Rice domestic violence incident on August 28, 2014. Commissioner Roger Goodell has lengthen bans to six games for the first domestic violence incident and a lifetime ban for a second incident. This is after the NFL suspended Ray Rice for two games and receiving large amounts of criticism during the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almasy|first1=Steve|last2=Nichols|first2=Rachel|title=NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/28/us/nfl-domestic-violence/|website=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has a history of inconsistently punishing domestic violence amongst its players. A majority of domestic violence violations are punished with about a 1.5 game suspension. The NFL rather has a consistent policy for punishing drug violations with performance-enhancing drugs and substance abuses averaging about 4 games suspension for the first offense and about 8 games suspension of performance-enhancing drugs and a 16 games suspension for substance abuse for a second offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCann|first1=Allison|title=The NFL’s Uneven History Of Punishing Domestic Violence|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has released a new Personal Conduct Policy on December 10, 2014. It is an updated version of the 2007 Personal Conduct Policy. It has added more infractions to the 2007 policy, which include violence against others and domestic violence. The disciplinary process is more detailed in terms of its investigative progress and consequences for infractions than its 2007 counterpart. The new policy will include counseling and treatment services for the offender and their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Rita|title=NFL's Personal Conduct Policy: A Step in the Right Direction|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rita-smith/nfls-personal-conduct-pol_1_b_6326480.html|publisher=huffingtonpost|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the domestic violence policy, the NFL will be educating high school students about domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Lindsay H.|title=NFL extending education about domestic violence to high school level|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/12/05/nfl-extending-education-about-domestic-violence-to-high-school-level/19955467/|publisher=USA TODAY|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person inside the NFL that is in charge on working on domestic violence and sexual assault issues is Anna Isaacson, who Roger Goodell named the first vice president of social responsibility on September 15, 2014. She has created new training sessions for every player and league employee as well as convincing the NFL to put in $10 million for domestic violence advertisements. She also constructed a partnership between the NFL and the National Domestic Violence Hotline to fund more resources to the various call centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drehs|first1=Wayne|title=Can Anna Isaacson save the NFL?|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/hotread141105/new-vp-social-responsibility-anna-isaacson-tries-save-nfl|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==

===Praise===
The new policy has been praised by both NFL players and sports columnists as a necessity to help improve the National Football League's image. The new policy—which also applies to coaches and front office personnel and has the support of NFLPA director Gene Upshaw—prompted questions and strong reactions among players.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;
Teammates of Chris Henry, including safety Madieu Williams, approved of the measure.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

[[Oakland Raiders]] defensive tackle [[Warren Sapp]] stated, "I understand what they're doing. Some of these new-jack kids act like they're walking on water. Sometimes, they need to be slapped in the face to wake up."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

[[New England Patriots]] owner [[Robert Kraft]] said of the policy, "I hope this sends a message to people in our league for how to conduct themselves. We have to be careful. People in America can't relate to overindulged athletes not acting responsibly."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

===Criticism===
{{cquote|''I hope it doesn't backfire. What happens if a coach, GM or owner gets a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]? Then what? What if an ex-NFL player throws himself through a window in [[Miami]]? That still reflects on the NFL's image.''&lt;br&gt;- [[Keyshawn Johnson]], former NFL wide receiver, and current NFL broadcaster.}}

Many considered the suspensions on Jones and Henry to be too harsh, especially Jones', which was enforced despite Jones having not been convicted of any crime. {{Who|date=December 2009}} Criticism was also drawn at the commissioner's ability to punish the rest of the player's team and revoke draft picks.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Goodell's actions are also leaving the league vulnerable to legal action from player's lawyers.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

When New England Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and his staff were [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|accused of illegally videotaping]] the [[New York Jets]]' defensive playcalling signals in September 2007, Belichick was not suspended, but instead fined $500,000. The team was penalized a [[2008 NFL Draft|first round draft pick in 2008]] as they qualified for the playoffs with a perfect 16–0 record, but would have been penalized with a second and third round pick had they failed to make the playoffs. (The Patriots still ended up with the [[New Orleans Saints]]' first-round pick in a trade, selecting [[Jerod Mayo]] with the pick.) The move was heavily criticized as being a [[double standard]].&lt;ref name="impression"/&gt; Although the videotaping is not considered to violate personal conduct rules, NFL players, including [[Cincinnati Bengals]] quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] were critical of Commissioner Goodell's move.&lt;ref name="impression"&gt;Covitz, Randy. [http://www.kansascity.com/sports/story/281362.html NFL gives impression of double standard with Belichick treatment] ''Kansas City Star'', September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Goodell penalized Belichick, he determined that the use of the camera during the Patriots’ season-opening 38-14 win over the New York Jets had no impact on the game.&lt;ref name="impression" /&gt;

[[Image:Hippopotamus-polka-early1850s.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Hippopotamus [[Polka]] sheet-music cover]]
'''Obaysch''' (1849? – 11 March 1878) was the first [[hippopotamus]] seen in [[Great Britain]] since [[prehistory|prehistoric times]], and the first in [[Europe]] since [[Ancient Rome]]. He was captured on an island on the [[White Nile]] when he was less than one year old. His name is derived from the name of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1052585465|title=Obaysch: a hippopotamus in Victorian London|last=Simons|first=John|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2019|isbn=9781743325865|location=Sydney|pages=|oclc=1052585465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Viceroy]] of [[Egypt]], [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas]] [[Pasha]], agreed with the British [[Consul General]], Sir [[Charles Murray (author and diplomat)|Charles Murray]] (later known as "Hippopotamus Murray") to swap Obaysch and some other exotic animals for some [[greyhound]]s and [[deerhound]]s.  Obaysch was sent by boat down the Nile to [[Cairo]], accompanied by a herd of [[cow]]s to provide him with [[milk]]. He was sent by [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] [[steamboat|steamer]] to [[Southampton]], and he arrived at [[London Zoo]] on 25 May 1850. He was an instant sensation in [[London]], attracting up to 10,000 visitors each day, and spawning a trade in hippo memorabilia and even a [[Hippopotamus Polka]] (by L. St. Mars&lt;ref name="levy_185."&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Hippopotamus Polka |last=St. Mars |first=L. |work=Levy Music Collection |date=n.d. |access-date=28 August 2018 |url= https://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/collection/185/006 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The number of visitors to the Zoo in 1850 was double the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107064727/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/famous-animals,98,AR.html |title=Famous Animals at the Zoological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas Pasha]] sent a second hippo to London, a female named Adhela who arrived on 22 July 1854.  After a wait of over 16 years, the pair finally produced offspring in 1871, but the calf died after 2 days. A second calf died the following year, but a third, born on 5 November 1872, survived.

==Description==
The Peripatidae exhibit a range of derivative features. They are longer, on average, than the [[Peripatopsidae]] and also have more leg pairs, numbering between 22 and 43—the gonopore is always between the penultimate pair. There are no oviparous species—the overwhelming majority are viviparous. The females of many viviparous species develop a placenta with which to provide the growing embryo with nutrients.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Distribution==
The Peripatidae are restricted to the tropical and subtropical zones; in particular, they inhabit [[Central America]], northern [[South America]], [[Gabon]], [[Northeast India]], and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliveira|first1=I.

{{Love sidebar|cultural}}
'''''Philia''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-grc|[[:wikt:φιλία|φιλία]]}}), often translated "'''brotherly love'''", is one of the four ancient [[Greek words for love]]: ''philia'', ''[[storge]]'', ''[[agape]]'' and ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]''. In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', philia is usually translated as "[[friendship]]" or [[affection]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Liddell and Scott]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfili%2Fa φιλία]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete opposite is called a [[phobia]].

== Aristotle's view ==
As Gerard Hughes points out, in Books VIII and IX Aristotle gives examples of philia including:
:"young lovers (1156b2), lifelong friends (1156b12), cities with one another (1157a26), political or business contacts (1158a28), parents and children (1158b20), fellow-voyagers and fellow-soldiers (1159b28), members of the same religious society (1160a19), or of the same tribe (1161b14), a cobbler and the person who buys from him (1163b35)."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
All of these different relationships involve getting on well with someone, though Aristotle at times implies that something more like actual liking is required. When he is talking about the character or disposition that falls between obsequiousness or flattery on the one hand and surliness or quarrelsomeness on the other, he says that this state:
:"has no name, but it would seem to be most like [philia]; for the character of the person in the intermediate state is just what we mean in speaking of a decent friend, except that the friend is also fond of us." (1126b21)
This passage indicates also that, though broad, the notion of philia must be mutual, and thus excludes relationships with inanimate objects, though philia with animals, such as pets, is allowed for (see 1155b27&amp;ndash;31).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle defines the activity involved in philia (τὸ φιλεῖν) as:
:"wanting for someone what one thinks good, for his sake and not for one's own, and being inclined, so far as one can, to do such things for him" (1380b36&amp;ndash;1381a2)
John M. Cooper argues that this indicates:
:"that the central idea of φιλíα is that of doing well by someone for his own sake, out of concern for ''him'' (and not, or not merely, out of concern for oneself). [... Thus] the different forms of φιλíα [as listed above] could be viewed just as different contexts and circumstances in which this kind of mutual well-doing can arise"&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle takes philia to be both necessary as a means to happiness ("no one would choose to live without friends even if he had all the other goods" [1155a5&amp;ndash;6]) and noble or fine (καλόν) in itself.

==Types==

Aristotle divides friendships into three types, based on the motive for forming them: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure and friendships of the good.

Friendships of utility are relationships formed without regard to the other person at all. Buying merchandise, for example, may require meeting another person but usually needs only a very shallow relationship between the buyer and seller. In modern English, people in such a relationship would not even be called friends, but acquaintances (if they even remembered each other afterwards). The only reason these people are communicating is in order to buy or sell things, which is not a bad thing, but as soon as that motivation is gone, so goes the relationship between the two people unless another motivation is found. Complaints and quarrels generally only arise in this type of friendship.

At the next level, friendships of pleasure are based on pure delight in the company of other people. People who drink together or share a hobby may have such friendships. However, these friends may also part—in this case if they no longer enjoy the shared activity, or can no longer participate in it together.

Friendships of the good are ones where both friends enjoy each other's characters. As long as both friends keep similar characters, the relationship will endure since the motive behind it is care for the friend. This is the highest level of philia, and in modern English might be called true friendship.

:"Now it is possible for bad people as well [as good] to be friends to each other for pleasure or utility, for decent people to be friends to base people, and for someone with neither character to be a friend to someone with any character.  Clearly, however, only good people can be friends to each other because of the other person himself; for bad people find no enjoyment in one another if they get no benefit." (1157a18&amp;ndash;21)

Not all bonds of philia involves reciprocity Aristotle notes. Some examples of these might include love of father to son, elder to younger or ruler to subject. Generally though, the bonds of philia are symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Happiness: Personhood, Community, Purpose
By Pedro Alexis Tabensky, Published by [[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7546-0734-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0734-2}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;

If philia is a type of love, [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued that it must be defined so as not to contradict love.  Oord defines philia as an intentional response to promote well-being when cooperating with or befriending others. And his philia is not only that meaning. The philia also gives humans authentic friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Visions_of_Agape_Intro.pdf "Introduction - Perspectives on Love and Agapé: Contemporary Views on Love"] by Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-sufficiency==
Aristotle recognizes that there is an apparent conflict between what he says about ''philia'' and what he says elsewhere (and what is widely held at the time) about the self-sufficient nature of the fulfilled life:
:"it is said that the blessedly happy and self-sufficient people have no need of friends.  For they already have [all] the goods, and hence, being self-sufficient, need nothing added." (1169b4&amp;ndash;6)
He offers various answers.  The first is based on the inherent goodness of acting for and being concerned for others ("the excellent person labours for his friends and for his native country, and will die for them if he must" [1169a19&amp;ndash;20]); thus, being a wholly virtuous and fulfilled person necessarily involves having others for whom one is concerned&amp;mdash;without them, one's life is incomplete:
:"the solitary person's life is hard, since it is not easy for him to be continuously active all by himself; but in relation to others and in their company it is easier." (1170a6&amp;ndash;8)

Aristotle's second answer is: "good people's life together allows the cultivation of virtue" (1170a12).  Finally, he argues that one's friend is "another oneself," and so the pleasure that the virtuous person gets from his own life is also found in the life of another virtuous person.  "Anyone who is to be happy, then, must have excellent friends" (1170b19).

==Altruism and egoism==
For Aristotle, in order to feel the highest form of philia for another, one must feel it for oneself; the object of philia is, after all, "another oneself."  This alone does not commit Aristotle to egoism, of course.  Not only is self-love not incompatible with love of others, but Aristotle is careful to distinguish the sort of self-love that is condemned (ascribed to "those who award the biggest share in money, honours, and bodily pleasures to themselves.  For these are the goods desired and eagerly pursued by the many on the assumption that they are best" [1168b17&amp;ndash;19]) from that which should be admired (ascribed to one who "is always eager above all to perform just or temperate actions or any other actions in accord with the virtues, and in general always gains for himself what is fine [noble, good]" [1168b25&amp;ndash;27]).  In fact:
:"the good person must be a self-lover, since he will both help himself and benefit others by performing fine actions.  But the vicious person must not love himself, since he will harm both himself and his neighbours by following his base feelings." (1169a12&amp;ndash;15)

Aristotle also holds, though, that, as Hughes puts it: "[t]he only ultimately justifiable reason for doing anything is that acting in that way will contribute to a fulfilled life."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp 173&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus acts of ''philia'' might seem to be essentially egoistic, performed apparently to help others, but in fact intended to increase the agent's happiness.  This, however, confuses the nature of the action with its motivation; the good person doesn't perform an action to help a friend because it will give her fulfillment; she performs it in order to help the friend, and in performing it makes both her friend and herself happy.  The action is thus good both in itself and for the effect it has on the agent's happiness.&lt;ref&gt;See Hughes, pp 175&amp;ndash;176.  For an alternative view, see Kraut, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
The crash happened at around 07:30 on the morning of Friday, 23 October 2015 at a bend on Departmental Road 17 not far south of Puisseguin.&lt;ref name=BBCNews /&gt; Authorities said they believed the lorry, carrying logs, lost control on a bend and [[Jackknifing|jackknifed]] into the coach's path.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both vehicles burst into flames as a result of the collision.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/10/23/une-collision-entre-un-camion-et-un-car-fait-42-morts-en-gironde_4795380_1653578.html Report on crash in ''Le Monde'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the fire and consequent loss of life was that the truck had installed on a large aluminum gasoline tank carrying fuel for chainsaws and other logging equipment which ruptured in the crash. Afterwards, gasoline streamed down the hill under the bus, where accident sparks ignited it, and the fire traveled back to the truck. 

The bus was equipped with emergency escape hammers with which to break windows, but passengers were not aware of them or not instructed in their use, and several passengers had  mobility issues.

==Casualties==
Forty-one of the dead were on the bus, with the other two being the driver of the lorry and his three-year-old son. Most of the dead on the bus were elderly people who had just set off from the nearby town of [[Petit-Palais-et-Cornemps]],&lt;ref name=BBCNews /&gt; and belonged to that town's seniors' club.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;

== Rules ==

According to the [[French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau|BEA-TT]], the different applicable rules/standards for road vehicles such as autocar, to address fire concerns, are defined at different scales, to let those vehicles work and operate in various countries: United Nations, European Union, and France. Some European directives have been withdrawal.&lt;ref name="rapport_beatt_2015-014."/&gt;

According to [[Elisabeth Borne]], France submitted the [[French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau|BEA-TT]] report to United Nations on 11 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobilicites.com/011-6547-Puisseguin-l-ONU-va-plancher-sur-l-evolution-de-la-securite-des-autocars.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramu III''' (known as "'''Ramu'''," and later renamed "'''Winston'''") was an [[Orca]]  ("killer [[whale]]") who resided at the now-defunct [[Windsor Safari Park]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Berkshire]], [[England]] between 1970 and 1976, and later, at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California|California]] between 1976 and 1986.  An adult male, Ramu (actually Ramu III) was caught on August 8, 1970, after his pod of eighty orcas was 'corralled' in Penn Cove, near [[Coupeville, Washington]], [[United States|USA]] (six others were also caught, while four died and the remaining 69 escaped).  At capture, Ramu was 13.32&amp;nbsp;ft (4.06 m) long and a member of the [[Southern Resident Killer Whales]]' L-pod. It is assumed his family members still survive in the [[Salish Sea]] and in nearby [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal waters.

==Windsor Safari Park==
Ramu was then transferred to Windsor Safari Park,&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/chart1.html|title=Known captures of orca for worldwide aquaria|work=A Whale of a Business|publisher=PBS|date=November 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he became the star attraction in the park's Sea World exhibition, (not to be confused with the American [[SeaWorld]], where he would later move) splashing people with the beating of his tail against the water, along with a small number of [[dolphin]]s, with whom Ramu cohabited.  Over the next six years, Ramu matured into a bull Orca and began to outgrow the relatively small tank at the safari park.  In October 1976, Ramu was sold to SeaWorld San Diego in a swap that saw two female Orcas (named Winnie and Hoi Wai) move in the other direction. To avoid confusion with another Orca named Ramu that already lived at Seaworld San Diego, Ramu was renamed Winston,&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; although he inevitably performed under the stage name [[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]], (used for most performing whales at SeaWorld, after [[Shamu|the first whale kept there]].)

==SeaWorld San Diego==
As a fully grown male, Winston now dwarfed even his pool mates, his size distinguishing him almost as much as his [[dorsal fin]], which flopped over to his left hand side and made him instantly recognizable to visitors to the park. He courted and mated with several females at the park, impregnating Kandu V, Kenau and Katina.  Katina was the first to give birth, on September 26, 1985, to a healthy young female Orca named [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]] (the first of the 'Baby Shamu' generation of whale calves).  In January 1986, both Kenau and [[Kandu V]] lost their babies, Kenau's dying of a [[heart defect]] 11 days after birth and Kandu's being [[stillbirth|stillborn]].

Winston was not a failure by any means though. Kalina was the first calf conceived and born in captivity successfully, and the success ushered in a generation of numerous Orca births in captivity around the world. Kalina's mother Katina is still alive at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]], along with Kalina's own calves, Keet, (the first 'grandbaby' Shamu), Keto, Tuar and Skyla, as well as a stillbirth in 1997. In 2004, Keet had his first offspring, a female called Kalia, the first great grandbaby Shamu, making Winston a great grandfather. In 2005, Keet sired Halyn, his second offspring thus making Winston a great grandfather again. Sadly, Kalina died in October 4, 2010, from septicemia, at 25 years old.

Winston died on April 28, 1986 of chronic [[cardiovascular]] failure.  At the time of his last health checkup, Winston had been 7.4 metres long and weighed 5,443&amp;nbsp;kg.  His age at death has been estimated as between 15 and 20 years of age.

'''Suspensors''' are [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures found in certain [[fungi]] and [[plant]]s.


==Fungi==
In fungi, suspensors are filamentous structural formations having the function of holding a [[zygospore]] between two [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of [[hyphae]].

==Plants==
In plants, suspensors are found in [[zygote]]s in [[angiosperm]]s, connecting the [[endosperm]] to an [[embryo]]. Usually in [[Dicotyledon|dicots]] the suspensor cells divide transversally a few times to form a filamentous suspensor of 6-10 cells. The suspensor helps in pushing the embryo into the endosperm. The first cell of the suspensor towards the micropylar end becomes swollen and functions as a [[haustorium]]. The haustorium has wall ingrowths similar to those of a [[transfer cell]]. The last of the suspensors at the end of the embryo is known as [[hypophysis (plant embryogenesis)|hypophysis]]. Hypophysis later gives rise to the [[radicle]] and root cap. During embryo development in angiosperm seeds, normal development involves asymmetrical division of the unicellular embryo, inducing polarity. The smaller terminal cell divides to become the proembryo while the larger basal cell divides laterally to form the suspensor. The suspensor is analogous to a placental mammalian's [[umbilical cord]].

'''Time Aware LSTM''' ('''T-LSTM''') is a [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) unit capable of handling irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. T-LSTM was developed by researchers from [[Michigan State University]], [[IBM Research]], and [[Cornell University]] and was first presented in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/patient-subtyping-via-time-aware-lstm-networks|title=Patient Subtyping via Time-Aware LSTM Networks|first=KDD|last=Organizers|website=www.kdd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Experiments using real and synthetic data proved that T-LSTM auto-encoder outperformed widely used frameworks including LSTM and MF1-LSTM auto-encoders.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''Tuanku Abbas''' was a Malayan pirate active in the 1840s and the brother of a [[raja]]h of [[Aceh]]. He was well known for sponsoring and leading pirate raids, the most notable of which occurred in 1843 when he captured an Indian Crew and plundered their ship. After the incident the crew escaped and appealed to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] authorities who, the following year, burned Abbas' village to the ground.&lt;ref name="pirates!"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUGJVMEqRkMC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;ots=ajIA-BE4k6&amp;dq=Jacobszoon+Lucifer&amp;sig=bulFPnY_ndR71mA3adb-tYA1OzE|title=Pirates!: Brigands, Buccaneers, and Privateers in Fact, Fiction, and Legend|accessdate=2007-05-09|last=Rogoziński|first=Jan|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80722-X|year=1995|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vach nacht''' 
({{Lang|yi|וואך-נאכט}}, '''vacht nacht''' or '''vakhnakht''', lit: "watch night" in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]) is the night before the [[brit milah]] ("circumcision") of a male Jewish child, when he is in need of added spiritual protection. A standard "vach nacht" custom, practised by many [[Ashkenazi Jews]], is to have children come and recite the [[Shema Yisrael]] and other verses from the [[Torah]] near the baby. In [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic communities]] a celebratory meal is held. In many [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] communities, the corresponding ceremony is called '''Brit Yitzchak''' ("covenant of [[Isaac]]".)

==Origins==
As described in ''Edut L'Yisrael: Sheiruta di'Tzlota'' (a text on customs surrounding weddings and births in Judaism, published in Israel c. 1960), the current practice appears to be a combination of two distinct customs.

Firstly, as stressed in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources, the night before the circumcision is considered a spiritually dangerous time for the baby; as such, the father would gather ten men to conduct a vigil to study Torah to protect him from metaphysical damage. Thus, this night is given the Yiddish name, "night of watching [or 'guarding']".

Secondly, non-Kabbalistic sources describe a practice several centuries old, that on the Friday night before the [[bris milah]], a [[melamed]] would take his preschool-age students to say Shema near the baby, and afterwards receive candy (or their equivalent at that point in history, namely [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s or [[dried fruit]]).

'''''Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way''''' (also known as '''''Westward Ho''''') is a {{convert|20|x|30|ft|m|adj=on}} painted [[mural]] displayed behind the western staircase of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chamber in the [[United States Capitol|United States Capitol Building]]. The mural was painted by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]] in 1861 and symbolizes [[Manifest Destiny]], the belief that the United States was destined for Western exploration and expansion originating from the initial colonies along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic seaboard]] to the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific Ocean]]. A study measuring {{convert|33+1/4|x|43+3/8|in|cm|1}} hangs in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The darkness turning into light represents the greatness that was believed to lie in the future West.

== Content ==
Leutze combined pioneer men and women, mountain guides, wagons, and mules to suggest a divinely ordained pilgrimage to the Promised Land of the western frontier. Within the left half of the picture is a depiction of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay, the [[Golden Gate]], which is being pointed to by the pilgrim seated atop the rock in the foreground. Within the right hemisphere of the painting is a depiction of a valley, representing the Valley of Darkness and symbolic of the troubles faced by explorers. The imagery is familiar imperial iconography and is regarded as a symbol of [[American exceptionalism]] and the realization of [[Manifest Destiny]], ultimately leading to the evolution of the American Empire.

== Literary reference ==

The painting takes its inspiration from the closing lines of [[George Berkeley]]'s ''Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America:

&lt;poem&gt;
Westward the course of empire takes its way; 
The first four Acts already past, 
A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; 
Time's noblest offspring is the last.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Influences ==
The imagery of the pilgrim gesturing on a high rock is very similar to the 5 cent [[postage stamp]], ''[[John C. Frémont|Fremont]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]]'' that was part of the 1898 [[Trans-Mississippi Issue]], and reprinted a century later.

A [[Currier and Ives]] print from 1868 uses the same title and theme for a very different print, showing a [[railroad]] crossing a new settlement as the train goes west.

A [[:File:'Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way' Laying Track 600 Miles West of St. Louis, Missouri, October 19, 1867.jpg|photographic print]] and a [https://www.kshs.org/km/items/view/153 stereograph] by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]], both of an 1867 end-of-track frontier construction train, were titled "Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way".

== In popular culture ==

[[David Foster Wallace]] named one of his short stories "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" in his 1989 collection ''[[Girl with Curious Hair]]''.

Early revisions of the 1995 computer game ''[[Oregon Trail II]]'' depict the study version of this painting on the title screen.

'''Yuri's Night''' is an international celebration held every April 12 to commemorate milestones in space exploration.

Yuri's Night is named for the first human to launch into space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], who flew the [[Vostok 1]] spaceship on April 12, 1961. The launch of  [[STS-1]], the first [[Space Shuttle]] mission, is also honored, as it was launched 20 years to the day of Vostok 1 on April 12, 1981. In 2011, Yuri's Night was celebrated at over 567 events in 75 countries on 7 continents.
&lt;ref name="Yuri's Night - World Space Party"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yuri’s Night Event Data |url=https://yurisnight.net/data/ |accessdate=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuri's Night is often called the "World Space Party".&lt;ref name=ynguardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Darwin’s Day to Yuri’s Night: some science dates to remember |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/20/festive-science-dates |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-20 |accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==

The goal of Yuri's Night is to increase public interest in [[space exploration]] and to inspire a new generation of explorers. Driven by space-inspired artistic expression and culminating in a worldwide network of annual celebrations and educational events, Yuri's Night creates a global community of young people committed to shaping the future of space exploration while developing responsible leaders and innovators with a global perspective. These global events are a showcase for elements of culture that embrace space including music, dance, fashion, and art.&lt;ref name="AIAA"&gt;Ryan Kobrick, R. Brice Russ, and Timothy Bailey (2011).

==History of Yuri's Night==

Yuri's Night was created in 2000 by [[Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides]], [[George T. Whitesides]] and Trish Garner. The first Yuri's Night was held on April 12, 2001, exactly 40 years after the launch of [[Vostok 1]].&lt;ref name=wired20110214/&gt; Since 1962, April 12 has been celebrated in [[Russia]] (formerly the [[Soviet Union]]) as [[Cosmonautics Day]] ({{lang-ru|День Космонавтики}})&lt;ref name="32FZ"&gt;{{Cite Russian law

He and his family were displaced from their native [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] during the [[Second Congo War]] that began in 1998.&lt;ref name="mwekassa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/5/2/5675474/mwekassa-i-come-from-a-land-of-war|title=Zack Mwekassa: 'I come from a land of war'|publisher=bloodyelbow.com |author=John Joe O'Regan|date=2014-05-02|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Boxing===
Mwekassa began his professional boxing career at the age of 22 in 2006 in [[South Africa]].  In the first 2 years of his career, he amassed an undefeated streak of 8-0 with all but one of the wins coming by way of TKO or KO.  He experienced his first losses back-to-back in 2008 and 2009, before going on another 5-0 undefeated streak.

===Kickboxing===
Mwekassa began training in [[South Africa]] in 2003 with elite kickboxers, including the late [[Mike Bernardo]].&lt;ref name="mwekassa" /&gt; His trainers intended him for the [[K-1]] circuit but the opportunities were scarce, so he moved into professional boxing in 2006.

In 2014, Mwekassa resurrected his interest in kickboxing.  He saw [[Glory (kickboxing)|GLORY]] on television&lt;ref name="mwekassa" /&gt; and approached the company about fighting for them.  He soon found himself scheduled to face popular MMA and kickboxing fighter [[Pat Barry (fighter)|Pat Barry]] at [[Glory 16: Denver]].&lt;ref name="mwekassa" /&gt; In what many considered a shocking upset, he knocked out Barry with an incredible uppercut in the first round.

Mwekassa returned to the Glory ring on November 7, 2014 at [[Glory 18: Oklahoma]].  He was part of a four-man, one-night tournament to decide the next Light Heavyweight title contender.  Mwekassa started in impressive fashion as he knocked out Brian Collette in the semifinals.  In the finals, he faced [[Saulo Cavalari]].  After a competitive back-and-forth two rounds, Mwekassa lost in the third round due to a head kick.

Mwekassa had a rematch with Cavalari for the vacant Glory Light Heavyweight Championship at [[Bellator MMA &amp; Glory: Dynamite 1]] on September 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmamania.com/2015/7/30/9074967/bellator-142-dynamite-fight-card-zack-mwekassa-vs-saulo-cavalari-rematch-glory-lkickboxing|title=Bellator 142: 'Dynamite' fight card gets Zack Mwekassa vs Saulo Cavalari rematch for vacant GLORY light heavyweight title|publisher=mmamania.com|author=Michael Stets|date=2015-07-30|accessdate=2015-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost the fight via unanimous decision.
