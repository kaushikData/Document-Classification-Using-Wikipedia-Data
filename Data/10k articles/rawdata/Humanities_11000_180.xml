'''''Asia Overland''''' by [[Mark Elliott (British author)|Mark Elliott]] and Wil Klass was an idiosyncratic book of the 1990s which developed a minor [[cult following]] amongst backpackers in [[Asia]] and the [[former Soviet Union]]. Although it has been out of print since 2002, the book remains a talking point amongst older travellers. Its unique feature was that practical information was displayed in a set of schematic 'treasure maps'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1873756100 Amazon.ca: Asia Overland: Books: Mark Elliott, Wil Klass&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than in run-on text, a style later replicated in certain other books by [[Trailblazer (travel)|Trailblazer]],.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1873756674 Amazon.com: Trailblazer South East Asia: The Graphic Guide: Books: Mark Elliott&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/customer-reviews/1873756674 Amazon.co.uk: Reviews for South-East Asia (Trailblazer): Books: Mark Elliott&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between maps, the book's writing offered a way to inspire questions and investigation more than providing answers in the style of more classic [[Lonely Planet]] style guides. The guide gained a certain notoriety by explaining 'tricks' for crossing ex-Soviet borders semi-legally, for reaching Iraqi Kurdistan when that area was still little known to exist, and for getting into North Korea without a visa. Today these tips appear extremely foolhardy but at the time the book was written (largely pre-Internet) they worked and caused much excitement amongst travellers of the era. Despite considerable interest from the public, there has been no follow-up edition and at times second-hand copies of the original edition have been offered at relatively exorbitant prices on Amazon and e-Bay.

==Trivia==
The book contains several hidden in-jokes including 'towns' on maps named after friends of the authors (Bakus, Danigrad etc.).

''Asia Overland'' was the first practical guide book in English to cover the ex-Soviet Caucasus region after the breakup of the USSR.

{{Paranormal}}
The '''Bell Witch''' or '''Bell Witch Haunting''' is a legend from Southern American [[Folklore of the United States|folklore]], centered on the 19th-century Bell family of northwest [[Robertson County, Tennessee]]. [[John Bell (farmer)|John Bell Sr.]], who made his living as a farmer, resided with his family along the [[Red River (Cumberland River)|Red River]] in an area currently near the town of [[Adams, Tennessee|Adams]]. According to legend, from 1817-1821, his family and the local area came under attack by a mostly invisible entity that was able to speak, affect the physical environment, and [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]]. Some accounts record the spirit also to have been [[clairvoyant]] and capable of crossing long distances with superhuman speed (and/or of [[Bilocation|being in more than one place at a time]]).

In 1894, newspaper editor Martin V. Ingram published his ''Authenticated History of the Bell Witch''. The book is widely regarded as the first full-length record of the legend and a primary source for subsequent treatments. The individuals recorded in the work were known historical personalities. In modern times, some skeptics have regarded Ingram's efforts as a work of historical fiction or fraud. Other researchers consider Ingram's work a nascent [[Folkloristics|folklore study]] and an accurate reflection of belief in the region during the 19th century.

While not a fundamental element of the original recorded legend, the [[Bell Witch Cave]] in the 20th century became a source of continuing interest, belief, and generation of lore. Contemporary artistic interpretations such as in film and music have expanded the reach of the legend beyond the regional confines of the [[Southern United States]].

==Legend Synopsis==

[[File:Bellhome.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An artist's sketching of the Bell home, originally published in 1894]]

In his book ''An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch'', author Martin Van Buren Ingram published that the poltergeist's name was Kate, after the entity claimed at one point to be "Old Kate Batts' witch," and continued to respond favorably to the name.&lt;ref name="blackdog"/&gt;  The physical activity centered on the Bells' youngest daughter, Betsy, and her father, and 'Kate' expressed particular displeasure when Betsy became engaged to a local named Joshua Gardner.&lt;ref name="FeeWebb2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher R. Fee|author2=Jeffrey B. Webb|title=American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore (3 Volumes)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXnEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|date=31 August 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-568-8|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haunting began sometime in 1817 when John Bell witnessed the apparition of a strange creature resembling a dog. Bell fired at the animal but it disappeared. John's son Drew Bell approached an unknown bird perched on a fence that flew off and was of "extraordinary size." The daughter Betsy observed a girl in green dress swinging from the limb of an oak tree. Dean, a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] of the Bell family, reported being followed by a large black dog on evenings he visited his wife. Activity moved to the Bell household with knocking heard along the door and walls. The family heard sounds of gnawing on the beds, invisible dogs fighting, and chains along the floor. About this time John Bell began experiencing [[paralysis]] in his mouth.&lt;ref name="chapter2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 2|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030307101405/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_2.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomena grew in intensity as sheets were pulled from beds when the children slept. Soon the entity pulled hair and scratched the children with particular emphasis on Betsy who was slapped, pinched and stuck with pins.&lt;ref name="Brown2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Brown|title=Haunted Tennessee: Ghosts and Strange Phenomena of the Volunteer State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSLiFwJzOH4C&amp;pg=PA72|date=26 February 2009|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-4648-9|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bells turned to a family friend James Johnston for help. After retiring for the evening at the Bell home, Johnston was awakened that night by the same phenomena. That morning he told John Bell it was a "spirit, just like in the [[Bible]]." Soon word of the haunting spread with some traveling great distances to see the witch.&lt;ref name="MoranSceurman2009" /&gt; The apparition began to speak out loud and was asked, "Who are you and what do you want?" and the voice answered feebly, "I am a spirit; I was once very happy but have been disturbed."&lt;ref name="chapter8part1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 8, Part 1|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_8.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030315025348/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_8.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=30 June 2018|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit offered diverse explanations of why it had appeared, tying its origin to the disturbance of a Native American [[Mound Builders|burial mound]] located on the property, and sent Drew Bell and Bennett Porter on a unproductive search for buried treasure.&lt;ref name="chapter8part2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 8, Part 2|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_8_-_part_2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030315030041/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_8_-_part_2.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=30 June 2018|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of full conversations, the spirit repeated word for word two sermons given 13 miles apart at the same time.&lt;ref name="MoranSceurman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Moran|author2=Mark Sceurman|title=Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXtBIvwPN84C&amp;pg=PA254|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-6688-6|pages=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entity was well acquainted with Biblical text and appeared to enjoy religious arguments. As another amusement, the witch shared [[gossip]] about activities in other households, and at times appeared to leave for brief moments to visit homes after an inquiry.&lt;ref name="chapter8part2" /&gt;

John Johnston, a son of James, devised a test for the witch, something no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina would say to the slaves if she thought they did something wrong. The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, "Hut tut, what has happened now?" In another account, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family that the entity had visited his family in England. He apologized for his skepticism.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pat Fitzhugh|title=The Bell Witch: The Full Account|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgH7CGgFdzgC&amp;pg=PA57|date=1 October 2000|publisher=The Armand Press|isbn=978-0-9705156-0-5|pages=57, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, the spirit displayed a form of kindness, especially towards Lucy, John Bell's wife, "the most perfect woman to walk to earth." The witch would give Lucy fresh fruit and sing hymns to her, and showed John Bell Jr. a measure of respect.&lt;ref name="Price1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Edwin Price|title=The Infamous Bell Witch of Tennessee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plBlDoPkDFMC&amp;pg=PA38|date=January 1994|publisher=The Overmountain Press|isbn=978-1-57072-008-6|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to John Bell Sr. as "Old Jack," the witch claimed she intended to kill him and signaled this intention through curses, threats and afflictions. The story climaxes with the Bell patriarch being [[Poisoning|poisoned]] by the witch. Afterward the entity interrupted the mourners by singing [[drinking song]]s.&lt;ref name="tngovstory"&gt;{{cite web|title=TSLA::"Tennessee Myths and Legends"|url=http://share.tn.gov/tsla/exhibits/myth/bellwitch.htm|website=share.tn.gov|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, as a result of the witch's entreatment, Betsy Bell called off her engagement to Joshua Gardner. Subsequently, the entity told the family it was going to leave, but return in seven years in 1828. The witch returned on time to Lucy and her sons Richard and Joel with similar activities as before, but they chose not to encourage it, and the witch appeared to leave again.&lt;ref name="mcclure"&gt;{{cite book|title=McClure's Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSAAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114|year=1922|publisher=S.S. McClure, Limited|pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several accounts say that during his military career, [[Andrew Jackson]] was intrigued with the story and his men were frightened away after traveling to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=James|title=Ghosts of the Bluegrass|year=2009|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=94|author2=Macy Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an independent oral tradition recorded in the vicinity of [[Panola County, Mississippi]], the witch was the ghost of an unpleasant overseer John Bell murdered in [[North Carolina]]. In this tradition, the spirit falls in love with the central character 'Mary', leading to her death. This account is reminiscent of [[vampire]] lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=Arthur Palmer|title=The Bell Witch of Tennessee and Mississippi: A folk legend|date=January–March 1934|publisher=The Journal of American Forklore|pages=45–63|author2=Pete Kyle McCarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[supernatural]] powers attributed to the Tennessee spirit have also been compared to that of [[jinn]] in mythology.&lt;ref name="GuileyImbrogno2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosemary Ellen Guiley|author2=Philip J.

In the manuscript attributed to [[Richard Williams Bell]], he wrote that the spirit remained a mystery:

{{quote|text=Whether it was witchery, such as afflicted people in past centuries and the darker ages, whether some gifted fiend of hellish nature, practicing sorcery for selfish enjoyment, or some more modern science akin to that of [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]], or some [[hobgoblin]] native to the wilds of the country, or a disembodied soul shut out from heaven, or an evil spirit like those Paul drove out of the man [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|into the swine]], setting them mad; or a [[demon]] let loose from hell, I am unable to decide; nor has any one yet divined its nature or cause for appearing, and I trust this description of the monster in all forms and shapes, and of many tongues, will lead experts who may come with a wiser generation, to a correct conclusion and satisfactory explanation.&lt;ref name="chapter8part6"/&gt;|author=Williams Bell |source=''An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch: Chapter 8''}}

==Early written sources==

===''The Saturday Evening Post''===

[[File:Betsy.jpg|right|thumb|upright=.75|An artist's drawing of Betsy Bell, originally published in 1894]]

The publications ''New England Farmer'' of [[Boston]] and the ''Green Mountain Freeman'' of [[Vermont]] in January and February 1856 published an article regarding the Bell Witch legend and the publications ascribed the origin of the text to the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name=farmerarticle /&gt;&lt;ref name="freemanarticle" /&gt; The ''Farmer'' was a weekly agricultural journal.&lt;ref name="LoCFarmer"&gt;{{cite web|title=New England farmer.|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn85038272/|website=The Library of Congress|accessdate=20 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Freeman'' was affiliated with the abolitionist [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]].&lt;ref name="Hemenway1882"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abby Maria Hemenway|author2=Eliakim Persons Walton|title=The History of the Town of Montpelier, Including that of the Town of East Montpelier, for the First One Hundred and Two Years ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYoQ5EssbR0C&amp;pg=PA312|series=Vermont Historical Gazetteer|volume=4|year=1882|publisher=Vermont Watchman and State Journal Press|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unidentified author described the apparition as the 'Tennessee Ghost' or 'Bell Ghost,' and stated the event occurred 30 years or more from the time the article was written. There are three human characters in the account, Mr. Bell, his daughter Betsey Bell, and Joshua Gardner. The author stated that the voice, which spoke freely about the house from all directions, would not manifest itself until the lights were extinguished at night. The phenomenon attracted wide interest. The author claimed to have become well acquainted with Mr. Gardner. When the ghost was asked how long it would remain, it replied, "until Joshua Gardner and Betsey Bell get married." The author goes on to state that Betsey Bell had fallen in love with Joshua Gardner and had discovered the skill of '[[ventriloquism]]'. The author states that Ms. Bell then used her skill to attempt to convince Joshua Gardner to marry her. When they did not marry, the apparition disappeared.&lt;ref name=farmerarticle&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tennessee Ghost|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20235068/new_england_farmer/|newspaper=New England Farmer|date=January 26, 1856|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate =May 20, 2018|issue=Volume 11, Number 4 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freemanarticle"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tennessee Ghost|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023209/1856-02-07/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=1 December 2016|work=Green Mountain Freeman|issue=Volume 13, Number 7|date=February 7, 1856|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. V. Ingram, in his ''An Authenticated History Of The Bell Witch'', wrote that a ''Saturday Evening Post'' article regarding the Bell Witch had been retracted:

{{quote|text=About 1849 the ''Saturday Evening Post'', published either at Philadelphia or New York, printed a long sketch of the Bell Witch phenomenon, written by a reporter who made a strenuous effort in the details to connect her with the authorship of the demonstrations. Mrs. Powell was so outraged by the publication that she engaged a lawyer to institute suit for [[Defamation|libel]]. The matter, however, was settled without litigation, the paper retracting the charges, explaining how this version of the story had gained credence, and the fact that at the time the demonstrations commenced Betsy Bell had scarcely advanced from the stage of childhood and was too young to have been capable of originating and practicing so great a deception. The fact also that after this report had gained circulation, she had submitted to any and every test that the wits of detectives could invent to prove the theory, and all the stratagems employed, served only to demonstrate her innocence and utter ignorance of the agency of the so-called witchery, and was herself the greatest sufferer from the affliction.&lt;ref name="chapter9"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 9|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_9.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030310060450/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_9.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Martin V.

===Clinard and Burgess Trial, 1868===

In September 1868, an article was published entitled "Witchcraft and Murder: Hobgoblins and Old Gray Horses the Incentive to Crime." Tom Clinard and Dick Burgess were arrested for the murder of Mr. Smith. The article reported that Smith claimed the powers of witchcraft while working near Adam's Station, chopping wood on a farm with the defendants. The article stated that Smith claimed to use these occult powers on Clinard and Burgess, leading to the conflict between them.&lt;ref name=hobgoblin&gt;{{cite news|title=Witchcraft and Murder: Hobgoblins and Old Gray Horses the Incentive to Crime|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7660018/the_courierjournal/|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=September 21, 1868|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 30, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of the decedent was reported variously as James or Charles Smith.

Ingram published an interview with Lucinda E. Rawls, of [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], daughter of Alexander Gooch and Theny Thorn, both reported as close friends of Betsy Bell. Rawls testified that the Bell Witch was a frequent topic of conversation during her lifetime and pointed to a murder of a man for witchcraft as evidence for this claim.

Ingram appended a date of 1875 or 1876 to the bloodshed, but connected the Rawls recollection with the death of Smith:

{{quote|text=Smith came into the community a stranger, and was employed by Mr. Fletcher, where Clinard and Burgess were also engaged on the farm. Smith professed to be something of a wizard, or rather boasted of his power to hypnotize and lay spells on people, subjecting any one who came under his influence to his will, and it was reported that he claimed to have derived this power from the mantle of the Bell Witch.  However, the writer interviewed Hon. [[John Ford House|John F. House]], who was council for the defense, on the subject, who says that no such evidence was produced in the trial, but that the lawyers handled the Bell Witch affair for all that it was worth in the defense of their clients, presenting the analogy or similarity of circumstances with good effect on the jury.&lt;ref name="chapter12"/&gt;|author=Martin V. Ingram |source=''An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch: Chapter 12''}}

===Haunted House, 1880===

On April 24, 1880 an article was published regarding a '[[haunted house]]' in [[Springfield, Tennessee]] where knocking underneath the floor was heard. The fourth night of knockings began at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and ended at 4 a.m. with the home surrounded by 10-12 persons working in an effort to discover the origin of the sound.&lt;ref name=springfieldghost&gt;{{cite news|title=A Real Ghost Story: Springfield Terribly Excited Over Mysterious Manifestations|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20900489/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=April 27, 1880|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 12, 2018 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up report from April 26, 1880, the writer reported that several hundred people had visited the home attempting to witness the phenomenon with many camped out over night despite the home owners asking them to leave.&lt;ref name=springfieldghost2 /&gt; On Wednesday night, April 28, 1880, the family were reported to have left the home for the night and a smaller group of investigators around the home heard knocking from fifty yards away.&lt;ref name=springfieldghost3&gt;{{cite news|title=The Springfield Spook Sensation|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22107816/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=April 30, 1880|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 22, 2018 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the events, the journalist took the opportunity to mention the Bell Witch legend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is an actual fact that several hundred intelligent people of Springfield and vicinity have been so excited over the noise as to go night after night to listen to it ... About thirty years ago Robertson county had a sensation similar to this known as the "Bell Witch," and people came from all parts of the country, even as far as New York, to hear or see her.&lt;ref name=springfieldghost2&gt;{{cite news|title=Springfield's Ghost|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7564477/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=April 28, 1880|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 28, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Springfield floor knocking occurred at the residence of John W. Nuckolls, a prominent physician. Nuckolls was recently married to Laura Hopkins Jones, a union opposed by her family. The phenomenon created a domestic disturbance between the couple, as a local carpenter, Gill Walling, accused Laura Nuckolls of creating the noise with an iron ball attached to a rubber belt hidden under her clothes. [[Robertson County, Tennessee|Robertson County]] historian Yolanda Reid states, "they came to the conclusion that the wife was tying it into the bottom of her skirt to make the sounds, nobody ever proved it."&lt;ref name="nuckollsmurder"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Highland |first1=Deborah |title=Local Legends and Halloween Lore|work=[[The Tennessean]] |date=October 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated in May, 1880. That August, John Nuckolls retrieved his infant child from his wife, running through town with his estranged wife following in anguish. Afterward the child was returned to Laura Nuckolls who was living with her father, Asa Hopkins. John Nuckolls, in February 1882, confronted Laura's father, over his desire to see the child, and threatened his father-in-law's life. During the argument, the subject of 'ghosts' between the men was reported by an eyewitness as Nuckolls attempted to shoot Hopkins but was restrained.&lt;ref name=springfieldhomicide&gt;{{cite news|title=The Springfield Homicide|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20904512/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=July 1, 1882|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 12, 2018 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, as a result of this confrontation, Nuckoll's brother-in-law, S. B. Hopkins, traveled from Nashville and shot John W. Nuckolls with a [[double-barreled shotgun]], causing his death. The circumstances of the shooting were contested and S. B. Hopkins was acquitted of murder.&lt;ref name="goodspeed" /&gt;

The journal ''Studies in Philology'', in 1919, published a study of witchcraft in North Carolina by folklorist [[Tom Peete Cross]]. Cross cites a column from the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' where it mentions the paper had sent a reporter to Robertson County in the 1880s, John C. Cooke, to investigate reports of the possible reemergence of the Bell Witch phenomenon.&lt;ref name="cookemention"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Peete Cross|title=Studies in Philology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m65JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA240|year=1919|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nashville Centennial Exposition===

[[File:Johnsdeath.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The death of John Bell, December, 1820. Illustration first published in 1894.]]

A several page account of the Bell Witch legend was included in a sketch of Robertson County and was reportedly written for Nashville's Centennial Exposition in 1880. The sketch was published in 1900 by the Tennessee Historical Society. The author of the sketch is unknown and the article is undated. Dates in the sketch end at 1880. The writer stated the source of the first portion of the narrative from "F. R. Miles, William Pride, W. J. Gooch, Ben. B. Batts, and many others." The author identified the burial disturbance as skull bones previously located in a "mound nearby on the river bluff." The return of the remains did not placate the spirit. The witch could speak in several languages and would "set the dogs" on unsuspecting victims. In the Centennial account, the Bell entity did not explicitly poison John Bell.&lt;ref name="centennial" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At one time a vial of poison was found in the flue of the chimney, and being taken down, Dr. George B. Hopson gave one drop to a cat, causing its death in seven seconds. The witch claimed to have put the poison there for the purpose of killing Mr. Bell. Being asked how it was going to administer the poison, it said by pouring it into the dinner pot. It is remarkable that, although he enjoyed good health up to the time of this event, Mr. Bell died within [ ] days after the vial was found, being in a stupor at the time of his death. From this time the people visited the house less frequently, although the witch would now and then be heard.&lt;ref name="centennial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duggan|first1=W. L.|title=Sketches of Sevier and Robertson Counties|journal=The American Historical Magazine|date=1 January 1900|volume=5|issue=4|pages=310–25|jstor=42657394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Ingram account, attributed to Richard Williams Bell, John Bell was already suffering from an unknown affliction and bedridden for some time. John Bell's son, John Bell Jr., found the vial in the cupboard after his father did not wake. The family called for Dr. Hopson, while the Bell Witch exclaimed she had fed the poison to John Bell.  Alex Gunn and John Bell Jr. tested the poison on the cat with a straw, which "died very quick." John Bell died the next day on December 20, 1820.&lt;ref name="chapter8part6"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch:Chapter 8, Part 6|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_8_-_part_6.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030117142245/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_8_-_part_6.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 January 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centennial sketch stated the witch could appear as a rabbit, bear or [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]], and [[Imitation|imitate]] various [[List of animal sounds|animal sounds]]. The sketch described the entity as one of seven spirits with three names given by the author: Three Waters, Tynaperty, and Black Dog.&lt;ref name="centennial"/&gt; The Ingram account also described a family of spirits. In addition to Kate, the other members of the 'witch family' had the names of Blackdog, Mathematics, Cypocryphy, and Jerusalem. Blackdog was described as the apparent leader of the group.&lt;ref name="blackdog"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 8, Part 3|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_8_-_part_3.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030319085639/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_8_-_part_3.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=1894|publisher=Phil Norfleet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goodspeed's ''History of Tennessee''===

Goodspeed Brothers' 1886 ''History of Tennessee'', recorded a short account of the legend that identified the spirit as female and stated that interest in the phenomenon was widespread in the region at the time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A remarkable occurrence, which attracted wide-spread interest, was connected with the family of John Bell, who settled near what is now Adams Station about 1804. So great was the excitement that people came from hundreds of miles around to witness the manifestations of what was popularly known as the "Bell Witch." This witch was supposed to be some spiritual being having the voice and attributes of a woman. It was invisible to the eye, yet it would hold conversation and even shake hands with certain individuals. The freaks it performed were wonderful, and seemingly designed to annoy the family. It would take the sugar from the bowls, spill the milk, take the quilts from the beds, slap and pinch the children, and then laugh at the discomfiture of its victims. At first it was supposed to be a good spirit, but its subsequent acts, together with the curses with which it supplemented its remarks, proved the contrary. A volume might be written concerning the performances of this wonderful being, as they are now described by contemporaries and their descendants. That all this actually occurred will not be disputed, nor will a rational explanation be attempted. It is merely introduced as an example of superstition, strong in the minds of all but a few in those times, and not yet wholly extinct.&lt;ref name="goodspeed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Goodspeed's History of Tennessee: The History of Robertson County|date=1886|publisher=The Goodspeed Publishing Co.|location=Nashville TN|page=828|url=http://www.tngenweb.org/goodspeed/robertson/history.html|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Accounts from 1890===

[[File:The Tennessean Tue Jan 28 1890.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Nashville Obituary for Joel Egbert Bell (1813-1890). Bell was the youngest and last surviving child of John and Lucy Bell Sr.]]

An article was published February 3, 1890 describing a series of events from Adam's Station, Tennessee. At dusk, January 27, 1890, Mr. Hollaway reported watching two unknown women arrive at his home and dismount from their horses as he was feeding cattle. When he arrived at the house, the horses and women were gone. Mr. Hollaway's wife reported seeing the women in the yard as well. That week, Mr. Rowland attempted to place a sack of corn on his horse's back and it fell off. He again attempted to place the sack of corn on the horse's back several more times, but each time the sack fell off. Joe Johnson arrived and held on to the sack as Mr. Rowland mounted his horse. They witnessed the sack floating away for 20 yards where it settled down at the fence. When the men went to retrieve the sack, a voice was heard, "You won't touch this sack anymore."&lt;ref name=weird1890&gt;{{cite news|title=A Rural Fake: A Mulhattanism from Adam's Station Creating Some Excitement|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11990352/the_tennessean|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=February 3, 1890|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate =June 28, 2017 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow up report was published on February 18, 1890 with the title, "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles.&lt;ref name="mulhattan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoaxes of Joseph Mulhattan|url=http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/joseph_mulhattan/|website=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=29 November 2016|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was republished a few days later with the subtitle "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.&lt;ref name="weirdwitch2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdwitch" /&gt;

Mr. Winters reported taking a peculiar bird while hunting with great difficulty. After he returned home, he opened the game-bag to discover the bird had disappeared and in place was a rabbit which then also disappeared. While burning vegetation outdoors, Mr. Rowland described a visit at 9 p.m. of a half clothed black man with one eye in his forehead that directed Mr. Rowland to follow him and dig at a large rock. The figure then disappeared. Mr. Rowland dug that night until exhaustion. He received help the next morning from Bill Burgess and Mr. Johnson and discovered something described as a "kettle turned bottom upward." They were unable to remove it as the soil began moving back into the hole faster than the men could remove the soil. The report concludes saying that many people were visiting to see the witch.&lt;ref name=weirdwitch2&gt;{{cite news|title=A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Fishy Flavor from Adam's Station, TN|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7632073/the_courierjournal/|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=February 21, 1890|page=6|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 28, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weirdwitch&gt;{{cite news|title=A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7643024/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean|The Daily American]]|date=February 18, 1890|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 28, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martin Van Buren Ingram==

===Biography===

Born near [[Guthrie, Kentucky]], June 20, 1832, Martin Van Buren Ingram took over responsibility of the family farm at the age of 17. A member of Hawkins' Nashville Battalion during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was discharged for disability after the [[Battle of Shiloh]].&lt;ref name="bioquestion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Drop Stitches|work=The Nashville Tennessean|issue=Vol. 16, No. 41|date=July 20, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ingram began his editing and publishing career in April 1866 with the ''Robertson Register'' with no previous experience. October 1868, Ingram moved the paper to Clarksville and began issuing the ''Clarksville Tobacco Leaf'' in February 1869.&lt;ref name="ingramlife"/&gt; Ingram continued an ownership association with the ''Leaf'' until about 1881. The consequences of poor health, family tragedy and fire limited his continuing interest in the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name=IngramObituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Veteran Journalist Dies in Clarksville|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7675496/the_tennessean/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=October 6, 1909|page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=December 1, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of Ingram's death in October 1909, editor of the ''Clarksville Leaf Chronicle'', W. W. Barksdale, wrote of his friend and colleague:

{{quote|text=We doubt exceedingly if there ever lived a man who performed as much self-sacrificing labor to further the interests of the community in which he lived.  He became a citizen of Clarksville forty years ago and from that time practically until the day of his death his greatest concern was the advancement and welfare of his adopted town and county ... A man of true mold, he despised all deceit, trickery, and littleness, and with a courage which nothing could daunt, he laid on the journalistic lash unsparingly whenever he thought the occasion required. Naturally, his was not a pathway strewn with roses – his was an aggressive nature, a fact which often brought him into serious collision with those with whom he took issue. Time, however, usually justified him in the positions which he assumed.&lt;ref name="ingramlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Van Buren Ingram|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/martin_van_buren_ingram.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029091205/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/martin_van_buren_ingram.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2014|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|publisher=Phil Norfleet|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=W.

J. Allen Bell expressed the belief that his father's manuscript was written when he was 35 years old in 1846. He stated his father gave him the manuscript and family notes shortly before his death in 1857. Richard Williams Bell was roughly 6 to 10 years of age during the initial manifestations of the Bell Witch phenomenon and 17 at the occurrence of the spirit's return in 1828. The reported contributions of Richard Williams Bell, approximately 90 pages in length, are recorded in Chapter 8 of Ingram's work, entitled ''Our Family Trouble''.&lt;ref name="ourfamilytrouble"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 8, Our Family Trouble|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_81.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030310060152/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_81.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2003|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|publisher=Phil Norfleet|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] no one has ever seen this diary, and there is no evidence that it ever existed: "Conveniently, every person with firsthand knowledge of the Bell Witch hauntings was already dead when Ingram started his book; in fact, every person with secondhand knowledge was even dead."  Dunning also concluded that Ingram was guilty of falsifying another statement, that the ''Saturday Evening Post'' had published a story in 1849 accusing the Bells' daughter Elizabeth of creating the witch, an article which was not found at the time.&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4118|number=118|title=Demystifying the Bell Witch|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Nickell]] argues the chapter includes the use of [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] themes and [[anachronism]] which impacts credibility.&lt;ref name="nickell2015"/&gt; Jim Brooks, native of Adams, writes in his work ''Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard,'' that Bell family descendants report that Ingram did not return the manuscript to the family. Brooks explores the possibility that Ingram would have had an enhanced opportunity to modify the story by not returning the papers.&lt;ref name="brookswork"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Jim|title=Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard|date=2015|publisher=McClanahan Publishing House|isbn=1934898546|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Cartwright of the [[University of North Florida]] compares Ingram's work with ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' folklore as recorded by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] and also as an expression of the psychological shame of slavery and Native American removal. The slaves in the account are regarded as experts on the witch, with Uncle Zeke identifying the witch as, "dat Injun spirit ... the Injuns was here fust, and we white fokes driv em out, all but dem whar wur dead and cudent go, an da's here yit, in der spirit." The figure of "progress" Gen. Andrew Jackson was brought nearly to heel and the master, John Bell, was dead. The role of the [[trickster]] not played by the [[Br'er Rabbit]] but the witch-rabbit, the spirit's common animal form. The displaced, blacks, widows and girls, act as witness to a force polite society cannot comprehend. The witch, "appears as a catch-all for every remainder of resistant agency."&lt;ref name="HobsonLadd2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=Keith|editor=Fred Hobson, Barbara Ladd|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Literature of the U.S. South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztPNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=19 December 2016|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-045511-8|pages=91–92|chapter=Jackson's Villes, Squares, and Frontiers of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who were alive during the haunting, Ingram conducted interviews with Ibby Gunn, born in 1806, a daughter of Uncle Zeke and the sister-in-law of Dean, as well as Mahala Byrns Darden, born circa 1807, daughter of James Byrns. Ibby Gunn shared some experiences of Dean including the creation of a [[witch ball]] made of hair by her sister Kate for her husband Dean, the use of which appeared to anger the entity.&lt;ref name="ibbysaccount"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 10|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_10.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917225902/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_10.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 September 2002|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|publisher=Phil Norfleet|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahala Darden detailed what she understood family and friends were experiencing at the time of the haunting, expressed her great fear the witch would come visit her home and also related the spirit sang drinking songs at John Bell's graveside.&lt;ref name="mahalasaccount"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 13|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_13.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021113042549/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com:80/chapter_13.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 November 2002|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|publisher=Phil Norfleet|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andrew Jackson====

The account of General Andrew Jackson's visit is confined to Chapter 11 of Ingram's work. The chapter is a letter from Thomas L. Yancey, an attorney in Clarksville, dated January 1894. Yancey explained that his grandfather, Whitmel Fort, was a witness to phenomena at the Bell homestead and Fort had related the story of Jackson's visit which was undated in the letter. Yancey described his grandfather's account as, "quite amusing to me."&lt;ref name="jacksonyancey" /&gt;

The Bell household was strained of resources from visitors and Jackson brought a wagon load of supplies with his men. Nearing the Bell homestead, the wagon stopped and appeared fastened to its position despite considerable effort by Jackson's men to free it. Jackson exclaimed, "By the eternal, boys, it is the witch." A metallic voice was heard in the vegetation, "All right General, let the wagon move on, I will see you again tonight." The horses began moving again. Instead of camping out, the party stayed at the Bell home that evening. Among the Jackson party was a 'witch layer' who boasted of his supernatural exploits. Tiring of the bravado, Jackson whispered, "By the eternals, I do wish the thing would come, I want to see him run." The entity arrived and taunted the witch layer to shoot her. The man's gun would not fire. The witch countered,  "I'll teach you a lesson," and appeared to beat the man and led him out the door by his nose. Jackson exclaimed, "By the eternal, boys, I never saw so much fun in all my life. This beats fighting the British." The witch told Jackson she would uncover another rascal the next night. That morning Jackson's men chose to leave for home as they were apprehensive as to who was next.&lt;ref name="jacksonyancey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Martin|title=An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch: Chapter 11|url=http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_11.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003225306/http://bellwitch02.tripod.com/chapter_11.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 October 2002|website=Bell Witch Folklore Center|publisher=Phil Norfleet|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paranormal investigator [[Benjamin Radford]], as well as Brian Dunning, conclude that there is no evidence that Andrew Jackson visited the Bell family home. During the years in question, Jackson's movements were well documented, and nowhere in history or his writings is there evidence of his knowledge of the Bell family. According to Dunning, "The [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 Presidential election]] was notoriously malicious, and it seems hard to believe that his opponent would have overlooked the opportunity to drag him through the mud for having lost a fight to a witch."&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Radford |title=The Bell Witch Mystery|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=January–February 2012|volume=36|issue=1|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Lindahl, affiliated with the [[University of Houston]], writes that the Andrew Jackson encounter is an example of how belief and history mix together in the formation of legend. Such legends, which may persist in a locale for generations, upon receiving a media treatment can spread far outside of the area where the legend originated.&lt;ref name="HinsonFerris2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Glenn Hinson|author2=William Ferris|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 14: Folklife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSaaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-9855-0|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend in the 20th Century==

[[File:Bell-Witch-THC-marker-tn1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tennessee Historical Commission marker along U.S. Route 41 in Adams, Tennessee.]]

A prophecy was reported by May 1903 that the witch could return on the centennial of the Bell family arrival in Tennessee.&lt;ref name="cincy1903"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Tennessee's Terrible "Bell Witch" Keep It's promise|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|issue=Volume 9, Number 130|date=May 10, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an August 1903 article from Memphis, ''The Springfield Herald'' expressed that no one in the local area was concerned with a return of the Bell Witch and made a charge of plagiarism towards the Memphis paper. The ''Herald'' also stated the copyright for Ingram's work had passed to his son Tolbert who was working at [[The Denver Times]].&lt;ref name="heraldskepsis"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bell Witch Up Again |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20247567/the_leafchronicle/|accessdate=21 May 2018|work=The Leaf-Chronicle|date=August 14, 1903|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September, the local paper was again incredulous as the spirit was not reported to have returned in August.&lt;ref name="hoptown1903"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report from ''Springfield Herald''|work=Hopkinsville Kentuckian|issue=Volume 25, Number 73|date=September 15, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Bailey Bell, a grandson of John Bell Jr., and neurologist in Nashville, published a book entitled ''The Bell Witch: A Mysterious Spirit'' in 1934. In the work, he recounted stories he stated were told to him by his great aunt Betsy later in her life. This included another account of Andrew Jackson's visit and of a boy trapped in the Bell Witch Cave and pulled out of the cave feet first by the witch. Bell also detailed a series of prophecies he stated were given to his ancestors in 1828 by the spirit, including a declaration the witch was set to return again in 1935, 107 years after her last visit to the Bell family.&lt;ref name="desmoines"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burns|first1=Charles|title=Famed 'Ghost' Due Back in '35 After 107 Year Absence|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|issue=Volume 87, Number 100|date=September 29, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, there were reports of quirky events. Louis Garrison, owner of the farm that included the Bell Witch Cave, heard unexplained noises coming from inside. Bell descendants described the sound of something rubbing against a house, a paper like object that flew out the door and reentered through a side door, and faint music heard from a piano.&lt;ref name="kate1937"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jack|title=Something Goes on at Adams; It May Be Kate, the Bell Witch|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 32, Number 154|date=August 1, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group from the local [[Epworth League]] were reported to have attended a wiener roast in a rock quarry near the Bell Witch Cave on July 29, 1937. The group were joking about the legend when they saw a figure of a woman sitting on top of the cliff over the cave causing many to flee.&lt;ref name="epworth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jack|title=Form Lately Appears on Cliff Overlooking Bell Witch Cave|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 82, Number 159|date=August 4, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newspaper, a minister in the group later claimed to have investigated and discovered it was [[moonlight]] on a rock. The second report concluded with a weather report that the moon was barely noticeable that night.&lt;ref name="rockandmoon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister's Probe Reveals Rock Leaguers Mistook for Old Kate|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 32, Number 163|date=August 6, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Brooks published in 2015 that his mother was in attendance at the roast, and relates that the minister caught up to the youth on the road to town after discovering no explanation for the figure.&lt;ref name="brookswork2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Jim|title=Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard|date=2015|publisher=McClanahan Publishing House|isbn=1934898546|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1965, an article was published involving an antique oak rocking chair said to have been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was acquired in Willett's estate sale by Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on [[U.S. Route 41|U.S. 41]]. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.&lt;ref name="rockingchair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Bill|title=Has Bell Witch Returned Home?|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 60, Number 211|date=November 28, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Charles Romaine Willett (1886-1963), son of Sarah Elizabeth Bell, began an interest in the newspaper business at the age of 16. After some time playing professional baseball and working at other newspapers, Willett became the first managing editor of the ''[[The Tennessean|Nashville Tennessean]]'' in 1907 while teaching himself law. A mayor of Adams, and member of the State legislature, Charlie Willett was known for his reliability. Every Sunday, Willett would accompany his sweetheart, Miss Jerry Cullom Gardner, for ice cream in Clarksville and dinner  at Richardson's Restaurant on the return home. According to community lore, the couple never married so as not to tempt fate as they descended from the Bell and Gardner families respectively.&lt;ref name="willettbio"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Patch |first1=Rubya |title=REMEMBER WHEN: The inimitable Charlie Willett |url=https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/communities/2014/10/26/remember-inimitable-charlie-willett/17966011/ |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=[[The Leaf-Chronicle]] |date=October 26, 2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Brooks relates that a family member detailed familial obligations as the likely explanation. Brooks inquired what the couple thought about the rumor in the early 1960s. Jerry Gardner explained if Charlie Willet ever asked her to marry him, she would assent. When Brooks related this to Charlie Willett, he immediately smiled, pulled his thumbs through his suspenders and said, "Oh, she said that, did she?"&lt;ref name="brookswillet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Jim|title=Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard|date=2015|publisher=McClanahan Publishing House|isbn=1934898546|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a time during her childhood in 1944 when she was exploring the cave. She left English class, playing 'hooky,' and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and it blew out again. Terrified, she crawled along the water path of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives in the back of the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.&lt;ref name="bonnieaccount"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCampbell|first1=Candy|title=Is the Bell Witch a Mean Spirit?|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 72, Number 205|date=October 30, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visit in 1977 was reported of five soldiers from nearby [[Fort Campbell]] to the Bell Witch Cave. One of the soldiers was sitting on a rock and expressed skepticism of the legend when something invisible grabbed him around the chest.&lt;ref name="soldiers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wick|first1=Don|title=Witch bothers, bewilders|work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|issue=Volume 33, Number 109|date=October 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, staff writer David Jarrard for ''The Tennessean'' and photographer Bill Wilson, the latter also a member of the [[National Speleological Society]], were given permission to sleep in the cave over night. While in the first cave room they heard a noise from deeper in the cave Jarrard estimated at 30 yards.  Subsequently, an "unwavering groan" repeated again with greater volume and accompanied by several loud thumps. When it began a third time, the men retreated to the gate entrance. They explored the wiring to the lights looking for a reason for the noises. They went back to the first cave room but heard a rumble near the entrance. Walking back to the entrance they discovered the rumble was noise from a jet. As they reached the gate, a loud, high pitched scream emanated from inside the cave. The journalists left and did not spend the night.&lt;ref name="stafferretreat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarrard|first1=David|title=Bell Witch Cave too much 'story' for brave staffers|work=[[The Tennessean]]|issue=Volume 81, Number 222|date=October 27, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, H. C. Sanders, owner of a nearby gas station, reported 20 years earlier he ran out of gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log to catch his breath. The rabbit hopped up on the other side of the log looked at him and said, "Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?"&lt;ref name="rabbitfollow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maines|first1=John|title=Thar's gold in them thar witch's chills|work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|issue=Volume 151, Number 180|date=October 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical evaluation==

According to Radford, the Bell Witch story is an important one for all paranormal researchers: "It shows how easily legend and myth can be mistaken for fact and real events and how easily the lines are blurred" when sources are not checked.&lt;ref name="Radford"/&gt;  Dunning wrote that there was no need to discuss the supposed paranormal activity until there was evidence that the story was true. "Vague stories indicate that there was a witch in the area. All the significant facts of the story have been falsified, and the others come from a source of dubious credibility. Since no reliable documentation of any actual events exists, there is nothing worth looking into."&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;

Dunning concludes, "I chalk up the Bell Witch as nothing more than one of many unsubstantiated folk legends, vastly embellished and popularized by an opportunistic author of historical fiction."&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt; Radford reminds readers that "the burden of proof is not on skeptics to ''disprove'' anything but rather for the proponents to prove ... claims".&lt;ref name="Radford"/&gt;

Joe Nickell has written that many of those who knew Betsy suspected her of fraud and the Bell Witch story "sounds suspiciously like an example of "the poltergeist-faking syndrome" in which someone, typically a child, causes the mischief."&lt;ref name="nickell2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=The 'Bell Witch' Poltergeist|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_bell_witch_poltergeist|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Fluker, a researcher of the Mississippi version of the legend while affiliated with the [[University of Mississippi]], has expressed the Bell Witch legend has other value. "As a historian of collective memory, it matters very little to my research if hauntings are real or not. It does matter that people believe they are. As a result, they can help us understand the perspectives, in this case, of 19th and 20th century Americans."&lt;ref name="flukerperspective"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swartzfager|first1=Megan|title=Visiting professor to deliver lecture on 'The Bell Witch of Mississippi'|url=http://thedmonline.com/professor-bell-witch-lecture/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=The Daily Mississippian|date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bell Witch in culture==

===Film===

There have been several movies based, at least in part, on the Bell Witch legend. Roger Clarke, former film critic for ''[[The Independent]]'', argues the legend has also had a measurable influence on cinema such as in the ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist]]'' film series, the found footage ''[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]'' film series, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' released in 2015, the [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] of burial ground disturbance in ''[[The Amityville Horror]]'', and the [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] of cherries to the children in ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' released in 2013.&lt;ref name="clarke2017"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Clarke |first1=Roger |title=An American Haunting: in search of Tennessee's Bell Witch |url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/fortean-times/20171201/281535111243250 |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=www.pressreader.com |publisher=[[Fortean Times]] |date=Dec 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bomboniere''' (Italian bomboniera, from the french bonbonnière,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/bonbonni%C3%A8re/10119&lt;/ref&gt; a box containing "bonbons" (candies)) also known as "favors", are gifts given by hosts to their guests on special occasions such as [[weddings]], [[baptism]], [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]. They usually include [[Jordan Almonds]], known in Italian as [[Confectionary|Confetti]].
Five sugared almonds symbolize [[health]], [[wealth]], [[happiness]], [[fertility]] and [[Longevity|long life]].

Confetti can be made in many forms using several different ingredients.

Sugared almonds are put inside a bag made of tulle or satin and tied with ribbons in assorted colors. The colour of sugared almonds is white for a wedding, [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]; pink or light-blue for birthday or Baptism of a baby girl or baby boy, respectively, red for a graduation, and silver or gold for 25 or 50 year anniversaries.

Often they are adorned with dried natural flowers or artificial flowers made of silk or paper. The bag is often given stored inside a small vessel made of silver, crystal or porcelain.

In [[Australia]] the word "bomboniere" is applied to any small gift or keepsake given by the hosts to guests at any function held to celebrate weddings, first holy communions and the like. Such gifts may take the form of a wine bottle stopper, glass vase or picture frame as well as the more traditional sugared almonds in decorative bags.&lt;ref name="website01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petitcadeau.com.au/bomboniere-handcrafted-gifts/about_us |title=About Bomboniere |last=  |first=  |work=Bomboniere |publisher= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |quote=bomboniere for your wedding, engagement, christening, baptism, holy communion, bridal shower, baby shower, kitchen tea, birthday party, anniversary or any other special occasion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Torta Bomboniera'''&lt;br&gt;
A different and new type of bomboniera is the Favor Cake or "Torta Bomboniera" as it is called in Italy.
They are made using little carton box forming one or more tier of a "cake".&lt;br&gt;Inside each box there are the sugared almonds and a card printed with the data of ceremony (names, date etc.).
On each box there are glued several types of fine objects made of many materials.

Some samples are below, for various ceremonies:

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Evolution of "Torta Bomboniera" to "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana" (Porcelain Artisan Pastries)'''&lt;br&gt;
The following type of Italian Favor Cake is an evolution of above types.&lt;br&gt;
It is made using porcelain boxes shaped and hand decorated like very real edible "bignè" or cream puff.&lt;br&gt;
Inside each box there are five sugared almonds and a card printed with data of ceremony.&lt;br&gt;
For this reasons, the name that Italians give to this new idea is "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana", that is '''Porcelain Artisan Pastries'''

'''Christian Schweigaard Stang''' (15 March 1900 – 2 July 1977) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] linguist, [[Slavic studies|Slavicist]] and [[Baltic studies|Balticist]], [[professor]] in [[Balto-Slavic languages]] at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1938 until shortly before his death. He specialized in the study of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and was highly regarded in [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Hovdhaugen|first=Even|title=Christian Schweigaard Stang|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|year=2004|volume=9|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Christian_Schweigaard_Stang/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of politician and academic [[Fredrik Stang]] (1867–1941) and his wife Caroline Schweigaard (1871–1900). He was a grandson of [[Emil Stang]] and [[Christian Homann Schweigaard]], and a nephew of [[Emil Stang, Jr.|Emil Stang, Jr]]. He grew up in Kristiania and took his [[examen artium]] 1918 at [[Frogner School]].

==Career==
He received his [[Magister (degree)|magister degree]] in comparative [[Indo-European linguistics]] in 1927, and his Ph.D. in 1929. Subsequently he was the University Fellow in comparative Indo-European linguistics for the period 1928-33. From 1938 to 1970 he was professor of Slavonic languages at the University of Oslo. He served as the [[Dean (academic)|dean]] of the Faculty of Humanities from 1958 to 1960.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Stang was recognized as the leading international expert on Slavic Language learning, on the Baltic-Slavonic comparative linguistics, as well as Lithuanian during his period of study. One of Stang's most noted works was "Vergleichende Grammatik der baltischen Sprachen" (in English "Comparative Grammar of the Baltic languages") published in 1966. In addition to his monumental comparative grammar from 1966, his work on the Baltic and Slavonic verb convincingly demonstrated the close historical connections and interrelationships among the Baltic, Slavonic languages and Germanic languages. In his work on Slavonic accents from 1952, he noted that the Slav and Baltic accent system originally had been identical and that the differences are due to later, secondary changes.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; His research on Balto-Slavic comparative accentology culminated with work ''Slavonic Accentuation'' (Oslo, 1957) which, according to [[Frederik Kortlandt|Kortlandt]], "...marked an era in the study of the subject. The importance of this book can hardly be overestimated."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kortlandt|1975|p=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stang proved in this work that
# [[de Saussure's law]] did not operate in Slavic
# the [[neoacute]] is due to a retraction of the ictus from a stressed ''[[yer|jer]]'' or from a non-initial vowel with falling intonation
# the neo-circumflex was not the result of a [[Common Slavic]] development
Furthermore, he demonstrated that
# the [[Balto-Slavic acute|acute]] is restricted to paradigms with fixed stress
# the neoacute is characteristic of paradigms where the next syllable is stressed in other forms
# the [[Balto-Slavic circumflex|circumflex]] occurs on the first syllable of paradigms with final stress in other forms
In this way Stang replaced the classical doctrine, which derived the stress pattern of a paradigm from the intonations of the root vowel and the ending, by a doctrine which derives the intonation of the root vowel, when accented, from the stress pattern of the paradigm.

Stang also published several important contributions to comparative Indo-European linguistics.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; His contributions include [[Stang's law]], a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European phonology|phonological]] [[Phonological rule|rule]] which was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction | author=Benjamin W. Fortson | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-4051-0316-7 | page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Studies in West Slavic and Baltic linguistics| author= A. A. Barentsen and R. Sprenger | publisher= Rodopi | year=1991 | isbn=978-90-5183-246-4 | page=366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
He was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1932, as well as the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and the [[Royal Swedish Society of Sciences]] in [[Uppsala]]. He was praeces and vice praeces (the position alternates) of the former organization between 1964 and 1971. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1970. He died in July 1977 in [[Kirkenes]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

{{2018 Winter Olympics}}
This is a chronological summary of the major events of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County]], [[South Korea]]. Two events, the [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed doubles tournament|curling mixed doubles tournament]] and the [[Ski jumping at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's normal hill individual|men's normal hill ski jumping competition]], held their preliminary rounds on 8 February. The [[2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] took place one day later on 9 February. The last day of competition and the [[2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] was on 25 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/schedule | title=PyeongChang 2018 Schedule | website=pyeongchang2018.com | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games featured 102 events in 15 sports, making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Four new disciplines in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic programme in Pyeongchang, including [[Snowboarding#Big air|big air]] snowboarding, [[mixed curling#Mixed doubles|mixed doubles curling]], [[mass start]] [[speed skating]], and mixed team [[alpine skiing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-sports/33056128|title=Winter Olympics: Big air, mixed curling among new 2018 events|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Unified Korea]] women's ice hockey team competed under a separate IOC country code designation (COR); in all other sports, there was a separate [[North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics|North Korea team]] and a separate [[South Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics|South Korea team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27914">In U.S. education, '''deeper learning''' is a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions. Deeper learning is based on the premise that the nature of work, civic, and everyday life is changing and therefore increasingly requires that formal education provides young people with mastery of skills like [[analytic reasoning]], complex [[problem solving]], and [[teamwork]]. 

Deeper learning is associated with a growing movement in [[Education in the United States|U.S. education]] that places special emphasis on the ability to apply knowledge to real-world circumstances and to solve novel problems.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martinez|first1=Monica|last2=McGrath|first2=Dennis|title=Deeper Learning: How Eight Innovative Public Schools Are Transforming Education in the Twenty-First Century|date=2014|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59558-959-0|pages=1–21|url=http://thenewpress.com/books/deeper-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Deeper learning" was first introduced by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]] in 2010{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and specified a set of educational outcomes-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deeper Learning Defined|url=http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/documents/Deeper_Learning_Defined__April_2013.pdf|website=Hewlett Foundation|publisher=Hewlett Foundation|accessdate=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mastery of rigorous academic content
* Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills
* The ability to work collaboratively
* Effective oral and written communication
* Learning how to learn
* Developing and maintaining an academic mindset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindsetworks.com/go/academic-mindsets/ |title= academic mindset |publisher=Mindset Works |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of U.S. schools and school districts serving a broad socio-economic spectrum apply deeper learning as an integral component of their instructional approach.&lt;ref name="Mehta &amp; Fine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehta|first1=Jal|last2=Fine|first2=Sarah|title=The Elusive Quest for Deeper Learning|journal=Harvard Education Letter|date=July–August 2014|volume=30|issue=4|url=http://hepg.org/hel-home/issues/30_4/helarticle/the-elusive-quest-for-deeper-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While the term "deeper learning" is relatively new, the notion of enabling students to develop skills that empower them to apply learning and to adapt to and thrive in [[post-secondary education]] as well as [[career]] and life is not. A number of significant antecedents to deeper learning exist.

For example, American [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and [[education reform|educational reformer]] [[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) made a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. Like modern proponents of deeper learning, Dewey believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the [[curriculum]], and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning. Dewey's arguments undergirded the movements of [[progressive education]] and [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist education]], which called for teaching and learning beyond [[Rote learning|rote content knowledge]].

In the 1990s, skills-based education saw a resurgence with the advent of the "[[21st century skills|21st Century Skills]]" movements and the "Partnership for 21st Century skills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.p21.org/about-us/our-history |title=About us |publisher=Partnership for 21st Century |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] of the [[National Academies]] issued ''Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferrable Knowledge and Skill in the 21st Century,'' a report on deeper learning re-elevating the issue and summarizing research evidence on its outcomes to date.&lt;ref name="Pellegrino &amp; Hilton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellegrino|first1=James W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Margaret L.|title=Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferrable Knowledge and Skill in the 21st Century|date=2012|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were followed by a multi-collection series of major voices (e.g. Ken Kay, Linda Darling Hammond, Yong Zhao, James Pellegrino and others) in the Leading Edge publications ''Rethinking Student Learning'' and ''Deeper Learning: Beyond 21st Century Skills''.  In addition, Solution Tree published ''How to Teach Thinking in the Common Core'' and ''Enriched Learning Projects'' by James Bellanca.  Teacher College Press also published "how to" books to help teachers with deeper learning instruction.  Included in these are Reuven Feuerstein's ''Beyond Smarter'' and James Bellanca's ''Focus Factor'' and ''Classrooms without Borders''.

==Skills and competencies==
According to labor economists Frank Levy of [[MIT]] and Richard Murnane of [[Harvard University|Harvard’s Graduate School of Education]], since 1970, with the economic changes brought about by technology and [[globalization]], employers’ demands for workers with routine, repetitive skills—whether manual or cognitive—have dropped steeply, while demand for those with deeper learning competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has soared.&lt;ref name="Murnane &amp; Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murnane|first1=Richard J.|last2=Levy|first2=Frank|title=Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy|date=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy and Murnane argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the "foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have."&lt;ref name="Levy &amp; Murnane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Frank|last2=Murnane|first2=Richard|title=Dancing with Robots: Human Skills for Computerized Work|publisher=Third Way|url=http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Cassel and Kolstad found that by the year 2000 the top skills demanded by U.S. [[Fortune 500]] companies had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Cassel &amp; Kolstad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassel|first1=R.N.|last2=Kolstad|first2=R.|title=The critical job-skills requirements for the 21st century: Living and working with people|journal=Journal of Instructional Psychology|date=1998|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[Conference Board]] survey of some 400 employers revealed that key deeper learning competencies were the most important for new entrants into the workforce. Essential capabilities included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving. The [[Conference Board]] findings indicate that "applied skills on all educational levels trump basic knowledge and skills, such as Reading Comprehension and Mathematics&amp;nbsp;... while the ‘three Rs’ are still fundamental to any new workforce entrant’s ability to do the job, employers emphasize that applied skills like Teamwork/Collaboration and Critical Thinking are ‘very important’ to success at work."&lt;ref name="Conference Board"&gt;{{cite book|title=Are They Ready to Work? Employers' Perspectives on the Basic Knowledge and Applied Skills of New Entrants to the 21st Century U.S. Workforce|date=2006|publisher=Partnership for 21st Century Skills|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/FINAL_REPORT_PDF09-29-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 a coalition of national business community, education leaders, and policymakers founded the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or P21), a [[non-profit]] organization.  P21's goal is to foster a national conversation on "the importance of 21st century skills for all students" and "position 21st century readiness at the center of US K-12 education".  The organization has released reports exploring how to integrate the Four Cs approach into learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p21.org/about-us/our-history P21 Our History]. Retrieved 2016-03-05&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research and publications included an identification of deeper learning competencies and skills they called the [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] (collaboration, communication, critical thinking, creativity).  In a 2012 survey conducted by the [[American Management Association]] (AMA), executives found a need for highly skilled employees to keep up with the fast pace of change in business and to compete on a global level.  The survey identified three of the "Four Cs" ([[critical thinking]], communication and collaboration) as the top three skills necessary for these employees.&lt;ref name="Critical Skills Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Critical Skills Survey|date=2012|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|url=http://playbook.amanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-Critical-Skills-Survey-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructional reforms==
Deeper learning practitioners have developed a number instructional reform methods and built a variety of classroom, school, and district models. While stressing robust content mastery, instructors ask students to "move beyond basic comprehension and algorithmic procedures and engage in skills that lie at the top of traditional learning taxonomies—analysis, synthesis, and creation," according to Harvard education scholars Jal Mehta and Sarah Fine.&lt;ref name="Mehta &amp; Fine, Teaching differently"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehta|first1=Jal|last2=Fine|first2=Sarah|title=Teaching differently&amp;nbsp;... Learning deeply|journal=Kappan Magazine|date=2012|volume=94|issue=2|pages=31–35|url=http://www.myboe.org/cognoti/content/file/resources/documents/82/82c7708a/82c7708a4655db2ef23ed0529db9c5bd057e5cae/HighTechHighMehtaandFinePDK20121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Students are treated as active meaning makers with the capacity to do interesting and valuable work now&amp;nbsp;... the purpose of school is not so much to prepare students for a hypothetical future as to support them in engaging with the complex challenges that professional work at its best entails."
&lt;br /&gt;
In its 2012 report ''Education for Life and Work'', the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] identified the following research-based methods for developing deeper learning:&lt;ref name="Pellegrino &amp; Hilton" /&gt;
* Use multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks
* Encourage elaboration, questioning, and self-explanation
* Engage learners in challenging tasks, with supportive guidance and feedback
* Teach with examples and cases
* Prime student motivation
* Use formative assessment

Deeper examination of what "best practices" evidence shows connect teaching methods to the development of the Partnership for 21st Century Learning's 4C framework&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p21.org/framework&lt;/ref&gt; and the competencies identified in the Hewlett model for deeper learning,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hewlett.org/education/deeper learning&lt;/ref&gt; give a sharper picture of "what works" in terms of instructional strategies and tools. For instance, the Marzano Lab has identified the high effects of cooperative learning to develop collaboration, graphic organizers to advance critical thinking, feedback to sharpen communication, advance organizers to enrich entry activities in PBLs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marzanoresearch.com/instructional strategies&lt;/ref&gt; John Hattie's meta-analysis of visible learning is even more specific. Strategies that promote metacognition, reflection, student feedback, creativity, inquiry and more support the type of teaching that most enriches mindful, deeper learning. In addition, his studies detail how surface teaching strategies such as lectures, worksheets, overly frequent testing and others do little for achievement or deeper learning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treasury/gov.nz/publications//hattie&lt;/ref&gt; For young learners, the Center for Childhood Creativity has identified the powerful role of creative thinking in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://centerforchildhoodcreativity.org&lt;/ref&gt;

While evidence supporting the direct impact of education organized around deeper learning outcomes in driving academic achievement is not robust to date, it continues to build. P21 is leading an effort at the University of Connecticut to remedy this.  As early as 2008 a study of seven hundred California students demonstrated that students exposed to math instruction designed to develop deeper learning competencies significantly outperformed peers taught through more traditional methods.&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt;

==Network of schools==
A number of educational reform school networks across the country focus on developing deeper learning competencies.&lt;ref name=Rothman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothman|first1=Robert|title=Diving into Deeper Learning: Schools gear up to promote thinking skills|journal=Harvard Education Letter|date=March–April 2013|volume=29|issue=2|url=http://hepg.org/hel-home/issues/29_2/helarticle/diving-into-deeper-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; While committed to deeper learning educational outcomes, these networks, however, vary in their instructional models and approaches to school design. They include: [[Asia Society|Asia Society International Studies Schools Network]], Big Picture Learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigpicture.org/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher= Big Picture Learning |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ConnectEd California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connectedcalifornia.org/about |title= About us |publisher= ConnectEd California |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EdVisions Schools]], [[Envision Schools|Envision Education]], Expeditionary Learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elschools.org/about-us |title= About us |publisher= Expeditionary Learning |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Tech High, Internationals Network for Public Schools, New Tech Network, New Visions for Public Schools. A 2014 trade book by educational consultant Monica Martinez highlights features of Deeper Learning schools.&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt;

Because of limits imposed by state and federal laws, public school districts face the largest challenges to bring deeper learning back into their schools. The Partnership for 21st Century Learning (&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p21.org/exemplars&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the identification of exemplar schools which were relying on inclusion of 21st Century Skills as a base component for bringing deeper learning experiences to all children. Some of these exemplar schools come from the reform networks, but many are schools and districts that targeted deeper learning instruction and outcomes as their mission but without the benefits in money, public relations and compliance given to charter schools.

To further advance the notion, P21 created a Blogazine to "connect the dots between 21st Century skills and deeper learning outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p21.org/our-work/p21blog&lt;/ref&gt; The blog articles are written pro bono by major educational writers who advocate for the paradigm shift to Deeper Learning as well as by a balance of school leaders, teachers, professional learning specialists and others who are incorporating deeper learning practices into their curricula, instruction, assessment and system change plans. In its second year, the no-fee online P21 Blogazine expanded into a three times weekly online journal as a major voice of deeper learning theory and practice. Its aim was to seed understanding of the principles and picture the best practices occurring in innovative schools and classrooms.

It expanded its distribution by partnering with major 21st Century learning organizations such as Connected Educator's Month, chapters of ASCD, school districts and many P21 sponsors.It introduced a self-directed professional learning option for educators who are interested in reading, discussing and putting action plans garnered from P21 posts into classrooms.

As more schools, especially public schools, began to plan to integrate deeper learning, a group of Illinois advocates, aligned with P21, searched for assistance to scale best 21st Century teaching practices into classrooms. Already successful exemplars in the US and abroad were relying on versions of project based learning (problem-based, inquiry-based, product-making, project- based);&lt;ref name="Bellanca Enriched"/&gt; there was great variation in effectiveness. After reviewing models from multiple sources, the Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools determined none were adequate for systemic integration into schools or systems. The consortium team, made up of volunteer, long experienced professional developers, classroom teachers, administrators and school change specialists, all with experience in ''public'' school reform, adapted and redesigned the most effective PBL models and designed a new school-wide approach of PBL that included explicit instruction and assessment of the 4CS as advocated by the Partnership, technology, reflection and a 5th C, cultural responsiveness. These elements were integrated into a PBL design cycle, called MindQuest21. Creative making was balanced with critical thinking to allow for teachers to challenge the narrow framework of the standards which ignored the creative C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc21.org/MindQuest21&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting cost-effective, grass roots model intentionally targeted deeper learning outcomes with carefully selected deeper learning methods. It was piloted in an urban school with a large English Language Learning population, a suburban affluent district with four schools and a suburban, but economically and racially changing district, all using limited but existing funds.

At the same time that site administrators and teachers participated in a year-long, twice monthly interaction with the ''MindQuest21'' team, that same team interacted with district administrators to change systemwide practices to those ways of leading that would readily support the new focus on deeper learning practices and outcomes. What emerged was a scalable and sustainable model for changing the school and district systems so that the systems, including teacher evaluation, would support new approaches to teaching and learning in ''every'' classroom and a multi-faceted system of evaluation would show significant deeper learning (including standardized test content) gains for students, their schools and the district. It would also show to any visitor that a different way of teaching and learning existed as the norm in every classroom, engaging students every moment of the day in deeper learning processes aimed at explicit deeper learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc21.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The MindQuest21 approach was not an isolated example. As the P21 Exemplar identification program showed, more and more schools, often acting alone, sometimes in concert with other schools in a district, were shifting the learning paradigm from surface learning pushed by NCLB recall tests to deeper learning stimulated by entrepreneurial administrators and teachers. In a like manner, creative teachers who were able to defy the punishment threats of NCLB, did the same.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p21.org/blogazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
The majority of tests used in the current U.S. school system focus mainly on achievement of content knowledge and rely heavily on [[multiple-choice]] items, measuring primarily low-level knowledge and some basic skills.&lt;ref name="Darling-Hammond &amp; Adamson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darling-Hammond|first1=Linda|last2=Adamson|first2=Frank|title=Developing Assessments of Deeper Learning: The Costs and Benefits of Using Tests that Help Students Learn|date=2013|publisher=Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education|location=Stanford, CA|page=i|url=https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/developing-assessments-deeper-learning-costs-and-benefits-using-tests-help-students-learn_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[RAND Corporation]] found that, in the 17 states studied, fewer than 2% of [[mathematics]] items and only about 20% of [[English language|English language arts]] (ELA) items on state tests ask students to analyze, synthesize, compare, critique, investigate, prove, or explain their ideas.&lt;ref name="Darling-Hammond &amp; Adamson" /&gt;

However, two federally funded multi-state assessment consortia—the [[Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers]] (PARCC) and the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smarterbalanced.org |title=About |publisher=Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; —were formed to develop next-generation assessment tools, to be launched in 2014–15. Research conducted by UCLA's [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST)|CRESST]] show marked increases in the amount of higher-order skills to be assessed as measured by the Depth of Knowledge scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ode.state.or.us/teachlearn/subjects/socialscience/standards/depthofknowledgechart.pdf |title=Depth of Knowledge scale |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612020209/http://www.ode.state.or.us/teachlearn/subjects/socialscience/standards/depthofknowledgechart.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Innovation Lab Network (ILN) of states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsso.org/What_We_Do/Innovation_Lab_Network.html |title=Innovation Lab Network |publisher=[[Council of Chief State School Officers]] |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinated by the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]], convenes a smaller, informal consortium of ten states to develop strategies to create and deploy even more intellectually ambitious assessments. The performance assessments under development by participating states includes tasks that require students to analyze, critique, evaluate, and apply knowledge. The new tests also intend to encourage instruction aimed at helping students acquire and use knowledge in more complex ways.&lt;ref name="Darling-Hammond &amp; Adamson" /&gt;

In September 2014, a report was released by the [[American Institutes for Research]] on a three-year, quasi-experimental comparison of traditional and Deeper Learning schools. The research findings demonstrated the following improved student outcomes: students attending deeper learning network schools benefited from greater opportunities to engage in deeper learning and reported higher levels of academic engagement, motivation to learn, self-efficacy, and collaboration skills; students had higher state standardized assessment scores regardless of student background; students scored higher on PISA-based Test for Schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-basedtestforschools.htm |title=PISA-based Test for Schools |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) |accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on measures of core content knowledge and complex problem-solving skills; students graduated on time at statistically significantly higher rates (9 percent); and after graduation students were more likely to attend four-year colleges and enroll in more selective institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air.org/resource/evidence-deeper-learning-outcomes |title=Evidence of Deeper Learning Outcomes |publisher=American Institutes for Research |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deepening Critical Thinking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellanca|first1=James|title=Deepening Critical Thinking|journal=P21 Blogazine|date=June 23, 2014|volume=1|issue=5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deeper Learning Research: The Air Study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellanca|first1=James A.|title=Critical Thinking|journal=P21 Blogazine|date=November 2014|volume=1|issue=9|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellanca Enriched"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellanca|first1=James A.|title=Enriched Learning Projects|date=2010|publisher=Solution Tree Press|location=Bloomington, In|isbn=978-1-934009-74-1|pages=223|edition=1st|url=http://www.solution-tree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellanca|first1=James A.|title=Deeper Learning: Beyond 21st Century Skills|date=2015|publisher=Solutions Tree Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-936763-35-1|pages=390|edition=1|url=http://www.solution-tree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellanca |last2=Brandt|first1=James A. |first2=Ronald|title=21st Century Skills: Rethinking How Students Learn|date=2010|publisher=Solution Tree Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-935249-90-0|pages=349|edition=1|url=http://www.solution-tree.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogū were made across all of Japan, except [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru Daijisen |title=土偶 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-07-20 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Dogū |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Dogū have been found in eastern Japan and it is rare to find one in western Japan. The purpose of the Dogū remains unknown and should not be confused with the clay [[haniwa]] funerary objects of the [[Kofun period]] (250 &amp;ndash; 538).&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Jōmon figurines |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-07-21 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyday ceramic items from the period are called [[Jōmon pottery]].

==Origins==
Some scholars theorize the Dogū acted as [[Effigy|effigies]] of people, that manifested some kind of [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref name="kokushi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Kokushi Daijiten |title=土偶 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-07-21 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Dogū |oclc=683276033 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it may have been believed that illnesses could be transferred into the Dogū, then destroyed, clearing the illness, or any other misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 =Insolla|first1 =Timothy|title=The new hakodate jomon culture center, minamikayabe, japan|journal =[[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis (journal)]]|doi =10.2752/175183412X13346797480439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Dogū are made of [[clay]] and are small, typically 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref name="enc" /&gt; Most of the figurines appear to be modeled as female, and have big eyes, small waists, and wide hips.&lt;ref name="d" /&gt; They are considered by many to be representative of goddesses. Many have large abdomens associated with pregnancy, suggesting that the Jomon considered them [[mother goddess]]es.&lt;ref name="enc" /&gt; According to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], these figurines "suggest an association with fertility and shamanistic rites".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The dogū tend to have large faces, small arms and hands and compact bodies. Some appear to wear [[goggle]]s or have "heart-shaped" faces. Most have marks on the face, chest and shoulders, that suggest [[tattoo]]ing and probable incision with [[bamboo]].&lt;ref&gt;Takayama (1970) "Archaeology, Ethnology &amp; Anthropology of Eurasia", p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Rubin (1988) "Marks of civilization: artistic transformations of the human body", p.111-113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo DeMello(1992) "Encyclopedia of Body Adornment", p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dogū types==

* "horned-owl type" figurine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/11828|title=上境旭台貝塚３|last=Public interest Ibaraki education foundation Foundation|first=|date=2013|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakōki-dogū==
[[Image:JomonStatue.JPG|thumb|200px|''Shakōki-dogū'' ([[:ja:遮光器土偶|遮光器土偶]]) (1000–400 BCE), "goggle-eyed type" figurine. [[Tokyo National Museum]], [[Japan]].]]

The {{nihongo|''Shakōki-dogū''|遮光器土偶}}, or "goggle-eyed dogū," were created in the Jōmon era, and are so well known that when most Japanese hear the term ''dogū'', this is the image that comes to mind. The name "shakōki" (literally "light-blocking device") comes from the resemblance of the figures' eyes to traditional [[Inuit snow goggles]]. Another distinguishing feature of the objects are the exaggerated, feminine buttocks, chest and thighs.&lt;ref name="nakajima"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakajima | first1 = Toshio | year = 1943 | script-title=ja:石器時代土偶の乳房及び下腹部膨隆に就いて |trans-title=On the Breasts and Swollen Hips of Stone Age Dōgu  | journal =Jinruigaku Zasshi | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 294–295 | location = Tōkyō | publisher = Tōkyō Jinrui Gakkai | language = Japanese | format = PDF | accessdate = July 21, 2012 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase1911/58/7/58_7_287/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the abdomen is covered with patterns, many of which seem to have been painted with [[vermilion]]. The larger figures are hollow, presumably in order to prevent cracking during the [[Pottery#Firing|firing]] process.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008 |reason= Who has said this and where?}}

Unbroken figures are rare, and most are missing an arm, leg or other body part. In many cases, the parts have been cut off. One theory is that parts of the figures may have been cut off in fertility rituals{{Citation needed|date=July 2008 |reason= Whose theory is this?}}.

These types of dogū have been found in the Kamegaoka Site in [[Tsugaru, Aomori|Tsugaru]], [[Aomori Prefecture]]; the Teshiromori Site in [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]], [[Iwate Prefecture]]; the Ebisuda Site in [[Tajiri, Miyagi|Tajiri]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]]; and the Izumisawa Kaizuka Site in [[Ishinomaki, Miyagi|Ishinomaki]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]]. All the sites listed have been designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].

==Pseudoarchaeology==
{{See|Out-of-place artifact}}
Due in part to the enigmatic nature of the figurines, there have been numerous theories of non-scientific nature regarding their ornate appearance with some speculating that the physical appearance is connected to the suits and equipment of modern-day astronauts. One proponent in particular, [[Erich von Däniken]], has written how the dogū (referred in the text as the "Japanese statue of Tokomai") "...has modern fastenings and eye apertures on its helmet",&lt;ref&gt;von Däniken, Erich. ''Chariots of the Gods?''. Bantam Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; an attribution made as part of the final chapter of his 1968 publication ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' despite lacking any evidence for the claim.

There are also disparities in the varieties of dogū, with only a portion of the figures having the characteristic goggle-like eyes which is most cited by [[ancient alien]] theorists.

== Biography ==
Doris Buffett is the granddaughter of Ernest Buffett who operated a family grocery store in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Her father Howard Homan Buffett, founded the Omaha based investment business Buffett-Falk &amp; Company in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investinganswers.com/education/famous-investors/whats-so-great-about-warren-buffett-anyway-314|title=What's So Great about Warren Buffett, Anyway? {{!}} InvestingAnswers|website=www.investinganswers.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the oldest sister of Warren Buffett, the chief executive of [[Berkshire Hathaway]], and the [[The World's Billionaires|third-wealthiest person in the world]]. Buffett grew up in [[Kansas]], suffered through the [[Great Depression]] and saw frugal times as a young wife before her inheritance that now allows her to do philanthropic work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/discover/difference-maker-hall-of-fame-doris-buffett-giving-fortune-away/article_302581bd-6e42-5b54-809b-2729cdc40fe6.html|title=Difference Maker Hall of Fame: Doris Buffett giving fortune away to help improve others' lives|last=Jacobs|first=MICHAEL ZITZ PHOTO BY Erik|work=Fredericksburg.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married four times and has fought two bouts of cancer. 

Buffett attracted attention with the publication of a 2010 book titled, “''Giving It All Away: The Doris Buffett Story'',” which was authored by Michael Zitz. The book, which she pursued at the urging of her brother Warren Buffett and the lead singer of U2 [[Bono]], describes Doris' background and life as a philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilmingtonbiz.com/nonprofit/2010/08/05/doris_buffett_gives_it_all_away/1706&lt;/ref&gt; Buffett has donated $100 million of her own money, mostly to needy individuals, often taking the time to call and write to them personally and determine the best way to help. Through her ''Sunshine Lady Foundation'' she has helped thousands of children get an education or attend camp, sponsored young women in Afghanistan and supports prison education programs amongst other philanthropy work. Her goal is to give away her entire fortune, which remains substantial despite her generosity and the stock market crash of 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/fredericksburg-renames-public-pool-in-honor-of-philanthropist-doris-buffett/article_77334d0c-0dfa-53ca-8513-e2ae71d56992.html|title=Fredericksburg renames public pool in honor of philanthropist Doris Buffett, sister of Warren Buffett|last=LANCE-STAR|first=CATHY JETT THE FREE|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She established the ''Letters Foundation'' alongside her brother Warren Buffett to provide humanitarian grants to people experiencing a crisis through no fault of their own, when no other options exist. A hand-up and not hand-out is her philanthropy principle. Her brother Warren Buffett helped fund some of the foundation’s early projects though later she began providing funds herself from Berkshire Hathway stocks she owned. 
Unlike brother Warren Buffett who grants in 'wholesale', Doris Buffett believes in small and direct grants to people with financial difficulties hence the nickname 'retail' philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.de/Giving-All-Away-Doris-Buffett/dp/1579622097|title=Giving It All Away the Doris Buffett Sto: The Doris Buffett Story|last=Suchergebnisse|date=2010-05-01|publisher=Permanent Pr Pub Co|isbn=9781579622091|location=Sag Harbor, NY|language=Englisch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "She is far more philanthropic than I am. She identifies with the underdog. I do it in a wholesale way, but not on a one-on-one basis. She really wants to know their stories," Warren Buffett said to the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Doris Buffett also established the ''Learning By Giving Foundation'' which promotes the study of experiential philanthropy at various undergraduate colleges across the United States. At the end of the semester, each class receives a grant of $10,000 to distribute to local nonprofit organizations. The courses help students understand the social and economic roles of the nonprofit sector and philanthropy, and the processes through which social change is funded and implemented across sectors.

Buffett made her home in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] and moved to [[Boston]] in 2016 to be closer to family, and to receive treatment for [[Alzheimer’s disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-buffett-s-philanthropy-has-left-its-mark/article_bb190119-b203-5e00-85f7-c151fa2f531d.html|title=EDITORIAL: Buffett's philanthropy has left its mark|last=LANCE-STAR|first=THE EDITORIAL PAGE STAFF OF THE FREE|work=Fredericksburg.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2018/05/doris-buffett-has-alzheimers-and-now-her-foundation-is-the-basis-of-a-dispute/|title=Doris Buffett has Alzheimer’s, and now her foundation is the basis of a dispute|date=2018-05-13|work=Business Breaking News|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Line 3 Controversy in Minnesota ==
Much of the resistance to the Line 3 project comes from concerns over climate change. Environmental groups such as the North Star Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/north-star-chapter/pdf/Line3FactSheet.pdf|title=Line 3 and the Pipeline System|last=|first=|date=|website=Sierra Club North Star Chapter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MN350,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mn350.org/pipeline-resistance/|title=Pipeline Resistance|last=|first=|date=|website=MN350|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Honor the Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honorearth.org/sandpiper_line_3_corridor|title=Line 3|last=|first=|date=|website=Honor the Earth|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have anti-Line 3 campaigns. The [[Environmental impact statement|Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS), which was conducted by the [[Minnesota Department of Commerce]], explains how the new Line 3 pipeline would contribute to deforestation, increase risk of pollution to Minnesota's pristine water ecosystems and [[wild rice]] beds, and generate greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since the publication of the EIS, the MN Department of Commerce has formally denounced the proposed Line 3 project on environmental grounds, going so far as to say that they would prefer to see the old pipeline cease operations:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bemidjipioneer.com/4326044-enbridge-line-3-replacement-not-needed-minn-commerce-department-says|title=Enbridge Line 3 replacement not needed, Minn. commerce department says|last=Johnson|first=Brooks|date=September 11, 2017|website=Bemidji Pioneer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Native communities in Minnesota oppose Line 3. Five [[Anishinaabe]] tribes, the [[White Earth Band of Ojibwe|White Earth]], Red Lake, [[Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe|Mille Lacs]], [[Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|Fond du Lac]], and [[Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe|Leech Lake]] bands hold status as intervening parties against the project in the PUC's permit deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stopline3.org/news/5tribes|title=5 Ojibwe Tribes Intervene in Minnesota's Contested Case Process for Line 3|last=|first=|date=July 13, 2017|website=Stop Line 3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that the construction of Line 3 would disrupt tribal cultural sites such as burial grounds and historic locales, and degrade natural resources such as wild rice beds and healthy water ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mn.gov/commerce/energyfacilities/resource.html?Id=34735|title=Line 3 EIS: Chapter 9 - Tribal Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota Department of Commerce|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete Traditional Cultural Properties Survey has not been conducted of the proposed route.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/tribes-ask-puc-to-reconsider-review-of-new-enbridge-pipeline-route-saying-cultural-study-wasn-t-done/468049673/|title=Tribes ask PUC to reconsider review of new Enbridge pipeline route, saying cultural study wasn't done|last=Hughlett|first=Mike|date=January 4, 2018|website=Star Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One will not take place unless a permit for construction is granted to Enbridge.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This lack has been criticized by tribal groups.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The [[Minnesota Chippewa Tribe]], in conjunction with Honor the Earth, an Indigenous climate justice organization, released their own assessment of the cultural and environmental determinants Line 3 would have on their land.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnchippewatribe.org/pdf/Intro_DRAFT.pdf|title=Anishinaabe Cumulative Impact Assessment on the Proposed Enbridge Line 3 Expansion and Abandonment Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota Chippewa Tribe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chippewa Cumulative Impact Assessment reflects grave concern in that community and strongly opposes the pipeline's construction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In response to such concerns, Enbridge has an 'Indigenous Peoples Policy' which lays out guidelines for the company's work on Native land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports/indigenous-discussion-paper/indigenous-policy|title=Enbridge's Indigenous Peoples Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=Enbridge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another debate surrounding the proposed Line 3 project is what will happen to the infrastructure of the old Line 3. Enbridge has proposed a process they call "deactivation." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many who oppose the project call it "abandonment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pipelinecleanupmn.org/resources/line-3-abandonment-factsheet|title=Line 3 Abandonment Factsheet|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enbridge explains deactivation of a pipeline as a 5 step process: remove the oil, clean the pipe, disconnect it from facilities, put corrosion controls in place, and then leave the pipe in the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method that Enbridge would use to prevent corrosion is called c[[Cathodic protection|athodic protection]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup, an organization opposed to Line 3, has expressed concerns about the efficacy of that process.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pipelinecleanupmn.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/Pipeline%20Abandonment%20Report.pdf|title=Enbridge's Mess An Historic Moment for Minnesota Landowners|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many landowners along the old route worry that they will bear the financial burden for the decommissioned pipe, either through costs of cleanup, removal, or lost property value.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnchippewatribe.org/pdf/Chapter%204_Overview%20of%20projects_DRAFT.pdf|title=Chippewa Cumulative Impact Assessment: Chapter 4|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota Chippewa Tribe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Pipeline Abandonment Report from Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup and the Chippewa Cumulative Impact Statement mention that Line 3 would be the first pipeline ever to be decommissioned in MN, and try to interrogate what sort of precedent that might set.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Many Minnesotans support the Line 3 project for its potential to support the economy of communities along the route. Enbridge has said that thousands of jobs will be created as a result of the pipeline's construction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Environmental Impact Statement draws a distinction between the temporary employment that would be available during construction and the likelihood of long term job creation:&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mn.gov/commerce/energyfacilities/resource.html?Id=34735|title=Line 3 EIS: Chapter 5 - Existing Conditions, Impacts, and Mitigation - Certificate of Need|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota Department of Commerce|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Based on the small number of permanent jobs, it is likely that operation of the pipeline would result in no to negligible impact on the per capita household income, median household income, or unemployment rates in the ROI (region of interest.)|Line 3 Environmental Impact Statement (Chapter 5, page 578) &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;}}

In addition to job creation, Line 3 supporters also cite the positive impact that Enbridge property taxes could have on communities in Northern Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minnesotansforline3.com/about-us/|title=The Line 3 Replacement Project: Safety, Efficiency, Jobs|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesotans for Line 3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of the new Line 3's operations, Enbridge would pay $19.5 million in property taxes along the route.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enbridge.com/projects-and-infrastructure/public-awareness/minnesota-projects/line-3-replacement-project|title=Line 3 Replacement Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Enbridge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That number would increase over time.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Organizers hold some reservations about how impactful that revenue might be,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honorearth.org/understanding_the_minnesota_doc_s_opposition_testimony_for_line_3|title=Understanding the Minnesota DOC's Opposition Testimony for Line 3|last=|first=|date=|website=Honor the Earth|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Enbridge's recent lawsuit in which their claim that they had been overtaxed indebted counties across Minnesota to Enbridge for tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/enbridge-prevails-in-minnesota-property-tax-challenge/482687251/|title=Enbridge prevails in Minnesota property tax challenge|last=Hughlett|first=Mike|date=May 15, 2018|website=Star Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument in support of the pipeline ties safety to the economic concept of supply and demand. Recent studies have highlighted that train and truck transportation of oil results in more regular spills than transport by pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/28/pipelines-vs-trains-oil-transport/|title=Pipelines: The Worst Way to Move Oil, Except For All the Rest|last=Morris|first=David|date=August 28, 2016|website=Fortune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Among their arguments in support of the pipeline, Minnesotans for Line 3 cites the growing number of trains transporting oil through the state.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minnesotansforline3.com/2018/05/fact-check-friday-8-supply-demand-and-why-pipelines-like-line-3-are-so-important/|title=Fact Check Friday #8: Supply, demand and why pipelines like Line 3 are so important|last=|first=|date=May 11, 2018|website=Minnesotans for Line 3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that, due to high U.S. demand, oil will be moved through the states by whatever means are available.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Justin Trudeau]], Prime Minister of Canada, also advanced this argument in his public endorsement of the Canadian section of Line 3:&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-cabinet-trudeau-pipeline-decisions-1.3872828|title=Trudeau cabinet approves Trans Mountain, Line 3 pipelines, rejects Northern Gateway|last=Tasker|first=John|date=November 29, 2016|website=CBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(Transport of oil by rail) is less economic, and more dangerous for communities, and is higher in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than modern pipelines would be.|Justin Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;}}

Enbridge estimates that Line 3 would replace more than 10,000 rail cars or 24,000 [[Tank truck|tanker trucks]] transporting oil everyday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Minnesotans for Line 3 say that by approving the pipeline, government regulators could ensure safer transport of millions of barrels of oil a year.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The MN Department of Commerce, in their testimony against Line 3, questioned these projections, claiming that they depend on an unrealistic idea of the future demand of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mn.gov/eera/web/project-file?legacyPath=/opt/documents/34079/Fagan_Direct_Testimony%2014-916.pdf|title=BEFORE THE MINNESOTA OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS; FOR THE MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION; IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF ENBRIDGE ENERGY, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP FOR A CERTIFICATE OF NEED FOR THE LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROJECT IN MINNESOTA FROM THE NORTH DAKOTA BORDER TO THE WISCONSIN BORDER; DIRECT TESTIMONY OF DR.

Enbridge's key argument in support of the pipeline relates to that critique from the Department of Commerce.

'''Experimental archaeology''' (also called '''experiment archaeology''' and '''experiential archaeology''') is a field of study which attempts to generate and test archaeological hypotheses, usually by replicating or approximating the feasibility of ancient cultures performing various tasks or feats. It employs a number of methods, techniques, analyses, and approaches, based upon archaeological source material such as ancient [[structure]]s or [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].&lt;ref&gt;Experimental archaeology is "Within the context of a controllable imitative experiment to replicate past phenomena in order to generate and test hypotheses to provide or enhance analogies for archaeological interpretation" (Mathieu, 12)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinct from uses of primitive technology without any concern for archaeological or historical study. [[Living history]] and [[historical reenactment]], which are generally undertaken as a hobby, are the non archaeological person's version of this academic discipline.

One of the main forms of experimental archaeology is the creation of copies of historical structures using only historically accurate technologies. This is sometimes known as '''reconstruction archaeology''' or '''reconstructional archaeology'''; however, reconstruction implies an exact replica of the past, when it is in fact just a construction of one person's idea of the past; the more archaeologically correct term is a ''working construction of the past''. In recent years, experimental archaeology has been featured in several television productions, such as [[BBC]]'s "Building the Impossible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369083/|title=Building the Impossible|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[PBS]]'s ''[[Secrets of Lost Empires]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostempires/|title=NOVA Online – Secrets of Lost Empires|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable were the attempts to create several of Leonardo da Vinci's designs from his sketchbooks, such as his 15th century armed fighting vehicle.

== Examples ==
A good example is [[Butser Ancient Farm]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Hampshire]] which is a working replica of an [[Iron Age]] farmstead where [[long-term experiment]]s in prehistoric agriculture, animal husbandry, and manufacturing are held to test ideas posited by archaeologists. In [[Denmark]], the [[Lejre Experimental Centre]] carries out even more ambitious work on such diverse topics as artificial [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] burials, prehistoric science and stone tool manufacture in the absence of [[flint]].

Other examples include:
*The [[Kon-Tiki expedition|''Kon-Tiki'' expedition]] (1947), a [[balsa]] raft built by [[Thor Heyerdahl]], sailed from [[Peru]] to [[Polynesia]] to demonstrate the possibility of cultural exchange between [[South America]] and the Polynesian islands.
*Attempts to transport large stones like those used in [[Stonehenge]] over short distances using only technology that would have been available at the time. The original stones were probably moved from [[Pembrokeshire]] to the site on [[Salisbury Plain]].
*Since the 1970s the re-construction of timber framed buildings has informed understanding of early Anglo Saxon buildings at [[West Stow]], Suffolk, England. This extensive program of research through experiment and experience continues today.
*The reconstruction of part of [[Hadrian's Wall]] at [[Vindolanda]], carried out in limited time by local volunteers.
*Greek [[trireme]]s have been reconstructed by skilled sailors from plans and archaeological remains and have been successfully tried at sea.
*Attempts to manufacture steel that matches all the characteristics of [[Damascus steel]], whose original manufacturing techniques have been lost for centuries, including [[computational fluid dynamics]] reconstructions by the [[University of Exeter]] of the [[Sri Lanka]] furnaces at Samanalawewa, thought to be the most likely sources for Damascus steel.
*Experiments using reproduction [[Bâton de commandement|bâtons de commandement]] as [[spear]] throwers.
*[[Guédelon Castle]], a medieval construction project located in [[Treigny]], France.
*[[Ozark Medieval Fortress]], a sister project to Guédelon
* The [[Pamunkey Project]] – Dr. [[Errett Callahan]] led a series of extended Late Woodland living experiences in [[Tidewater Virginia]].
*[[Marcus Junkelmann]] constructed Roman devices and gear for various museums. He also tested and analyzed them in various reenactments, among them a group of [[Legionary|legionaries]] in full authentic gear crossing the [[Alps]]  from [[Augsburg]] to [[Verona]].

*[[Killian Driscoll]] undertook a series of experiments to examine the prehistoric use of vein [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=Understanding quartz technology in early prehistoric Ireland|date=2010|url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/phd_quartz_lithic_technology_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved experimental [[knapping]] to understand the fracture mechanics of the material;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=Vein quartz in lithic traditions: an analysis based on experimental archaeology|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2011|volume=38|url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/killian_driscoll_publications_2011_vein_quartz_lithic_traditions_analysis_experimental_archaeology_abstract.html|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; the experimental burning of quartz;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|last2=Menuge|first2=Julian|title=Recognising burnt vein quartz artefacts in archaeological assemblages|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2011|volume=38|url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/killian_driscoll_publications_2011_recognising_burnt_vein_quartz_artefacts_archaeological_assemblages_abstract.html|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experiment designed to investigate the ease of identification of stone tools made from quartz;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title= Identifying and classifying vein quartz artefacts: an experiment conducted at the World Archaeological Congress, 2008|journal=Archaeometry|date=2011|volume=53|url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/killian_driscoll_publications_2011_identifying_classifying_quartz_artefacts_experiment_archaeometry_abstract.html|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2011.00600.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this series was added to by an experiment that examined the effects of trampling on quartz tools compared to flint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=K|last2=Alcaina|first2=J|last3=Égüez|first3=N|last4=Mangado|first4=X|last5=Fullola|first5=J-M.|last6=Tejero|first6=J-M.|title=Trampled under foot: A quartz and chert human trampling experiment at the Cova del Parco rock shelter, Spain|journal=Quaternary International|date=2016|volume=424|url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/killian_driscoll_publications_2016_quartz_chert_trampling_experiment_abstract.html|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2015.04.054|bibcode=2016QuInt.424..130D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:Guedelon forge, France.jpg|thumb|Experimental medieval forge]]
Other types of experimental archaeology may involve burying modern replica [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[ecofact]]s for varying lengths of time to analyse the post-depositional effects on them. Other archaeologists have built modern [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] and measured the effects of silting in the ditches and weathering and subsidence on the banks to understand better how ancient monuments would have looked. One example is [[Overton Down]] in England.

The work of [[flintknapper]]s is also a kind of experimental archaeology as much has been learnt about the many different types of flint tools through the hands-on approach of actually making them. Experimental archaeologists have equipped modern professional butchers, archers and lumberjacks with replica flint tools to judge how effective they would have been for certain tasks. Use wear traces on the modern flint tools are compared to similar traces on archaeological artifacts, making probability hypotheses on the possible kind of use feasible. [[Hand axe]]s have been shown to be particularly effective at cutting animal meat from the bone and jointing it.

Another field of experimental archaeology is illustrated by the studies of the stone flaking abilities of non-human primates. It has been demonstrated that [[bonobo]]s are able to produce modified cores and flaked stones which are morphologically similar to early lithic industries in East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schick|first1=Kathy|last2=Toth|first2=Nicholas|last3=Garufi|first3=Gary|last4=Savage-Rumbaugh|first4=E. Sue|last5=Rumbaugh|first5=Duane|last6=Seveik|first6=Rose|title=Continuing Insestigations into the Stone Tool-making and Tool-using Capabilities of a Bonobo (Pan panisus)|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1999|volume=26|issue=7|pages=821–832|doi=10.1006/jasc.1998.0350}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The subject has proven popular enough to spawn several re-creation-type television shows:  
* The 1978 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Living in the Past (TV series)|Living in the Past]]'' re-created life in an [[Iron Age]] village with 15 volunteers over a period of 13 months.
* [[Discovery Channel]]'s I, Caveman&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incubatortv.com/i-caveman/&lt;/ref&gt; and I, Caveman : The Great Hunt &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/I-Caveman-The-Great-Hunt/dp/B005RUXET2&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Time Team]]
* Discovery Channel's The Colony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/colony/about/colony.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723105706/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/colony/about/colony.html |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; seasons 1 and 2 showed aspects of experimental archaeology
* Discovery Channel's ''[[MythBusters]]'' often conduct experimental archaeology to test the capability of mythical ancient weapons including [[Archimedes]]' death ray, and the tree cannon, as well as testing the capabilities of known weapons including the [[hwacha]] and the effects of cannonballs and splintering.
* The [[BBC]] has several re-creation farm series, including ''[[Tudor Monastery Farm]]'', ''[[Tales from the Green Valley]]'', ''[[Victorian Farm]]'', ''[[Edwardian Farm]]'', and ''[[Wartime Farm]]''.
* [[BBC Two]] has a series on the construction of [[Guédelon Castle]]: ''[[Secrets of the Castle]]''.

This is a list of the [[List of U.S. states|U.S. states]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. The population data is the official data from the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/|title=U.S. Census 2010 Interactive Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder rates and gun murder rates were calculated based on the [[FBI]] reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls|title=Murder by State, Types of Weapons, 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official population of each state for 2010 and gun ownership rates were added for context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalesan|first=Bindu|last2=Villarreal|first2=Marcos D.|last3=Keyes|first3=Katherine M.|last4=Galea|first4=Sandro|date=2015-06-09|title=Gun ownership and social gun culture|url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2015/06/09/injuryprev-2015-041586|journal=Injury Prevention|language=en|pages=injuryprev–2015–041586|doi=10.1136/injuryprev-2015-041586|issn=1353-8047|pmid=26124073|volume=22|pmc=4809774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official population data from the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] in 2010 is 309.3 million. The gun murders in 2010 from [[FBI]] reports is 8,775.&lt;ref name="ucr.fbi.gov"&gt;https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the reported &lt;ref name="ucr.fbi.gov"/&gt; gun murder rate for the U.S. was 2.84 per 100,000, the overall estimated gun homicide rate is 3.5. It should be noted that American statistics differ from other countries. For example, "homicide numbers in England and Wales 'exclude any cases which do not result in conviction, or where the person is not prosecuted on grounds of self defence or otherwise.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/wire/gun-control-fails-what-happened-england-ireland-and-canada&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonably inferred that the U.S. statistics are calculated at more than twice those of other countries due to the inclusion of non-arrest, non-conviction data. For instance, in 2012, the U.S. suffered 14,827 reported homicides for which only 7,133 arrests resulted. The U.S. reports at 70% conviction rate for murder prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=qa&amp;iid=403&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geodesic grid''' is a [[spatial grid]] based on a [[geodesic polyhedron]] or [[Goldberg polyhedron]].

A geodesic grid is a global Earth reference that uses triangular tiles based on the subdivision of a polyhedron (usually the [[icosahedron]], and usually a Class I subdivision) to subdivide the surface of the Earth. Such a grid does not have a straightforward relationship to latitude and longitude, but conforms to many of the main criteria for a statistically valid discrete global grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Keith C |title=Criteria and Measures for the Comparison of Global Geocoding Systems |work=Discrete Global Grids: Goodchild, M. F. and A. J. Kimerling, Eds |url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~kclarke/Papers/GlobalGrids.html |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the cells' area and shape are generally similar, especially near the poles where many other spatial grids have singularities or heavy distortion. The popular Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) falls into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spatial-effects.com/SE-papers1.html |first = Geoffrey| last=Dutton|title=Spatial Effects: Research Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geodesic grids may use the [[dual polyhedron]] of the geodesic polyhedron, which is the [[Goldberg polyhedron]]. Goldberg polyhedra are made up of hexagons and (if based on the icosahedron) 12 pentagons. One implementation that uses an [[icosahedron]] as the base polyhedron, hexagonal cells, and the [[Snyder equal-area projection]] is known as the Icosahedron Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavi-Amiri |first=Ali |author2=Harrison.E |author3=Samavati.F |title=hexagonal connectivity maps for digital earth |journal=International Journal of Digital Earth |year=2014 |doi=10.1080/17538947.2014.927597 |bibcode= 2015IJDE....8..750M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In biodiversity science, geodesic grids are a global extension of local discrete grids that are staked out in field studies to ensure appropriate statistical sampling and larger multi-use grids deployed at regional and national levels to develop an aggregated understanding of biodiversity. These grids translate environmental and ecological monitoring data from multiple spatial and temporal scales into assessments of current ecological condition and forecasts of risks to our natural resources. A geodesic grid allows local to global assimilation of ecologically significant information at its own level of granularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1559/152304092783786636 |last=White |first=D |author2=Kimerling AJ |author3=Overton WS |title=Cartographic and geometric components of a global sampling design for environmental monitoring. |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Systems |volume=19 |pages=5–22 |year=1992 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When modeling the [[weather prediction|weather]], ocean circulation, or the [[climatology|climate]], [[partial differential equation]]s are used to describe the evolution of these systems over time. Because computer programs are used to build and work with these complex models, approximations need to be formulated into easily computable forms. Some of these [[numerical analysis]] techniques (such as [[finite differences]]) require the area of interest to be subdivided into a grid — in this case, over the [[geodesy|shape of the Earth]].

Geodesic grids can be used in [[video game development]] to model fictional worlds instead of the Earth. They are a natural analog of the [[hex map]] to a spherical surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simblob.blogspot.com/2016/10/hexagon-tiling-of-sphere.html|last=Patel |first=Amit |title=Hexagon tiling of a sphere |year= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
Pros:
*Largely [[isotropic]].
*Resolution can be easily increased by binary division.
*Does not suffer from over sampling near the poles like more traditional rectangular longitude–latitude square grids.
*Does not result in dense linear systems like [[spectral method]]s do (see also [[Gaussian grid]]).
*No single points of contact between neighboring grid cells. [[Square grid]]s and isometric grids suffer from the ambiguous problem of how to handle neighbors that only touch at a single point.
*Cells can be both minimally distorted and near-equal-area. In contrast, square grids are not equal area, while equal-area rectangular grids vary in shape from equator to poles.

Cons:

[[File:CGELFunctions.png|thumb|A tree diagram of English functions]]
In [[linguistics]], '''grammatical relations''' (also called '''grammatical functions''', '''grammatical roles''', or '''syntactic functions''') refer to functional relationships between [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]]s in a [[clause]]. The standard examples of grammatical functions from traditional grammar are [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|direct object]], and [[indirect object]]. In recent times, the syntactic functions (more generally referred to as grammatical relations), typified by the traditional categories of subject and object, have assumed an important role in linguistic theorizing, within a variety of approaches ranging from generative grammar to functional and cognitive theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Christopher, S.|title=Syntactic functions in Functional Discourse Grammar and Role and Reference Grammar: an evaluative comparison|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000112000137|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=29 September 2013|doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theories of grammar are likely to acknowledge numerous further types of grammatical relations (e.g. complement, specifier, predicative, etc.). The role of grammatical relations in theories of grammar is greatest in [[dependency grammar]]s, which tend to posit dozens of distinct grammatical relations. Every [[head (linguistics)|head]]-dependent dependency bears a grammatical function.

==In traditional grammar==
The grammatical relations are exemplified in traditional grammar by the notions of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[direct object]], and [[indirect object]]:

::'''Fred''' gave '''Susan''' '''the book'''.

The subject ''Fred'' performs or is the source of the action. The direct object ''the book'' is acted upon by the subject, and the indirect object Susan receives the direct object or otherwise benefits from the action. Traditional grammars often begin with these rather vague notions of the grammatical functions. When one begins to examine the distinctions more closely, it quickly becomes clear that these basic definitions do not provide much more than a loose orientation point.

What is indisputable about the grammatical relations is that they are relational. That is, subject and object can exist as such only by virtue of the context in which they appear. A noun such as ''Fred'' or a noun phrase such as ''the book'' cannot qualify as subject and direct object, respectively, unless they appear in an environment, e.g. a clause, where they are related to each other and/or to an action or state. In this regard, the main verb in a clause is responsible for assigning grammatical relations to the clause "participants".

==Defining the grammatical relations==
Most grammarians and students of language intuitively know in most cases what the subject and object in a given clause are. But when one attempts to produce theoretically satisfying definitions of these notions, the results are usually less than clear and therefore controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Napoli (199326, 46ff., 91ff.) provides an insightful discussion of notions such as 'subject' and 'direct object'.&lt;/ref&gt; The contradictory impulses have resulted in a situation where most theories of grammar acknowledge the grammatical relations and rely on them heavily for describing phenomena of grammar but at the same time, avoid providing concrete definitions of them. Nevertheless, various principles can be acknowledged that attempts to define the grammatical relations are based on.

===Thematic criteria===
The [[thematic relations]] (='''thematic roles''', '''semantic roles''', e.g. [[agent (grammar)|agent]], [[patient (grammar)|patient]], theme, goal, etc.) can provide semantic orientation for defining the grammatical relations. There is a tendency for subjects to be agents and objects to be patients or themes. However, the thematic relations cannot be substituted for the grammatical relations, nor vice versa. This point is evident with the [[diathesis alternation|active-passive diathesis]] and [[ergative verb]]s:

::'''Marge''' has fixed '''the coffee table'''.
::'''The coffee table''' has been fixed (by '''Marge''').

::The torpedo sank '''the ship'''.
::'''The ship''' sank.

''Marge'' is the agent in the first pair of sentences because she initiates and carries out the action of fixing, and ''the coffee table'' is the patient in both because it is acted upon in both sentences. In contrast, the subject and direct object are not consistent across the two sentences. The subject is the agent ''Marge'' in the first sentence and the patient ''The coffee table'' in the second sentence. The direct object is the patient ''the coffee table'' in the first sentence, and there is no direct object in the second sentence. The situation is similar with the ergative verb ''sunk/sink'' in the second pair of sentences. The noun phrase ''the ship'' is the theme in both sentences, although it is the object in the first of the two and the subject in the second.

The grammatical relations belong to the level of surface syntax, whereas the thematic relations reside on a deeper semantic level. If, however, the correspondences across these levels are acknowledged, then the thematic relations can be seen as providing prototypical thematic traits for defining the grammatical relations.

===Configurational criteria===
Another prominent means used to define the syntactic relations is in terms of the syntactic configuration. The subject is defined as the [[verb argument]] that appears outside of the canonical [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]], whereas the object is taken to be the verb argument that appears inside the verb phrase.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Chomsky (1965), Bach (1974:39), Cowper (1992:40), Culicover (1997:167f.), Carnie (2007:118-120).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach takes the configuration as primitive, whereby the grammatical relations are then derived from the configuration. This "configurational" understanding of the grammatical relations is associated with Chomskyan [[phrase structure grammar]]s ([[Transformational grammar]], [[Government and Binding]] and [[Minimalist program|Minimalism]]).

The configurational approach is limited in what it can accomplish. It works best for the subject and object arguments. For other clause participants (e.g. attributes and modifiers of various sorts, prepositional arguments, etc.), it is less insightful, since it is often not clear how one might define these additional syntactic functions in terms of the configuration. Furthermore, even concerning the subject and object, it can run into difficulties, e.g.

::There were '''two lizards''' in the drawer.

The configurational approach has difficulty with such cases. The plural verb ''were'' agrees with the post-verb noun phrase ''two lizards'', which suggests that ''two lizards'' is the subject. But since ''two lizards'' follows the verb, one might view it as being located inside the verb phrase, which means it should count as the object. This second observation suggests that [[syntactic expletive|the expletive]] ''there'' should be granted subject status.

===Morphological criteria===
Many efforts to define the grammatical relations emphasize the role [[inflection]]al [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In English, the subject can or must agree with the finite verb in person and number, and in languages that have morphological [[grammatical case|case]], the subject and object (and other verb arguments) are identified in terms of the case markers that they bear (e.g. [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[absolutive]], etc.). Inflectional morphology may be a more reliable means for defining the grammatical relations than the configuration, but its utility can be very limited in many cases. For instance, inflectional morphology is not going to help in languages that lack inflectional morphology almost entirely such as Mandarin, and even with English, inflectional morphology does not help much, since English largely lacks morphological case.

===Prototypical traits===
The difficulties facing attempts to define the grammatical relations in terms of thematic or configurational or morphological criteria can be overcome by an approach that posits protoyptical traits. The prototypical subject has a cluster of thematic, configurational, and/or morphological traits, and the same is true of the prototypical object and other verb arguments. Across languages and across constructions within a language, there can be many cases where a given subject argument may not be a prototypical subject, but it has enough subject-like traits to be granted subject status. Similarly, a given object argument may not be prototypical in one way or another, but if it has enough object-like traits, then it can nevertheless receive the status of object.

This third strategy is tacitly preferred by most work in theoretical syntax. All those theories of syntax that avoid providing concrete definitions of the grammatical relations but yet reference them often are (perhaps unknowingly) pursuing an approach in terms of prototypical traits.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

==Heads and dependents==
The importance of the syntactic functions (= grammatical relations) reaches its greatest extent in [[dependency grammar]] (DG) theories of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;The most comprehensive source on DG is Ágel et al. (2003/6).&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Head (linguistics)|head]]-dependent dependency bears a syntactic function.&lt;ref&gt;See Mel’čuk (1988:22, 69).&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that an inventory consisting of dozens of distinct syntactic functions is needed for each language. For example, a determiner-noun dependency might be assumed to bear the DET ([[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]) function, and an adjective-noun dependency is assumed to bear the ATTR (attribute) function. These functions are often produced as labels on the dependencies themselves in the syntactic tree, e.g.

::[[File:Grammatical relations.jpg|Grammatical relations: Labeled DG tree]]

The tree contains the following syntactic functions: ATTR (attribute), CCOMP (clause complement), DET (determiner), MOD (modifier), OBJ (object), SUBJ (subject), and VCOMP (verb complement). The actual inventories of syntactic functions will differ from the one suggested here in the number and types of functions that are assumed. In this regard, this tree is merely intended to be illustrative of the importance that the syntactic functions can take on in some theories of syntax and grammar.

'''Harriette Pipes McAdoo''' (March 15, 1940 - December 21, 2009) was an American sociologist and a distinguished professor at [[Michigan State University]]. She and her husband, John Lewis McAdoo, engaged in research concerning African-American families. She was the author of a well-regarded anthology, ''Black Families''.

==Early life==
McAdoo was the first of three children born to William Harrison Pipes and Anne Howard Russell Pipes. She was born in the infirmary of [[Fort Valley State University|Fort Valley State College]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Julia|title=Harriette Pipes McAdoo (1940–2009)|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|date=February–March 2011|volume=66|issue=2|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2011-02175-005|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Pipes taught at Fort Valley State and several other colleges, was president of [[Alcorn State University|Alcorn College]] and became the first African-American professor at Michigan State University.&lt;ref name="Iconic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature: MSU's Iconic Professors|url=http://alumni.msu.edu/magazine/article.cfm?id=2138|website=[[Michigan State University]]|accessdate=March 27, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When McAdoo was a small child, her mother worked as a domestic servant in spite of having a master's degree because of poor job prospects for black people at the time.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robert L.|title=History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Profiles of Outstanding Black Psychologists|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781434396631|page=341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wubiCX1Bl5YC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;lpg=PA335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAdoo grew up mostly in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but her family moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]], when she was a teenager, and she finished high school there.&lt;ref name="Defining"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriette McAdoo: Defining the American family|url=https://msu.edu/unit/msuaa/magazine/s92/harriett.htm|website=msu.edu|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAdoo earned undergraduate and master's degree from [[Michigan State University]] and a Ph.D. in [[educational psychology]] and child development from the [[University of Michigan]]. She did postdoctoral work at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt;

==Career==
After 21 years on the faculty at [[Howard University]] in the School of Social Work, two of which she spent as acting dean, she was named a Distinguished Professor at Michigan State in the Department of Sociology and the School of Human Ecology. McAdoo also held visiting professorships at several institutions, including [[Smith College]] and the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Footnotes {{!}} April 2010 Issue {{!}} Obituaries|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/apr10/obit_0410.html|website=www.asanet.org|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAdoo and her husband, researcher John Lewis McAdoo, started working on the Family Life Project in the 1970s. The project was an attempt to study African-American families. The couple felt that most of the sociological evidence on this subject reinforced long-held stereotypes because they came from dysfunctional families who had contact with agencies such as prisons and drug treatment programs rather than from middle-class families. McAdoo and her husband systematically looked at middle-class black families in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scarupa|first1=Harriet|title=Middle class, stable and black|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/223773736/?terms=harriette%2Bpipes%2Bmcadoo|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=August 21, 1977|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Association of Black Psychologists]] named McAdoo its 1978 Outstanding Researcher of the Year. During the Carter administration, McAdoo was an appointee to the White House Conference on Families. In 1994, McAdoo was the president of the National Council on Family Relations. She was the editor of a four-volume anthology known as ''Black Families''. She and her husband established the Empirical Conference on Black Psychology.&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt;  

==Death and legacy==
McAdoo died unexpectedly in 2009. She was predeceased by her husband.&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt; The National Council on Family Relations awards the John L. and Harriette P. McAdoo Dissertation Award to recognize doctoral dissertations that relate to ethnic minority families. In 2018, Ijeoma Opara was named the recipient of the John L. and Harriette P. McAdoo Dissertation Award for her work on highlighting protective factors for drug use and sexual risk behavior prevention among Black and Hispanic female adolescents. &lt;ref name="NCFR"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCFR recognizes Ijeoma Opara for contributions to knowledge about ethnic minority families {{!}} National Council on Family Relations|url=https://www.ncfr.org/news/ncfr-recognizes-ijeoma-opara-contributions-knowledge-about-ethnic-minority-families|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercules of the Forum Boarium''' is one of two gilded bronze statues of [[Hercules]] found on the site of the [[Forum Boarium]]  of [[ancient Rome]]. The two statues were both placed in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori|Palazzo Dei Convervatori]] for safe keeping in 1950 and remain there today. The Hercules of Forum Boarium was likely to have been a cult image of Temple of Hercules that stood by the ancient cattle market.

==Description==
The bronze sculpture is slightly over life-sized &lt;ref&gt;Height 2.41 m.&lt;/ref&gt; and is in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] style of the second century BCE. The Hellenistic style was based on the canon of proportions that had been established by [[Lysippos]] in the early fourth century BCE. The muscles on the sculpture are exaggerated and the head is proportionally smaller when compared to the rest of the body. The Forum Boarium statue is one of the two surviving full-sized Greek statues from ancient Greece. The second Hercules statue was discovered near the [[Theatre of Pompey]]. The Hercules of the Theatre of Pompey had been carefully buried under protective tiles and uncised FCS (Fulgor Conditum Summanium) because it was constantly hit by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OLGA|first1=PALAGIA,|title=TWO STATUES OF HERCULES IN THE FORUM BOARIUM IN ROME|url=https://www.academia.edu/5267150/Two_statues_of_Hercules_in_the_Forum_Boarium_in_Rome|website=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hercules of the Theatre of Pompey depicts him leaning on his club vertically as he holds the apple of Hesperides in his left hand. On his left forearm, he has draped the skin of the [[Nemean Lion]] that he defeated on his first Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OLGA|first1=PALAGIA,|title=TWO STATUES OF HERCULES IN THE FORUM BOARIUM IN ROME|url=https://www.academia.edu/5267150/Two_statues_of_Hercules_in_the_Forum_Boarium_in_Rome|website=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both sculptures display [[contrapposto]], a typical style from Lysippos in which the figure's weight is thrown entirely on one foot. Though their muscles are exaggerated, they stand in marked contrast to the bearded, burly and perhaps more familiar ''[[Farnese Hercules]]''.

The statue of Hercules from Forum Boarium is based on his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labors]] where he must bring back the [[Hesperides|Golden Apples of Hesperides to Eurystheus]]. Hercules found [[Prometheus]] during his search and freed him from his prison. In return, Prometheus told him where he could find the Golden Apples. The apples were guarded by a hundred-headed dragon named Ladon who could not be conquered by Hercules. To defeat Ladon, he needed the help of Atlas, the titan that held the Earth and Heavens on his shoulder. Hercules managed to convince Atlas to help him get the apples, but in exchange, Hercules would have to carry the weight of the world while Atlas acquired the apples. When Atlas returned with the apples, he did not want to retake the weight of the world back. Hercules tricked Atlas by saying that he would gladly stay and hold up the world, but asked Atlas if he could take the weight again so he can adjust his cloak. Atlas took back the weight of the world and Hercules immediately picked up the Golden Apples and ran off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Symmachus|first1=Aurelius|title=The Temple of Hercules|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/articles/article-020.html|website=www.roman-empire.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The temple of the Forum Boarium in Rome is located by the [[Tiber|Tiber River]]. The statue was first created for the cult of [[Ara Maxima]], which was dedicated to Hercules by the Greek king Evander. Legend states that the statue was created to commemorate the story of Hercules killing the robber Cacus who attempted stealing cattle from Geryon. During the early Renaissance, the little that was left of the temple was demolished under the orders of [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]]. The temple was converted into a church.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Müntz, ''Les arts à la cour des papes pendant le XVe et le XVIe siècle'', vol. III:177f.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statue of Hercules was moved to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the [[Campidoglio]] in 1510&lt;ref&gt;inv. no. MC1265; Haskell and Penny 1981:227&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of Hercules Aemilianus is believed to have been commissioned by either Aemilius Paullus, who dedicated a tomb to Hercules, or by Scipio Aemilianus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5267150/Two_statues_of_Hercules_in_the_Forum_Boarium_in_Rome|title=TWO STATUES OF HERCULES IN THE FORUM BOARIUM IN ROME|last1=OLGA|first1=PALAGIA,|website=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was found after Romans demolished a portion to create space for their new rotunda. &lt;ref name="Fabio"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/536737/_The_Mouth_of_Truth_and_the_Forum_Boarium_Oceanus_Hercules_and_Hadrian_Art_Bulletin_93_no._1_2011_7-37|title=The Mouth of Truth and the Forum Boarium: Oceanus, Hercules, and Hadrian|last1=Fabio|first1=Barry,|date=March 2011|publisher=College Art Association|edition=Vol. 93, No. 1|pages=17-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ancient temples where the statue may have been displayed: the temple located between [[Circus Maximus]] and the Church of Santa Maria and the temple of Hercules Ameliana. The statue of Hercules of the Theatre of Pompey, or also known as the statue of Hercules Inviticus, was discovered in 1864 near the Theatre of Pompey. This is the gilded, bronze statue of Hercules that is now located in the Vatican Rotunda.

'''Hexis''' ({{lang-grc|ἕξις}}) is a relatively stable arrangement or disposition, for example a person's health or knowledge or character. It is an [[Ancient Greek]] word, important in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], and because of this it has become a traditional word of philosophy. It stems from a verb related to [[Ownership|possession]] or "having", and [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], for example, translates it as "possession". It is more typically translated in modern texts occasionally as "state" (e.g., H. Rackham), but more often as "[[disposition]]". Joe Sachs translates it as "active condition", in order to make sure that ''hexis'' is not confused with passive conditions of the soul, such as feelings and impulses or mere capacities that belong to us by nature. Sachs points to Aristotle's own distinction, explained for example in ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 8b, which distinguishes the word ''diathesis'', normally uncontroversially translated as disposition. In this passage, ''diathesis'' only applies to passive and shallow dispositions that are easy to remove and change, such as being hot or cold, while ''hexis'' is reserved for deeper and more active dispositions, such as properly getting to know something in a way that it will not be easily forgotten. Another common example of a human ''hexis'' in Aristotle is health (''hugieia'', or sometimes ''eu(h)exia'', in Greek) and in cases where ''hexis'' is discussed in the context of health, it is sometimes translated as "constitution".

Apart from needing to be relatively stable or permanent, in contexts concerning humans (such as knowledge, health, and good character) ''hexis'' is also generally understood to be contrasted from other dispositions, conditions and habits, by being "acquired" by some sort of training or other habituation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''hexis'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%28%2Fcis entry] in [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plotinus]], virtue is a hexis of the soul that is not primarily related to [[praxis (process)|praxis]] and habituation; hexis is a quality of being in an active state of possession that intellectualizes the soul in permanent contemplation of the intelligible world (Enn. VI.8.5.3–37).&lt;ref&gt;Stamatellos, G. (2015) "Virtue and Hexis in Plotinus", International Journal of the Platonic Tradition 9.2: 129-45 [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18725473-12341312]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses also occur, for example it is sometimes translated as "habit", based upon the classical translation from Greek to Latin "''habitus''", which also comes from a verb indicating having.

Being in a truly fixed state, as opposed to being stable, is not implied in the original Aristotelian usage of this word.&lt;ref&gt;''Stasis'', in Greek, was “rest”. In fact, neither a ''hexis'' nor a ''[[dunamis]]'' are static or moving because they do not [[Existence|exist]] in the way that moving things exist ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] IX).&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the example of "[[health]]" being a ''hexis''.

{{Quotation|"Having" (''hexis'') means (a) In one sense an activity (''[[energeia]]''), as it were, of the haver and the thing had, or as in the case of an action (praxis) or motion; for when one thing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of making. In this way between the man who has a garment and the garment which is had, there is a "having (''hexis'')." Clearly, then, it is impossible to have a "having" (''hexis'') in this sense; for there will be an infinite series if we can have the having of what we have. But (b) there is another sense of "having" which means a disposition (''diathesis''), in virtue of which (''kath' ho'') the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else. E.g., health is a state (''hexis''), since it is a disposition of the kind described. Further, any part of such a disposition is called a state (''hexis''); and hence the excellence ([[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]) of the parts is a kind of state (''hexis'').|Aristot. Met. 5.1022b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022b Greek from Perseus Project]: ἕξις δὲ λέγεται ἕνα μὲν τρόπον οἷον ἐνέργειά τις τοῦ  [5]  ἔχοντος καὶ ἐχομένου, ὥσπερ πρᾶξίς τις ἢ κίνησις （ὅταν γὰρ τὸ μὲν ποιῇ τὸ δὲ ποιῆται, ἔστι ποίησις μεταξύ: οὕτω καὶ τοῦ ἔχοντος ἐσθῆτα καὶ τῆς ἐχομένης ἐσθῆτος ἔστι μεταξὺ ἕξις）: ταύτην μὲν οὖν φανερὸν ὅτι οὐκ ἐνδέχεται ἔχειν ἕξιν （εἰς ἄπειρον γὰρ βαδιεῖται, εἰ τοῦ ἐχομένου ἔσται ἔχειν τὴν [10] ἕξιν）, ἄλλον δὲ τρόπον ἕξις λέγεται διάθεσις καθ᾽ ἣν ἢ εὖ ἢ κακῶς διάκειται τὸ διακείμενον, καὶ ἢ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ ἢ πρὸς ἄλλο, οἷον ἡ ὑγίεια ἕξις τις: διάθεσις γάρ ἐστι τοιαύτη. ἔτι ἕξις λέγεται ἂν ᾖ μόριον διαθέσεως τοιαύτης: διὸ καὶ ἡ τῶν μερῶν ἀρετὴ ἕξις τίς ἐστιν.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

So according to Aristotle, a "''hexis''" is a type of "disposition" (diathesis) which he in turn describes in the same as follows...

{{Quotation|"Disposition" means arrangement (''taxis'') of that which has parts, either in space (''[[topos]]'') or in potentiality ([[dunamis]]) or in form (''[[Theory of forms|eidos]]''). It must be a kind of position (''thesis''), as indeed is clear from the word, "disposition" (''diathesis'').|Aristot. Met. 5.1022b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022b Greek from Perseus]: διάθεσις λέγεται τοῦ ἔχοντος μέρη τάξις ἢ κατὰ τόπον ἢ κατὰ δύναμιν ἢ κατ᾽ εἶδος: θέσιν γὰρ δεῖ τινὰ εἶναι, ὥσπερ καὶ τοὔνομα δηλοῖ ἡ διάθεσις.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And specifically it is the type of disposition "in virtue of which (''kath' ho'') the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else".

The wording "in virtue of which" was also described in the same passage...

{{Quotation|"That in virtue of which" has various meanings. (a) The form or essence of each individual thing; e.g., that in virtue of which a man is good is "goodness itself." (b) The immediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e.g., color is produced in the surface of things. Thus "that in virtue of which" in the primary sense is the form , and in the secondary sense, as it were, the matter of each thing, and the immediate substrate. And in general "that in virtue of which" will exist in [[Four causes|the same number of senses as "cause."]] For we say indifferently "in virtue of what has he come?" or "for what reason has he come?" and "in virtue of what has he inferred or inferred falsely?" or "what is the cause of his inference or false inference?" (And further, there is the positional sense of ''kath' ho'', "in which he stands," or "in which he walks"; all these examples denote place or position).|Aristot. Met. 5.1022a&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022a Greek from Perseus Project]: τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ λέγεται πολλαχῶς, ἕνα μὲν τρόπον τὸ εἶδος  [15]  καὶ ἡ οὐσία ἑκάστου πράγματος, οἷον καθ᾽ ὃ ἀγαθός, αὐτὸ ἀγαθόν, ἕνα δὲ ἐν ᾧ πρώτῳ πέφυκε γίγνεσθαι, οἷον τὸ χρῶμα ἐν τῇ ἐπιφανείᾳ. τὸ μὲν οὖν πρώτως λεγόμενον καθ᾽ ὃ τὸ εἶδός ἐστι, δευτέρως δὲ ὡς ἡ ὕλη ἑκάστου καὶ τὸ ὑποκείμενον ἑκάστῳ πρῶτον. ὅλως δὲ τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ ἰσαχῶς καὶ  [20]  τὸ αἴτιον ὑπάρξει: κατὰ τί γὰρ ἐλήλυθεν ἢ οὗ ἕνεκα ἐλήλυθε λέγεται, καὶ κατὰ τί παραλελόγισται ἢ συλλελόγισται, ἢ τί τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ συλλογισμοῦ ἢ παραλογισμοῦ. ἔτι δὲ τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ τὸ κατὰ θέσιν λέγεται, καθ᾽ ὃ ἕστηκεν ἢ καθ᾽ ὃ βαδίζει: πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα τόπον σημαίνει καὶ θέσιν.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Aristotle then, a ''hexis'' is an arrangement of parts such that the arrangement might have excellence, being well arranged, or in contrast, might be badly arranged. Also see Aristotle's [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] viii&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classicallibrary.org/aristotle/categories/2.htm#8&lt;/ref&gt; where a hexis ("habit" in the translation of Edghill) is contrasted with a disposition (''diathesis'') in terms of it being more permanent and less easy to change. The example given is "knowledge" (''epistemē'').

In perhaps the most important case, Aristotle contrasted ''hexis'' with ''[[energeia]]'' (in the sense of activity or operation) at [[Nicomachean Ethics]] I.viii.1098b33 and [[Eudemian Ethics]] II.i.1218b. The subject here was ''[[eudaimonia]]'', the proper aim of human life, often translated as "happiness" and ''hexis'' is contrasted with ''energeia'' (ἐνέργεια) in order to show the correctness of a proposed definition of ''eudaimonia'' - "activity (ἐνέργεια) in conformity with virtue"

{{Quotation|Now with those who pronounce happiness to be virtue, or some particular virtue, our definition is in agreement; for ‘activity ({{lang|grc|ἐνέργεια}}) in conformity with virtue’ (''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]'') involves virtue. But no doubt it makes a great difference whether we conceive the Supreme Good to depend on possessing virtue or on displaying it—on disposition ({{lang|grc|ἕξις}}), or on the manifestation of a disposition in action. For a man may possess the disposition without its producing any good result, as for instance when he is asleep, or has ceased to function from some other cause; but virtue in active exercise cannot be inoperative—it will of necessity act (''praxis''), and act well (''eu praxei''). And just as at the Olympic games the wreaths of victory are not bestowed upon the handsomest and strongest persons present, but on men who enter for the competitions—since it is among these that the winners are found,—so it is those who act rightly who carry off the prizes and good things of life.|Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1098b Greek from Perseus Project]: τοῖς μὲν οὖν λέγουσι τὴν ἀρετὴν ἢ ἀρετήν τινα συνῳδός ἐστιν ὁ λόγος: ταύτης γάρ ἐστιν ἡ κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐνέργεια. διαφέρει δὲ ἴσως οὐ μικρὸν ἐν κτήσει ἢ χρήσει τὸ ἄριστον ὑπολαμβάνειν, καὶ ἐν ἕξει ἢ ἐνεργείᾳ. τὴν μὲν γὰρ ἕξιν ἐνδέχεται μηδὲν ἀγαθὸν ἀποτελεῖν ὑπάρχουσαν, οἷον τῷ καθεύδοντι ἢ καὶ ἄλλως πως ἐξηργηκότι, τὴν δ᾽ ἐνέργειαν οὐχ οἷόν τε: πράξει γὰρ ἐξ ἀνάγκης, καὶ εὖ πράξει. ὥσπερ δ᾽ Ὀλυμπίασιν οὐχ οἱ κάλλιστοι καὶ ἰσχυρότατοι στεφανοῦνται ἀλλ᾽ οἱ ἀγωνιζόμενοι （τούτων γάρ τινες νικῶσιν）, οὕτω καὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ βίῳ καλῶν κἀγαθῶν οἱ πράττοντες ὀρθῶς ἐπήβολοι γίνονται.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Happiness then, is an ''energeia'', but virtue of character (often translated as "moral virtue") is made up of ''hexeis''. Happiness is said to deserve honoring like the divine if it actually achieved, while virtue of character, being only a potential achievement, deserves praise but is lower.&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Nic. Eth. Book I Ch.12 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1101b 1101b]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1102a 1102a]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interpersonal deception theory'''
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Interpersonal.png|thumb]] --&gt;
('''IDT''') attempts to explain how individuals handle actual (or perceived) deception at the conscious or subconscious level while engaged in face-to-face communication. IDT assumes that communication is not static; it is influenced by personal goals and the meaning of the interaction as it unfolds. The sender's overt (and covert) communications are affected by the overt and covert communications of the receiver, and vice versa. Intentional deception requires greater cognitive exertion than truthful communication, regardless of whether the sender attempts falsification ([[Lie|lying]]), [[:wikt:concealment|concealment]] (omitting material facts) or [[equivocation]] (skirting issues by changing the subject or responding indirectly). IDT explores the interrelation between the sender's communicative meaning and the receiver's thoughts and behavior in deceptive exchanges.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Theoretical perspective{{anchor|Theoretical Perspective}}==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Theoretical.png|thumb]] --&gt;
IDT views deception through the lens of interpersonal communication, considering deception as an interactive process between sender and receiver. In contrast with previous studies of deception (which focused on the sender and receiver individually), IDT focuses on the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] and relational nature of deceptive communication. Behaviors by sender and receiver are dynamic, multifunctional, multidimensional and multi-modal.&lt;ref&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic communication is communication between two people; a dyad is a group of two people between whom messages are sent and received. Relational communication is communication in which meaning is created by two people simultaneously filling the roles of sender and receiver. [[Dialogic]] activity is the active communicative language of the sender and receiver, each relying upon the other in the exchange.

In [[psychotherapy]] and psychological counseling, dyadic, relational and dialogic activity between therapist and patient relies on honest, open communication if the patient is to recover and be capable of healthier relationships. Deception uses the same theoretical framework in reverse; the communication of one participant is deliberately false.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] studied nonverbal cues to detect deception about a century ago. Freud observed a patient being asked about his darkest feelings. If his mouth was shut and his fingers were trembling, he was considered to be lying. In 1989, DePaulo and Kirkendol developed the Motivation Impairment Effect (MIE). MIE states the harder people try to deceive others, the more likely they are to get caught. Burgoon and Floyd, however, revisited this research and formed the idea that deceivers are more active in their attempt to deceive than most would anticipate or expect.

IDT was developed by two communication professors, David B. Buller and [[Judee K. Burgoon]]. Prior to their study, deception had not been fully considered as a communication activity. Previous work had focused upon the formulation of principles of deception. These principles were derived by evaluating the lie detection ability of individuals observing unidirectional communication. These early studies found initially that "although humans are far from infallible in their efforts to diagnose lies, they are substantially better at the task than would result merely by chance." Buller and Burgoon discount the value of highly controlled studies – usually one-way communication experiments – designed to isolate unmistakable cues that people are lying. Therefore, IDT is based on two-way communication and intended to describe deception as an interaction communicative process.&lt;ref&gt;https://managingresearchlibrary.org/glossary/communicative-interaction&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|18 Propositions|18 propositions}}Propositions==
IDT's model of interpersonal deception has 18 verifiable propositions. Based on assumptions of interpersonal communication and deception, each proposition can generate a testable hypothesis. Although some propositions originated in IDT, many are derived from earlier research. The propositions attempt to explain the cognition and behavior of sender and receiver during the process of deception, from before interaction through interaction to the outcome after interaction.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|The Superordinate Role of Context and Relationship|The superordinate role of context and relationship}}Context and relationship===
IDT's explanations of interpersonal deception depend on the situation in which interaction occurs and the relationship between sender and receiver. 
:1. Sender and receiver cognition and behaviors vary, since deceptive communication contexts vary in access to social cues, immediacy, relationship, conversational demands and spontaneity.

Individuals approach deceptive exchanges with factors such as expectancy, knowledge, goals or intentions and behaviors reflecting their communication competence. IDT posits that these factors influence the deceptive exchange.
:3. Compared with truth-tellers, deceivers engage in more strategic activity designed to manage information, behavior and image and have more nonstrategic arousal cues, negative and muted [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and non-involvement.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features on Senders’ Initial Detection Apprehension and Deception Displays|Effects of preinteraction features on senders' initial detection apprehension and deception displays}}Effects on sender's deception and fear of detection===
IDT posits that factors before the interaction influence the sender's [[deception]] and fear of detection.
:4. Context moderates deception; increased interaction produces greater strategic activity (information, behavior and image management) and reduced nonstrategic activity (arousal or muted affect) over time.
:5. Initial expectations of honesty are related to the degree of interactivity and the relationship between sender and receiver.
:6. Deceivers' fear of detection and associated strategic activity are inversely related to expectations of honesty, a function of context and relationship quality.
:7. Goals and motivation influence behavior.
:8. As receivers' informational, behavioral and relational familiarity increase, deceivers have a greater fear of detection and exhibit more strategic information, behavior and image management and nonstrategic leakage behavior.
:9. Skilled senders convey a truthful demeanor, with more strategic behavior and less nonstrategic leakage, better than unskilled ones.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features and Initial Interaction on Receiver Cognitions|Effects of preinteraction features and initial interaction on receiver cognitions}}Effects on receiver cognition===
IDT also posits that factors before the interaction, combined with initial behavior, affect receiver suspicion and detection accuracy.
:10. Receiver judgment of sender credibility is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.
:11. Detection accuracy is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills, informational and behavioral familiarity, receiver decoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

IDT describes receiver suspicion and sender reaction.
:12. Receiver suspicion is displayed in a combination of strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:13. Senders perceive suspicion.
:14. Suspicion, perceived or actual, increases senders' strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:15. Deception and suspicion displays change over time.
:16. Reciprocity is the predominant interaction pattern between senders and receivers during interpersonal deception.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Postinteraction Outcomes|Postinteraction outcomes}}Outcomes===

IDT posits that interaction between sender and receiver influences how credible the receiver thinks the sender is and how suspicious the sender thinks the receiver is.
:17. Receiver detection accuracy, bias, and judgments of sender credibility after an interaction are functions of receiver cognition (suspicion and truth bias), receiver decoding skill and final sender behavior.
:18. Sender perceived deception success is a function of final sender cognition (perceived suspicion) and receiver behavior.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Receiver's Role in IDT|Receiver's role in IDT}}Receiver's role==
Although most people believe they can spot deception, IDT posits that they cannot. A deceiver must manages his or her verbal and nonverbal cues to ensure that what they are saying appears true. According to IDT, the more [[Social intelligence|socially aware]] a receiver is, the better he or she is at detecting deceit.

In a common social agreement, people are honest with one another and believe that others will be honest with them. If a deceiver begins a deceptive exchange with an accurate statement, the statement may induce the receiver to believe the rest of the deceiver's story is also true. The sender prepares the receiver to accept his or her information as truth, even if some (or all) of the dialogue is false. If the sender repeats the same tactic, the receiver will become more aware that the sender is lying.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Emotion in IDT}}Emotion==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:20160425153327-emotions-mosaic-different-expressions-faces-angry-mad-sad-smile-feelings.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
Emotion plays a central role in IDT as a motivation and result of deception. Emotion can motivate deception, with the sender relying on relevant knowledge (informational, relational and behavioral familiarity)&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve goals such as self-gratification, avoiding a negative emotional outcome or creating a negative emotional outcome for the target of deception. Emotion can be a result of deception, since a physical response occurs in the sender (usually arousal and negative affect).&lt;ref&gt;Ekman &amp; Friensen, 1969; Zuckerman, DePaulo et al., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leakage===
Leakage in deception is manifested most overtly in nonverbal signals; studies indicate that over 90 percent of emotional meaning is communicated non-verbally. Humans are sensitive to body signals, and communication is often ambiguous; something is communicated verbally and its opposite non-verbally. Leakage occurs when nonverbal signals betray the true content of a contradictory verbal message. Facial expression is difficult to read, and the [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS) is a means of uncovering deception. Small facial movements, known as micro-expressions, can be detected in this system using action units.

==={{anchor|Micro-expressions and Action Units}}Micro-expressions and action units===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Micro expressions.png|thumb]] --&gt;
Action units (AUs) can be examined frame by frame, since these micro-expressions are often rapid. [[Paul Ekman]]’s research in facial deception has found several constants in certain expressions, with the action units relating to lip-corner pulling (AU12) and cheek-raising (AU6) qualifiers for happiness in most people. Brow-lowering (AU4) and lip-stretching (AU20) are disqualifiers for happiness. Emotional leakage appears in these fleeting expressions.

A study of Ekman’s observations revealed that AUs appear in over 90 percent of facial expressions. Despite the progress of the facial deception theory and the use of video to capture micro-expressions, it is more practical to search the body for signs of betraying what the sender is trying to communicate. The following signs may indicate deception: 
*Increased, rapid, or strained blinking
*Dilation of the pupils
*Pitch change in voice
*Increased tempo or rate of speech
*Hesitations more pronounced
*Nonverbal and verbal inconsistencies
*Sweating

University of Virginia social psychologist [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/bella-depaulo-phd Bella DePaulo] has said, "Facial cues&amp;nbsp;... are indeed faking cues".{{cn|date=July 2015}}

====Facial expression{{anchor|Facial Expression}}====
Seven basic emotions are communicated through facial expression: [[anger]], [[fear]], [[sadness]], [[joy]], [[disgust]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and [[contempt]]. These emotions are recognized universally. These expressions are innate of develop through [[socialization]].

Cultures have a variety of rules governing the social use of facial expression; for example, the Japanese discourage the display of negative emotions. Individuals may find it difficult to control facial expression, and the face may "leak" information about how they feel.

====Gaze====
{{Main|Eye contact}}
People use eye contact to indicate threat, intimacy and interest. Eye contact is used to regulate [[turn-taking]] in conversation, and indicates how interested the listener (receiver) is in what the speaker is saying. Receivers make eye contact about 70–75 percent of the time, with each contact averaging 7.8&amp;nbsp;seconds.

====Gesture====
[[Gestures]] are among the most culture-specific forms of nonverbal communication, and may lead to misinterpretation. Involuntary self-touching, such as touching the face, scratching, gripping the hands together or putting the hands in (or near) the mouth, occur when people experience intense emotions such as depression&lt;ref&gt;https://psychcentral.com/disorders/depression/&lt;/ref&gt;, elation or extreme anxiety.

Ekman and Friesen demonstrated gesture leakage by showing films of a depressed woman to a group, which was asked to judge the woman's mood. Those shown only the woman's face thought she was happy and cheerful, while the group who saw only her body thought she was tense and disturbed.

====Touch====
Touch can reassure and indicate understanding. Humans touch one another in sexual intimacy, affiliation and understanding; in greetings and farewells; as an act of aggression, and to demonstrate dominance. According to Argyle (1996), there "appear to be definite rules which permit certain kinds of touch, between certain people, on certain occasions only. Bodily contact outside these narrow limits is unacceptable".

=={{anchor|Criticism of IDT}}Criticism==
DePaulo, Ansfield and Bell questioned IDT: "We can find the 'why' question in Buller and Burgoon's synthesis. There is no intriguing riddle or puzzle that needs to be solved, and no central explanatory mechanism is ever described."&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Although they praised Buller and Burgoon's 18 propositions as a comprehensive description of the timeline of deceptive interactions, they said the propositions lacked the interconnectedness and predictive power of a unifying theory. DePaulo ''et al.'' criticized IDT for failing to distinguish between interactive communication (which emphasizes the situational and contextual aspects of communicative exchanges) from interpersonal communication, which emphasizes exchanges in which the sender and receiver make psychological predictions about the other's behavior based on specific prior knowledge; this conceptual ambiguity limited IDT's explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996; see also Stiff, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Buller and Judee Burgoon==
Buller and Burgoon have conducted over two dozen experiments in which they ask participants to deceive another person, and the researchers have found that people often find themselves in situations where they make statements that are not completely honest "to avoid hurting or offending another person, to emphasize their best qualities, to avoid getting into a conflict, or to speed up or slow down a relationship".&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"&gt;http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/interpersdecep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Experiments}}Experiment==
Buller and Burgoon asked participants to put themselves in the following situation:
"You've been dating Pat for nearly three years and feel quite close in your relationship. Since Pat goes to a different school upstate, the two of you have agreed to date other people. Nevertheless, Pat is quite jealous and possessive. During the school year you see Pat only occasionally, but you call each other every Sunday and talk for over an hour. On Friday one of your friends invites you to a party on Saturday night, but the party is 'couples only' so you need a date. There's no way that Pat could come down for the weekend. You decide to ask someone from your class who you've been attracted to so that you can go to the party. The two of you go and have a great time. On Sunday afternoon, there's a knock on your door and it's Pat. Pat walks in and says, 'Decided to come down and surprise you, tried calling you all last night, but you weren't around. What were you doing?{{'"}} The researchers listed three possible responses: lying ("I was at the library getting ready for my theory exam"), telling part of the truth while omitting important details ("Went to a party at a friend's apartment") or being intentionally vague or evasive ("Went out for a while").&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Interpersonal Deception and Online Dating}}Online dating==
A [[Qualitative research|qualitative study]] investigated deception in online dating. The study focused on four questions: (1) About what characteristics are online daters deceptive? (2) What motivation do online daters have for their deception of others in the online-dating environment? (3) What perceptions do online daters have about other daters' deceit towards them in the online-dating environment? (4) How does deception affect romantic relationships formed in the online-dating environment? In an online survey, data was collected from 15 open-ended questions. The study had 52 participants, ranging in age from 21 to 37, and found that most online daters consider themselves (and others) mostly honest in their online self-presentation. Online daters who used deception were motivated to do so by the desire to attract partners and project a positive self-image. Daters were willing to overlook deception in others if they viewed the dishonesty as a slight exaggeration or a characteristic of little value to the dater. Despite deception, participants believe that the online-dating environment can develop successful romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Wagner|first=Lyndsey|type=Master's thesis|title=Interpersonal Relationships and Online Dating|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/masters/210/|publisher=[[Liberty University]]|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishak Pasha Palace''' ({{lang-tr|İshak Paşa Sarayı}}) is a semi-ruined palace and administrative complex located in the [[Doğubeyazıt]] district of [[Ağrı province]] of eastern [[Turkey]].

The Ishak Pasha palace is an [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman-period]] palace whose construction was started in 1685 by Colak Abdi Pasha of the Cildirogullari&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erdin|first=Nurgun|last2=Tirak|first2=Kamile|date=2009-09-01|title=Identification of Wooden Objects in Ishak Pasha Palace|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/download/article-file/174711|journal=Istanbul Universitesi Orman Fakultesi Dergisi|volume=59|pages=126|via=dergipark.gov.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the bey of Beyazit province. Construction was continued by his son İshak Pasha and completed by his grandson Mehmet Pasha. According to the inscription on its door, the [[Harem]] Section of the palace was completed by his grandson Ishak (Isaac) Pasha in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Verity Campbell - Turkey - 2007 - 724 pages, page 586, {{ISBN|1-74104-556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ishak Pasha Palace is one of the few examples of surviving historical Turkish palaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The palace was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 100 [[Turkish lira|new lira]] banknote of 2005-2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]   {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=2009-06-03 }}.

'''Lawrence Davidson''' is a retired professor of history from [[West Chester University]] in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/31/what-drives-us-policy-toward-israel/|title=What Drives US Policy Toward Israel?|date=31 March 2016|publisher=[[CounterPunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2016}} He is the author of ''Islamic Fundamentalism'', ''Cultural Genocide'' and has focused his academic research on American foreign relations with the Middle East.

== Early life and education ==
Davidson was born to a secular Jewish household in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania in 1945. He attended [[Rutgers University]] from 1963–1967 where he earned his bachelor's degree in history. While attending Rutgers, Davidson developed a leftist perspective regarding the problems facing the US in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1967, Davidson was accepted into [[Georgetown University]] Master's program where he studied modern European intellectual history under the Palestinian expatriate professor [[Hisham Sharabi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} During his time at Georgetown University (1969–1970), Davidson became one of the founding members of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) at Georgetown University at the height of the Vietnam Conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Lawrence. 1967. [Georgetown University Students for a Democratic Society papers].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2016}} {{Unreliable source?|date=July 2016}}

In 1970, with the breakup of the SDS, Davidson left the United States for Canada.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He spent the next six years at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton where he earned his PhD (1976) in modern European Intellectual history.

After returning to the United States in the mid 1970s, Davidson spent several years as an adjunct instructor at various colleges and universities, as well as working for a time as a middle manager at [[Alexian Brothers]] Health Systems Catholic hospital in St. Louis. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}Subsequently, he was contracted to write the history of [[Alexian Brothers]]’ oldest hospital. This led to his first book length work, The Alexian Brothers of Chicago (1990).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexianbrothers.org/?id=2531&amp;sid=21&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2016}}

In 1989, Davidson joined the faculty of history at [[West Chester University]] as a tenure track professor where he taught Middle East history, the history of science, and modern European intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-wells/professor-lawrence-davids_b_821449.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2016}} He remained at this institution for 27 years and maintained a productive publishing record.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He retired from WCU in May of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcupa.edu/arts-humanities/History/retiredFaculty.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Davidson writes for his Blog ''" To The Point Analyses"'' and is a contributing editor for [[Logos: A Journal of Modern Society and Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://logosjournal.com/editors-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson is a board member of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, alongside such notables as [[Hamid Dabashi]], [[Ilan Pappé]], [[Michel Shehadeh]], and honorary advisory board member [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usacbi.org/advisory-board/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Genocide (2012) ==
In 2012, Davidson wrote the book ''"Cultural Genocide"''. Davidson defines cultural genocide as the ‘''purposeful destructive targeting of out-group cultures so as to destroy or weaken them in the process of conquest or domination.’''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plurilogue.com/2013/09/cultural-genocide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715035857/http://www.plurilogue.com/2013/09/cultural-genocide.html |archivedate=2016-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2016}}

Many [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have written [[autobiographies]] about their presidencies and/or (some periods of) their life before their time in office. Some 19th-century U.S. presidents who wrote autobiographies are James Buchanan and Ulysses S. Grant, though Grant's autobiography is about his time as General during the U.S. Civil War and not about his presidency. Some of the more recent U.S. presidential autobiographies, such as Bill Clinton's, George W. Bush's, and Barack Obama's (written and published before he was elected president) sold well enough to earn them millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7331834.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Clintons' earnings exceed $100m |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Mann, Washington |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/man-of-steel-barely-rates-a-mention-in-bush-memoirs-20101110-17nrf.html |title='Man of Steel' barely rates a mention in Bush memoirs |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list includes societies that have been identified as [[matrilineal]] or [[matrilocal]] in ethnographic literature.

"Matrilineal" means property is passed down through the maternal line on the death of the mother, not that of the father.

The Akans of Ghana, West Africa, are matrlineals. Akans are the largest ethnic group in Ghana. They are made of the Akims, Asantes, Fantis, Akuapims, Kwahus, Denkyiras, Brongs, Akwamus, Krachis etc.

"Matrilocal" means new families are established in proximity to the brides' extended family of origin, not that of the groom.

Note: ''separate'' in the marriage column refers to the practice of husbands and wives living in separate locations, often informally called ''[[walking marriage]]s''. See the articles for the specific cultures that practice this for further description.

In a number of islands, including Lesbos, Lemnos, Naxos, and Kos, matrilineal succession to real property was the rule at the end of the 18th century A.D. The facts were reported by an English traveller, John Hawkins, who wrote: "In the large number of the islands, the eldest daughter takes as her inheritance a portion of the family house, together with its furniture, and one third of the share of the maternal property, which in reality in most of these cases constitutes the chief means of subsistence; the other daughters, when they marry off in succession, are likewise entitled to (a portion of) the family house and the same share of whatever property remains. These observations were applicable to the islands of Mytilin (Lesbos), Lemnos, Scopelo, Skyros, Syra, Zea Ipsera, Myconi, Paros, Naxia, Siphno, Santorini and Cos, where I have either collected my information in person or had obtained it through others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Sayers Peden''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[translator]] and professor emerita of Spanish at the [[University of Missouri]]. She lives and works in [[Columbia, Missouri]].

==Life and career==
Her work covers nearly every genre — poetry, novel, theater and [[belles lettres]] — from the 16th century to today. Peden received her bachelor's (1948), master's (1963) and doctorate (1966) from the University of Missouri. She started translating while working toward her doctorate in 1964. Peden was writing on [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[playwright]] [[Emilio Carballido]] and came across a small novel Carballido had written. Peden shared the book with her former late husband, William Peden, who said, "You know I don't read Spanish. Why don't you translate it for me?" So she did.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/lost-without-translation-margaret-sayers-peden-on-work-as-a-translator/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carballido's ''The Norther'' (El Norte) became her first published translation in 1970. She continued translating and teaching at the University of Missouri until she retired from teaching in 1989. She still translates works today. 

In 2010, Peden's translation of [[Fernando de Rojas]]' ''[[La Celestina]]'' won the 2010 [http://www.atanet.org/membership/honorsandawards_lewis.php Lewis Galantiere Translation Prize], which the [[American Translators Association]] awards every other year to a book-length literary translation.&lt;ref&gt;http://interact.stltoday.com/pr/business/PR01181102025199&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, she received the [[PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation|Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation]] from the [[PEN American Center]]. Named in honor of U.S. translator [[Ralph Manheim]], this literary award is given every three years to a translator whose career has demonstrated a commitment to excellence through the body of her work. The medal is awarded in recognition of a lifetime achievement in the field of literary translation.&lt;ref&gt;http://coas.missouri.edu/news/2012/peden.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout Peden's career, she has translated more than 60 books from Spanish to English and is considered one of the leading translators of her time.&lt;ref&gt;http://mizzoumagarchives.missouri.edu/2011-Spring/columns/peden-translates-book-into-national-prize/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''modius''' is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress or crown found in [[ancient Egyptian art]] and art of the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a [[ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of dry measure]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 245; Irene Bald Romano, ''Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, And Roman Stone Sculpture in the University Of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably does represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.

The modius is worn by certain deities, including [[Mut]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsy M. Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen from the Reign of Amenhotep III," in ''Servant of Mut: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Fazzini'' (Brill, 2007), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian deities]] and their Roman counterparts, the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Ephesian Artemis]] and certain other forms of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Didyma: Apollo's Oracle, Cult, and Companions'' pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture: The Styles of ca. 331–200 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On some deities it represents fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, ''Didyma'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be a form mostly restricted to supernatural beings in art, and by rarely worn in real life, with two probable exceptions.  A tall modius is part of the complex headdress used for portraits of Egyptian queens, ornamented variously with symbols, vegetative motifs, and the [[uraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen," p 36ff.; Paul Edmund Stanwick, ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings As Egyptian Pharaohs'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), p. 35 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the distinctive headdress of [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, ''Classical Sculpture,'' p. 294; Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myrtle Florence Broome''' (22 February 1888 – 27 January 1978) was a British [[Egyptologist]] and artist known for her illustrated work with [[Amice Calverley]] on the Temple of [[Seti I|Set I]] at Abydos in Egypt and her paintings of Egyptian village life in the 1920s and 1930s.

== Early life and education ==
Myrtle Florence Broome was born on 22 February 1888 in [[Muswell Hill]], London, England to Eleanor Slater and Washington Herbert Broome.&lt;ref name="artefacts"&gt;{{cite web|last1=AE|title=Myrtle Florence Broome|url=http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/people/myrtle-florence-broome|website=Artefacts of Excavation: British Excavations in Egypt 1880–1890|publisher=Griffin Institute|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her art training at a school in [[Bushey]] founded by Sir [[Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref name="ruffle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruffle|first1=John|title=Myrtle Florence Broome|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Broome_Myrtle%20Florence.pdf|website=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archeology|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1911 to 1913 she attended [[University College London]] and obtained a Certificate in Egyptology. Her teachers were Sir [[Flinders Petrie]] and [[Margaret Murray]].&lt;ref name="egyptology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bierbrier|first1=Morris|title=Who was who in Egyptology|date=2012|publisher=Egyptian Exploration Society|location=London|isbn=0-85698-207-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epigraphy career in Egypt ==
In 1927, Broome was  invited to participate in a project being conducted in Egypt by the British School of Archeology. The participants, including archeologist [[Olga Tufnell]], copied tomb inscriptions at Qua-El-Kebi, Egypt.&lt;ref name="egyptology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;

In 1929, Broome returned to Egypt to work as an artist with  Canadian epigrapher  [[Amice Calverley]]. Calverley had been hired by the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] in 1927 to copy the wall scenes in the Temple of Seti I, c. 1300 BC at Abydos. In the winter of 1928, a visit to [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] by Mr. and Mrs. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] changed the scope of the work being done.  Rockefeller was so impressed with the painted reliefs and Calverley's photography like reproductions, that he decided to finance the entire project.  As a patron of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], he was also responsible for the Oriental Institute joining efforts on the temple endeavor with the Egypt Exploration Society.&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;

[[File:AbydosSetiChapelRelief145.jpg|thumb|Example of a relief in Temple Chapel of Osiris, Temple of Seti I, Abydos, Egypt]]

Calverley was appointed director of the Temple project. With the increased funds, Broome was hired as Calverley's assistant in 1929. During eight seasons at the Temple, the two women were responsible for all the paintings and replications, with the help of a small staff of artists.  Besides using large photographs to record the reliefs, the artists penciled over lines and inscriptions for a completely accurate rendering.&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;

Broome and Calverley also used watercolor paintings to provide color to the reproductions, because only black and white photography was available at the time. The result of that effort is four volumes with coloured plates published by the University of Chicago between 1933 and 1958.&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calverley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lesko|first1=Barbara|title=Amice Mary Calverley (1896–1959)|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Caverley_Amice%20Mary.pdf|website=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archeology1|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists lived together in a mudbrick house near the temple with two local servants. Broome and Calverley were actively involved in the life of the village, participating in feasts and ceremonies and often providing medical assistance to the villagers. The two women traveled together throughout Egypt, taking trains and often driving across the desert in a [[Jowett Cars|Jowett car]] they named Joey; Broome's impressions from that time are noted in letters and illustrations that were sent to her parents.&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;

Broome retired from [[Egyptology]] in 1937 and returned to England due to her father's illness.&lt;ref name="egyptology" /&gt; She later painted a number of watercolours of Egyptian villages and the surrounding landscape. Over seventy of her paintings are on permanent exhibit at the [[Bushey Museum]] in [[Bushey]], England.&lt;ref name="bushey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myrtle Broome 1888–1978|url=https://artuk.org/discover/artists/broome-myrtle-18881978|website=Art UK|publisher=Bushey Museum|accessdate=14 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415013308/https://artuk.org/discover/artists/broome-myrtle-18881978|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broome's letters and papers are at the Griffith Institute in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="egyptology" /&gt;

== Design and craft career in England ==

Broome's father, Washington Herbert Broome was a music and book publisher.&lt;ref name="ruffle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon" /&gt;  He was a contemporary of [[William Morris]], an influential designer in the British [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. W. Broome worked with Morris at the Kelmscott Press before establishing The Old Bourne Press with [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]]. In 1907, W. Broome built a house in Bushey that is now listed as a historically interesting building with [[Historic England]]. The Broome house "Avalon" was designed and built in the  late Arts and Crafts Style.  Myrtle Broome created painted panels and decorations throughout the house. She is also mentioned as being a designer and a craft worker, who designed for [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]].&lt;ref name="avalon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=HE|title=Avalon|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1259291|website=Historic England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avalon is also listed as the home of Myrtle and Washington Broomes' business – "Designers and Workers in Metal and Enamel". Historic England describes the house as being "of special interest as a building created for a designer and craftsman of the Arts and Crafts movement, containing a rich variety of decorative elements of the period designed by Broome and his daughter."&lt;ref name="avalon" /&gt;

'''PRONOM''' is a [[world wide web|web]]-based technical registry to support [[digital preservation]] services, developed by [[The National Archives (UK)|The National Archives of the United Kingdom]]. PRONOM was the first and remains, to date, the only operational public [[file format]] registry in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue46/rusbridge/|title=Excuse Me... Some Digital Preservation Fallacies?|work=ariadne.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwi-iuk.org/cashmere/htdocs/html/workshop/presentations/van_wijngaarden_format_registries.pdf Van Wijngaarden, H. (2005) Format Registries, ''CASHMERE-int Workshop on Preservation and DC-tools: Standards and standardization activities, Goettingen'': 6]&lt;/ref&gt; although the "Magic File" repository of the [[File (command)|File Command]] has served this role in a less formal capacity for two decades. Other projects to develop technical registries, including the UK [[Digital Curation Centre]]'s Representation Information Registry, and the [[Global Digital Format Registry]] project at [[Harvard University]], are now in progress.

PRONOM's origins lie in a requirement to have access to reliable technical information about the electronic records held by The National Archives. By definition, electronic records are not inherently human-readable - file formats encode information into a form which can only be processed and rendered comprehensible by very specific technological environments. The accessibility of that information is therefore highly vulnerable to [[digital obsolescence|technological obsolescence]]. Technical information about the structure of those file formats, and the [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] environments required to support them, is therefore a prerequisite for any digital preservation regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub93/contents.html|title=Contents|work=clir.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRONOM was developed to provide this function, initially as an internal resource for National Archives staff, and subsequently as public, web-based resource.

__TOC__

== Development ==
The first version of PRONOM was developed by The National Archives digital preservation department in March 2002. PRONOM 2 was released in December 2002, and provided support for the development of multi-lingual versions of the registry. The web-enabling of PRONOM (PRONOM 3) in February 2004 represented the starting point for the development of PRONOM as a major online resource for the international digital preservation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews7-5.html#feature2|title=OCLC: Worldwide, member-owned library cooperative - Global|work=rlg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRONOM 4, released in October 2005, includes a significant reworking of the underlying data model to allow the capture of detailed technical information on file formats and support future interoperability with other planned registry systems, and the release of the DROID software for automatic file format identification.

The latest version PRONOM 5 was a relatively minor update to support improvements to DROID and was released in 2006. A much more substantial update is planned for 2007, which will include the exposure of core PRONOM functions through [[web service]]s [[interface (computer science)|interfaces]].  This work forms part of the Seamless Flow programme to position The National Archives to receive and manage future government records in electronic formats.

In future, PRONOM may participate as a node in the planned [[Global Digital Format Registry]] project.

The National Archives won the 2007 [[Digital Preservation Award]] sponsored by the [[Digital Preservation Coalition]], for its work on PRONOM and DROID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/advocacy/press/award2007.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704044547/http://www.dpconline.org/graphics/advocacy/press/award2007.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=404 - Digital Preservation Coalition|author=CyberMedia|work=dpconline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

The core technical registry supports a number of specific services:

The PRONOM registry provides a searchable web database of technical information about file formats, the software tools required to access them, and the technical environments required to access them. Users can search for formats and software using a variety of criteria, such as format or software name and [[file extension]]. PRONOM also holds information about support periods for software products, and can also be queried on this basis. In addition to on-screen viewing, registry information can be exported in [[XML]], [[comma-separated values|CSV]] and printer-friendly formats. The PRONOM website allows users to submit new information for inclusion in PRONOM.

=== The PRONOM Persistent Unique Identifier (PUID) scheme ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[File format]] --&gt;

The PRONOM Persistent Unique Identifier (PUID) is an extensible scheme of persistent, unique and unambiguous [[identifier]]s for records in the PRONOM registry. Such identifiers are fundamental to the exchange and management of digital objects, by allowing human or automated user agents to unambiguously identify, and share that identification of, the representation information required to support access to an object. This is a virtue both of the inherent uniqueness of the identifier, and of its binding to a definitive description of the representation information in a registry such as PRONOM.

At present, the PUID scheme is limited to one particular class of representation information: the [[file format|format]] in which a digital object is encoded. Formats were considered a particular priority for such a scheme, as no existing, universally applicable system provides for this. [[Unix]] [[magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[resource fork|data forks]] do provide some of this functionality, but the same is not true within [[DOS]] or [[Microsoft Windows]] environments. The three-character [[file extension]] is neither standardised nor unique, and is interpreted differently by different environments. Equally, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] [[MIME]]-type scheme does not provide sufficient granularity or coverage to satisfy the requirements for unique identifiers. The PUID scheme has been developed for the single purpose of providing such identifiers.

The scheme has been adopted as the recommended encoding scheme for describing file formats in the latest version of the ''UK e-Government Metadata Standard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/egms-metadata-standard.pdf UK e-Government Metadata Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is designed to be extensible, and may be expanded in future to include other classes of representation information in PRONOM, such as [[data compression|compression methods]], [[character encoding|character encoding schemes]], and [[operating system]]s.

PUIDs can be expressed as [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s using the &lt;tt&gt;info:pronom/&lt;/tt&gt; namespace, details of which are available from the [[info URI]] registry. Neither the PUID scheme, nor its expression as an info URI, supports any inherent dereferencing mechanism, i.e. a PUID does not resolve to a [[Uniform Resource Locator]]. However, The National Archives is planning to develop a range of services to expose PRONOM registry content, including a resolution service for PUIDs.

=== DROID ===

DROID (Digital Record Object Identification) is a software tool developed by The National Archives to perform automated batch identification of file formats. It is one of a planned series of tools utilising PRONOM to provide specific digital preservation services. DROID uses internal (byte sequence) and external (file extension) signatures to identify and report the specific file format versions of digital files. These signatures are stored in an XML signature file, generated from information recorded in the PRONOM technical registry. New and updated signatures are regularly added to PRONOM, and DROID can be configured to automatically download updated signature files from the PRONOM website via [[web service]]s.

DROID allows files and folders to be selected from a file system for identification. After the identification process had been run, the results can be output in [[XML]], [[comma-separated values|CSV]] or printer-friendly formats.

DROID is a platform-independent [[Java (Sun)|Java]] tool. It includes a documented, public [[API]], and can be invoked from both [[GUI]] and [[command line]] interfaces.

=== Future services ===
Proposed future services include format risk assessments and preservation planning, and the automated generation of migration pathways for converting between formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=20571#article1|title=OCLC: Worldwide, member-owned library cooperative - Global|work=rlg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
A '''picture dictionary''' or '''pictorial dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] where the definition of a word is displayed in the form of a drawing or photograph. Picture dictionaries are useful in a variety of teaching environments, such as teaching a young child about their [[native language]], or instructing older students in a [[foreign language]], such as in the [[Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon]]. Picture dictionaries are often organized by topic instead of being an alphabetic list of words, and almost always include only a small corpus of words.

A similar but distinct concept is the [[visual dictionary]], which is composed of a series of large, labelled images, allowing the user to find the name of a specific component of a larger object.

The term '''political radicalism''' (in [[political science]] known as [[Radicalization|radicalism]]) denotes [[Politics|political]] principles focused on [[Social change|altering]] [[social structure]]s through [[revolution]]ary or other means and changing [[Value (ethics)|value systems]] in fundamental ways.

Derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:radix#Latin|radix]]}} ("root"), the denotation of radical has changed since its eighteenth-century coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum—yet it retains the "change at the root" connotation fundamental to [[revolutionary]] societal change. Historically, [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] has referred exclusively to the radical left (under the single category of [[far-left politics]]) and rarely incorporating [[far-right politics]]—though these may have [[revolutionary]] elements. The prominent exception is in the [[United States of America|United States]], where some{{quantify|date=January 2017}}{{who|date=August 2018}} consider radicalism to include both political extremes of the radical left and the [[Radical right (United States)|radical right]]. In traditional labels of the spectrum of political thought, the opposite of radical – on the "[[Right-wing politics|right]]" of the political spectrum – is termed "[[reactionary]]".

The nineteenth-century ''[[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]]'' (1881, 1889) reports that "radicalism is characterized less by its principles than by the manner of their application".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]], Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States'', 1893, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l-J3vOPWd50C&amp;pg=PA492&amp;dq=%22radicalism+is%22&amp;lr= p. 492, article "Radicalism"], by [[Maurice Block]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] often used the term "radical" [[pejorative]]ly whereas contemporary left radicals used the term "conservative" derogatorily,&lt;ref&gt;Mike Sanders (ed.) (2001), ''Women and Radicalism in the Nineteenth Century'', {{ISBN|0-415-20526-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4ucbBfkoQC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=%22radicalism+is%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=lPpumOh7NWu_qt7zy1AiQP5rCcM "General Introduction"].&lt;/ref&gt; thus contemporary denotations of "radical", "radicalism" and "political radicalism" comprise far-left ([[hard left]],&lt;ref name="March2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luke March|title=Radical Left Parties in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xF3FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1724|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-57897-7|page= 1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[radicalism (historical)|radical left]])&lt;ref&gt;Edward Walter (1992), ''The Rise and Fall of Leftist Radicalism in America'', {{ISBN|0-275-94276-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and far-right ([[Far-right politics|hard right]], [[Far-right politics|radical right]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Abcarian (1971), ''American Political Radicalism: Contemporary Issues and Orientations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' records the first political usage of "radical" as ascribed to the [[Whigs (British political party)|British Whig Party]] [[Parliament of England|parliamentarian]] [[Charles James Fox]], who in 1797 proposed a "radical reform" of the [[electoral system]], [[Suffrage|franchise]] to provide [[universal manhood suffrage]], thereby [[idiom]]atically establishing "radical" to denote supporters of the reformation of the British Parliament. Throughout the nineteenth century, the term was combined{{by whom?|date=January 2017}} with political notions and doctrines, thus producing the concepts of [[working class]] radicalism, [[middle class]]-, philosophic-, democratic- [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]-, [[Tory]]- and plebeian radicalism. In the event, politically influential radical leaders give rise to their own trend of political radicalism (see [[Thomas Spence|Spencean radicalism]] and [[Richard Carlile|Carlilean radicalism]]). Philosophically, the French political scientist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) is the principal theoretician proposing "political radicalism" as feasible in [[republic]]an [[political philosophy]], ''[[Viz.|viz]]'' the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and other modern revolutions—the antithesis to the [[liberalism]] of [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10969/Radicals-Radicalism-Radical-Liberalism.html|title=Radicals/Radicalism - Radical Liberalism|author=&lt;!-- Not stated. --&gt;|date=|website=science.jrank.org|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is an [[oil painting]] on panel attributed to the workshop of the [[early Netherlandish]] painter [[Jan van Eyck]], dated to 1442 (the year after the master's death) and now in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]].

==History==
Since the date on the painting is subsequent to Jan van Eyck's death (June 1441), it is likely that the work, left unfinished, had been completed by members of his workshop, or his brother Lambert.

A work with a similar subject is mentioned in the inventories of  [[Palazzo Medici]], in [[Florence]], which had been drawn up after the death of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1492. Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s [[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1480).

==Description==

The painting depicts [[Saint Jerome]] in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and [[Galero|hat]], and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests. Below is a lion, recalling the saint's legend in which he had extracted a thorn from the paw of the animal, who had later remained loyal to him. The light enters from a window behind the writing desk and from the foreground, in order to illuminate any detail of the scene. Objects on the desk and the shelves include an [[hourglass]], a [[pounce (calligraphy)|pounce pot]], a [[ruler]], an [[astrolabe]], numerous [[book]]s and writing instruments, all suitable for the idealized man of the [[Renaissance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">In 2017, the term '''[[sapphire]] jubilee''' or '''blue sapphire jubilee''' was coined for the celebrations to mark the 65th anniversary of the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] (see [[Sapphire Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]]). Previously, the sapphire [[wedding anniversary]] was understood to be the 45th, and this would be expected to carry over to regnal anniversaries as with silver, golden, and diamond jubilees.

The '''Sole Survivor Policy''' or [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] Directive 1315.15 "Special Separation Policies for Survivorship" describes a set of regulations in the [[Military of the United States]] that are designed to protect members of a family from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] or from [[Combat|combat duty]] if they have already lost family members in military service.

==History==
The issue that gave rise to the regulations first caught public attention after the five [[Sullivan brothers]] were all killed when the [[USS Juneau (CL-52)|USS ''Juneau'' (CL-52)]] was sunk during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6963267.stm US 'sole survivor' to leave Iraq]", ''[[BBC News]]'', 25 August 2007. Retrieved 31 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was enacted as law in 1948. No nominally peacetime restriction was in place until 1964 during the [[Vietnam War]]; in 1971, Congress amended the law to include not only the sole surviving son or daughter, but also any son or daughter who had a combat-related death in the family. Since then, each branch of the military has made its own policies with regard to separating immediate family members.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;Powers, Rod; "[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/deploymentsconflicts/a/solesurviving.htm Sole Surviving Son or Daughter]", ''[[About.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Before the Sole Survivor Policy was officially implemented in 1948, several occasions occurred when sole survivors were excused from active service.

In [[World War II]], the [[Borgstrom brothers]], Elmer, Clyde, and twins Rolon and Rulon, were killed within a few months of each other in 1944.  Their parents then successfully petitioned for their son Boyd, who was also on active duty, to be released from service.  Their sixth son, Elton, who had not yet reached conscription age, was exempted from military service.

The three Butehorn brothers of [[Bethpage, New York]], Charles, Joseph, and Henry, were all deployed during World War II.  After Charles was killed in action in France in 1944 and Joseph was killed in action in the Pacific in 1945, Henry, who was serving with the Army Air Forces in Italy, was ordered home by the War Department.  The "[[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]" post in Bethpage is named after their sacrifice.

In the case of the [[Niland brothers]], U.S. intelligence believed that all but one of four siblings were killed in action.  The eldest brother, Technical Sergeant Edward Niland, of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], was later found to have been held in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in [[Burma]]. The [[Academy Award|academy-award]] winning film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], was loosely based on the Niland brothers' story.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Alex (11 May 2004). The Bedford Boys: One American Town's Ultimate D-day Sacrifice. Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|0-306-81355-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Borgstrom and Butehorn incidents occurred before the Sole Survivor Policy was put into effect in 1948. They, along with the deaths of all of the Sullivan brothers in 1942, helped lead to it. 

Jason and Nathan Hubbard joined the army after their brother Jared had died in Iraq in 2004.  In 2007, Nathan died in a helicopter crash.  Military officials ordered Jason home shortly after.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Jeremy, Ben, and Beau Wise served in active combat roles in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]]. Jeremy, a former [[Navy SEAL]], was at a [[CIA]] base as a [[military contractor]] and was killed in 2009 when a [[suicide bomb]]er attacked the base. Later in 2011, Ben, an [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Army Special Forces]] [[combat medic]], was seriously wounded in Afghanistan and died of his injuries at [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]]. Beau was deployed in Afghanistan with the Marines at that time and was immediately relieved of combat duties and returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/double-sacrifice-family-loses-sons-afghanistan-150204154.html|title=Double sacrifice: Family loses sons in Afghanistan|last=NUSS|first=JEANNIE|date=11 March 2012|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=ONE FAMILY, TWO SACRIFICES — In a war few Americans fought, the Wises would pay an awful price| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2014/01/18/one-family-two-sacrifices/| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
This policy protects "only sons/daughters", "the last son/daughter to carry the family name", and "sole surviving sons/daughters" only during [[peacetime]].&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt; In times of [[state of emergency|war or national emergency]] as declared by the [[US Congress]], this provision does not apply to any of the above. Also, this provision is voluntary, meaning that the member wishing to be sent home has to request for the policy to be applied and get his application approved. Furthermore, it does not apply strictly to the sole surviving son but also to all surviving sons.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;

Members of the Armed Forces who are not eligible for Department of Defense Directive 1315.15, "Special Separation Policies for Survivorship", include those who currently have [[court-martial]] charges pending against them or those who have been convicted by court-martial. 

The policy was changed to allow both enlisted and officers to apply for this discharge. If members of the Armed Forces re-enlist or voluntarily extend their active duty beyond the requirement after having been notified of a death in the family, those members automatically becomes ineligible.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/131515p.pdf DoD Special Separation Policies for Survivorship Directive]", [[United States Department of Defense]], this reference confirmed on 20 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">'''Storybook Activities for Improving Language''' ('''SAIL''') was an intervention where [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] teachers were trained to use storybook reading to improve the literacy skills, particularly vocabulary skills,  of preschool children. All of the children were enrolled in Head Start classrooms in [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]], [[Oregon]], who were also participants in [[Project STAR]] a larger study conducted by the [[University of Oregon]]. The intervention included activities that targeted [[vocabulary]], comprehension, and narrative ability. It was conducted for twenty minutes a day, approximately four days a week for eight weeks.

The trained teachers were instructed to read assigned storybooks to their classrooms for the allotted period of time. The storybooks used in the intervention were [[age appropriate]], had numerous distinct sequence events, and varied vocabulary. Three vocabulary words were assigned per book to be introduced to the preschoolers that were related to the story and likely to be unfamiliar words. Some examples of selected words were ukulele, magician, optometrist, flashlight, crane, and restaurant. Activities were planned for all four days the book was assigned.

== Procedure ==
On the first day, children were introduced to the author, and had the opportunity to predict the events of the story based on the cover of the book. The teacher read the story, pausing to define assigned vocabulary words. At the conclusion of the story, the teachers asked comprehension questions.

On the second day, the teacher re-introduced the author and reminded the children of the three assigned vocabulary words. The teachers showed pictures of the vocabulary words and discussed broader categories that these words could fall into (e.g., "elk" falls into the category of "animals").

On the third day, students retold the story using the pictures in the book, and were encouraged to use the three vocabulary words while retelling the story. The teacher then asked review-oriented questions focusing on the vocabulary words.

On the final day, the children acted out events of the story beginning by stating the three vocabulary words. The children were assigned to play different roles of characters in the story.

== Results ==
Preschoolers who participated in the intervention improved on measures of vocabulary and narrative ability. However, there were no significant gains in comprehension or [[Print Awareness]]. This study differed from previous studies in that it took place in a large group setting, to accommodate the resources available in typical [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs, and in that teachers spent four days on one storybook. The study further supported that reading aloud to children may not be a sufficient practice to increase literacy skill.

== Background ==
Born in the west Ukrainian town of [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanislav]] (since 1962 Ivano-Frankivsk) to a Belarusian father and a Ukrainian mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering the Great Patriotic War was a political act|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21725273-svetlana-alexievichs-unwomanly-face-war-was-part-peculiarly-soviet-debate|accessdate=21 July 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetlana Alexievich grew up in Belarus. After finishing school she worked as a reporter in several local newspapers before graduating from [[Belarusian State University]] (1972) and becoming a correspondent for the literary magazine ''Nyoman'' in [[Minsk]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://who.bdg.by/obj.php?&amp;kod=262 Brief biography of Svetlana Alexievich (Russian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918014331/http://who.bdg.by/obj.php?&amp;kod=262 |date=2014-09-18 }}, from ''Who is who in Belarus''&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career in journalism, Alexievich specialised in crafting narratives based on witness testimonies. In the process, she wrote [[oral histories]] of several dramatic events in Soviet history: the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/4-books-read-svetlana-alexievitch-nobel-prize-literature-winner-ukrainian-belarusian-2132614|title=4 Books To Read By Svetlana Alexievitch, Nobel Prize Literature Winner And Ukrainian-Belarusian Author|date=2015-10-08|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-svetlana-alexievich-20151206-story.html|title=Svetlana Alexievich's 'Zinky Boys' gives voice to the voiceless|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[fall of the Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/svetlana-alexievich-wins-2015-nobel-prize-in-literature|title=Svetlana Alexievich wins 2015 Nobel prize in literature|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2015-10-08|last2=Harding|first2=Luke|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=agencies|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[political persecution]] by the [[Alexander Lukashenko|Lukashenko]] administration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lannan.org/bios/svetlana-alexievich Biography of Aleksievich] at Lannan Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; she left Belarus in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svetlana Alexievich: The Empire Will Not Pass Away Without Bloodshed|url=http://belarusians.co.uk/2014/09/18/svetlana-alexievich-the-empire-will-not-pass-away-without-bloodshed/|date=18 September 2014|website=www.belarusians.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919065259/http://belarusians.co.uk/2014/09/18/svetlana-alexievich-the-empire-will-not-pass-away-without-bloodshed/|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Cities of Refuge Network]] offered her sanctuary and during the following decade she lived in Paris, Gothenburg and Berlin.

== Literary work ==
Alexievich's books trace the emotional history of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and post-Soviet individual through carefully constructed collages of interviews.&lt;ref name=Alter8Oct&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/books/svetlana-alexievich-nobel-prize-literature.html|date=8 October 2015|accessdate=8 October 2015|title=Svetlana Alexievich Wins Nobel Prize in Literature|work=The New York Times|first=Alexandra|last=Alter}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian writer and critic [[Dmitry Bykov]], her books owe much to the ideas of Belarusian writer [[Ales Adamovich]], who felt that the best way to describe the horrors of the 20th century was not by creating fiction but through recording the testimonies of witnesses.&lt;ref name=bykov.echo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Быков|first1=Дмитрий|title=О присуждении Светлане Алексиевич Нобелевской премии по литературе|url=http://echo.msk.ru/programs/beseda/1636786-echo/|publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}} {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belarusian poet [[Uladzimir Nyaklyayew]] called Adamovich "her literary godfather".

Rough translation: "If the entire Russian literature came, as [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] stated, from the [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]'s ''Overcoat'', then the entire writings of Alexievich came from the documentary book of Ales Adamovich, Yanka Bryl and Uladzimir Kalesnik ''I'm from the flamy village''. Adamovich is her literary godfather".&lt;/ref&gt; Alexievich has confirmed the influence of Adamovich and Belarusian writer [[Vasil Bykaŭ]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svetlana Alexievich: It is not my victory alone, but also a victory of our culture and the country|url=http://eng.belta.by/culture/view/svetlana-alexievich-it-is-not-my-victory-alone-but-also-a-victory-of-our-culture-and-the-country-86012-2015/|publisher=[[Belarusian Telegraph Agency]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regards [[Varlam Shalamov]] as the best writer of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BBC151224&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2015/12/151224_alexievich_interview_newshour |title=Алексиевич: "Есть мой путь, и я иду этим путём" |language= Russian |trans-title= Alexievich interview |work= BBC |date= 24 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If you look back at the whole of our history, both Soviet and post-Soviet, it is a huge common grave and a blood bath. An eternal dialog of the executioners and the victims. The accursed Russian questions: what is to be done and who is to blame. The revolution, the gulags, the Second World War, the Soviet–Afghan war hidden from the people, the downfall of the great empire, the downfall of the giant socialist land, the land-utopia, and now a challenge of cosmic dimensions – Chernobyl.

'''''Time Team''''' is a British television programme that originally aired on [[Channel 4]] from 16 January 1994 to 7 September 2014. Created by television producer [[Tim Taylor (producer)|Tim Taylor]] and presented by actor [[Tony Robinson]], each episode featured a team of specialists carrying out an [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[Excavation (archaeology)|dig]] over a period of three days, with Robinson explaining the process in lay terms. The specialists changed throughout the programme's run, although it consistently included professional archaeologists such as [[Mick Aston]], [[Carenza Lewis]], [[Francis Pryor]] and [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]]. The sites excavated ranged in date from the [[Palaeolithic]] to the [[Second World War]].

In October 2012, Channel 4 announced that the final series would be broadcast in 2013.&lt;ref name=guardian-time-team-consigns-time-team-to-history&gt;{{cite news |last=Conlan |first=Tara |title=Channel 4 consigns Time Team to TV history |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/19/channel-4-time-team |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 20 was screened from January–March 2013 and nine [[Time Team (specials)|specials]] were screened between May 2013 and September 2014.

==Format==
{{main|List of Time Team episodes}}
At the start of the programme, Tony Robinson explains, in an opening "piece to camera", the reasons for the team's visit to the site and during the dig, he enthusiastically encourages the archaeologists to explain their decisions, discoveries and conclusions. He tries to ensure that everything is comprehensible to the archaeologically uninitiated. The site is frequently suggested by a member of the viewing public. ''Time Team'' uncover as much as they can of the archaeology and history of the site in three days.

Excavations are not just carried out to entertain viewers. Tony Robinson claims that the archaeologists involved with ''Time Team'' have published more scientific papers on excavations carried out in the programme than all British university archaeology departments over the same period and that by 2013, the programme had become the biggest funder of field archaeology in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/biog_tony_garden.html |title=Tony Robinson interview |first=Steve |last=Platt |website=Channel 4 |accessdate=23 October 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/biog_tony_garden.html |archivedate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-03-28/tony-robinson-on-walking-through-history-time-team-and-blackadder |first=Jade |last=Bremner |title=Tony Robinson on Walking Through History, Time Team and Blackadder |website=[[Radio Times]] |date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team members==
A team of [[archaeologist]]s, usually led by [[Mick Aston]] or [[Francis Pryor]] (the latter usually heading [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] digs), including field archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]], congregate at a site, usually in Britain. The original ''Time Team'' line-up from 1994 has altered over the years. Historian [[Robin Bush (historian)|Robin Bush]] was a regular in the first nine series, having been involved with the programme through his long friendship with Mick Aston. [[Architectural historian]] [[Beric Morley]] featured in ten episodes between 1995 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leightonbuzzardonline.co.uk/news/local-news/alzheimers-ends-glittering-career-for-linslade-scholar-1-996041 |title=Alzheimers ends glittering career for Linslade scholar |newspaper=Leighton Buzzard Observer |date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Carenza Lewis]] left to pursue other interests. She was replaced by [[Helen Geake]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] specialist. The regular team also included:&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108961/epcast |title=IMDB Episodes cast for Time Team |accessdate=12 March 2015 |website=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stewart Ainsworth]], [[landscape archaeology|landscape investigator]]; [[John Gater]] and [[Christopher Gaffney (archaeologist)|Chris Gaffney]], [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|archaeological geophysicists]]; Henry Chapman, [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]; [[Victor Ambrus]], [[illustrator]]; and [[Robin Bush (historian)|Robin Bush]], [[archivist]]

The team was supplemented by experts appropriate for the period and type of site. [[Guy de la Bédoyère]] has often been present for [[Roman Empire|Roman]] digs, as well as those involving the [[Second World War]] such as [[D-Day]] and aircraft (such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]). Architectural historian [[Jonathan Foyle]] has appeared in episodes relating to excavations of country estates. Paul Blinkhorn (pottery), Mark Corney (coins) and Jackie McKinley (bones) have appeared from time to time. Mick ‘the dig’ Worthington, an excavator in the early series, occasionally returned as a [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologist]], whereupon he was dubbed 'Mick the twig'. Margaret Cox often assisted with [[forensic archaeology]], mainly between 1998 and 2005. Other specialists who appeared from time to time include historian [[Bettany Hughes]], archaeologist [[Gustav Milne]], East of England specialist [[Ben Robinson]] and David S. Neal, expert on Roman [[mosaic]]s. [[Local history|Local historians]] also joined in when appropriate.

In February 2012, it was announced that Aston had quit the show due to format changes. The disputed changes included hiring anthropologist [[Mary-Ann Ochota]] as a co-presenter, dispensing with other archaeologists and what he thought were plans to "cut down the informative stuff about the archaeology".&lt;ref name="Time Team expert quits after show hires former model"&gt;{{cite web |title=Time Team expert quits after show hires former model |first=Ben |last=Arnold |url=http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/time-team-expert-quits-after-show-hires-former-model-%E2%80%93-daily-tv-round-up.html |website=Yahoo!

We have addressed some of them" and that "you’ve not heard the last of Mick on ''Time Team''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/tim_darch/d/80914164-Tim-Taylor-Statement-regarding-Mick-Aston |first=Tim |last=Taylor |title=Farewell to Mick? |website=Scribd.com |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929231550/http://www.scribd.com/doc/80914164/Tim-Taylor-Statement-regarding-Mick-Aston |archivedate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent regular team members included archaeologist Neil Holbrook, Roman coins specialist Philippa Walton, and historian Sam Newton. Younger members of ''Time Team'' who made regular appearances include:&lt;ref name="IMDB" /&gt; Jenni Butterworth; Raksha Dave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time Team archaeologist Raksha Dave lectures in Leeds |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/leeds/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8858000/8858997.stm |website=BBC Leeds |date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Kerry Ely; Brigid Gallagher; Rob Hedge; Katie Hirst; [[Alex Langlands]]; Cassie Newland; Ian Powlesland; [[Alice Roberts]]; Faye Simpson &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Time Team archaeologist joins Chester |url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/news/2009/02/13 |website=University of Chester |date=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Barney Sloane; Tracey Smith; and Matt Williams.

==Production==
''Time Team'' developed from an earlier Channel 4 programme, ''[[Time Signs]]'', first broadcast in 1991. Produced by Taylor, ''Time Signs'' had featured Aston and Harding, who went on to appear on ''Time Team''. Following that show's cancellation, Taylor went on to develop a more attractive format, producing the idea for ''Time Team'', which Channel 4 also picked up, broadcasting the first series in 1994. ''Time Team'' has had many companion shows during its run, including ''[[Time Team Extra]]'' (1998), ''[[History Hunters]]'' (1998–1999) and ''[[Time Team Digs]]'' (1997–2006), whilst several spin-off books have been published. The programme features special episodes, often [[Documentary film|documentaries]] on history or archaeology and [[live television|live]] episodes. ''[[Time Team America]]'', a US version of the programme, was broadcast on [[PBS]] in 2009 and co-produced by [[Oregon Public Broadcasting]] and Videotext/C4i. The programme has been exported to 35 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/time-team-buried-by-c4/5048025.article |title=Time Team buried by C4 |first=Balihar |last=Khalsa |magazine=Broadcast |location=London |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2013 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Team'' was commissioned by Channel 4 Television (the broadcaster) and made in partnership between VideoText Communications Ltd and Picturehouse Television Co. Ltd (based in [[London]]). Recently formed Wildfire Television was involved in the production of ''The Big Roman Dig'' (2005) and ''The Big Royal Dig'' (2006). It was produced by Tim Taylor, the show's originator, with Associate Producer Tony Robinson.

On 13 September 2007, during the filming of a [[jousting reenactment]] for a special episode of ''Time Team'', a splinter from a [[balsa wood]] [[lance]] went through the eye-slit in the helmet of one of the participants and entered his eye socket. 54-year-old Paul Anthony Allen, a member of a re-enactment society, died a week later in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7060957.stm|title=Fatal jousting accident man named|date=24 October 2007|website=BBC News|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 stated that the programme would be shown, but without the re-enactment sequence. The episode, dedicated to Mr Allen, was transmitted on 25 February 2008.

=== Cancellation ===
In 2012 [[Mick Aston]] announced he was leaving the show criticising format changes that focused less on archaeological activities.&lt;ref name="guardian-time-team-consigns-time-team-to-history" /&gt; Channel 4 subsequently announced that the final ''Time Team'' series would be broadcast in 2013.&lt;ref name="guardian-time-team-consigns-time-team-to-history" /&gt; Viewing figures had been in decline from 2.5 million in 2008 to 1.5 million watching a special called "Brunel's Last Launch" in November 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian-time-team-consigns-time-team-to-history" /&gt;
In October 2013 Tony Robinson said in an interview with ''[[Radio Times]]'' that he believed ''Time Team'' still had life in it and suggested that after a three- or four-year absence it could make a return. He also expressed support for a fan-organised Facebook campaign to bring the ''Time Team'' crew together again to carry out a dig in memory of Aston, who died suddenly on 24 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-12/tony-robinson-i-see-no-reason-why-time-team-cant-return|title=Tony Robinson: I see no reason why Time Team can’t return|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|date=12 October 2013|website=Radio Times|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular ''Time Team'' programme ended on 24 March 2013; the final ''Time Team'' special aired on 7 September 2014.

==Other formats==
{{Main|History Hunters|Time Team Digs|Time Team Extra|Time Team Live|Time Team America}}''Time Team's Big Dig'' was an expansion on the live format. A weekend of live broadcasts in June 2003 was preceded by a week of daily short programmes. It involved about a thousand members of the public in excavating test pits each one metre square by fifty centimetres deep. Most of these pits were in private gardens and the project stirred up controversies about approaches to [[public archaeology]].

''Time Team's Big Roman Dig'' (2005) saw this format altered, in an attempt to avoid previous controversies, through the coverage of nine archaeological sites around the UK which were already under investigation by professional archaeologists. ''Time Team'' covered the action through live link-ups based at a Roman Villa at [[Dinnington, Somerset|Dinnington]] in Somerset - itself a ''Time Team'' excavation from 2003. Over 60 other professionally supervised excavations were supported by ''Time Team'' and carried out around the country in association with the programme. A further hundred activities relating to Roman history were carried out by schools and other institutions around the UK.

''Time Team Specials'' are documentary programmes about topics in history and archaeology made by the same production company. They are generally presented by [[Tony Robinson]] and often feature one or more of the familiar faces from the regular programme of ''Time Team''. In some cases the programme makers have followed the process of discovery at a large commercial or research excavation by another body, such as that to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the ending of the [[First World War]] at the [[Vampire dugout]] in [[Belgium]]. ''Time Team'' usually does not carry out excavations for these programmes, but may contribute a reconstruction.

''Time Team History of Britain'' saw Robinson and the team document everything they have learned up to now and show a history of Britain. ''Behind the Scenes of Time Team'' showed meetings of the archaeologists, and material not transmitted during the episode of the dig. ''10 Years of Time Team'' presented a round-up of what has happened in Time Team over the past 10 years and what they expect to happen in the future.

==Influence==
''Time Team'' has been credited with promoting archaeology in the UK. In a 2008 report produced by [[English Heritage]], a [[working group]] of Palaeolithic specialists recognised the importance of the show in "promoting public awareness" of [[Prehistoric Britain#Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic Britain]], something which they argued was to be encouraged.

'Best Of' DVDs were released in the UK over the years; however, a complete series had never been released until Series 18 was released by [[Acorn Media UK]] on 6 February 2012. On 15 May 2012, Acorn Media released a collection of Roman themed episodes on Region One DVD.

In the [[Avestan]] literature and [[Iranian mythology]], there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: [[Amesha Spenta]] [[Amordad]] (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), [[Gaokerena]] (or white [[Haoma]], a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]] (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), [[Barsom]] (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or [[Haoma]] that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), [[Haoma]] (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title = Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaokerena]] is a large, sacred [[Haoma]] planted by [[Ahura Mazda]]. [[Ahriman]] (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, [[Ahura Mazda]] created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because [[Ahriman]] is responsible for all evil including death, while [[Ahura Mazda]] is responsible for all good (including life).

[[haoma]] is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.

Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit ''soma''. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254670/haoma |title=haoma (Zoroastrianism) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haoma-i |title=HAOMA i. BOTANY – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue in ancient mythology of [[Iran]] is the myth of [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]], two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the [[creation myth]] where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form).

===Ancient Mesopotamia and Urartu===
[[File:Rilievi in alabastro da palazzo di ashurnasirpal II a nimrud, albero sacro, 883-859 ac ca. 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Assyrian tree of life, from [[Nimrud]] panels.]]
The [[Assyria]]n tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and criss-crossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] by human or eagle-headed [[winged genie]]s, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with [[bucket and cone]]. [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name "Tree of Life" has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.
[[File:Urartu Helmet Fragment 2~.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Urartu|Urartian]] tree of life]]

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' is a similar quest for immortality. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Etana searches for a 'plant of birth' to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in [[cylinder seal]]s from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] (2390–2249 [[Common Era|BCE]]).

In ancient [[Urartu]], the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.

===Baha'i Faith===
{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], where it can refer to the [[Manifestation of God]], a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age.  An example of this can be found in the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = Adib |authorlink = Adib Taherzadeh |year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher = George Ronald |place = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8 |url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Cover.html |pages = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazemi, Farshid (2009).

{{bq|"Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awestruck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings. Would ye but sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall that place and those surroundings, and the truth of My utterance should be made evident unto all of you."}}

Also, in the ''[[Tablet of Ahmad (Arabic)|Tablet of Ahmad]]'' of Bahá'u'lláh: "Verily He is the Tree of Life, that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tablet of Ahmad |url=http://www.bahaiprayers.org/ahmad.htm |website=www.bahaiprayers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The ''Bo'' tree, also called ''[[Bodhi]]'' tree,  according to Buddhist tradition, is the pipal ([[Ficus religiosa]]) under which the Buddha sat when he attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) at Bodh Gaya (near Gaya, west-central Bihar state, India). A living pipal at Anuradhapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), is said to have grown from a cutting from the Bo tree sent to that city by King Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70648/Bo-tree |title=Bo tree (tree) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tibetan tradition when Buddha went to the holy Lake Manasorovar along with 500 monks, he took with him the energy of Prayaga Raj. Upon his arrival, he installed the energy of Prayaga Raj near Lake Manasorovar, at a place now known as Prayang. Then he planted the seed of this eternal banyan tree next to Mt. Kailash on a mountain known as the "Palace of Medicine Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1/12/2001 |title=The Kumbha Mela Times |publisher=Kmt.himalayaninstitute.org |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207041420/http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1%2F12%2F2001 |archivedate=December 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:Ⅰ号大型青铜神树.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze Tree with birds, flowers, and ornaments from [[Sanxingdui]]]]
{{see also|Fusang}}
In [[Chinese mythology]], a carving of a tree of life depicts a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] and a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]; the dragon often represents immortality.  A [[Taoism|Taoist]] story tells of a tree that produces a [[peaches of immortality|peach of immortality]] every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An [[archaeological]] discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at [[Sanxingdui]] in [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. Dating from about 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], it contained three [[bronze]] trees, one of them 4 meters high.  At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches.  At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws.  Also found in Sichuan, from the late [[Han dynasty]] (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The [[ceramic]] base is guarded by a horned beast with wings.  The leaves of the tree represent coins and people.  At the apex is a bird with coins and the [[Sun]].

===Christianity===
{{See also|Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil#Christianity}}
The tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22-24 as the source of [[Immortality|eternal life]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who "wash their robes" (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, "they that do his commandments") "have right to the tree of life" (v.14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the "pure river of water of life" which proceeds "out of the throne of God". The river seems to feed two trees of life, one "on either side of the river" which "bear twelve manner of fruits" "and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations" (v.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;The Bible (King James version), The Revelation of St. John, chapter &amp; verses as noted.&lt;/ref&gt; Or this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] has said that "the Cross is the true tree of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Pope-tells-WYD-youth:-the-Cross-of-Jesus-is-the-real-tree-of-life-5864.html |title=Pope tells WYD youth: the Cross of Jesus is the real tree of life |publisher= AsiaNews.it |date= March 20, 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonaventure|Saint Bonaventure]] taught that the medicinal fruit of the tree of life is Christ himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/speculum/1v-tree-of-life.html |title=The Tree of Life |publisher= [[Yale University]] |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albertus Magnus|Saint Albert the Great]] taught that the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], the Body and Blood of Christ, is the Fruit of the Tree of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/994/Fruit_of_the_Tree_of_Life_Albert_the_Great.html |title=The Eucharist as the Fruit of the Tree of Life &amp;#124; Saint Albert the Great |publisher=CrossroadsInitiative.com  |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Augustine|Augustine of Hippo]] said that the tree of life is Christ:
{{quote|All these things stood for something other than what they were, but all the same they were themselves bodily realities. And when the narrator mentioned them he was not employing figurative language, but giving an explicit account of things which had a forward reference that was figurative. So then the tree of life also was Christ... and indeed God did not wish the man to live in Paradise without the mysteries of spiritual things being presented to him in bodily form. So then in the other trees he was provided with nourishment, in this one with a sacrament... He is rightly called whatever came before him in order to signify him.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis, VIII, 4, 8 (On Genesis, New City Press, p. 351-353)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Isaac the Syrian says that "Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained," and that "the tree of life is the love of God" (Homily 72).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main article|Tree of life vision}}
The tree of life vision is a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] described and discussed in the [[Book of Mormon]]. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a [[dream]] by the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], and later in vision by his son [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], who wrote about it in the [[First Book of Nephi]]. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing [[salvation]], with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of [[Jesus]] may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.

The vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity and is a well known and cited story within [[Mormonism]]. A Mormon commentator reflected a common Mormon belief that the vision is "one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures]."&lt;ref&gt;Corbin T. Volluz, "Lehi's Dream of the Tree of Life: Springboard to Prophecy," JBMS 2/2 (1993): 38. - as quoted in  Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life: Understanding the Dream as Visionary Literature, Charles Swift, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 2005.

===Europe===
[[File:Husaby Church 2013 11th century Tree of Life sculpture.jpg|thumb|upright|11th century tree of life sculpture at an ancient [[Sweden|Swedish]] church]]
In ''Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique'' (Paris, 1737), [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]], a famous [[alchemy|alchemist]], identified the tree of life with the [[Elixir of life]] and the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

In ''[[Stephen Oppenheimer#Eden in the East|Eden in the East]]'' (1998), [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in [[Indonesia]] and was diffused by the so-called "Younger Dryas" event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Szechuan), then [[India]] and the [[Middle East]]. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through [[Russia]] to [[Finland]] where the Norse myth of [[Yggdrasil]] took root.

===Georgia===
The [[Borjgali]] ({{lang-ka|ბორჯღალი}}) is an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] tree of life symbol.

===Germanic paganism and Norse mythology===
In [[Germanic paganism]], trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and [[Germanic Neopaganism]], continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.

The tree of life appears in [[Norse mythology|Norse religion]] as ''[[Yggdrasil]]'', the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a [[European yew|yew]] or [[ash tree]]) with extensive lore surrounding it.  Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of [[Germanic people|Germanic Tribes]]' honouring sacred trees within their societies.  Examples include [[Thor's Oak]], [[sacred grove]]s, the [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]], and the wooden [[Irminsul]] pillar. In [[Norse Mythology]], the apples from [[Iðunn]]'s ash box provide immortality for the gods.

{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The "Tree of Immortality" (Arabic: شجرة الخلود) is the tree of life motif as it appears in the [[Quran]]. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the [[Tree of life (biblical)|biblical account]], the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Brannon |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo9jAavEHdIC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree+in+the+shade%22&amp;f=false |title=Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis |edition=annotated |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0826449566 |page=24 |quote=''Abu Hurayrah'': The Prophet Muhammad said: "In Paradise is a tree in the shade of which the stars course 100 years without cutting it: the Tree of Immortality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Oliver Leaman |year=2006 |editor-link=Oliver Leaman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22special%20tree%20in%20Eden%22&amp;f=false |title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415326391 |page=11 |quote=Unlike the biblical account of Eden, the Qur'an mentions only one special tree in Eden, the Tree of Immortality, from which Adam and Eve were prohibited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satan repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Three Translations of the Koran (Al-Qur'an) Side by Side {{cite quran|20|120|s=ns}}, "Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away?

"&lt;/ref&gt; The hadiths also speak about other trees in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Muhammad Ali (2011) ''Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an'' "This in itself gives an indication that it is the well-known tree of evil, for both good and evil are compared to two trees in {{cite quran|14|24|e=25|s=ns|b=n}} and elsewhere. This is further corroborated by the devil's description of it as “the tree of immortality” ({{cite quran|20|120|s=ns|b=n}}), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Indian [[Ahmadiyya]] movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html | title=Quran, Adam and Original Sin | publisher=Al Islam | author=Bilal Khalid | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=87&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Volume 1 | page=86 | publisher=Islam International Publications | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish sources===
{{main article|Etz Chaim|Tree of life (biblical)|l2=Biblical tree of life}}
''[[Etz Chaim]]'', Hebrew for "tree of life," is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the [[Book of Proverbs]], is figuratively applied to the [[Torah]] itself.  ''Etz Chaim'' is also a common name for [[yeshiva]]s and [[synagogue]]s as well as for works of [[Rabbinic literature]]. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a [[Sefer Torah]] is attached.

The tree of life is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]]; it is distinct from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. After [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, [[cherubs|Cherubim]] with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|9}})

In the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with [[wisdom]]: "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy ''[is every one]'' that retaineth her." ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:13-18|9}}) In {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|15:4|HE}} the tree of life is associated with calmness: "A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;For other direct references to the tree of life in the Jewish biblical canon, see also {{bibleverse||Proverbs|11:30|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|13:12|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]], generally considered [[biblical canon|non-canonical]], states that in the time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the [[Book of Life]] fruit to eat from the tree of life.&lt;!-- where in Enoch? --&gt;

====Kabbalah====

Jewish [[mysticism]] depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the [[Kabbalah]]. It comprises the ten ''[[Sefirot]]'' powers in the divine realm. The [[panentheistic]] and [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphic]] emphasis of this [[Emanationism|emanationist]] theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the ''Sefirot'', restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the [[Renaissance]] onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by [[Christian Kabbalah]], and continuing in [[Western esotericism]] occult [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah tree of life [[Syncretism|syncretically]] by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.

===Mesoamerica===
{{Main article|Mesoamerican world tree}}
The concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Religious cosmology|cosmologies]] and [[iconography]]. World trees embodied the four [[cardinal directions]], which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]] |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-05068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ''[[ceiba]]'' tree, and is known variously as a ''wacah chan'' or ''yax imix che'', depending on the [[Mayan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Raising the sky: The Maya creation myth and the Milky Way|work=The Real Maya Prophecies: Astronomy in the Inscriptions and Codices |url=http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |publisher=Maya Astronomy |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021734/http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |archivedate=6 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt;

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster," symbolic of the underworld). The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freidel, David A. |author2=[[Linda Schele]] |author3=Joy Parker |year=1993 |title=Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-688-10081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In a myth passed down among the [[Iroquois]], ''The World on the Turtle's Back'', explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.

The tree of life motif is present in the traditional [[Ojibway]] cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or ''Nookomis Giizhig'' in [[Anishinaabemowin]].

In the book [[Black Elk Speaks]], [[Black Elk]], an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) ''wičháša wakȟáŋ'' ([[medicine man]] and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women.  The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet "Our Father, the two-legged chief" and bring him to the [[Axis mundi|center of a hoop]] where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the "chief" standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.&lt;ref name="First People"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Visions-of-the-Other-World.html | title=Black Elk Speaks | publisher=First People of America and Canada - Turtle Island. | work=Visions of the Other World | accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serer religion ===
In [[Serer religion]], the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]]. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]). In the competing versions of the [[Serer people|Serer]] creation myth, the ''Somb'' (''[[Prosopis africana]]'') and the ''Saas'' tree ([[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]]) are both viewed as trees of life.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; However, the prevailing view is that, the ''Somb'' was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of [[plant species|plant life]].&lt;ref name="Serer"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation [[Serer people|Sereer]] - ''Pangool''", vol. 2., Les Nouvelles Editions [[Africa]]ines du [[Senegal]] (1990), pp 125–6, 199–200, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} &amp; {{en icon}} Niangoran-Bouah, Georges, "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines - MLB, (1987), p 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Somb'' was also used in the [[Serer ancient history|Serer tumuli and burial chambers]], many of which had survived for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; Thus, ''Somb'' is not only the tree of life in Serer society, but the symbol of immortality.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt;

The World Tree or tree of life is a central symbol in [[Turkic mythology]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is a common [[kilim motifs|motif in carpets]]. In 2009 it was introduced as the main design of the common [[Turkish lira]] sub-unit 5 [[kuruş]].

===Hinduism===

In the sacred books of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Puranas mention divine tree Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). This divine tree is guarded by Gandharvas in the garden of Amaravati, city under the control of Indra, King of gods. Popular story goes like this, for a very long time, gods and demi-gods who are believed to be fathered by Kashyapa Prajapati and have different mothers. After a long time frequent battles between the two half-brother clans, both groups decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain Amrutam (అమృతం, अमृत ) and share equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items emerged the Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). It is gold in colour. It has mesmerizing aura. It can be pleased with chanting and offers. When it is pleased, it grants every wish.

Austrian [[symbolist]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, ''[[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze]]''.  This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the "New Residence Hall" (also called the "Tree House"), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Masco&gt;{{cite web|title=MassArt Residence Story: This is the house that collaboration built|url=http://www.masco.org/news/sp-house-collaboration-built|work=MASCO: Medical Academic and Scientific Community Organization|publisher=MASCO, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''[[s:The Sacrifice|The Sacrifice]]'' (part of ''[[George Herbert#Works|The Temple]]'', 1633), the tree of life is the [[rood]] on which Jesus Christ was crucified. In [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the tree of life plays a role, especially in the sixth published book (the first in the in-world chronology) ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]''.

[[Alex Proyas]]' 2009 film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.tvguide.com/knowing/review/296881 | title=''Knowing'': Review | first=Cammila | last=Albertson | newspaper=[[TV Guide]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | year=2009| accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Supernatural (season 13)|season 13]] of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', fruit from the tree of life is an important ingredient in a spell to open a portal to an alternate reality. The angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] is able to find the tree in [[Syria]] and returns from a mission with the fruit in ''[[Scoobynatural]]''. The fruit is used in subsequent episodes as part of the spell to open the portal between the worlds.

'''Tututepec''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]].  It is located in the lower [[Río Verde (Oaxaca)|Río Verde]] valley on the coast of [[Mesoamerican geography#Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] that formed the nucleus of an extensive [[Mixtec]] state during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] period (ca. 12th to early 16th centuries). At its largest extent the site covered some 21.85&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and its political influence extended over an area of more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;km² of the neighbouring territory.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce ''et al.'' (2004), abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name in [[Mixtecan languages]] was ''Yucu Dzaa''.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the site is occupied by the contemporary settlement of [[Villa de Tututepec de Melchor Ocampo]], in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]].

'''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 1759''' was unanimously adopted on 20 June 2007.

== Resolution ==
The Security Council decided this morning to extend the mandate of the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]] (UNDOF), which monitors the ceasefire between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights, for six months, ending on 31 December 2007.

By its unanimous adoption of resolution 1759 (2007), the Council also reiterated the terms of its resolution 338 (1973), which calls on the two parties to pursue negotiations towards a lasting peace.

In a statement (document S/2007/PRST/20) complementing the resolution, Johan Verbeke (Belgium), Council President for June, quoted paragraph 11 of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s latest report on UNDOF (document S/2007/331), which maintains that the Middle East is likely to remain tense until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the problem can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9050.doc.htm|title=EXTENDING MANDATE OF UNITED NATIONS DISENGAGEMENT OBSERVER FORCE, SECURITY COUNCIL REITERATES CALL FOR LASTING ISRAEL-SYRIA PEACE|date=June 20, 2007|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''veto''' – Latin for "I forbid" – is the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation. A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the [[United Nations Security Council veto power|United Nations Security Council]], whose permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States of America) can block any resolution, or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] may override a Presidential veto of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: From bills to law|Article I, Section 7, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; A veto may give power only to stop changes (thus allowing its holder to protect the [[status quo]]), like the US legislative veto mentioned before, or to also adopt them (an "amendatory veto"), like the legislative veto of the Indian President, which allows him to propose amendments to bills returned to the Parliament for reconsideration.

The concept of a veto body originated with the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman consul|consuls]] and [[tribune]]s. Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The presidential veto: touchstone of the American presidency|pages=1–2|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-88706-802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman veto==
The institution of the veto, known to the Romans as the ''intercessio'', was adopted by the [[Roman Republic]] in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the mandamus interests of the [[plebs]] (common citizenry) from the encroachments of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], who dominated the Senate. A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill, but meant that it was denied the force of law. The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly. The consuls also had the power of veto, as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls. If one disagreed, either could invoke the ''intercessio'' to block the action of the other. The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institutions.&lt;ref name="Spitzer" /&gt;

==Westminster systems==

In [[Westminster system]]s and most [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the power to veto legislation by withholding the [[Royal Assent]] is a rarely used [[reserve power]] of the monarch. In practice, the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of its chief advisor, the prime minister.

===Australia===
Since the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931), the United Kingdom Parliament may not repeal any Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on the grounds that is repugnant to the laws and interests of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=25 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date=9 October 1942 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601205107/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=25 |archive-date=1 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia), such as Canada and New Zealand, are likewise affected. However, according to the [[Australian Constitution]] (sec. 59), the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] may veto a bill that has been given royal assent by the [[Governor-General]] within one year of the legislation being assented to.&lt;ref name="gov.au"/&gt; This power has never been used. The Australian Governor-General himself or herself has, in theory, power to veto, or more technically, withhold assent to, a bill passed by both houses of the [[Australian Parliament]], and contrary to the advice of the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hamer |first=David |author-link=David Hamer |year=2002 |work=Can Responsible Government Survive in Australia? |title=Curiously ill-defined – the role of the head of state |publisher=Australian Government – Department of the Senate |publication-place=Canberra |origyear=1994, University of Canberra |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=9495A9BDD2964D7DB682C13BFA5D4D1A&amp;_z=z |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done without consulting the sovereign as per Section 58 of the constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure. The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |title=Chapter I. The Parliament. Part V – Powers of the Parliament, Section 58 |work=[[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]: [[Australian Senate|Department of the Senate]] |accessdate=13 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193759/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |archivedate=14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[reserve power]] is however, constitutionally arguable, and it is difficult to foresee an occasion when such a power would need to be exercised. It is possible that a Governor-general might so act if a bill passed by the Parliament was in violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Powers of the Governor |url=http://www.govhouse.wa.gov.au/powers.htm |website=Dynamics in Government: A guide to the workings of government in Western Australia |publisher=Constitutional Centre of Western Australia |editor-first=Jolly |editor-last=Read |dead-url=yes |accessdate=15 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406000323/http://www.govhouse.wa.gov.au/powers.htm |archivedate=6 April 2011 |date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue, however, that a government would be hardly likely to present a bill which is so open to rejection. Many of the viceregal reserve powers are untested, because of the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the observance of the convention that the head of state acts upon the advice of his or her chief minister. The power may also be used in a situation where the parliament, usually a [[hung parliament]], passes a bill without the blessing of the executive. The governor general on the advice of the executive could withhold consent from the bill thereby preventing its passage into law.

With regard to the six governors of the states which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth, a somewhat different situation exists. Until the [[Australia Act]] 1986, each state was constitutionally dependent upon the British Crown directly. Since 1986, however, they are fully independent entities, although the Queen still appoints governors on the advice of the state head of government, the [[premier]]. So the Crown may not veto (nor the UK Parliament overturn) any act of a state governor or state legislature. Paradoxically, the states are more independent of the Crown than the federal government and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mediation Communications, Level 3, 414 Bourke Street, Melbourne Vic 3000, Phone 9602 2992, www.mediacomms.com.au |url=http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/role.htm |title=Government House |publisher=Governor.vic.gov.au |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714204231/http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/role.htm |archivedate=14 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; State constitutions determine what role a governor plays. In general the governor exercises the powers the sovereign would have, including the power to withhold the Royal Assent.

===Canada===
{{see also|Disallowance and reservation#In_Canada}}
According to the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Act, 1867]], the [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen in Counsel]] (in practice the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]) may instruct the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to withhold the Queen's assent, allowing the sovereign two years to disallow the bill, thereby vetoing the law in question.  This was last used in 1873, and the power was effectively nullified by the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]].

Provincial viceroys, called "[[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]]" (plural) are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for consideration and possible disallowance by the [[Cabinet of Canada|Federal Cabinet]]; this clause was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Frank Lindsay, [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/bastedo_frank_lindsay_1886-1973.html Encyclopedia of Saskatachewan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{see also|President of India#Important presidential interventions in the past}}

In India, the president has three veto powers, i.e. absolute, suspension &amp; pocket. The president can send the bill back to parliament for changes, which constitutes a limited veto that can be overridden by a simple majority. But the Bill reconsidered by the parliament becomes a law with or without the assents of President after 14 days. The president can also take no action indefinitely on a bill, sometimes referred to as a pocket veto. The president can refuse to assent, which constitutes an absolute veto.&lt;ref name="intro india"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Constitution of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;pg=PA145 | publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Learning Pvt.

===Spain===
In Spain, Section 91 of the Constitution provides that the King shall give his assent to laws passed by the General Courts within 15 days after their final passing by them. The absence of the royal assent, although not constitutionally provided{{clarify|date=September 2012}}, would mean the bill did not become a part of the law. 
Section 90 of the Constitution states that "Within two months after receiving the text, the Senate may, by a message stating the reasons for it, adopt a veto or approve amendments thereto. The veto must be adopted by overall majority."

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the royal veto ("withholding [[Royal Assent]]") was last exercised in 1708 by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] with the [[Scottish Militia Bill 1708]].

The [[House of Lords]] used to have an effective power of veto by refusing to concur in bills adopted by the [[House of Commons]]. However, reform first by a Liberal government and then by a Labour government has limited its powers. The [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949]] reduced its powers: they can now only amend and delay legislation. They can delay legislation for up to one year. Under the 1911 Act, money bills (those concerning finance) cannot be delayed, and under the [[Salisbury Convention]], the Lords, by [[Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom|convention]], cannot delay any bills set out in the governing party's manifesto.

==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Royal Assent]] --&gt;

===According to the Constitution===
{{See also|List of United States presidential vetoes|Line-item veto in the United States|Pocket veto}}
All legislation passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the President. This presentation is in the President's capacity as Head of Government.

If the President approves of the legislation, then the President signs it into law. According to [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 7: Bills|Article 1. Section 7]] of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RS22188.pdf | format = PDF | title = Regular Vetoes and Pocket Vetoes: An Overview  | first = Kevin R. |last = Kosar | date = 18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the President chooses not to sign or does not approve of the bill, the President must return the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], unsigned, within ten days, excluding Sundays, to the house of the [[United States Congress]] in which it originated, while the Congress is [[wikt:in session|in session]]. The President is constitutionally required to state any objections to the bill in writing, and the Congress is constitutionally required to consider them, and to reconsider the legislation. This action, in effect, is a veto.

If the Congress overrides the veto by a [[two-thirds majority|two-thirds vote]] in each house, it becomes law without the President's signature. Otherwise, the bill fails to become law unless it is presented to the President again and the President chooses to sign it.&lt;ref name="US Senate Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Senate Glossary|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/override_of_a_veto.htm|work=US Senate Glossary|publisher=US Senate|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the Congress [[veto override|overrides]] the Presidential veto 7% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Overrides of Presidential Vetoes|first=Mitchel A.|last=Sollenberger|website=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/98-157.pdf|date=April 7, 2004|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill can also become law without the President's signature if, after its presentment, the President simply fails to sign it within the ten days noted. If there are fewer than ten days left in the session before Congress [[wikt:adjourn|adjourns]], and if Congress does so adjourn before the ten days have expired in which the President might sign the bill, then the bill fails to become law. This procedure, when used as a formal device, is called a [[pocket veto]].

===Modifications declared unconstitutional===
In 1983, the Supreme Court had struck down the one-house [[legislative veto]], on [[separation of powers]] grounds and on grounds that the action by one house of Congress violated the Constitutional requirement of bicameralism. The case was ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'', concerning a foreign exchange student in [[Ohio]] who had been born in Kenya but whose parents were from India. Because he was not born in India, he was not an Indian citizen. Because his parents were not Kenyan citizens, he was not Kenyan. Thus, he [[Stateless person|had nowhere to go]] when his student visa expired because neither country would take him, so he overstayed his visa and was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported from the United States.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lena|title=Faces Behind Famous Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/garden/faces-behind-famous-cases.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Immigration and Nationality Act was one of many acts of Congress passed since the 1930s, which contained a provision allowing either house of that legislature to nullify decisions of agencies in the executive branch simply by passing a resolution. In this case, Chadha's deportation was suspended and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a resolution overturning the suspension, so that the deportation proceedings would continue. This, the Court held, amounted to the House of Representatives passing legislation without the concurrence of the Senate, and without presenting the legislation to the President for consideration and approval (or veto). Thus, the Constitutional principle of bicameralism and the separation of powers doctrine were disregarded in this case, and this legislative veto of executive decisions was struck down.

In 1996, the [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[Bill Clinton]] signed, the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]]. This [[Act of Congress|act]] allowed the President to veto individual items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead of vetoing the entire bill and sending it back to the Congress. However, this [[line-item veto]] was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it. In 1998, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled 6-3 to declare the line-item veto unconstitutional. In ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' ({{ussc|524|417|1998}}), the Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole. An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and [[head of state]]—and particularly as a single legislator acting in place of the entire Congress—thereby violating the [[separation of powers]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=51634#axzz2gmSarpIs|title=Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union|publisher=The American Presidency Project|work=Transcript|date=1995-01-24|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being declared unconstitutional, President Clinton had applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008092502/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/|archivedate=October 8, 2008|title=Supreme Court Strikes Down Line-Item Veto|work=CNN|date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara004.html|title=History of Line Item Veto Notices|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Senator [[Bill Frist]] introduced the [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto, however, the procedure created by the Act provides that, if the President should recommend rescission of a budgetary line item from a budget bill he previously signed into law—a power he already possesses pursuant to U.S. Const. Article II—the Congress must vote on his request within ten days. Because the legislation that is the subject of the President's request (or "Special Message", in the language of the bill) was already enacted and signed into law, the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action, not any kind of veto—whether line-item, legislative or any other sort. The House passed this measure, but the Senate never considered it, so the bill expired and never became law.&lt;ref name=govtrack&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4890|title=H.R. 4890 (109th)|accessdate=October 15, 2018|author=109th Congress (2006)|date=March 7, 2006|work=Legislation|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Senators [[Russ Feingold]] and [[John McCain]] introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a [[majority]] vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaI_6LByaIA |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=YouTube}} Video of reintroduction of Line Item Veto Bill March 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105025838/http://feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=309038 |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |title=Feingold, McCain, Ryan Introduce Line-item Veto to Curb Wasteful Spending |publisher=United States Senate |date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-2-25-2009/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs |publisher=The White House |date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===

====Intent of the Framers====
During the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], the veto was routinely referred to as a 'revisionary power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madison|first1=James |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/debcont.asp|title=Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention |date=1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Veto was constructed not as an absolute veto, but rather with limits, such as that Congress can override a veto, and that the President's objections must be stated in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitzer|first1=Robert J.|title=The Presidential Veto|date=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0887068027|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limits would have been important in the minds of the Founders, given that in Britain the monarch retained an absolute veto (though by this time the power had become a formality). Further, as [[Elbridge Gerry]] explained in the final days of the Convention: "The primary object of the revisionary check of the President is not to protect the general interest, but to defend his own department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madison|first1=James |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_912.asp|title=Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention |date=12 September 1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Constitutional Convention the framers overwhelmingly rejected three proposals for an absolute veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James P.|title=Power Play: The Bush Presidency and the Constitution|date=2009|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|location= Washington, DC|isbn=081570335X|pages=210–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Christopher N.|title=Presidential Defiance of "unconstitutional" Laws: Reviving the Royal Prerogative|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031330064X|pages=876–881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under the Articles and Constitution====
The [[President of the Continental Congress|Presidents]] of the [[Continental Congress]] (1774–81) did not have the power of veto. The President could not veto an act of Congress under the [[Articles of Confederation]] (1781–89), but he possessed certain recess and reserve powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of the Continental Congress. It was only with the enactment of the [[United States Constitution]] (drafted 1787; ratified 1788; fully effective since 4 March 1789) that veto power was conferred upon the person titled "President of the United States".{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The presidential veto power was first exercised on 5 April 1792 when President [[George Washington]] vetoed a bill outlining a new apportionment formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caulfield |first1=Michael |title=Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - Jefferson's Method of Apportionment |journal=Convergence |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=November 2010 |url=https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-jeffersons-method-of-apportionment |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apportionment described how Congress divides seats in the House of Representatives among the states based on the US census figures. President Washington's stated reasons for vetoing the bill were (1) that it did not apportion representatives according to states' relative populations and (2) that it gave eight states more than 1 representative per 30,000 residents, in violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first=George |last=Washington |author-link=George Washington |recipient=House of Representatives |subject=Veto Message of George Washington April 5, 1792 |date=April 5, 1792 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/gwveto1.asp |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |publisher=Bureau of National Literature, Inc. |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress first overrode a presidential veto (passed a bill into law notwithstanding the President's objections) on 3 March 1845.&lt;ref name=veto_history&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf | title=Presidential Vetoes, 1789 to 1988 | format=PDF | date=February 1992 | publisher=The U.S. Government Printing Office | accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. states, veto powers, and override authority===
All U.S. states also have a provision by which legislative decisions can be vetoed by the governor. In addition to the ability to veto an entire bill as a "package," many states allow the governor to exercise specialty veto authority to strike or revise portions of a bill without striking the whole bill.

;Amendatory veto
:Allows a governor to amend bills that have been passed by the legislature. Revisions are subject to confirmation or rejection by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vock|first=Daniel|title=Govs enjoy quirky veto power|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/govs-enjoy-quirky-veto-power-85899386875|publisher=pewstates.org|accessdate=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Line item veto
:Allows a governor to remove specific sections of a bill (usually only spending bills) that has been passed by the legislature. Deletions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Pocket veto
:Any bill presented to a governor after a session has ended must be signed to become law. A governor can refuse to sign such a bill and it will expire. Such vetoes cannot be overridden.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Reduction veto
:Allows a governor to reduce the amounts budgeted for spending items. Reductions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;
;Package veto
:Allows a governor to veto the entire bill. Package vetoes can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Vock"/&gt;

==European republican systems==

===Presidential veto===
Many European republics allow some form of presidential veto on legislation, which may vary, according to their constitutional form or by convention. These include France, Italy, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary.&lt;!-- There is also another form of presidential veto, which is neglected on this section: pocket veto. --&gt;

The [[President of Austria]] has no veto power, but signs bills into law.

The [[President of Iceland]] may refuse to sign a bill, which is then put to [[referendum]]. This right was not exercised until 2004, by President [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], who has since refused to sign two other bills. The first bill was withdrawn, but the latter two resulted in referenda.

The [[President of France]] has only a very limited form of suspensive veto: when presented with a law, he or she can request another reading of it by the Assembly, but only once per law. Aside from it, the President can only refer bills to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]].

The [[President of Hungary]] has two options to veto a bill: submit it to the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] if he suspects that it violates the constitution or send it back to the [[National Assembly of Hungary|Parliament]] and ask for a second debate and vote on the bill. If the Court rules that the bill is constitutional or it is passed by the Parliament again, respectively, the President must sign it.

The [[President of Ireland]] may refuse to grant assent to a bill that he or she considers to be unconstitutional, after consulting the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]; in this case, the bill is referred to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], which finally determines the matter. This is the most widely used reserve power. The President may also, on request of a majority of [[Seanad Éireann]] (the upper house of parliament) and a third of [[Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house of parliament), after consulting the Council of State, decline to sign a bill "of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained" in an [[ordinary referendum]] or a new Dáil reassembling after a general election held within eighteen months. This latter power has never been used because the government of the day almost always commands a majority of the Seanad, preventing the third of the Dáil that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it.

The [[President of Italy]] may request a second deliberation of a bill passed by Parliament before it is promulgated. This is a very weak form of veto as the Parliament can override the veto by an ordinary majority. The same provision exists in France and Latvia. While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a determined parliamentary majority, it may have a delaying effect and may cause the parliamentary majority to reconsider the matter. The President of Republic can also call a new election for parliament. He can also veto minister nominations, as happened in 2018.

The [[President of Estonia]] may effectively veto a law adopted by [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]] by refusing to proclaim it and demanding a new debate and decision. The parliament, in its turn, may override this veto by passing the law unamended for the second time (a simple majority is enough). In this case the President is obliged to proclaim the law or to request the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]] to declare the law unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court rules that the law does not violate the [[Constitution of Estonia|Constitution]], the President may not object any more and is obliged to finally proclaim the law.

The [[President of Latvia]] may suspend a bill for a period of two months, during which it may be referred to the people in a referendum if a certain number of signatures are gathered. This is potentially a much stronger form of veto, as it enables the President to appeal to the people against the wishes of the Parliament and Government.

The [[President of Poland]] may submit a bill to the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] if he suspects that bill is unconstitutional or send it back to the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] for a second voting. If the Tribunal says that the bill is constitutional or if Sejm passes it by at least three-fifths of the votes, the President must sign the bill.

The [[President of Portugal]] may refuse to sign a bill or refer it, or parts of it, to the [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]]. If the President refuses to sign bill without it being declared unconstitutional, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] (parliament) may pass it again, in which case it becomes law.

The [[President of Ukraine]] may refuse to sign a bill and return it to Parliament with his proposals. If the parliament agrees on his proposals, the President must sign the bill. Parliament may overturn a veto by a two-thirds majority. If Parliament overturns his veto, the President must sign the bill within 10 days.

==Liberum veto==
In the constitution Poland or the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, there was an institution called the [[liberum veto]]. All bills had to pass the ''Sejm'' or "Seimas" (Parliament) by [[unanimous]] consent, and if any legislator voted ''nay'' on anything, this not only vetoed that bill but also dissolved that legislative session itself. The concept originated in the idea of "Polish democracy" as any Pole of noble extraction was considered as good as any other, no matter how low or high his material condition might be. It was never exercised, however, under the rule of the strong Polish royal dynasties, which came to an end in the mid-17th century. These were followed by an elective kingship. As might be expected, the more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the legislature and, combined with a string of weak figurehead kings, led ultimately to the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning and the dissolution of the Polish state]] in the late 18th century.

==Philippines==
The [[President of the Philippines]] may refuse to sign a bill, sending the bill back to the house where it originated along with his objections. [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] can override the veto via a two-thirds vote with both houses voting separately, after which the bill becomes law. The president may also veto specific provisions on [[money bill]]s without affecting other provisions on the same bill. The president cannot veto a bill due to inaction; once the bill has been received by the president, the chief executive has thirty days to veto the bill. Once the thirty-day period expires, the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it.

     {{Voting}}

'''Voter segments in political polling''' in the United States consist of '''all adults''', '''registered voters''', and '''likely voters'''.

==Definitions==
Political opinion polling in the United States usually surveys one of three population segments. 
* '''All adults''' are polls in which all Americans age 18 and older have been surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion of all United States residents, regardless of voting eligibility or intent.&lt;ref name="gal1"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between registered voters and likely voters?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/110287/what-difference-between-registered-voters-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Registered voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are [[voting registration|registered to vote]] are surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion only of citizens who would be legally able to cast a vote if the election were held on the day the poll was taken and, therefore, necessarily exclude non-citizen residents and, in many jurisdictions, the mentally ill and convicted felons.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Likely voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are (a) registered voters, and who, (b) have indicated a high intent of actually voting in the next election, are surveyed.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt;

==Relative values==
According to the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]], "there is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report 'likely' voters than '[[Registered Voter|registered]]' voters".&lt;ref name="aapor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Likely-Voters.aspx|title=Likely Voters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[American Association for Public Opinion Research]]|access-date=|quote=There is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report "likely" voters than "registered" voters, especially as Election Day approaches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on a Pew study, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' has noted that polls of "likely voters" represent the "Holy Grail of polling" and are most likely to accurately reflect the outcome of an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clement|first1=Scott|title=Why the 'likely voter' is the holy grail of polling|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/07/why-the-likely-voter-is-the-holy-grail-of-polling/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 2010 polling by [[Five Thirty Eight]] concluded that polls of "registered voters" that year tended to favor [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates by a factor of five percentage points over the actual results of the election, while polls of "likely voters" tended to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates by a factor of one percentage point over the actual results of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Registered Voter Polls Will (Usually) Overrate Democrats|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Five Thirty Eight]]|date=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' this is because registered voters who are least likely to actually cast a ballot tend to be low-income voters, or persons living in urban areas, which are constituencies that tend to favor Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Differences Between Registered And Likely Voter Polls Didn’t Affect Fall Trends In 2014 Senate Forecast|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/senate-polls_n_6327394.html|accessdate=December 15, 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that registered voters tend to lean more to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] than to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], stating that "For those individuals identified as registered to vote by state governments, the voter file has a score (ranging from 0 to 100) describing their likelihood of voting for Democrats or Republicans, with higher numbers indicating a preference for Democrats. According to the full voter file, 55% of all registered voters in the U.S. are likely Democrats and 33% are likely Republicans." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/2018/10/09/the-rbs-poll-comports-well-with-data-from-the-full-voter-file-about-the-partisanship-of-registered-voters/|title=The RBS poll comports well with data from the full voter file about the partisanship of registered voters|last1=Kennedy|first1=Courtney|last2=Hatley|first2=Nick|last3=Keeter|first3=Scott|last4=Mercer|first4=Andrew|last5=Igeilnik|first5=Ruth|last6=Traylor|first6=Frederic|work=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for identifying "likely voters"==
Polls targeting "likely voters" generally begin with a list of known registered voters and then ask respondents a series of screening questions before the survey is conducted. Often this can simply be "are you going to vote on Election Day?" with respondents who answer "yes" to the question being included in the survey's final results, and those who answer "no" being excluded.&lt;ref name="gal2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|title=How Do You Define "Likely Voters"?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/4636/how-define-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, complex formulas that account for a variety of demographic and psychographic variables are applied.&lt;ref name="gal2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12052">{{about|phonetic reduction, which means a change in pronunciation|the meaning in phonology|Phonemic merger}}
In [[phonetics]], '''vowel reduction''' is any of various changes in the acoustic ''quality'' of [[vowel]]s, which are related to changes in [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[sonority hierarchy|sonority]], [[vowel length|duration]], loudness, articulation, or position in the word (e.g. for the [[Creek language]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/papers/Johnson_Martin_2001.pdf Acoustic vowel reduction in Creek: Effects of distinctive length and position in the word] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;), and which are perceived as "weakening". It most often makes the vowels shorter as well.

Such a vowel may be called ''reduced'' or ''weak''. In contrast, an unreduced vowel may be described as ''full'' or ''strong''.

==Weakening of vowel articulation==
[[Image:Peripheral and central vowel space.svg|thumb|250px|Cardinal vowel chart showing peripheral (white) and central (blue) vowel space, based on the chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2003|p=227}}]]
Phonetic reduction most often involves a [[Mid-centralized vowel|centralization]] of the vowel, that is, a reduction in the amount of movement of the tongue in pronouncing the vowel, as with the characteristic change of many unstressed vowels at the ends of English words to something approaching [[schwa]]. A well-researched type of reduction is that of the neutralization of acoustic distinctions in [[unstressed vowel]]s, which occurs in many languages. The most common reduced vowel is [[schwa]].

Whereas full vowels are distinguished by height, backness, and roundness, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1986}}, reduced unstressed vowels are largely unconcerned with height or roundness. English {{IPA|/ə/}}, for example, may range phonetically from mid {{IPA|[ə]}} to {{IPA|[ɐ]}} to open {{IPA|[a]}}; English {{IPA|/ɨ/}} ranges from close {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[e]}}, to open-mid {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. The primary distinction is that {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is further front than {{IPA|/ə/}}, contrasted in the numerous English words ending in unstressed ''-ia.'' That is, the jaw, which to a large extent controls vowel height, tends to be relaxed when pronouncing reduced vowels. Similarly, English {{IPA|/ɵ/}} ranges through {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}; although it may be labialized to varying degrees, the lips are relaxed in comparison to {{IPA|/uː/}}, {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, or {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. The primary distinction in words like ''folio'' is again one of backness. However, the backness distinction is not as great as that of full vowels; reduced vowels are also [[Centralization (phonetics)|centralized]], and are sometimes referred to by that term. They may also be called ''obscure,'' as there is no one-to-one correspondence between full and reduced vowels.{{sfnp|Bolinger|1986|p=347}}

Sound duration is a common factor in reduction: In fast speech, vowels are reduced due to physical limitations of the articulatory organs, e.g., the tongue cannot move to a prototypical position fast or completely enough to produce a full-quality vowel (compare with [[clipping (phonetics)|clipping]]). Different languages have different types of vowel reduction, and this is one of the difficulties in [[language acquisition]]; see, e.g., "[[Non-native pronunciations of English]]" and "[[Anglophone pronunciation of foreign languages]]". Vowel reduction of [[second language]] speakers is a separate study.

Stress-related vowel reduction is a principal factor in the development of [[Indo-European ablaut]], as well as other changes reconstructed by [[historical linguistics]].

There are several ways to distinguish full and reduced vowels in transcription. Some English dictionaries mark full vowels for secondary stress, so that e.g. {{angbr|{{IPA|ˌɪ}}}} is a full unstressed {{IPA|/ɪ/}} while {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ}}}} is a reduced unstressed ''schwi''.{{efn|A word play on schwa.}} The vowel quality may be considered distinct, with reduced vowels centralized, e.g. with full {{angbr|{{IPA|ʊ}}}} vs reduced {{angbr|{{IPA|ɵ}}}}. Some transcriptions of English and Russian use non-IPA letters for reduced vowels, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|ᵻ}}}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ᵿ}}}} in English.

Such vowel reduction is one of the sources of distinction between a [[spoken language]] and its [[written language|written counterpart]]. Vernacular and formal speech often have different levels of vowel reduction, and so the term "vowel reduction" is also applied to differences in a [[Variety (linguistics)|language variety]] with respect to, e.g., the [[language standard]].

Some languages, such as [[Spoken Finnish|Finnish]], [[Hindi]], and classical [[Spanish language|Spanish]], are claimed to lack vowel reduction. Such languages are often called [[syllable-timed language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Dauer. "Stress-timing and syllable-timing reanalysed". Journal of Phonetics. 11:51–62 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, [[Mexican Spanish]] is characterized by the reduction or loss of the unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound {{IPA|/s/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volumen 2'', pp.154–155,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&amp;pg=PA154 URL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lope Blanch, Juan M. (1972) ''En torno a las vocales caedizas del español mexicano'', pp. 53–73, Estudios sobre el español de México, editorial Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México [http://www.filos.unam.mx/LICENCIATURA/Pagina_FyF_2004/introduccion/Lope_Vocales_caedizas.pdf URL].&lt;/ref&gt; It can be the case that the words ''pesos'', ''pesas'', and ''peces'' are pronounced the same: {{IPA|[ˈpesə̥s]}}.

==Vowel inventory reduction==
In some cases phonetic vowel reduction may contribute to [[phonemic differentiation|''phonemic'' (phonological)]] reduction, which means merger of [[phoneme]]s, induced by indistinguishable pronunciation.
This sense of vowel reduction may occur by means other than vowel centralisation, however. Many Germanic languages, in their early stages, reduced the number of vowels that could occur in unstressed syllables, without (or before) clearly showing centralisation. [[Proto-Germanic]] and its early descendant [[Gothic language|Gothic]] still allowed more or less the full complement of vowels and diphthongs to appear in unstressed syllables, except notably short /e/, which merged with /i/. In early [[Old High German]] and [[Old Saxon]], this had been reduced to five vowels (i, e, a, o, u, some with length distinction), later reduced further to just three short vowels (i/e, a, o/u). In [[Old Norse]], likewise, only three vowels were written in unstressed syllables: a, i and u (their exact phonetic quality is unknown). [[Old English]], meanwhile, distinguished only e, a, and u (again the exact phonetic quality is unknown). [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance languages|Romance language]], also shows reduction, but in differing degrees depending on dialect. The Valencian dialect reduces the number of possible vowels from seven to five in unstressed environments, merging {{IPA|[ɛ]}} into {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} into {{IPA|[o]}}. The central Catalan dialect goes even further, distinguishing only {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ə ~ ɐ]}}, with {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[a]}} becoming {{IPA|[ə ~ ɐ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} merging into {{IPA|[u]}}. In [[Italian language|Italian]], the vowels noted e and o in spelling are pronounced {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} in unstressed syllables.

==Specific languages==

===English===
{{main article|Stress and vowel reduction in English}}
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is a prominent feature of the [[English language]], both at the level of the word ''(lexical stress)'' and at the level of the phrase or sentence ''(prosodic stress)''. Absence of stress on a syllable, or on a word in some cases, is frequently associated in English with [[vowel reduction]] – many such syllables are pronounced with a centralized vowel ([[schwa]]) or with certain other vowels that are described as being "reduced" (or sometimes with a [[syllabic consonant]] as the syllable nucleus rather than a vowel). Various [[phonology|phonological]] analyses exist for these phenomena.

===Latin===
{{details|History of Latin#Phonology}}
[[Old Latin]] had initial stress, and short vowels in non-initial syllables were frequently reduced. Long vowels were usually not reduced.

Vowels reduced in different ways depending on the phonological environment. For instance, in most cases they reduced to {{IPA|/i/}}. Before ''l pinguis'', an {{IPA|/l/}} not followed by {{IPA|/i iː l/}}, they became Old Latin {{IPA|/o/}} and Classical Latin {{IPA|/u/}}. Before {{IPA|/r/}} and some consonant clusters, they became {{IPA|/e/}}.
&lt;!-- Verification of Old Latin form needed: insolto or ensolto? --&gt;
* {{lang|la|fáciō}}, *{{lang|la|ád-faciō}} &gt; Old Latin {{lang|la|fáciō}}, {{lang|la|áfficiō}} "make, affect"
: {{lang|la|fáctos}}, *{{lang|la|ád-factos}} &gt; {{lang|la|fáctos}}, {{lang|la|áffectos}} "made, affected" ([[participle]]s)
* {{lang|la|sáltō}}, *{{lang|la|én-saltō}} &gt; Old Latin {{lang|la|sáltō}}, {{lang|la|ínsoltō}} "I jump, I jump on"
* {{PIE|parō, *pe-par-ai}} &gt; Latin {{lang|la|párō}}, {{lang|la|péperī}} "I give birth, I gave birth"

In [[Classical Latin]], stress [[Latin spelling and pronunciation#Accent|changed position]], so in some cases reduced vowels became stressed. Stress moved to the penult if it was [[syllable weight|heavy]] or the antepenult in other cases.
*Classical Latin {{lang|la|fáciō}}, {{lang|la|affíciō}}
: {{lang|la|fáctus}}, {{lang|la|afféctus}}
* {{lang|la|sáltō}}, {{lang|la|īnsúltō}}

===Slavic languages===
====Bulgarian====
In the [[Bulgarian language]] the vowels ''а'', ''о'' and ''е'' can be reduced when unstressed to ''ъ'', ''у'' and ''и'', respectively. The most prevalent is ''а'' &gt; ''ъ'', while ''о'' &gt; ''у'' is considered incorrect in literary speech. The last reduction ''е'' &gt; ''и'' is prevalent in the more Eastern dialects of the language.

====Russian====
{{main article|Vowel reduction in Russian}}
There are five vowel phonemes in Standard Russian. Vowels tend to merge when they are unstressed. The vowels /a/ and /o/ have the same unstressed allophones for a number of dialects and reduce to a schwa. Unstressed /e/ may become more central if it does not merge with /i/.

Other types of reduction are phonetic, such as that of high vowels (/i/ and /u/), which become near-close so этап ('stage') is pronounced [ɪˈtap], and мужчина ('man') is pronounced [mʊˈɕːinə].

====Early Slavic languages====
{{main article|Havlík's law}}
The [[Proto-Slavic]] language possessed two short high vowels known as [[yer]]s: a short high front vowel denoted as ĭ or ь, and a short back vowel denoted as ŭ or ъ. These vowels underwent reduction and were eventually deleted in certain positions in a word in the early Slavic languages, beginning from the late dialects of Proto-Slavic. This process is known as [[Havlík's law]].

The '''Wieliczka Salt Mine''' ({{lang-pl|Kopalnia soli Wieliczka}}), located in the town of [[Wieliczka]] in southern [[Poland]], lies within the [[Kraków]] [[metropolitan area]]. Opened in the 13th century, the [[Mining|mine]] produced [[table salt]] continuously until 2007, as one of the world's oldest [[salt mine]]s in operation. Throughout, the royal mine was run by the ''[[Żupy krakowskie]]'' Salt Mines company.&lt;ref name="wieliczkasaltmine"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724131018/http://www.wieliczkasaltmine.net/ "Wieliczka – The Salt of the Earth"] at the WieliczkaSaltMine.net. {{En icon}}&amp;nbsp;{{Pl icon}}.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kr.edu.pl"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081011193539/http://www.cyf-kr.edu.pl/wieliczka/kopsoli.php Ancient salt-works.

Commercial mining was discontinued in 1996, because of salt prices going down and also mine flooding.&lt;ref name="wieliczkasaltmine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kr.edu.pl"/&gt;  The mine is currently one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monuments]] (''[[Pomnik historii|Pomniki historii]]''), whose attractions include dozens of statues and four chapels carved out of the [[rock salt]] by the miners, as well as supplemental carvings made by contemporary artists.

==History==

[[File:Wieliczka kolaż 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Surface and underground views of the Wieliczka Salt Mine. Composite of illustrations to a series of maps of the town and mines of Wieliczka engraved in 1645 by [[Willem Hondius]].]]
[[File:Wieliczka, Jana Matejki; Kopalnia soli- kierat konny węgierski; A-580; 01.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hungary|Hungarian]]-type [[horse]] [[treadmill]], late 18th century, in ''Komora Kraj'' (the [[Country]] Chamber)]]
The Wieliczka salt mine reaches a depth of 327 meters  and is over {{convert|287|km}} long. The rock salt is naturally grey in various shades, resembling unpolished granite rather than the white or crystalline look that many visitors may expect. In the 13th century, rock salt was discovered in Wieliczka and the first shafts were dug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wieliczka-saltmine.com/about-the-mine/the-mine-of-the-past-and-of-today|title=Kopalnia Soli Wieliczka|last=Goldensubmarine.com|website=www.wieliczka-saltmine.com|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the Saltworks Castle in Wieliczka (the central building – “The House within the Saltworks”) – head office of the mine’s board since medieval times till 1945. The Saltworks Castle was built in the late 13th to early 14th century. Wieliczka is now the location of the Kraków Saltworks Museum. Many shafts were dug throughout the time the mine was in operation.&lt;ref name="Goldensubmarine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wieliczka-saltmine.com/about-the-mine/the-mine-of-the-past-and-of-today|title=Kopalnia Soli Wieliczka|last=Goldensubmarine.com|website=www.wieliczka-saltmine.com|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different technology was added such as the Hungarian-type horse treadmill and Saxon treadmills to haul the salt to the top of the surface.&lt;ref name="Goldensubmarine.com"/&gt; During [[World War II]], the shafts were used by the occupying Germans as an ''ad hoc'' facility for various war-related industries. The mine features an underground lake; and the new exhibits on the history of salt mining, as well as a {{convert|3.5|km}} touring route (less than 2% of the length of the mine's passages) that includes historic statues and mythical figures carved out of [[rock salt]] in distant past. More recent sculptures have been fashioned by contemporary artists.

The Wieliczka mine is often referred to as "the Underground Salt Cathedral of Poland". In 1978 it was placed on the original [[UNESCO]] list of the [[World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=32 |title=Wieliczka Salt Mine - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the crystals of the [[chandeliers]] are made from rock salt that has been dissolved and reconstituted to achieve a clear, glass-like appearance. It also houses a private rehabilitation and wellness complex.

There is a legend about [[Kinga of Poland|Princess Kinga]], associated with the Wieliczka mine. The Hungarian princess was about to be married to [[Bolesław V the Chaste]], the [[Seniorate Province|Prince of Kraków]]. As part of her dowry, she asked her father, [[Béla IV of Hungary]], for a lump of salt, since salt was prizeworthy in Poland. Her father [[Béla IV of Hungary|King Béla]] took her to a salt mine in Máramaros. She threw her engagement ring from Bolesław in one of the shafts before leaving for Poland. On arriving in Kraków, she asked the miners to dig a deep pit until they come upon a rock. The people found a lump of salt in there and when they split it in two, discovered the princess's ring. Kinga had thus become the patron saint of salt miners in and around the Polish capital.&lt;ref name="polandforvisitors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polandforvisitors.com/poland/wieliczka_history|title=History of Wieliczka Salt Mine|publisher=Poland For Visitors Travel Guide|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi occupation, several thousand Jews were transported from the forced labour camps in Plaszow and Mielec to the Wieliczka mine to work in the underground armament factory set up by the Germans. However, manufacturing never began as the Soviet offensive was nearing. Some of the machines and equipment were disassembled, including an electrical hoisting machine from the Regis Shaft, and transported to Liebenau in the Sudetes mountains. Part of the equipment was returned after the war, in autumn 1945. The Jews were transported to factories in the Czech Republic and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wieliczka-saltmine.com/visiting/tourist-route/history |title=History - "Wieliczka" Salt Mine - tourist attractions of Malopolska |website=Wieliczka-saltmine.com |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mine is one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monuments]] (''[[Pomnik historii|Pomniki historii]]''), as designated in the first round, 16 September 1994.  Its listing is maintained by the [[Narodowy Instytut Dziedzictwa|National Heritage Board of Poland]].
In 2010 it was successfully proposed that the nearby historic [[Bochnia Salt Mine]] (Poland's oldest salt mine) be added to the list of [[UNESCO World Heritage]] sites. The two sister salt mines now appear together in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites as the "Wieliczka and Bochnia Royal Salt Mines".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/32  Wieliczka and Bochnia Royal Salt Mines.] UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the UNESCO World Heritage Site was expanded by the addition of the [[Żupny Castle]].

==Tourism==

The mine is currently one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monuments]] (''[[Pomnik historii|Pomniki historii]]''), whose attractions include dozens of statues and four chapels carved out of the [[rock salt]] by the miners. The older sculptures have been supplemented with new carvings made by contemporary artists.  About 1.2 million people visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine annually.&lt;ref name="wieliczkasaltmine" /&gt;

Notable visitors to this site have included [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Fryderyk Chopin]], [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]], [[Bolesław Prus]],&lt;ref name="Twórczość Bolesława Prusa 1972, p. 451"&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Works of Bolesław Prus), second edition, Warsaw, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1972, p. 451, note 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignacy Paderewski]], [[Robert Baden-Powell]], [[Jacob Bronowski]] (who filmed segments of ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' in the mine), [[the von Unrug family]] (a prominent Polish-German royal family), Karol Wojtyła (later, [[Pope John Paul II]]), former [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and many others.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There is a chapel, and a reception room that is used for private functions, including weddings.  A chamber has walls carved by miners to resemble wood, as in wooden churches built in early centuries.  A wooden staircase provides access to the mine's 64-metre (210-foot) level.  A 3-kilometre (1.9-mile) tour features corridors, chapels, statues, and underground lake, {{convert|135|m}} underground. An elevator (lift) returns visitors to the surface; the elevator holds 36 persons (nine per car) and takes some 30 seconds to make the trip.

==In Culture==
The earliest writings about the Wieliczka Salt Mine include a description by [[Adam Schröter]]: ''Salinarum Vieliciensium incunda ac vera descriptio. Carmine elegiaco...'' (1553); augmented edition: ''Regni Poloniae Salinarum Vieliciensium descriptio. Carmine elegiaco...'' (1564).&lt;ref&gt;[[Marek Żukow-Karczewski]], [http://mak.bn.org.pl/cgi-bin/makwww.exe?BM=49&amp;IM=01&amp;WI=xUKOWbKARCZEWSKIbMAREK&amp;NU=01&amp;DD=1 ''"Pięknem urzeczeni (trzy zapomniane relacje)"'' ("Enchanted by beauty:  three forgotten relations")], ''Aura'' 1, 1998, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish journalist and novelist [[Bolesław Prus]] described his 1878 visit to the salt mine in a remarkable series of three articles, "''Kartki z podróży (Wieliczka)''" ["Travel Notes (Wieliczka)"], in ''Kurier Warszawski'' (The Warsaw Courier), 1878, nos. 36–38.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in [[Bolesław Prus]], ''Wczoraj–dziś–jutro:  wybór felietonów'' (Yesterday–Today–Tomorrow:  a Selection of Newspaper Columns, selected, edited, and with foreword and notes, by [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]]), Warsaw, [[Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy]], 1973, pp. 34–49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The great Prus scholar [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]] writes:  "The power of the Labyrinth scenes [in Prus' 1895 historical novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''] stems, among other things, from the fact that they echo Prus' own experiences when visiting Wieliczka."&lt;ref name="Twórczość Bolesława Prusa 1972, p. 451"/&gt;  The Wieliczka Salt Mine indeed helped inspire ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref name="Pharaoh 1997, pp. 349"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "[[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' and the Wieliczka Salt Mine," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1997, no. 3, pp. 349–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prus combined his powerful impressions of the salt mine with the description of the ancient Egyptian [[Labyrinth#Herodotus' Egyptian labyrinth|Labyrinth]], in Book II of [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', to produce the remarkable scenes found in chapters 56 and 63 of his novel.&lt;ref name="Prus' 1994, p. 47"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, ''Preisner's Music'', a compilation of film music by Polish composer [[Zbigniew Preisner]], was recorded by ''Sinfonia Varsovia'' in the Wieliczka mine's chapel. The chapel is often said to have the best acoustics in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Preisner]], "Preisner's Music", Virgin France, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australia television series [[Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord]], the mines were used as the Land of the Moloch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">'''Edward Yechezkel Kutscher''' or Yechezkel Kutscher ({{lang-he|יחזקאל קוטשר}}; 1 June 1909 – 12 December 1971) was an Israeli [[Philology|philologist]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[linguist]].

== Biography ==
Kutscher was born in 1909 in [[Topoľčany]], [[Slovakia]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He studied at the [[yeshiva]] in his home town and, later, in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]. In 1931 he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and continued with his studies at the [[Mercaz HaRav|Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva]] and at a [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Movement]] teachers seminary. For several years subsequently, he taught at various schools in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]].

In 1941, he completed his studies in Hebrew linguistics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and, in 1949, began lecturing in linguistics at the Hebrew University, which he continued to do until his death. In 1960 he was appointed a professor. In 1958 he also started lecturing at [[Bar-Ilan University]].

For many years Kutscher was a member of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and its predecessor, the Hebrew Language Committee (Vaʻad ha-lashon ha-ʻIvrit). In 1965 he was appointed editor of the periodical ''[[Leshonenu]]'' ("''Our Language''").

Kutscher was regarded as "probably the greatest living authority on Aramaic until his death in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le-ma'am Ziony: Essays in Honor of Ziony Zevit|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|work=H.H. Rowley's Aramaic of the Old Testament after (Almost) a Century|publisher=Cascade Books|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4982-0691-4|editor-last=Greenspahn|editor-first=Frederick E.|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research work included the study of different [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] scripts, including the [[Kaufmann Manuscript]] and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. His work revealed the Kaufmann Manuscript to be most authentic of the [[Mishnah]].

== Awards ==
* In 1961, Kutscher was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for the [[humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashka|title=Israel Prize recipients in 1961 (in Hebrew)|publisher=cms.education.gov.il (Israel Prize official website) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ousTKSWz|archivedate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
