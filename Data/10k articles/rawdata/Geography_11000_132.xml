The '''anthroposphere''' (sometimes also referred as '''technosphere''') is that part of the environment that is made or modified by humans for use in human activities and [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s. It is one of the [[Earth's spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhn| first1 = A.| last2 = Heckelei | first2 = T. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Anthroposphere| journal = Impacts of Global Change on the Hydrological Cycle in West and Northwest Africa| volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]| location = | date = 4 June 2010| language = | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-12957-5_8 | editor-last1 = Speth|editor-first1 = Peter|editor-last2 = Christoph|editor-first2 = Michael |editor-last3 = Diekkrüger|editor-first3 = Bernd| jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = 25 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As human technology becomes more evolved, such as the greater ability of technology to cause deforestation, the impact of human activities on the environment potentially increases.

[[Image:Benchmark in Edinburgh.jpg|right|thumb|180px|An [[Ordnance Survey]] cut mark in the UK]]
[[File:Benchmark on rock near Llyn Crafnant.jpg|thumb|Occasionally a non-vertical face was used, and a slightly different mark was used]]

The term '''benchmark''', or '''bench mark''', originates from the chiseled horizontal marks that [[Surveying|surveyor]]s made in stone structures, into which an angle-iron could be placed to form a "bench" for a [[Level staff|leveling rod]], thus ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately repositioned in the same place in the future. These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled [[Broad arrow|arrow]] below the horizontal line.

The term is generally applied to any item used to mark a point as an elevation reference.  Frequently, bronze or aluminum disks are set in stone or concrete, or on rods driven deeply into the earth to provide a stable elevation point. If an elevation is marked on a map, but there is no physical mark on the ground, it is a [[spot height]].

The [[Height#In geodesy|height]] of a benchmark is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending from a ''fundamental benchmark''.  A fundamental benchmark is a point with a precisely known relationship to the level datum of the area, typically [[mean sea level]]. The position and height of each benchmark is shown on large-scale maps.

The terms "height" and "elevation" are often used interchangeably, but in many jurisdictions they have specific meanings; "height" commonly refers to a local or relative difference in the vertical (such as the height of a building), whereas "elevation" refers to the difference from a nominated reference surface (such as sea-level, or a mathematical/geodetic model that approximates the sea level known as the [[geoid]]).  Elevation may be specified as [[normal height]] (above a reference ellipsoid), [[orthometric height]], or [[dynamic height]] which have slightly different definitions.

== Other types of survey marks ==
[[Image:Flush bracket G4863.jpg|right|thumb|180px|An [[Ordnance Survey]] flush bracket]]

[[Triangulation]] points, also known as [[trig point]]s, are marks with a precisely established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as the tip of a [[church (building)|church]] [[spire]] or a [[chimney stack]] are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the [[United Kingdom]] triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as "fixed in three dimensions".

==Agencies responsible for benchmarks==
Benchmarks are typically placed ("monumented") by a government agency or private survey firm, and many governments maintain a register of these marks so that the records are available to all. These records are usually in the form of a geographically searchable database (computer or map-based), with links to sketches, diagrams, photos of the marks, and any other technical details.

Government agencies that place and maintain records of benchmarks include:

[[Image:Districts of Madagascar.png|right|thumb|200px|Districts of Madagascar]]
'''Districts''' are second-level [[administrative division]]s of [[Madagascar]] below the [[Regions of Madagascar|regions]]. There are 114 districts in Madagascar. Districts are in their turn divided into communes; while some of the districts in urban areas (such as the City districts of [[Antananarivo]], [[Antsirabe|Antsirabe I]], [[Antsiranana|Antsiranana I]], [[Fianarantsoa|Fianarantsoa I]], [[Toamasina|Toamasina I]] and [[Toliara|Toliara I]]) and offshore islands (such as the districts of [[Nosy Be]] and [[Nosy Boraha]]) each consist of only one commune, most of the districts are divided typically into 5&amp;ndash;20 communes.

A geomorphological system said to be in '''dynamic steady state''' has values that oscillate between [[maxima and minima]] around a central mean value.

The flux of sediment from an undisturbed drainage basin changes over the short-term as rainstorms come and go, individual hillslopes fail in mass movements, and riverbanks collapse. Over the long-term, the flux of sediment from a drainage basin oscillates around a mean value, producing a dynamic steady state, unless there are significant changes in boundary conditions such as climate, vegetation cover, or uplift rate.&lt;ref name=Bierman&gt;Bierman, P. R., Montgomery, D. R. Equilibrium and Steady State. Key Concepts in Geomorphology (2014) W. H. Freeman and Company Publishers 41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010. www.whfreeman.com
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equilibrium==

The concept of balance, or equilibrium, between landforms and geomorphological processes provides a useful conceptual framework to study the evolution of landscapes, as well as understanding nonequilibrium landforms and landscapes. Often it is useful or convenient to assume that an equilibrium landscape does not change over time – a condition referred to as steady state. Equilibrium however is not static, but rather is a dynamic steady state with landscape characteristics that vary over time around a central tendency. This information suggests that steady state is strongly scale dependent.&lt;ref name=Bierman /&gt;

==Systems (dynamic v. non-dynamic)==

Systems can be defined as dynamic or non-dynamic in an equilibrium state. Besides the usual transient condition, where at least one quantity changes with time, stable dynamic systems may be in a steady state condition or equilibrium state where the system is at rest.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhm&lt;/ref&gt; This special condition is possible after sometime, when all input and output quantities are and remain constant. The relation between [[input and output]] quantities for a system in a steady state condition is called “Static Transfer Response of the Dynamic System”. Dynamic systems can be defined as static and transient, while this is seemingly contradictory, this indicates that the system is always a dynamic system, even if it remains momentarily in a steady state condition. The opposite of dynamic is not static but non-dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruhm, K. H. Dynamic System in Steady State Condition – State Space. Internet portal “Measurement Science and Technology”; Document: www.ethz.ch/dok01/d0000881.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response time (state changes) ==

When boundary conditions change significantly, geomorphic systems adjust. These adjustments aren't instantaneous, but rather, there is a lag in change, this is the response time. Many geomorphic systems are in steady state with their central tendencies oscillating in equilibrium around a mean value, however, when external factors such as climate or base level change, the system can cross a threshold, and after a certain response time, change to a new and different state in which the system will oscillate around a different mean value.&lt;ref name=Bierman /&gt;

An example of this condition is deforestation combined with agricultural land conversion, this increases the fluvial sediment flux to a new and higher dynamic steady state because soils are now disturbed by plowing and thus more vulnerable to erosion. In this process, a threshold is crossed and the system will enter a different state which means that the system now oscillates around a different mean value.&lt;ref name=Bierman /&gt;

== Geomorphic processes in dynamic steady state ==

The average slope of a mountain range remains constant if erosion and rock uplift rates are equal over time, even if individual erosional events greatly change local slopes in short-term. The timescales over which topography equilibrates to changes in landscape-forming processes range from seasonal resurfacing of gravel stream-beds following winter storms to the tens of millions of years it can take to erode mountain ranges.&lt;ref name=Bierman /&gt;

Over the past 600 million years, [[Phanerozoic]] time, the earth has supported a complex population of [[organisms]]. The earth has waxed and waned but has remained within the ranges of composition necessary for life to evolve. Because all of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is used for photosynthesis by living organisms, it enters and leaves surface ocean waters every few years, and because it is all used in the weathering processes on land every few thousand years, efficient feedback mechanisms must have operated to hold atmospheric carbon dioxide within relatively narrow limits during all environmental changes of the Phanerozoic time. If at any point over this time span the concentration of carbon dioxide had dropped to less than 1/3 of its present value, almost all photosynthesis would have stopped, but the records show that this has not happened. The conclusion that the long-term circulation of materials of the earths surface environment can be regarded as a dynamic system, protected from severe perturbations by effective feedback mechanisms and without major secular trends, seems reasonable.{{to whom|date=December 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;Garrels, R. M., Lerman, A., Mackenzie, F. T.

'''Euxinia''' or '''euxinic conditions''' occur when water is both [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] and sulfidic. This means that there is no [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a raised level of free [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water.  The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (''Euxeinos Pontos)''- which translates to "hospitable sea".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Katja M.|last2=Kump|first2=Lee R.|date=2008-04-29|title=Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=251–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinic deep water is a key component of the [[Canfield ocean]], a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the [[Boring Billion]] proposed by [[Donald Canfield]], an American geologist, in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|date=2008-08-15|title=Ironing Out Ocean Chemistry at the Dawn of Animal Life|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/923|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=923–924|doi=10.1126/science.1162870|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18703731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.

== Background ==
Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|last2=Anbar|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Severmann|first3=Silke|last4=Scott|first4=Clint|last5=Gill|first5=Benjamin C.|date=2009-04-27|title=Tracking Euxinia in the Ancient Ocean: A Multiproxy Perspective and Proterozoic Case Study|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=507–534|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small [[black shale]] deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_1|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|last=Torres|first=Martha E.

Sosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=D. E.|year=|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/24839|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of [[banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in [[iron sulfide]] (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic [[oxidant]] instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has become what is known as the [[Canfield ocean]], a model backed by the increase in presence of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sedimentary [[pyrite]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate [[evaporite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melezhik|first=Victor A.|last2=Fallick|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Rychanchik|first3=Dmitry V.|last4=Kuznetsov|first4=Anton B.|date=2005-04-01|title=Palaeoproterozoic evaporites in Fennoscandia: implications for seawater sulphate, the rise of atmospheric oxygen and local amplification of the δ13C excursion|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x/abstract|journal=Terra Nova|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x|issn=1365-3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anoxic event|Anoxia]] and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or "toxic" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in [[meromictic lakes]] and silled basins such as the [[Black Sea]] and some fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|600x600px|Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean]]
The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the presence of [[Sulfate|sulfate ions]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), organic matter (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|bacteria]] capable of reducing sulfate to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria utilize the [[redox]] potential of sulfate as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and organic matter as a [[Reducing agent|reductant]] to generate chemical energy through [[Anaerobic respiration|cellular respiration]]. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:

2CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the [[By-product|byproduct]] hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of oxygen and [[gas exchange]] between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in [[seabed]] [[sediment]]s that have a strong [[redox gradient]] and become [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] at some depth below the [[Sediment–water interface|sediment-water interface]]. In the ocean the [[Reaction rate|rate]] of these reactions is not [https://online.science.psu.edu/biol011_active002/node/4343 limited] by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative [[weathering]] of [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] became a major source of sulfate to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E. M.|year=1982|title=Sulphate and sulphate reduction in early Precambrian oceans|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5853/pdf/296145a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=296|pages=145–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|year=|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2688866|pmid=19451639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or [[nitrate]], so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[denitrifying bacteria]]. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include [[anoxic waters]], high [[nutrient]] levels, and a [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] water column.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the [[Canfield ocean]], are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the [[geologic record]] at relevant locations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nutrient traps ===
In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the [[photic zone]], supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}), comes from [[weathering]] of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=C. M.|last2=Mills|first2=M. M.|last3=Arrigo|first3=K. R.|last4=Berman-Frank|first4=I.|last5=Bopp|first5=L.|last6=Boyd|first6=P. W.|last7=Galbraith|first7=E. D.|last8=Geider|first8=R. J.|last9=Guieu|first9=C.|title=Processes and patterns of oceanic nutrient limitation|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1765|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=9|pages=701–710|doi=10.1038/ngeo1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Geography ====
[[File:FjordCirculation.JPG|thumb|399x399px|A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers.]]
The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to [[plate tectonics]], resulting in the [[bathymetry]] of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stratification ====
Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelburg|first=J.

=== Warming climate ===
A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the [[solubility]] of [[Ocean deoxygenation|oxygen decreases]], allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotinski|first=Roberta M.|year=2001|title=Ocean stagnation and end-Permian anoxia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235451836_Ocean_Stagnation_and_end_Permian_anoxia|journal=Geology|volume=29|pages=7–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Volcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Evidence for euxinic events ==

=== Black shale ===
[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]
Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Geochemistry ===
Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Isotopes ====
[[Stable isotope ratio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945435170|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) become equal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;  is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the [[Black Sea]], molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4−x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; ).&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=G.

Bacteria such as [[green sulfur bacteria]] (GSB) and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments.

==== Iron geochemistry ====
[[Pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and bioreactive iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy|last2=Severmann|first2=Silke|year=2006|title=A critical look at iron paleoredox proxies: New insights from modern euxinic marine basins|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=70|pages=5698–5722|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raiswell|first=R.|last2=Newton|first2=R.|last3=Wignall|first3=P.

== Euxinic events in Earth's history ==

  [[File:Timeline of euxinia in ancient oceans.png|thumb|660x660px|Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;]]

=== Proterozoic ===
The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the [[Banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|year=|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=361|issue=1470|pages=903–915|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1838|issn=0962-8436|pmid=16754606|via=|pmc=1578726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulton|first=Simon W.|last2=Fralick|first2=Philip W.|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|date=2004-09-09|title=The transition to a sulphidic ocean {{!}}[sim]{{!}} 1.84 billion years ago|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7005/full/nature02912.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=431|issue=7005|pages=173–177|doi=10.1038/nature02912|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the [[Boring Billion]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yanan|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E.|last3=Knoll|first3=Andrew H.|date=2002-02-01|title=Middle Proterozoic ocean chemistry: Evidence from the McArthur Basin, northern Australia|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/302/2/81|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=302|issue=2|pages=81–109|doi=10.2475/ajs.302.2.81|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found biomarkers for [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brocks|first=Jochen J.|last2=Love|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Summons|first3=Roger E.|last4=Knoll|first4=Andrew H.|last5=Logan|first5=Graham A.|last6=Bowden|first6=Stephen A.|date=2005-10-06|title=Biomarker evidence for green and purple sulphur bacteria in a stratified Palaeoproterozoic sea|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/abs/nature04068.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=437|issue=7060|pages=866–870|doi=10.1038/nature04068|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=C.|last2=Lyons|first2=T.

=== Phanerozoic ===
There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Paleozoic ====

The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. “Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.” ''Nature'' 469 (7328): 80–83. doi:10.1038/nature09700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Tatiana|last2=Strauss|first2=Harald|last3=Guo|first3=Qingjun|last4=Liu|first4=Congqiang|date=2007-10-08|title=Reconstructing marine redox conditions for the Early Cambrian Yangtze Platform: Evidence from biogenic sulphur and organic carbon isotopes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207001800|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|series=From Snowball Earth to the Cambrian bioradiation: calibration of Ediacaran-Cambrian history in South China|volume=254|issue=1–2|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodfellow|first=Wayne D|last2=Jonasson|first2=Ian R|year=1984|title=Data from ocean stagnation and ventilation defined by secular trends in pyrite and baritye, Selwyn Basin, Yukon|url=|journal=Geology|volume=12|pages=583–586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Tim K.|last2=Hardie|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Timofeeff|first3=Michael N.|last4=Demicco|first4=Robert V.|title=Secular variation in seawater chemistry and the origin of calcium chloride basinal brines|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG19728R.1|journal=Geology|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1130/g19728r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods.

Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the [[Kellwasser event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=David|last2=Wignall|first2=Paul B.|last3=Racki|first3=Grzegorz|date=2004-03-01|title=Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/div-classtitleextent-and-duration-of-marine-anoxia-during-the-frasnianfamennian-late-devonian-mass-extinction-in-poland-germany-austria-and-francediv/E23779056D0B8D8520D5A7E04FFF5B1D|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=141|issue=2|pages=173–193|doi=10.1017/S0016756804008866|issn=1469-5081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the [[Carboniferous]], most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=K.

==== Mesozoic ====

The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct [[Ocean anoxic event|Ocean Anoxic Event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cenozoic ====
Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Modern euxinia ==
 
Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Meromictic lakes ===
[[Meromictic lake]]s are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for [[limnic eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|title=Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa|last=Tietze|first=Klaus|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|isbn=9783663052418|editor-last=Freeth|editor-first=Samuel J.|series=International Monograph Series|pages=97–107|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|editor-last2=Ofoegbu|editor-first2=Charles O.|editor-last3=Onuoha|editor-first3=K.

[[File:Mariager fjord vinter.jpg|thumb|Mariager fjord often produces a "rotten egg" smell in the summer due to sulfur content.]]

=== North Sea fjords ===
Some [[fjord]]s develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water.  Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Ketil B|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E|date=2004-02-01|title=Annual fluctuations in sulfur isotope fractionation in the water column of a euxinic marine basin 1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703703003879|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=68|issue=3|pages=503–515|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Framvaren Fjord ====

This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millero|first=Frank J.|date=1991-07-01|title=The oxidation of H2S in Framvaren Fjord|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=1007–1014|doi=10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Wensheng|last2=Millero|first2=Frank J.|title=The chemistry of the anoxic waters in the Framvaren Fjord, Norway|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01025231|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–88|doi=10.1007/BF01025231|issn=1380-6165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.

Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomova|first=Svetlana|last2=Braaten|first2=Hans Fredrik|last3=Yakushev|first3=Evgeniy|last4=Skei|first4=Jens|date=2014-04-28|year=|title=Biogeochemical consequences of an oxygenated intrusion into an anoxic fjord|url=http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/15/1/5|journal=Geochemical Transactions|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1186/1467-4866-15-5|issn=1467-4866|pmid=24872727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mariager Fjord ====

This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least 5 times in the last century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a [[harmful algal bloom]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

'''Geographical distance''' is the [[distance]] measured along the surface of the [[earth]]. The formulae in this article calculate distances between points which are defined by geographical coordinates in terms of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. This distance is an element in solving the [[Geodesy#Geodetic problems|second (inverse) geodetic problem]].

==Introduction==
Calculating the distance between geographical coordinates is based on some level of abstraction; it does not provide an ''exact'' distance, which is unattainable if one attempted to account for every irregularity in the surface of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartography.org.uk/default.asp?contentID=749&lt;/ref&gt; Common abstractions for the surface between two geographic points are:

*Flat surface;
*Spherical surface;
*Ellipsoidal surface.

All abstractions above ignore changes in elevation. Calculation of distances which account for changes in elevation relative to the idealized surface are not discussed in this article.

===Nomenclature===

Distance, &lt;math&gt;D,\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is calculated between two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The geographical coordinates of the two points, as (latitude, longitude) pairs, are &lt;math&gt;(\phi_1,\lambda_1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\phi_2,\lambda_2),\,\!&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Which of the two points is designated as &lt;math&gt;P_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not important for the calculation of distance.

Latitude and longitude coordinates on maps are usually expressed in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. In the given forms of the formulae below, one or more values ''must'' be expressed in the specified units to obtain the correct result. Where geographic coordinates are used as the argument of a trigonometric function, the values may be expressed in any angular units compatible with the method used to determine the value of the trigonometric function. Many electronic calculators allow calculations of trigonometric functions in either degrees or [[radian]]s. The calculator mode must be compatible with the units used for geometric coordinates.

Differences in latitude and longitude are labeled and calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta\phi&amp;=\phi_2-\phi_1;\\
\Delta\lambda&amp;=\lambda_2-\lambda_1.
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is not important whether the result is positive or negative when used in the formulae below.

"Mean latitude" is labeled and calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_m=\frac{\phi_1+\phi_2}{2}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Colatitude is labeled and calculated as follows:
:For latitudes expressed in radians:
::&lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}-\phi;\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:For latitudes expressed in degrees:
::&lt;math&gt;\theta=90^\circ-\phi.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Unless specified otherwise, the [[Earth radius|radius]] of the earth for the calculations below is:
:&lt;math&gt;R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 6,371.009 kilometers = 3,958.761 statute miles = 3,440.069 [[nautical mile]]s.

&lt;math&gt;D_\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Distance between the two points, as measured along the surface of the earth and in the same units as the value used for radius unless specified otherwise.

===Singularities and discontinuity of latitude/longitude===

Longitude has [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]] (longitude is undefined) and a [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] at the ±[[180th meridian|180° meridian]]. Also, planar projections of the [[Circle of latitude|circles of constant latitude]] are highly curved near the Poles. Hence, the above equations for [[Delta (letter)|delta]] latitude/longitude (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda\!&lt;/math&gt;) and mean latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi_m\!&lt;/math&gt;) may not give the expected answer for positions near the Poles or the ±180° meridian. Consider e.g.  the value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda\!&lt;/math&gt; (“east displacement”) when &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2\!&lt;/math&gt; are on either side of the ±180° meridian, or the value of &lt;math&gt;\phi_m\!&lt;/math&gt; (“mean latitude”) for the two positions (&lt;math&gt;\phi_1\!&lt;/math&gt;=89°, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\!&lt;/math&gt;=45°) and (&lt;math&gt;\phi_2\!&lt;/math&gt;=89°, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2\!&lt;/math&gt;=−135°).

If a calculation based on latitude/longitude should be valid for all Earth positions, it should be verified that  the discontinuity and the Poles are handled correctly. Another solution is to use [[n-vector|''n''-vector]] instead of latitude/longitude, since this [[horizontal position representation|representation]] does not have discontinuities or singularities.

==Flat-surface formulae==

A planar approximation for the surface of the earth may be useful over small distances. The accuracy of distance calculations using this approximation become increasingly inaccurate as:

* The separation between the points becomes greater;
* A point becomes closer to a geographic pole.

The shortest distance between two points in plane is a straight line. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] is used to calculate the distance between points in a plane.

Even over short distances, the accuracy of geographic distance calculations which assume a flat Earth depend on the method by which the latitude and longitude coordinates have been [[map projection|projected]] onto the plane. The projection of latitude and longitude coordinates onto a plane is the realm of [[cartography]].

The formulae presented in this section provide varying degrees of accuracy.

===Spherical Earth projected to a plane===

This formula takes into account the variation in distance between meridians with latitude:

:&lt;math&gt;D=R\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^2+(\cos(\phi_m)\Delta\lambda)^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:where:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are in radians;
::&lt;math&gt;\phi_m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be in units compatible with the method used for determining &lt;math&gt;\cos(\phi_m).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:To convert latitude or longitude to radians use
::&lt;math&gt; 1^\circ = (\pi/180)\,\mathrm{radians}.&lt;/math&gt;

This approximation is very fast and produces fairly accurate result for small distances {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Also, when ordering locations by distance, such as in a database query, it is much faster to order by squared distance, eliminating the need for computing the square root.

===Ellipsoidal Earth projected to a plane===

The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] prescribes the following formulae for distances not exceeding {{convert|475|km|mi}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reference points and distance computations|journal=Code of Federal Regulations (annual edition). Title 47: Telecommunication.|date=October 1, 2016|volume=73.208|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2016-title47-vol4/pdf/CFR-2016-title47-vol4-sec73-208.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D=\sqrt{(K_1\Delta\phi)^2+(K_2\Delta\lambda)^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;D\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Distance in kilometers;
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are in degrees;
::&lt;math&gt;\phi_m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be in units compatible with the method used for determining &lt;math&gt;\cos(\phi_m);\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
K_1&amp;=111.13209-0.56605\cos(2\phi_m)+0.00120\cos(4\phi_m);\\
K_2&amp;=111.41513\cos(\phi_m)-0.09455\cos(3\phi_m)+0.00012\cos(5\phi_m).\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:Where &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; are in units of kilometers per degree.  It may be interesting to note that:
::&lt;math&gt;K_1=M\frac{\pi}{180}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = kilometers per degree of latitude difference;
::&lt;math&gt;K_2=\cos(\phi_m)N\frac{\pi}{180}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = kilometers per degree of longitude difference;
::where &lt;math&gt;M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the '''''m'''eridional'' and its perpendicular, or "'''''n'''ormal''", [[Radius of curvature (applications)#Principal radii of curvature|radii of curvature]] (the expressions in the FCC formula are derived from the [[binomial series]] expansion form of &lt;math&gt;M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, set to the ''Clarke 1866'' [[reference ellipsoid]]).

===Polar coordinate flat-Earth formula===
:&lt;math&gt;D=R\sqrt{\theta^2_1\;\boldsymbol{+}\;\theta^2_2\;\mathbf{-}\;2\theta_1\theta_2\cos(\Delta\lambda)},&lt;/math&gt;
:where the colatitude values are in radians. For a latitude measured in degrees, the colatitude in radians may be calculated as follows: &lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{\pi}{180}(90^\circ-\phi).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Spherical-surface formulae==
{{main|Great-circle distance}}
If we are willing to accept a possible error of 0.5%, we can use formulas of [[spherical trigonometry]] on the sphere that best approximates the surface of the earth.

The shortest distance along the surface of a sphere between two points on the surface is along the great-circle which contains the two points.

The [[great-circle distance]] article gives the formula for calculating the distance along a great-circle on a sphere about the size of the Earth. That article includes an example of the calculation.

===Tunnel distance===

A tunnel between points on Earth is defined by a line through three-dimensional space between the points of interest.
The great circle chord length may be calculated as follows for the corresponding unit sphere:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta{X}=\cos(\phi_2)\cos(\lambda_2) - \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\lambda_1);\\
&amp;\Delta{Y}=\cos(\phi_2)\sin(\lambda_2) - \cos(\phi_1)\sin(\lambda_1);\\
&amp;\Delta{Z}=\sin(\phi_2) - \sin(\phi_1);\\
&amp;C_h=\sqrt{(\Delta{X})^2 + (\Delta{Y})^2 + (\Delta{Z})^2}.\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The tunnel distance between points on the surface of a spherical Earth is
&lt;math&gt;D = R C_h&lt;/math&gt;.  For short distances (&lt;math&gt;D\ll R&lt;/math&gt;), this underestimates the great circle distance by &lt;math&gt;D(D/R)^2/24&lt;/math&gt;.

==Ellipsoidal-surface formulae==
{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}

[[File:Long geodesic on an oblate ellipsoid.svg|thumb|
Geodesic on an oblate ellipsoid]]
An ellipsoid approximates the surface of the earth much better than a
sphere or a flat surface does.  The shortest distance along the surface
of an ellipsoid between two points on the surface is along the
[[geodesic]].  Geodesics follow more complicated paths than great
circles and in particular, they usually don't return to their starting
positions after one circuit of the earth.  This is illustrated in the
figure on the right where ''f'' is taken to be 1/50 to accentuate the
effect.  Finding the geodesic between two points on the earth, the
so-called [[inverse geodetic problem]], was the focus of many
mathematicians and geodesists over the course of the 18th and 19th
centuries with major contributions by

Methods for computing the geodesic distance are widely available in
[[geographical information systems]], software libraries, standalone
utilities, and online tools.  The most widely used algorithm is by
[[Thaddeus Vincenty|Vincenty]],&lt;ref&gt;

who uses a series which is accurate to third order in the flattening of
the ellipsoid, i.e., about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm; however, the algorithm fails to
converge for points that are nearly [[Antipodes|antipodal]].  (For
details, see [[Vincenty's formulae]].)  This defect is cured in the
algorithm given by
Karney,&lt;ref&gt;

This results in an algorithm which is accurate to full double precision
and which converges for arbitrary pairs of points on the earth.  This
algorithm is implemented in GeographicLib.&lt;ref&gt;

The exact methods above are feasible when carrying out calculations on a
computer. They are intended to give millimeter accuracy on lines of any
length; we can use simpler formulas if we don't need millimeter
accuracy, or if we do need millimeter accuracy but the line is short.

give accuracy on the order of 10 meters over thousands of kilometers. First convert the latitudes &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \phi_2&lt;/math&gt; of the two points to [[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|reduced latitudes]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \beta_1&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle  \beta_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \tan \beta = (1 - f) \tan \phi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the flattening.
Then calculate the [[central angle]] &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt; in radians between two points &lt;math&gt; (\beta_1 , \; \lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (\beta_2 , \; \lambda_2)&lt;/math&gt; on a sphere using [[Great-circle distance|the Great-circle distance method]] ([[spherical law of cosines|law of cosines]] or [[haversine formula]]), with longitudes &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \; &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 \; &lt;/math&gt; being the same on the sphere as on the spheroid.

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac { \beta_1 + \beta_2 }{2} \qquad Q = \frac {\beta_2 - \beta_1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X = ( \sigma - \sin \sigma) \frac {\sin^2 P \cos^2 Q}{ \cos^2 \frac { \sigma}{2}} \qquad \qquad Y = ( \sigma + \sin \sigma) \frac {\cos^2 P \sin^2 Q}{ \sin^2 \frac { \sigma}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{distance} = a \bigl( \sigma - \tfrac f2 (X + Y) \bigr) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the equatorial radius of the chosen spheroid.

On the [[GRS 80]] spheroid Lambert's formula is off by

:0 North 0 West to 40 North 120 West, 12.6 meters
:0N 0W to 40N 60W, 6.6 meters
:40N 0W to 40N 60W, 0.85 meter

===Bowring's method for short lines===

Bowring maps the points to a sphere of radius ''R&amp;prime;'', with latitude and longitude represented as &amp;phi;&amp;prime; and &amp;lambda;&amp;prime;.  Define
:&lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{1 + e'^2\cos^4 \phi_1}, \quad B = \sqrt{1 + e'^2\cos^2 \phi_1},&lt;/math&gt;
where the second eccentricity squared is
:&lt;math&gt; e'^2 = \frac{a^2 - b^2}{b^2} = \frac{f(2-f)}{(1-f)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The spherical radius is
:&lt;math&gt;R' = \frac{\sqrt{1 + e'^2 }}{B^2} a.&lt;/math&gt;
(The [[Gaussian curvature]] of the ellipsoid at &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 1/''R&amp;prime;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)
The spherical coordinates are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tan\phi_1' &amp;= \frac{\tan\phi}B,\\
\Delta\phi' &amp;=  \frac{\Delta \phi}{B}\biggl[1 + \frac{3 e'^2 }{4 B^2}(\Delta \phi) \sin (2 \phi_1 + \tfrac23 \Delta \phi )\biggr],\\
\Delta\lambda' &amp;= A\Delta\lambda,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi=\phi_2-\phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi'=\phi_2'-\phi_1'&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda=\lambda_2-\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\lambda'=\lambda_2'-\lambda_1'&lt;/math&gt;.  The resulting problem on the sphere may be solved using the techniques for [[great-circle navigation]] to give approximations for the spheroidal distance and bearing.  Detailed formulas are given by Rapp,&lt;ref name=rapp91/&gt; &amp;sect;6.5 and Bowring.&lt;ref name=bowring81/&gt;

The '''[[Cayman Islands]]''' are a [[British overseas territories|British dependency]] and [[island country]]. It is a three-island [[archipelago]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], consisting of [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Brac]], and [[Little Cayman]].

==Geology==
The islands are located on the Cayman Rise which forms the northern margin of the [[Cayman Trough]]. The trough is the deepest point in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern [[Cuba]] along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward [[Costa Rica]] and resulted from [[Paleocene]] to [[Eocene]] [[island arc]] formation with associated [[volcanism]] along an extinct [[subduction zone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/165_SR/chap_20/chap_20.htm H.

Davies and M.A. Brunt (1994), "Scientific Studies in the Cayman Islands", in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9rjEbZWPLvcC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The Cayman Islands: Natural History and Biogeography'', Volume 71], edited by M. A. Brunt. Springer. p. 1. {{ISBN|9780792324621}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Islands' location, the Cayman Islands do get [[earthquakes]].

== Climate ==
The Cayman Islands have a [[tropical wet and dry climate]], with a wet season from May to October, and a dry season that runs from November to April. Terrain is mostly a low-lying [[limestone]] base surrounded by [[coral reef]]s.

Besides [[earthquakes]] another major [[natural hazard]] is the [[tropical cyclone]]s that form during the [[Atlantic hurricane season]] from July to November.

== Environmental issues ==
An important environmental issue is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources. [[Drinking water]] supplies must be met by [[rainwater]] catchment and [[desalination]]. In addition there is also a problem with trash washing up on the beaches or being deposited by there by residents. The Cayman Islands have no recycling or waste treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/10/04/1100-pounds-of-garbage-plucked-from-beach/|title=1,100 pounds of garbage plucked from beach - Cayman Compass|author=|date=|website=www.caymancompass.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117011931/https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/10/04/1100-pounds-of-garbage-plucked-from-beach/|archivedate=17 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural resources ==
[[File:Map of Grand Kayman.gif|Map of Grand Cayman|thumb|400px]]
[[File:North Side Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sunset from North Side beach, Grand Cayman]]
[[Natural resource]]s include [[fish]] and a climate and beaches that foster [[tourism]], which is the islands' major industry. A 2012 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 0.83 percent [[arable land]] and 2.08 percent permanent crops.

== Districts ==
The territory is subdivided into six districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island, Grand Cayman. The sixth, Sister Islands, comprises the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.

'''Hachures''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|ʊər|z}} are an older mode of [[Cartographic relief depiction|representing relief]]. They show orientation of slope, and by their thickness and overall density they provide a general sense of steepness. Being non-numeric, they are less useful to a scientific survey than contours, but can successfully communicate quite specific shapes of terrain. They are a form of [[shading]], although different from the one used in [[Cartographic relief depiction#Shaded relief|shaded maps]].

Hachure representation of relief was standardized by the Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann in 1799.&lt;ref name="esri.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0701/althillshade.html |title= New Tools Produce Classic Cartographic Effects |author= Patrick J Kennelly and A Jon Kimerling |accessdate=2010-07-22 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hachures may be combined with other ways of representing relief, like shades, the result being a shaded hachure map; an example of such a map is the ''[[Dufour Map]]'' of [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/services/cartography/collection/dufour.html Dufour Map from The Federal Office of Topography of Switzerland]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110023146/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/services/cartography/collection/dufour.html |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil von Sydow]] designed maps with coloured hachures: green for lowlands and brown for highlands.

==Overview==
[[Image:Conquest mexico 1519 21.png|thumb|450px|A hachure map depicting [[Hernán Cortés|Cortes']] invasion route of Mexico.]]

Hachures are strokes (short line segments or curves) drawn in the direction of the steepest slope (the [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] direction).&lt;ref name="esri.com"/&gt; Steeper slopes are represented by thicker, shorter strokes, while gentler slopes are represented by thinner, longer and farther apart strokes. A very gentle slope or a flat area, like the top of a hill, are usually left blank.

The hachures are traditionally monocolour, usually black, gray or brown. Using two complementary colours for the hachures on a neutral background colour (e.g. black and white lines on gray map colour) would give a shading effect as if the relief were illuminated.

==Rules==
In representing relief with hachures on a map, six rules are to be followed, according to G.R.P. Lawrence (1979):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gD8pWkA6TcwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA548#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration |edition=2nd |editor= Elaine R S Hodges |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |year=2003 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The hachures are drawn in the direction of the steepest gradient.
# The hachures are arranged in rows perpendicular to their direction.
# The length and thickness of each stroke represents the drop in height along its direction: a short and thick stroke represents a short and steep slope, while a long and thin stroke represents a long and gentle slope.
# The strokes are spaced at an equal distance inside a row.
# The strokes have the same thickness inside a row.
# If the map is illuminated, strokes are thinner and farther apart on the illuminated side.

The Swiss cartographer [[Eduard Imhof]] set 5 similar rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/811 |author= Patrick J Kennelly and A Jon Kimerling |title= Desktop Hachure Maps from Digital Elevation Models |journal= Cartographic Perspectives |volume= 37 |year= 2000 |doi= 10.14714/CP37.811 |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Hachures follow the direction of steepest gradient
# Hachures are arranged in horizontal rows
# Hachure length corresponds to the local horizontal distance between assumed contours of a certain interval
# Hachure width is thicker for steeper slopes
# Hachure density remains constant throughout the map area.

If the illumination is vertical, rule 5 is kept; in the case of oblique illumination, it is dropped. The rules above are to be obeyed for large-scale maps. If the map being drawn is a small-scale map (less than 1:500 000 according to Imhof), rules may be relaxed in order to obtain a more suggestive representation.

Hachures are still used today on Large Scale maps to show slopes and on British Ordnance Survey Maps and also in various countries toposheets to show Road and Railway Cutting and Embankments. On British OS Maps they have become long triangles with the short base at the top, and always pointing downwards.  Embankments are further identified by having a line around them.

'''''Inventio Fortunata''''' (also '''''Inventio Fortunate''''', '''''Inventio Fortunat''''' or '''''Inventio Fortunatae'''''), "''Fortunate, or fortune-making, discovery''", is a [[lost work|lost book]], probably dating from the 14th century, containing a description of the [[North Pole]] as a [[magnetic]] island (the [[Rupes Nigra]]) surrounded by a giant [[whirlpool]] and [[Hyperborea|four continents]]. No direct extracts from the document have been discovered, but its influence on the Western idea of the geography of the [[Arctic]] region persisted for several centuries.

==The story of the ''Inventio''==
The book is said to be a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] written by a 14th-century [[Franciscan]] (Minorite) [[friar]] from [[Oxford]] who travelled the North Atlantic region in the early 1360s, making some half-a-dozen journeys conducting business on behalf of the King of England ([[Edward III]]). He described what he found on his first journey  to the islands beyond 54 degrees north in a book, ''Inventio Fortunata'', which he presented to the King.

Unfortunately, by the time Atlantic explorers were seeking information in the 1490s, the ''Inventio'' had gone missing, and was only known through a summary in a second text, the ''[[Itinerarium]],'' written by a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] traveller from [['s-Hertogenbosch]] named Jacobus Cnoyen (also known as James Cnoyen or Jakob van Knoyen; modern Knox). As will be discussed below, Cnoyen's summary was the basis for the depiction of the Arctic region on many maps, one of the earliest being Martin Behaim's 1492 globe. By the late 16th century, even Cnoyen's text was missing, so most of what we know of the contents of the ''Inventio Fortunata'', other than its use on maps, is found in a letter from the Flemish [[cartographer]] [[Gerardus Mercator]] to the English astronomer [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] dated April 20, 1577, now located in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Taylor
  | first = E.G.R.
  | author-link = Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor
  | title = A Letter Dated 1577 from Mercator to John Dee
  | journal = Imago Mundi
  | volume = 13
  | issue = 1
  | pages = 56–68
  | year = 1956
  | doi = 10.1080/03085695608592127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cnoyen's information came in a very round-about way. In 1364, a priest from one of the Atlantic islands had returned to [[Norway]], bringing with him an [[astrolabe]] which he had received from the visiting Franciscan friar, in exchange for a religious book. He made a detailed report to the King of Norway. Copies still survive of a social and geographical description of [[Greenland]] by a local church official named Ivar Bardarson, who turns up in Norwegian records in 1364, so this much of Cnoyen's story tallies well with reality (although this report does not contain the sort of personal information relayed by Cnoyen). Cnoyen seems to have obtained his information from Norwegian sources some time later, neither he nor the priest having actually seen the ''Inventio''.

Cnoyen's account (originally in his own language; translations here based on Eva Taylor's version&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;) mixes probable fact with what may have been his own attempts to research the background, stating that Greenland was first settled at the orders of [[King Arthur]], whose army supposedly conquered the North Atlantic islands. He also refers to the "indrawing seas"- currents which drew ships northward, so that:

:"nearly 4000 persons entered the indrawing seas who never returned. But in A.D. 1364 eight of these people came to the King's Court in Norway.  Among them were two priests, one of whom had an astrolabe, who was descended in the 5th generation from a [[Brussels]] citizen. One, I say: all eight were from those who had penetrated the northern regions in the first ships."

Of the visiting Franciscan, Cnoyen (or Mercator) summarised the priest's report thus:

:"Leaving the rest of the party who had come to the Islands, he journeyed further, through the whole of the North etc, and put into writing all the wonders of those Islands, and gave the King of England this book, which he called in Latin ''Inventio Fortunatae''."

In reality, the "book" may have been a detailed report, intended mainly to highlight the commercial possibilities offered by the North Atlantic following the decline of Norwegian interest in its colonies.

==Authorship==
Mercator's contemporary, the 16th-century English historian [[Richard Hakluyt]], identifies the author of the ''Inventio'' as [[Nicholas of Lynn]]. Hakluyt apparently arrived at this conclusion because of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s mention of Nicholas in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe.'' Hakluyt did not himself, of course, have a copy of the ''Inventio.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Nicholas was alive at the right time (very roughly -- he is quite likely to have been a child in 1360), and had the right skills, but he was a [[Carmelite]] friar, not a Franciscan, and no earlier biographer indicates that he spent years travelling back and forth across the Atlantic on government business. There is another possible candidate, about whom, unfortunately, almost nothing is known. According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, an Irishman named Hugh, who was a Franciscan, travelled widely in the 14th century, and wrote "a certain journey in one volume" -- but again, whether or not this was the ''Inventio'', no copy of it is known.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

==Influence on maps==


The concept of the pole as a magnetic mountain goes back at least to Roman times, but the author of ''Inventio Fortunata'' added other features to the picture as well as measurements. Whether or not the ''Inventio'' is the source of the medieval concept of the North Pole as a magnetic mountain surrounded by a circular continent divided by four powerful rivers, maps as early as [[Martin Behaim]]'s 1492 globe depict the region in this way. 

[[Johannes Ruysch]]'s ''Universalior cogniti orbis tabula'' from 1508, features a marginal note mentioning the ''Inventio Fortunata:''
:"It is said in the book concerning the fortunate discovery [Inventio Fortunate] that at the arctic pole there is a high magnetic rock, thirty-three German miles in circumference. A surging sea surrounds this rock, as if the water were discharged downward from a vase through an opening. Around it are islands, two of which are inhabited."

[[Image:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mercator's map from 1595 showing the [[Hyperborea|Arctic continent]].]]
[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s world map of 1569 reflects his reading of Cnoyen's ''Itinerarium.'' It also features a marginal note alluding to the Franciscan's "discovery", but not to the book itself, which he never saw: 

:"we have taken [the Arctic geography] from the Itinerium of Jacobus Cnoyen of the Hague, who makes some citations from the Gesta of Arthur of Britain; however, the greater and most important part he learned from a certain priest at the court of the king of Norway in 1364. He was descended in the fifth generation from those whom Arthur had sent to inhabit these lands, and he related that in the year 1360 a certain Minorite, an Englishman from Oxford, a mathematician, went to those islands; and leaving them, advanced still farther by magic arts and mapped out all and measured them by an astrolabe in practically the subjoined figure, as we have learned from Jacobus. The four canals there pictured he said flow with such current to the inner whirlpool, that if vessels once enter they cannot be driven back by wind." 

The Arctic map inset on Mercator's 1569 world map was the prototype for the influential and widely circulated ''Septentrionalium Terrarum'' of 1595, posthumously published by his son, and the maps in [[Ortelius]]'s ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of 1570. Both show the same configuration of the arctic regions as the 1569 map.

In his letter to Dee, Mercator further quotes Cnoyen's description of the Northern regions: 

:"...In the midst of the four countries is a Whirlpool into which there empty these four Indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel. It is 4 degrees wide on every side of the Pole, that is to say eight degrees altogether. Except that right under the Pole there lies a bare rock in the midst of the Sea. Its circumference is almost 33 French miles, and it is all of magnetic stone. And is as high as the clouds, so the Priest said, who had received the astrolabe from this Minorite in exchange for a Testament. And the Minorite himself had heard that one can see all round it from the Sea, and that it is black and glistening. And nothing grows thereon, for there is not so much as a handful of soil on it."

The persistence of this idea of the geography of the far north persisted throughout the 16th and 17th century. This is probably due to the influence of Ruysch, Mercator, and Ortelius. Maps were only revised when the region was explored and mapmakers obtained knowledge of the true geography of the Arctic.

More interesting to modern researchers are the people the friar encountered, "pygmies" who may well be identical with the [[Skraelings]] referred to in old Norse texts about Greenland, predecessors of the modern [[Inuit]].

==The John Day letter==
In 1956 a letter referring to the existence of the book was found in the ''[[Archivo General de Simancas]]'' (Spain) from the English merchant [[John Day (merchant)|John Day]] to "The Most Magnificent And Most Worthy Lord - The Lord Grand Admiral" (presumably [[Christopher Columbus]]).

In the letter, written in either December 1497 or January 1498, John Day says, 

:"...''Your Lordship's servant brought me your letter. I have seen its contents and I would be most desirous and most happy to serve you. I do not find the book Inventio Fortunata, and I thought that I (or he) was bringing it with my things, and I am very sorry not [to] find it because I wanted very much to serve you. I am sending the other book of [[Marco Polo]] and a copy of the land which has been found [by [[John Cabot]]]…"''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Farisi al-Istakhri''' ({{lang|ar|آبو إسحاق إبراهيم بن محمد الفارسي الإصطخري}}) (also ''Estakhri'', {{lang-fa|استخری}}, i.e. from the Iranian city of [[Istakhr]], b. - d. 957 AD [346AH]&lt;ref&gt;Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirous. "The Persian Gulf in the Geographical Views of the Ancient World" In ''Cartographie Historique du Golfe Persique''. Edited by M. Taleghani, D. Silva Couto, &amp; J.-L. Bacque-Grammont. Louvain, Belgium: Diffusion, 2006. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 10th century  [[Persian peoples|Persian]] travel-author and [[Geography in medieval Islam|geographer]] who wrote valuable accounts in Arabic of the many Muslim territories he visited during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].  Istakhri met the celebrated traveller-geographer [[Ibn Hawqal|Ibn Haukul]], while travelling in the [[Indus Valley]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabiclegends.com/Al-Istakhri.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and  Haukul's magnum opus, ''Kitab al-Surat al-Ard'', incorporated the work of Istakhri.

Istakhri's account of [[windmill]]s is the earliest known.

==Works==
Istakhri's two surviving works are:

*''Masalik al-Mamalik'' ({{lang|ar|مسالك الممالك}}, "Routes of the Realms")

*''Suwar al-Aqaaleem'' ( {{lang|ar|صور الاقاليم}}, "Pictures of the Regions")

==Published Editions==

An 8-volume edition of works by medieval Arab geographers, edited by the dutch orientalist [[Michael Jan de Goeje]] in a series titled ''Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum'' was published by Brill, Lugduni-Batavora (Leiden) in the 1870s.  An edition of Istakhri's MS text was produced for the first volume under the Latin title ''Viae Regnorum descriptio ditionis Moslemicae'' - "Description of Roads of the Kingdoms in Muslim territories".   In 1927 the editor [[Theodore Noldeke]] produced a second edition.

In 1845 the german orientalist [[A. D. Mordtmann]] published a translation in Hamburg with the title ''Das Buch der Länder von Schech Ebu Ishak el Farsi el Isztachri'', with a foreword by C. Ritter. (Schriften der Akademie von Ham Bd. 1, Abth. 2).

[[File:Bellin - Carte reduite de l'ocean septentrional.png|thumb|300px|right|Jacques-Nicolas Bellin: ''Carte réduite de l'océan septentrional...'', from: ''L'hydrographie françoise'', Paris 1766]]

'''Jacques Nicolas Bellin''' (1703 – 21 March 1772) was a French [[hydrographer]], [[geographer]], and member of the French intellectual group called the [[philosophes]].

Bellin was born in Paris. He was hydrographer of France's [[hydrographic office]], member of the ''Académie de Marine'' and of the [[Royal Society]] of London. Over a 50-year career, he produced a large number of maps of particular interest to the ''Ministère de la Marine''. His maps of Canada and of French territories in North America ([[New France]], [[Acadia]], [[Louisiana]]) are particularly valuable.  He died at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].

==First ''Ingenieur de la Marine''==

In 1721, at age 18, he was appointed hydrographer (chief cartographer) to the French Navy. In August 1741, he became the first ''Ingénieur de la Marine of the Depot des cartes et plans de la Marine'' (the French Hydrographical Office) and was named Official Hydrographer of the French King.

==Prodigious work, high standard of excellence==
[[File:Carte de la Guyane françoise et l'isle de Cayenne (Bellin, 1763).jpg|thumbnail|''Carte de la Guyane françoise et l'isle de Cayenne'', 1763 CE, by Bellin]]
During his reign the Depot published a prodigious number of charts and maps, among which were large folio-format sea-charts of France, the ''Neptune Francois''. He also produced a number of sea-atlases of the world, e.g., the ''Atlas Maritime'' and the ''Hydrographie Francaise''. These gained fame, distinction and respect all over Europe and were republished throughout the 18th and even in the succeeding century.

Bellin also created smaller format maps such as the ''1764 Petit Atlas Maritime'' (5 vols.) containing 580 finely detailed charts.

Bellin set a very high standard of workmanship and accuracy thus gaining for France a leading role in European cartography and geography. Many of his maps were copied by other mapmakers of Europe.

==Member of philosophes==

He was one of the [[Encyclopédistes]], a group of 18th century intellectuals in France who compiled the 35-volume [[Encyclopédie]] which was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Bellin contributed 994 articles.

The Encyclopédistes, were part of the group called ''philosophes'' among whose members were the great minds of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], e.g., [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Baron d'Holbach]].

==Innocent party to a geographical error==

Bellin contributed a number of maps to 15-vol. ''[[Histoire Generale des Voyages]]'' of [[Antoine François Prévost]] or simply known l'Abbe Prevost. One of these maps led to a geographical blunder whose impact reverberates to this day. This was the map of the Philippines which Bellin copied from a world-famous chart produced in 1734 by the Spanish missionary to the Philippines, [[Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde]].

Unlike many other European mapmakers of the time who outright appropriated Murillo's map, Bellin had the intellectual integrity to fully credit Murillo as his source, an open acknowledgement shown in the title [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] of Bellin's map which came out the same year as the original work by Murillo.

Shown in Bellin's map was an island named "[[Limasava]]", a word invented in 1667 by Spanish friar, [[Fr. Francisco Combés, S.J.]], to refer to the way station of the [[Armada de Molucca]] under the command of the Portuguese captain-general [[Fernao de Magalhaes]] during its navigation in [[Philippine]] waters. Combés, who had not read a single eyewitness account of the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] expedition relied on two sources, the hopelessly garbled Italian translation of the Antonio Pigafetta account by [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]] and the secondhand account by [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]. Ramusio wrote the fleet anchored in March–April 1521 in Butuan in Mindanao, and from there sailed for Cebu with a brief stopover at "[[Messana]]". In the authentic Pigafetta account, the port was an isle named [[Mazzaua]] while the stopover isle was named [[Gatighan]]. [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]] gave a faithful narration of the Mazzaua anchorage.

Combés disregarded de Herrera's version and adopted Ramusio's. He wrote that Magellan's fleet had anchored at Butuan and from there sailed for Cebu making a stop at a way station he named [[Limasaua]].

Five years earlier than Combés, Fr. Francisco Colín wrote the Armada moored at Butuan from March–April 1521 where Magellan and his men together with the natives celebrated an Easter Sunday mass on 31 March 1521. From Butuan the fleet sailed for Cebu making a brief stop at a way station he called "[[Dimasaua]]", an invented word meaning "this is not the Mazagua of Antonio de Herrera where supposedly an Easter Sunday mass was held which I already said happened in Butuan."

This episode was projected in the 1734 map made by Murillo who used Combés name, "Limassava" not "Dimasaua" which map Bellin copied.

==Gatighan becomes Limasava==

In 1789, Augustinian [[Carlo Amoretti]], Italian Encyclopedist and librarian of [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan, discovered the authentic Italian manuscript of [[Antonio Pigafetta]] among the scattered holdings of the library. Here it came out that the port of March–April 1521 was not [[Butuan]] but [[Mazaua]]. Amoretti, who himself had not read any of five eyewitness reports of the incident including two French versions of Pigafetta's account, asserted in a footnote that Mazaua was probably the isle named [[Limasava]] in Bellin's map, thus interchanging the real port of Mazaua with the way station [[Gatighan]].

Largely with the appearance of the eyewitness account of [[Ginés de Mafra]], the only seaman in Magellan's fleet to return to Mazaua, whose testimony reveals a concrete, measurable description of Mazaua, the skein starting from the garbled version of [[Pigafetta]] by [[Ramusio]] to the mishandling by Combés to Bellin and finally to Amoretti has been unraveled: Pigafetta's [[Gatighan]] is Bellin's Limasava.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">'''Johann Friedrich Goldbeck''' (22 September 1748 – 9 April 1812)  was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theologian]].

Goldbeck was born in [[Tschernjachowsk|Insterburg]], [[East Prussia]]. He first visited the Latin school in his home town Insterburg&lt;ref name="AEH"&gt;A. E. Henning: ''Topographisch-historische Beschreibung der Stadt Insterburg''. Königsberg 1794, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yNkAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter, from 1761 to 1764, the [[Collegium Fridericianum]] (''Friedrichskollegium'') in [[Kaliningrad|Königsberg]]. Since 1764 he studied theology at the [[University of Königsberg]]. In 1769 he was appointed as a private tutor by a [[Prussia]]n nobleman, whom he accompanied in 1771 on a journey  to the town of [[Magdeburg]]. In 1772 be became a teacher at [[Kloster Berge school]] located in the vicinity of Magdeburg. One year later he became an army chaplain in the infantery regiment ''v. Rohr'' (No. 15) in [[Grudziądz|Graudenz]]. In 1783 he was nominated as a senior minister of the parish of [[Nekrassowo (Kaliningrad, Gurjewsk)|Schaaken]],  [[Samland District|Landkreis Königsberg]], East Prussia.

After he had published some articles on theological and pedagogical topics, he edited since 1781 his ''Litterarischen Nachrichten von Preußen'' (Literary news from Prussia) which consist of two parts and which are in use still today. His most important work is the ''Vollständige Topographie des Königreichs Preußen'' (Complete topography of the Kingdom of Prussia) (1785 und 1789), which consist of two parts. Part I covers all departments, towns and [[Amtsbezirk]]e of East Prussia, Part II covers all departments, towns and Amtsbezirke of West Prussia.

Goldbeck was an honorary member of ''Königliche Deutsche Gesellschaft zu Königsberg'' (Royal German society in Königsberg).&lt;ref name="AEH" /&gt; He died on 9 April 1812 in Schaaken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">'''John Robert Victor Prescott''' (12 May 1931 - 17 August 2018) [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia|FASSA]] was a British and Australian academic, author, and professor emeritus at the [[University of Melbourne]]. A political geographer, most of Prescott's work focused on international boundary issues, particularly [[Maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]].

==Education==
Prescott earned his BSc (1952). Dip. Ed. and MA degrees at the [[University of Durham]] in the United Kingdom. The [[University of London]] awarded his doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prescott |first1=Dorothy |title=JOHN ROBERT VICTOR PRESCOTT B. Sc., M.A., Dip. Ed. (Durham), Ph. D. (London), M.A. (Melbourne), FASSA |url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/resources/Prescottbiography.pdf |website=Prescott Biography |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Prescott started his career as a schoolteacher in Durham after undergraduate study, and was then appointed lecturer in the Department of Geography, [[University of Ibadan]], Nigeria in 1956. He gained a Masters and his  PhD (on Nigerian border issues) while in post.

He was appointed lecturer in geography at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1961. He was made Professor in 1986 at the age of 55, and retired in 1996.&lt;ref name="ASSA"&gt;Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA), [http://www.assa.edu.au/fellows/profile.php?id=261  Profile of ASSA Fellow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301175814/http://www.assa.edu.au/fellows/profile.php?id=261 |date=2011-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a commentator on political matters and geography for Australian [[Radio National|ABC radio]], also commenting on and predicting Australian election outcomes, until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-23/the-national-tally-room-in-1983/9389626&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/resources/Prescottbiography.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Prescott's interests remained in political geography, always with a focus on borders and frontiers, and their material and political characteristics. Studies included Australian Aboriginal conceptions of territory and frontiers, border disputes in South East Asia and the South China Sea, and the effects of the colonial period on African borders. van Houtum summarized Prescott and Julian Minghi's two major contributions to border geography as showing "Where is the border located, how did it came about, evolve, change over time, become the topic of (military) disputes and what are the political consequences of its (changes in) location."&lt;ref&gt;Henk van Houtum. 2005. [http://www.unice.fr/crookall-cours/iup_geopoli/docs/geopoliticsborders2005.pdf Geopolitics The Geopolitics of Borders and Boundaries]. ''Geopolitics'', 10(4):672–679.&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott's last book explored the legal and geographical problems of borders, and was coauthored with the renowned human rights lawyer and academic [[Gillian Triggs]].

Prescott was particularly active in examining the problems generated by maritime boundaries and borders, and resolution of disputes through negotiation and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. He said in his 1985 book with Schofield that "The marked increase in maritime space coming under the jurisdiction of coastal states in the post-war period, coupled with similarly significant changes in the diversity and intensity of offshore activities, radically transformed the nature of maritime boundary negotiations, enhancing both their complexity and importance. Clearly, the extension of coastal states' sovereignty seawards has generated the potential for many new maritime boundaries and a host of overlapping jurisdictional claims and offshore boundary disputes."

==Selected works==
Prescott published widely on boundary issues and political geography. A full list of his works was compiled by his wife Dorothy, available [https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/research/BibliographyJRVPrescottv2.pdf here]. Much of it is in/with conventional academic journals and publishers, and is therefore inaccessible online. In addition, his early work incorporated quotes in French and German, inaccessible to many. These books have, however, been re-released in the mid 2010s.  Major works were:

The '''Lampi Island Marine National Park''' is a demarcated marine [[national park]] located in [[Lanbi Island]], [[Mergui Archipelago]], [[Burma]]. It is governed by the Burma Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division and the level of protection is total.  The altitudes within the park range from sea level to 455 m.

The main purposes of the reserve are [[habitat conservation]] of both marine and island resources. 228 species of birds including 19 threatened species such as [[plain-pouched hornbill]] and [[Wallace's hawk-eagle]], 10 species of [[amphibian]]s and 19 species [[reptile]] with 3 species of [[endangered sea turtles]] ([[green sea turtle|green]], [[loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead]] and [[olive ridley sea turtle|olive ridley]]), 19 species of mammals including [[sunda pangolin]] are present. The typical habitats are [[coral reef]]s, [[tropical evergreen forest]] and [[mangrove]]s. There are also beach and dune habitats, as well as [[sea grass]] beds which feed the [[dugong]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf Myanmar Protected Areas - Context, Current Status and Challenges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417063155/http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are also migrant to the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt E.. 2012.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of North America.  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

This article comprises four sortable tables of [[Summit|mountain summits]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the Americas extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of Oceania.&lt;/ref&gt; that are the [[Elevation|higher]] than any other point [[#Northernmost high summits|north]] or [[#Southernmost high summits|south]] of their [[latitude]] or [[#Easternmost high summits|east]] or [[#Westernmost high summits|west]] their [[longitude]] in North America.

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 states of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in Nicaragua, {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]] – There is much confusion about the mysterious name, "Ninety-Six," and the true origin may never be known.

Pitcher [[Bill Voiselle]] of the Boston Braves was from Ninety Six, South Carolina, and wore uniform number 96.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8527">The [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] has had a number of [[windmill]]s over the centuries. They were mostly corn mills, and about half of those built survive in one form or another.

==Guernsey==
* '''Cote des Vardes'''
Located in Montville Road, [[St Peter Port]], used to grind stone,&lt;ref name=SGI/&gt; has been converted into a three-storey property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperbrouard.com/uploads/attachments/property_2478514.pdf |title=Cote des Vardes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Delancey Windmill'''
This mill was standing in 1847.&lt;ref name=HP050347/&gt;

* '''L'Hyvreuse Windmill'''
The site of the ''L'Hyvreuse Windmill'' is now occupied by the Victoria Tower, built in 1848.&lt;ref name=Tower&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.islandlife.org/victoria.htm| publisher = Islandlife.org| title = Victoria Tower| accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lärkstaden''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Lark City") is an urban area within the city district of [[Östermalm]] in central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

The name originates from the large block "Lärkan" which used to dominated the area before the present buildings were built in 1907.  Many of the blocks added at this time were given names such as "piplärkan" [[pipit]], "tofslärka" ([[Crested lark]]), "trädlärka" [[Woodlark]], and other bird names.&lt;ref name="DN-Stugart"&gt;Stugart&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the area has no official extent, it is said to be delimited by the streets [[Odengatan]], [[Karlavägen]], [[Valhallavägen]], and [[Uggelviksgatan]], if nothing else because of the contrast between the small-scale character of the neighbourhood and the blocks surrounding it.

'''Multimap.com''' was a [[United Kingdom]] based provider of mapping and [[location-based service]]s. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2007 and merged into [[Bing Maps]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3040853.ece Microsoft swoop hands Multimap founder $25m]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Multimap.com was founded circa 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010603190148/http://www.multimap.com/indexes/aboutindex.htm Multimap.com about page], Internet Archive Wayback Machine, June 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It offered street maps and door-to-door travel directions on a public web site. Other offerings included [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]], local information, and business services. Services were also offered through its partners, including accommodation, restaurant and train-ticket booking. It also sold historic and aerial photograph prints. In 2004 the public web site regularly delivered more than 160 million page views per month and received more than 7.3 million unique users per quarter.

Unlike later online maps such as [[Google Maps]], Multimap offered discrete panning by clicking links, a form of user interaction later displaced by continuous panning [[Tiled web map|'slippy' maps]].

The [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] is used to provide a Wikipedia map overlay generated from the official [[Wikipedia:Database download|database download]]. This is used to browse [[Geotagging|geotagged]] articles.

In December 2007, the company was bought by [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.microsoft.com/2007/12/12/microsoft-acquires-one-of-europes-top-online-map-services/ Microsoft Acquires One of Europe's Top Online Map Services], Press Release, December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010{{fact|date=November 2018}} it was merged into Microsoft's Bing Maps service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7862">The '''National Council for the Social Studies''' ('''NCSS''') is a U.S.-based association devoted to supporting [[social studies]] education. It is affiliated with various regional or state level social studies associations, including: the [[Middle States Council for the Social Studies]], the Washington State Council for the Social Studies, the New York City UFT Association for the Teaching of Social Studies, the Michigan Council for the Social Studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstudies.org/ local NCSS Affiliated Councils]&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts Council for the Social Studies.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masscouncil.org/?page_id=579&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Council for the Social Studies]]. They publish several journals; their flagship publication&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bu.edu/sed/martells-article-featured-by-national-council-for-the-social-studies/ ''Martell’s Article Featured by National Council for the Social Studies.''] Boston University. School of Education. 18 September 2013.

Accessed 9 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1921, NCSS engages and supports educators in strengthening and advocating social studies. With members in all the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and 69 foreign countries, NCSS serves as an umbrella organization for elementary, secondary, and college teachers of history, geography, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, anthropology, and law-related education. Organized into a network of more than 110 affiliated state, local, and regional councils and associated groups, the NCSS membership represents K–12 classroom teachers, college and university faculty members, curriculum designers and specialists, social studies supervisors, and leaders in the various disciplines that constitute the social studies.

==Social Studies==
NCSS defines social studies as "the integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence." Within the school program, social studies provides coordinated, systematic study drawing upon such disciplines as anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, law, philosophy, political science, psychology, religion, and sociology, as well as appropriate content from the humanities, mathematics, and natural sciences. In essence, social studies promotes knowledge of and involvement in civic affairs. And because civic issues—such as health care, crime, and foreign policy—are multidisciplinary in nature, understanding these issues and developing resolutions to them requires multidisciplinary education. These characteristics are the key defining aspects of social studies.

==Expectations of Excellence==
In 2010, the council published National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies: A Framework for Teaching, Learning and Assessment. This publication is an update and revision of  Expectations of Excellence: Curriculum Standards for Social Studies originally published in 1994. The National Curriculum Standards provides an articulated K–12 social studies program that serves as a framework for the integration of other national standards in social studies, including U.S. and world history, civics and government, geography, global education, and economics. NCSS standards ensure that an integrated social science, behavioral science, and humanities approach for achieving academic and civic competence is available to guide social studies decision makers in K–12 schools.

The NCSS framework consists of ten themes incorporating fields of study that correspond with one or more relevant disciplines. The organization believes that effective social studies programs include experiences that provide for the study of: Culture; Time, Continuity, and Change; People, Places, and Environments; Individual Development and Identity; Individuals, Groups, and Institutions; Power, Authority, and Governance; Production, Distribution, and Consumption; Science, Technology, and Society; Global Connections; and Civic Ideals and Practices.

==Awards==
The NCSS gives a number of awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstudies.org/awards |website=www.socialstudies.org |title=Awards and Grants|publisher=National Council for the Social Studies |accessdate=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18020">Currently, the best source for nationwide LiDAR availability from public sources is the United States Interagency Elevation Inventory (USIEI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.noaa.gov/inventory/]&lt;/ref&gt; The USIEI is a collaborative effort of NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey, with contributions from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. The inventory displays high-accuracy topographic and bathymetric data for the US, and it's intended to be a comprehensive, nationwide listing of known high-accuracy topographic data, including [[lidar]]. The most recent inventory was completed August 2013 and will be updated annually. Note, however, that getting access to the data is often less than straightforward in the current implementation.

History: In the United States, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) was the lead agency coordinating efforts across multiple agencies towards a [[National LIDAR Dataset]]. The first meeting, a National LIDAR Initiative Strategy Meeting, was held at USGS headquarters in Reston, Virginia in February 2007. In May 2008 a second meeting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asprs.org/publications/pers/2008journal/september/highlight.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was held, co-sponsored by USGS, [[NASA]], and the [[AASG]]. In 2009, several sessions at the annual [[American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing]] meeting were devoted to this initiative.[http://lidar.cr.usgs.gov/asprs_2009.php]

The USGS website remains a central source for information about the national initiative, and it includes presentation materials from the various meetings about the subject. This site also discusses how the USGS incorporates [[LIDAR]] data into the [[National Elevation Dataset]]. In addition to USGS and NASA, numerous government agencies have indicated their interest in such a project, including [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], [[NOAA]], and [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]].[http://www.asprs.org/publications/pers/2008journal/september/highlight.pdf]

While there is consensus at a federal level supporting the creation of a National LIDAR Dataset, key aspects remain unresolved, including funding, data specifications, and the delineation of agency roles and responsibilities.[http://www.asprs.org/publications/pers/2008journal/september/highlight.pdf] While these issues are pending, the following states are among those moving forward with their own statewide LIDAR datasets:

'''North East India''' is the north easternmost part of [[India]]. It comprises seven states; namely [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Manipur]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Nagaland]].
The states of Assam ([[Kamarupa]] &amp; [[Davaka]]), Tripura, and Manipur are ancient in existence, while rest curbed out from Assam in late twentieth century, i.e., Nagaland in 1963, Meghalaya in 1972, Arunachal Pradesh in 1975 and the state of Mizoram come into existence as late as 1987.

==Etymologies of state names==
It is common in names of North Eastern Indian states like rest of country of usage of [[Sanskrit]] word referring to quality or feature of land.

The name of Assam state derived from the Sanskrit word 'Asama', which means unequal or uneven referring to its geology which is equal mix of river valleys and hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatravelogue.com/dest/nest/nest.html |title=Assam Etymology |publisher=indiatravelogue.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipur===
Manipur state known by said Sanskrit word which means land of jewels. It seems that naming the said name in account of the past prosperity of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| surname= Mee, Foley | given= Erin B.,Helene P. | title= Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage|publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2011|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripura===
Tripura by which said state is known is another Sanskrit word which means "lands of three cities".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Arunachal Pradesh===
Arunachal Pradesh is a Sanskrit word which means land of rising sun as state is located in the easternmost part of the country and gets first sunrise in the country.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Ghosh, Shukla Ghosh (1995), ''Indian Textiles: Past and Present'', p.229 Arunachal Pradesh may be termed as the land of rising sun since it in this part of the country that Sun ray first kisses Indian soil. In other words Sun rises first in Arunachal Pradesh before rest of our country.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meghalaya===
The state of Meghalaya has reputation of having highest rainfall as compared to other states of country. The wettest place in the world Mawsynram, is located in Meghalaya. Said feature of land is reflected in its name in Sanskrit which means Abode of clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nenanews.com/meghalya.htm |title=Meghalaya Etymology |publisher=nenanews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mizoram===
The states of Nagaland and Mizoram are exceptions where Sanskrit words are not used in the state name. Mizoram was named after the Mizo tribal dialect and refers to their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.nlup.mizoram.gov.in/?phek=bawm&amp;bid=25|title=Mizoram Etymology |publisher=en.nlup.mizoram.gov.in|date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagaland===
Tha name Nagaland consists of two words: the 'Naga', a native term for umbrella of tribes and [[English language|English]] word 'land', collectively meaning land of Naga tribes. Until recent times term 'Naga' was foreign to Naga tribes themselves, there was no generic term for entire group of tribes, who rather identify themselves as Konyak, Tangkhul, Angami, Sema, Lotha, Ao, Pangmei, Zeliangrong, Mao and Khiumniungan etc.

The word 'Naga' is attributed to two origins. One theory states that in [[Myanmar]], Naga tribes are called Na-Ka, which in [[Burmese language]] means 'people with pierced ear lobes'. The British explorers which comes into contact with Myanma in 1795 and with Nagas since 1832, heard about Na-Ka group and anglicised it as Naga, as found in British anthropological and official records.

Another theory points to the usage by people of Assam where Naga meaning 'naked', is used for 'primitive man living in natural surroundings in uncorrupted form'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Atai Shimray (2005), ''Let Freedom Ring?: Story of Naga Nationalism'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the planting of trees in agriculture}}
{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}

An '''orchard''' is an intentional planting of [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s that is maintained for [[food]] [[agriculture|production]]. Orchards comprise [[fruit tree|fruit]]- or [[nut (fruit)|nut]]-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large [[garden]]s, where they serve an [[aesthetic]] as well as a productive purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Orchard Plans and Methods: How to Begin and Carry on the Work |author= Luther Burbank|publisher=The Minerva Group|isbn=1-4147-0141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize [[berry]] shrubs in preference to [[fruit tree]]s. Most [[temperate]]-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown [[lawn|grass]] or bare [[soil]] base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy. 

Most orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit. While the importance of introducing [[biodiversity]] is recognized in forest plantations, it would seem to be beneficial to introduce some genetic diversity in orchard plantations as well by interspersing other trees through the orchard.  Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases just as in [[forests]] &lt;ref name="konnert15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F., Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]], Bioversity International, Rome, Italy.|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p.|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804173305/http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Orchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water where [[climate|climatic]] extremes are [[microclimate|moderated]] and [[flower|blossom]] time is retarded until [[frost]] danger is past.

==Layout==
An orchard's layout is the technique of planting the crops in a proper system.
There are different methods of planting and thus different layouts.  Some of these layout types include:
# [[Square]] method
# [[Rectangular]] method
# [[Quincunx]] method
# [[Triangular]] method
# [[Hexagonal]] method
# Contour or [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] method
For different varieties, these systems may vary to some extent.

==Orchards by region==

The most extensive orchards in the United States are apple and orange orchards, although citrus orchards are more commonly called groves. The most extensive apple orchard area is in eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state, with a lesser but significant apple orchard area in most of [[Upstate New York]]. Extensive orange orchards are found in [[Florida]] and southern [[California]], where they are more widely known as 'groves'. In eastern [[North America]], many orchards are along the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] (such as the [[Fruit Ridge (Michigan)|Fruit Ridge Region]]), [[Lake Erie]], and [[Lake Ontario]].

In [[Canada]], apple and other fruit orchards are widespread on the [[Niagara Peninsula]], south of [[Lake Ontario]]. This region is known as ''Canada Fruitbelt'' and, in addition to large-scale commercial fruit marketing, it encourages "pick-your-own" activities in the harvest season.

[[Murcia]] is a major orchard area (or la huerta) in Europe, with citrus crops. New Zealand, China, Argentina and Chile also have extensive apple orchards.

[[Tenbury Wells]] in [[Worcestershire]] has been called ''The Town in the Orchard'', since the 19th century, because it was surrounded by extensive orchards. Today, this heritage is celebrated through an annual [[Applefest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applefest.org.uk|title=The Teme Valley Times supports the Tenbury Applefest|work=applefest.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
[[:de:Streuobstwiese|Streuobstwiese]] (pl. ''Streuobstwiesen'') is a German word that means a meadow with scattered fruit trees or fruit trees that are planted in a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Streuobstwiese.html|title=dict.cc dictionary :: Streuobstwiese :: German-English translation|work=dict.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streuobstwiese, or a '''meadow orchard''',&lt;ref&gt;''Streuobstwiese'': meadow orchard in [http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/Streuobstwiese German-English Collins Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is a traditional landscape in the temperate, maritime climate of continental Western Europe. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Streuobstwiesen were a kind of a rural community orchard that were intended for productive cultivation of [[stone fruit]]. In recent years, ecologists have successfully lobbied for state subsidies to valuable [[habitat]]s, [[biodiversity]] and [[natural landscape]]s, which are also used to preserve old meadow orchards. Both conventional and meadow orchards provide a suitable habitat for many animal species that live in a cultured landscape. A notable example is the [[hoopoe]] that nests in tree hollows of old fruit trees and, in the absence of alternative nesting sites, is threatened in many parts of [[Europe]] because of the destruction of old orchards.&lt;ref&gt;Berhens M. ''[http://www.foei.org/en/publications/pdfs/wel-e.pdf Why hoopoes won't trade]''. A Pro Natura Publication on the Global Economy and Nature. Pro Natura, Switzerland, pp. 8-9. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327052340/http://www.foei.org/en/publications/pdfs/wel-e.pdf |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical orchards==

* [[Orchard House]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] was the residence of American celebrated writer [[Louisa May Alcott]].
* [[Fruita, Utah]] part of [[Capitol Reef National Park]] has [[Mormon pioneer]] orchards maintained by the [[United States National Park Service]].

==Modern orchards==
Historical orchards have large, mature trees spaced for heavy equipment. Modern commercial [[apple]] orchards, by contrast and as one example, are often "high-density" (above 150 trees per acre) and in extreme cases have up to 9000 trees per acre. These plants are no longer trees in the traditional sense, but instead resemble vines on dwarf stock and require trellises to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Michael|last2=et al|title=High Density Apple Orchard Management|url=https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/high-density-apple-orchard-management|publisher=[[North Carolina State University]]|accessdate=26 July 2017|ref=AG-581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Belarus}}

At the top level of administration, [[Belarus]] is divided into six ''regions'' and the city of [[Minsk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/uby.html Belarus Regions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which has a special status being the capital of Belarus. Minsk is also the capital of [[Minsk Region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassybel.ru/belarus/minsk/ Minsk summary], at the website of the Belarus embassy in [[Russia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second level, the regions are divided into ''[[raion]]s'' ("districts").

The layout and extent of the regions were set in 1960 when Belarus (then [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]) was a part of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="kge"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Regions of Belarus|url=http://www.statoids.com/uby.html|publisher=Statoids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the start of the 20th century, the boundaries of the Belarusian lands within the [[Russian Empire]] were still being defined.  Basically in 1900 it contained the entire [[Minsk Governorate]] and [[Mogilev Governorate]], the majority of [[Grodno Governorate]], parts of [[Vitebsk Governorate]] and the parts of [[Vilna Governorate]] (the latter is now in [[Lithuania]]).&lt;ref name="kge"/&gt; World War I, the independence of Poland, as well as the 1920-1921 [[Polish–Soviet War]] affected the boundaries. In 1921, Belarus had what is now all of Minsk Governorate except for the western fringe, the western part of Gomel Region, a western slice of Mahilyow, and a small part of Vitebsk Region. In 1926 the eastern part of Gomel region was added.  
&lt;ref name="kge"/&gt;

In [[Byelorussian SSR|Soviet Belarus]], new administrative units, called ''voblast'' (cognate of [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''[[oblast]]'' with [[Prothesis (linguistics)|prothetic]] v-) were introduced in 1938. And again, during World War II, the boundaries fluctuated. In 1939 they were reset with Belarus gaining territory to the west, Baranavichy, Belastok (Bialystok), Brest, Pinsk, and Vileyka oblasts. In 1944 Belastok was eliminated and the new oblasts of Babruysk, Grodno, and Polotsk were created. At that same time, Vileika Voblast was renamed Molodechno Voblast.&lt;ref name="kge"/&gt;

At different times between 1938 and 1960, the following ''voblasts'' existed:

* [[Babruysk Voblast]], created 1944, eliminated 1954
* [[Baranavichy Voblast]], created 1939, eliminated 1954
* [[Belastok Voblast]], created 1939, eliminated 1944 (now Bialystok in Poland)
* [[Brest Voblast]], created 1939
* [[Gomel Voblast]], created 1938
* [[Grodno Voblast]], created 1944
* [[Maladzyechna Voblast]] renamed from Vileyka Voblast 1944, eliminated 1960
* [[Mogilev Voblast]], created 1938
* [[Minsk Voblast]], created 1938
* [[Navahrudak Voblast]], created 1939, renamed Baranavichy Voblast December 1939
* [[Pinsk Voblast]], created 1939, eliminated 1954
* [[Polatsk Voblast]], created 1944, eliminated 1954
* [[Polesia Voblast]], created 1938, eliminated 1954
* [[Vitebsk Voblast]], created 1938
* [[Vileyka Voblast]], created 1939, renamed to Maladzyechna Voblast 1944

A '''royal forest''', occasionally "'''Kingswood'''", is an area of land with different definitions in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]]. The term ''[[forest]]'' in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land; however, the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a "preserve" – i.e. land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting – with less emphasis on its composition. There are also differing and contextual interpretations in Continental Europe derived from the [[Government of the Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] and [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Braunstein, « Forêts d'Europe au Moyen-Âge », Les Cahiers du Centre de Recherches Historiques [En ligne], 6 | 1990, mis en ligne le 20 mars 2009, consulté le 22 août 2012. URL : http://ccrh.revues.org/2859 ; DOI : 10.4000/ccrh.2859&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglo-Saxon England]], though the kings were great huntsmen they never set aside areas declared to be "outside" (Latin ''foris'') the law of the land.&lt;ref name="Loyn"&gt;[[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'' 2nd ed. 1991:378-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c. 500 to 1066) creating forests.&lt;ref&gt;The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer. c.&amp;nbsp;1180 {{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/excheq.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208115037/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/excheq.htm |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The law was designed to protect the ''venison'' and the ''vert'', the "noble" animals of the chase&amp;nbsp;– notably [[Red deer|red]] and [[fallow deer]], the [[roe deer]], and the [[wild boar]]&amp;nbsp;– and the greenery that sustained them. Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the [[monarch]] or (by invitation) the [[aristocracy]] (see [[medieval hunting]]). The concept was introduced by the [[Normans]] to England in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest; at one stage in the 12th century, all of [[Essex]] was afforested, and on his accession [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] declared all of [[Huntingdonshire]] forest.&lt;ref name="Loyn" /&gt;

Afforestation, in particular the creation of the [[New Forest]], figured large in the folk history of the "[[Norman yoke]]", which magnified what was already a grave social ill: "the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned, peasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar element in the English national story&amp;nbsp;.... The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated", [[H. R. Loyn]] observed.&lt;ref name="Loyn" /&gt; Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law had died out, but many of England's woodlands still bore the title "Royal Forest". During the [[Middle Ages]], the practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe.

Royal forests usually included large areas of [[heath (habitat)|heath]], [[grassland]] and [[wetland]]&amp;nbsp;– anywhere that supported [[deer]] and other [[game (food)|game]]. In addition, when an area was initially designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. This could foster resentment as the local inhabitants were then restricted in the use of land they had previously relied upon for their livelihoods; however, common rights were not extinguished, but merely curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn = 0-8122-7760-0 |publication-place = [Philadelphia] |title = The royal forests of medieval England |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL4747090M/The_royal_forests_of_medieval_England |author = Young, Charles R. |publication-date = 1979 |id = 0812277600 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas chosen for Royal Forests==

The areas that became Royal Forests were already relatively wild and sparsely populated, and can be related to specific geographic features that made them harder to work as farmland. Prosperous, well-farmed areas were not generally chosen to be afforested; if they were, they tended to lose the status fairly rapidly.

In the [[South West England|South West]], forests extended across the [[Late Jurassic|Upper Jurassic]] Clay Vale.&lt;ref name="Grant, p5"&gt;Grant, p5&lt;/ref&gt; In [[the Midlands]], the clay plain surrounding the [[River Severn]] was heavily wooded. Clay soils in [[Oxfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] formed another belt of woodlands.

In [[Hampshire]], [[Berkshire]] and [[Surrey]], woodlands were established on sandy, gravelly acid soils. Marshlands in [[Lincolnshire]] were afforested.&lt;ref name="Grant, p6"/&gt;

Upland moors too were chosen, such as [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] in the South West, and the Peak Forest of [[Derbyshire]]. [[North York Moors|The North Yorkshire moors]], a sandstone plateau, had a number of Royal forests.&lt;ref name="Grant, p5"/&gt;

== Forest law ==
[[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], a great lover of hunting, established the system of forest law. This operated outside the [[common law]], and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from destruction. In the year of his death, 1087, a poem, "[[The Rime of King William]]", inserted in the [[Peterborough Chronicle]], expresses English indignation at the forest laws.

=== Offences ===
Offences in forest law were divided into two categories: trespass against the vert (the vegetation of the forest) and the venison (the game). The five animals of the forest protected by law were given by [[John Manwood|Manwood]] as the [[hart (deer)|hart]] and [[Red deer|hind]] ([[red deer]]), [[boar]], [[hare]] and [[wolf]]. (In England, the boar became extinct in the wild by the 13th century, and the wolf by the late 15th century.) Protection was also said to be extended to the beasts of [[chase (land)|chase]], the [[Deer|buck]] and [[wiktionary:doe#Noun|doe]] ([[fallow deer]]), [[fox]], [[marten]], and [[roe deer]], and the beasts and fowls of [[warren (free)|warren]]: the [[hare]], [[rabbit|coney]], [[pheasant]], and [[partridge]].&lt;ref name="manwood"&gt;{{cite book | last=Manwood | first=John | authorlink=John Manwood | title=A Treatise and Discourse of the Lawes of the Forrest | chapter=1 | chapterurl=http://homepage.mac.com/calhounabode/josh/TheText.htm | accessdate=2006-10-17 | year=1598 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of chase and of warren (i.e. to hunt such beasts) were often granted to local nobility for a fee, but were a quite separate concept.

Trespasses against the vert were rather extensive: they included ''purpresture'', the [[inclosure]] of a pasture or erection of a building on forest lands, ''[[assarting]]'', clearing forest land for agriculture, and felling trees or clearing shrubs, among others. These laws applied to any land within the boundary of the forest, even if it were freely owned; although the Charter of the Forest in 1217 established that all freemen owning land within the forest enjoyed the rights of ''[[agistment]]'' and ''[[pannage]]'' (see below).

In addition, inhabitants of the forest were forbidden to bear hunting weapons, and dogs were banned from the forest; [[English Mastiff|mastiffs]] were permitted as watchdogs, but they had to have their front claws removed to prevent them from hunting game.

Disafforested lands on the edge of the forest were known as [[purlieus]]; agriculture was permitted here and deer escaping from the forest into them was permitted to be killed if causing damage.

=== Rights and privileges ===
The kings rapidly discovered that abridging their rights in the royal forests could provide a useful source of income. Local nobles could be granted a royal licence to take a certain amount of game. The common inhabitants of the forest might, depending on their location, possess a variety of rights: ''[[Estovers|estover]]'', the right of taking firewood, ''[[pannage]]'', the right to pasture swine in the forest, ''[[turbary]]'', the right to cut turf (as fuel), and various other rights of pasturage (''[[agistment]]'') and harvesting the products of the forest. Land might be disafforested entirely, or permission given for [[assart]] and [[purpresture]].

=== Officers ===
The justices of the forest were the [[Justice in Eyre]] and the [[verderer]]s.

The chief royal official was the Warden. As he was often an eminent and preoccupied magnate, his powers were frequently exercised by a deputy. He supervised the [[forester]]s and under-foresters, who personally went about preserving the forest and game and apprehending offenders against the law. The [[agister]]s supervised pannage and agistment and collected any fees thereto appertaining. The nomenclature of the officers can be somewhat confusing: the rank immediately below the constable were referred to as foresters-in-fee, or, later, ''woodwards'', who held land in the forest in exchange for a rent, and advised the warden. They exercised various privileges within their [[bailiwick]]s. Their subordinates were the under-foresters, later referred to as [[forest ranger|rangers]]. The rangers are sometimes said to be patrollers of the purlieu.

Another group, called [[serjeanty|serjeants]]-in-fee, and later, foresters-in-fee (not to be confused with the above), held small estates in return for their service in patrolling the forest and apprehending offenders.

The forests also had [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyors]], who determined the boundaries of the forest, and ''regarders''. These last reported to the court of justice-seat and investigated encroachments on the forest and invasion of royal rights, such as assarting. While their visits were infrequent, due to the interval of time between courts, they provided a check against collusion between the foresters and local offenders.

=== Courts ===
[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] gives the following outline of the '''forest courts''', as theoretically constructed:
*'''Court of attachment''', sometimes called the ''Forty-Day Court'' or ''Woodmote''. This court was held every forty days, and was presided over by verderers and the Warden, or his deputy. The foresters [[attachment (law)|attached]] persons who had committed crimes against the forest law and brought them before this court to have them enrolled; however, it did not possess the power to try or convict individuals, and such cases had to be passed upwards to the swainmote or the court of justice seat.
*'''Court of regard''', held every third year to enforce the law requiring declawing of dogs within the forest.
*'''Swainmote''' or ''Sweinmote'' was held three times a year: the fortnight before the feast of St. Michael, about the feast of St. Martin, and the fortnight before the feast of St. John the Baptist. It was presided over by the Warden and verderers, the foresters and [[agister]]s being in attendance. The first two occasions were to regulate agistment and pannage, respectively; the third was for the purpose of trying offenders before a jury of [[wikt:swain|swains]], or freemen of the forest. (The name of the court is sometimes said to be derived from [[swine]], probably a misapprehension through its regulation of pannage.)
*'''Court of justice-seat''' or ''eyre'' was the highest of the forest courts. It was to be held every three years, to be announced forty days in advance, and was presided over by a [[Justice in Eyre]]. It was, in theory, the only court that could pass sentence upon offenders of the forest laws.

In practice, these fine distinctions were not always observed. In the [[Forest of Dean]], swainmote and the court of attachment seem to have been one and the same throughout most of its history. As the courts of justice-seat were held  less frequently, the lower courts assumed the power to fine offenders against the forest laws, according to a fixed schedule. The courts of justice-seat crept into disuse, and in 1817, the office of Justice in Eyre was abolished and its powers transferred to the [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]]. Courts of swainmote and attachment went out of existence at various dates in the different forests. A Court of Swainmote was re-established in the [[New Forest]] in 1877.

== History ==

[[William I of England|William I]], original enactor of the Forest Law in England, did not harshly penalise offenders. The accusation that he "laid a law upon it, that whoever slew hart or hind should be blinded," according to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' is little more than propaganda. [[William Rufus]], also a keen hunter, increased the severity of the penalties for various offences to include death and mutilation. The laws were in part codified under the Assize of the Forest (1184)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/sech/sech_035.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].

[[Magna Carta]], the [[charter]] forced upon King [[John of England]] by the English barons in 1215, contained five clauses relating to royal forests. They aimed to limit, and even reduce, the King's sole rights as enshrined in forest law. The clauses were as follows (taken from translation of the great charter (Magna Carta)):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt;

* (44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appear before the '''Royal Justices of the Forest''' in answer to general summonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings or are sureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.
* (47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once be disafforested. River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shall be treated similarly.
* (48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters, warreners, sheriffs and their servants, or river-banks and their wardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by twelve sworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquiry the evil customs are to be abolished completely and irrevocably. But we, or our chief justice if we are not in England, are first to be informed.
* (52) To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands, castles, liberties, or rights, without the lawful judgement of his equals, we will at once restore these. In cases of dispute the matter shall be resolved by the judgement of the twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace (§&amp;nbsp;61). In cases, however, where a man was deprived or dispossessed of something without the lawful judgement of his equals by our father King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have respite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order, before we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once render justice in full.
* (53) We shall have similar respite [to that in clause 52] in rendering justice in connexion with forests that are to be disafforested, or to remain forests, when these were first afforested by our father Henry or our brother Richard; with the guardianship of lands in another person's `fee', when we have hitherto had this by virtue of a `fee' held of us for knight's service by a third party; and with abbeys founded in another person's `fee', in which the lord of the `fee' claims to own a right. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice to complaints about these matters.

After the death of John, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] was compelled to grant the [[Charter of the Forest]] (1217), which further reformed the forest law and established the rights of agistment and pannage on private land within the forests. It also checked certain of the extortions of the foresters. An "Ordinance of the Forest" under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] again checked the oppression of the officers, and introduced sworn juries in the forest courts.

=== Great Perambulation and after ===
In 1300 many (if not all) forests were [[perambulated]] and reduced greatly in their extent, in theory to their extent in the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].  However, this depended on the determination of local juries, whose decisions  often excluded from the Forest lands described in [[Domesday Book]] as within the forest.  Successive kings tried to recover the "purlieus" excluded from a forest by the Great Perambulation of 1300.  Forest officers periodically fined the inhabitants of the purlieus for failing to attend Forest Court or for forest offences.  This led to complaints in Parliament.  The king promised to remedy the grievances, but usually did nothing.

Several forests were alienated by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and his successors, but generally the system decayed.  [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] revived "Swainmotes" (forest courts) for several forests and held Forest Eyres in some of them.   [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1547 placed the forests under the [[Court of Augmentations]] with two Masters and two Surveyors-General.  On the abolition of that court, the two surveyors-general became responsible to the Exchequer.  Their respective divisions were North and South of the [[river Trent]].

The last serious exercise of forest law by a court of justice-seat (Forest Eyre) seems to have been in about 1635, in an attempt to raise money.

=== Disafforestation, sale of forest lands and the Western Rising ===

{{see also|Western Rising and disafforestation riots}}

By the [[Tudor period]] and after, forest law had largely become anachronistic, and served primarily to protect timber in the royal forests.  [[James I of England|James I]] and his ministers [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]] pursued a policy of increasing revenues from the forests and starting the process of disafforestation.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p56"&gt;Sharp, p56&lt;/ref&gt;

Cecil made the first steps towards abolition of the forests, as part of James I's policy of increasing his income independently of Parliament. Cecil investigated forests that were unused for royal hunting and provided little revenue from timber sales. [[Knaresborough Forest]] in Yorkshire was abolished. Revenues in the Forest of Dean were increased through sales of wood for iron smelting. Enclosures were made in Chippenham and Blackmore for herbage and pannage.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p56"/&gt;

Cranfield commissioned surveys into [[assart]] lands of various forests, including Feckenham, Sedgemoor and Selwood, laying the foundations of the wide scale abolition of forests under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].  The commissioners appointed raised over £25000 by compounding with occupiers, whose ownership was confirmed, subject to a fixed rent. Cranfield's work led directly to the disafforestation of Gillingham Forest in Dorset and Chippenham and Blackmore in Wiltshire. Additionally, he created the model for abolition of the forests followed throughout the 1630s.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p56-57"&gt;Sharp, p56-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Each disafforestation would start with a commission from the Exchequer, which would survey the forest, determine the lands belonging to the crown, and negotiate compensation for landowners and tenants whose now-traditional rights to use of the land as commons would be revoked. A legal action by the Attorney General would then proceed in the Court of Exchequer against the forest residents for intrusion, which would confirm the settlement negotiated by the Commission. Crown lands would then be granted (leased), usually to prominent courtiers, and often the same figures that had undertaken the commission surveys. Legal complaints about the imposed settlements and compensation were frequent.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p56-57"/&gt;

The disafforestations caused riots and [[Skimmington]] processions resulting in the destruction of enclosures and reoccupation of grazing lands in a number of West Country forests, including Gillingham, Braydon and Dean, known as the Western Rising. Riots also took place in Feckenham, Leicester and Malvern. The riots followed the physical enclosure of lands previously used as commons, and frequently led to the destruction of fencing and hedges. Some were said to have had a "warlike" character, with armed mobs numbering hundreds, for instance in Feckenham. The rioters in Dean fully destroyed the enclosures surrounding 3,000 acres in groups that numbered thousands of participants.

The disturbances tended to involve artisans and cottagers who were not entitled to compensation. The riots were hard to enforce against, due to the lack of efficient militia, and the low born nature of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, enclosure succeeded, with the exceptions of Dean and Malvern Chase.

=== After the Restoration ===
The Forest of Dean was legally re-established in 1668.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p164&lt;/ref&gt;  A Forest Eyre was held for the [[New Forest]] in 1670, and a few for other forests in the 1660s and 1670s, but these were the last.  From 1715, both surveyor's posts were held by the same person.  The remaining royal forests continued to be managed (in theory, at least) on behalf of the crown.  However, the commoners' rights of grazing often seem to have been more important than the rights of the crown.

In the late 1780s a [[Royal Commission]] was appointed to inquire into the condition of Crown woods and those surviving.  North of the Trent it found [[Sherwood Forest]] survived, south of it: the [[New Forest]], three others in [[Hampshire]], Windsor Forest in [[Berkshire]], the [[Forest of Dean]] in [[Gloucestershire]], Waltham or [[Epping Forest]] in Essex, three forests in [[Northamptonshire]], and [[Wychwood]] in [[Oxfordshire]].  Some of these no longer had swainmote courts thus no official supervision.  They divided the remaining forests into two classes, those with and without the Crown as major landowner.  In certain Hampshire forests and the Forest of Dean, most of the soil belonged to the Crown and these should be reserved to grow timber, to meet the need for [[oak]] for [[shipbuilding]].  The others would be inclosed, the Crown receiving an "allotment" (compensation) in lieu of its rights.

In 1810, responsibility for woods was moved from Surveyors-General (who accounted to the Auditors of Land Revenue) to a new [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests|Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues]].  From 1832 to 1851 "Works and Buildings" were added to their responsibilities.  In 1851, the commissioners again became a [[Commissioner of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues]].  In 1924, the Royal Forests were transferred to the new [[Forestry Commission]].

=== Forest of Dean ===
{{Main article|Forest of Dean}}
The Forest of Dean was used as a source of [[charcoal]] for [[blast furnace|ironmaking]] within the Forest from 1612 until about 1670. It was the subject of a Reafforestation Act in 1667.  Courts continued to be held at the [[Speech House]], for example to regulate the activities of the [[Freeminer]]s. The sale of [[cordwood]] for charcoal continued until at least the late 18th century. Deer were removed in 1850. The forest is today heavily wooded, as is a substantial formerly privately owned area to the west, now treated as part of the forest. It is managed by the Forestry Commission.

=== Epping Forest ===
{{Main article|Epping Forest}}
The extent of Epping Forest was greatly reduced by inclosure by landowners. The [[Corporation of London]] wished to see it preserved as an [[Open space reserved|open space]] and obtained an [[injunction]] to throw open some {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} that had been inclosed in the preceding 20 years. In 1875 and 1876, it bought {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of open waste land. Under the [[Epping Forest Act 1878]], the forest was disafforested and forest law abolished in respect of it. Instead the corporation was appointed as Conservators of the Forest. The forest is managed through the Epping Forest Committee.

=== New Forest ===
{{Main article|New Forest}}
An Act was passed to remove the deer in 1851, but abandoned when it was realised that the deer were needed to keep open the unwooded "lawns" of the forest. An attempt was made to develop the forest for growing wood by a rolling programme of inclosures. In 1875, a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] recommended against this, leading to the passage of the [[New Forest Act 1877]], which limited the Crown's right to inclose, regulated common rights, and reconstituted the Court of Verderers. A further [[New Forest Act 1964|Act]] was passed in 1964. This forest is also managed by the Forestry Commission.

===Sherwood Forest===
{{Main article| Sherwood Forest}}
A forest since the end of the [[Ice Age]] (as attested by [[palynology|pollen sampling cores]]), Sherwood Forest [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]] today encompasses 423.2 hectares,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designations/nnr/1009468.aspx |title=Sherwood Forest NNR |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1,045 acres) surrounding the village of [[Edwinstowe]], the site of [[Thoresby Hall]].

The forest that most people associate with Sherwood Forest is actually named [[Birklands and Bilhaugh]]. It is a remnant of an older, much larger, royal hunting forest, which derived its name from its status as the ''[[shire]]  (or sher) wood'' of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered on the west along the [[River Erewash]] and the [[Forest of East Derbyshire]]. When the [[Domesday Book]] was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws.

* 1:25.000. This is the most detailed map, useful for many purposes. Those are popular with tourists, especially for famous areas like [[Zermatt]] and [[St. Moritz]]. These maps cost CHF 13.50 each (2004). 208 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. The first map published on this scale was ''1125 Chasseral'', in 1952. The last map published on this scale was ''1292 Maggia'', in 1972. Since 1956, composites have been published, starting with ''2501 St. Gallen''. They have the same information, but consist of several parts of regular maps combined, especially in tourist or urban areas. 22 composite maps have so far (September 2004) been published.
* 1:50.000. Since 1994, routes are coloured on these maps. It is marketed as ''for hikers, Alpinists, cyclists, planners, tourists and explorers''. 78 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. Composites also exist, and are more frequent than the assemblages for 1:25.000 maps. As of September 2004, 24 composite maps have been published.
* 1:100.000. These are marketed as ''Geographical regions of special interest to tourists on one map''. 24 maps on this scale are published at regular intervals. 11 composite maps have also been published.
* 1:200.000. Switzerland and surrounding lands in four sheets (no composite maps).
* 1:300.000. A photographic copy of the 1:200.000 map, with Switzerland on a single sheet.
* 1:500.000. Switzerland with surrounding lands.
* 1:1.000.000. Switzerland with extensive surroundings, from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

====Numbering system====
The numbering system of Swiss regular maps (apart from composites) is directly based on the geographical situation. A map number is always one higher than the map number of the adjacent map to the west, and one lower than the adjacent map to the east. From north to south, the numbers differ by 20 for the scale 1:25.000, 10 for the scale 1:50.000 and 5 for the scale 1:100.000. However, as can be seen on the ''Seite nicht gefunden'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/national/25.html?mapnr=#mapviewjump&lt;/ref&gt; there are some exceptions to this rule: Switzerland is a little bit too large to be only 20 1:25.000 maps wide. Instead of choosing another system, the map to the east of ''1199 Scuol'' is called ''1199bis Piz Lad''. The same is true for some maps at scale 1:50.000.

===Tourist maps===
* [[Hiking]] maps are published on the scale 1:50.000. They are based on the regular maps 1:50.000, but include information about which routes are good to walk. They also have information about [[public transport]]. These maps are published in collaboration with ''Swisshiking''.
* [[Ski]] tour map, 1:50.000. Based on the topographical map 1:50.000, but including information about steep slopes, ski routes and snowboard routes.
* Road map: two sheets published on a scale of 1:200.000, but not the same as the topographical 1:200.000, as it lacks contour lines. This map is published each year.
* [[Culture|Cultural]] Heritage, 1:300.000
* Map of [[Museum]]s, 1:300.000.
* Map of [[Castle]]s, 1:200.000. It is based on the topographical map 1:200.000, but includes information about castles, fortresses and ruins.
* [[Mount Everest|Everest]], in collaboration with a lot of other organizations, including the [[National Geographic Society]].
* The ''[[Swiss Path]]'' is a [[hiking]] trail around [[Lake Uri]] to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Swiss Confederation. 
* Seeland-Trois lacs, 1:75.000, not directly based on any topographical map (e.g. it lacks contour lines). It was made for the ''Expo. 02'' which was in this region.

===Other maps===
* Satellite map, 1:300.000.
* Community map, 1:300.000, with only political borders, no topographical information except for lakes.
* Einst und Jetzt (history map; 1:25.000): only Bern and Basel have been published so far.

== History ==
{{see also|Swiss cartography}}

=== Early work and Dufourkarten ===
In 1809, the first topographical surveys of [[Switzerland]] took place on a [[confederation|confederate]], military level. They took place in the north-eastern area and were led by [[Hans Conrad Finsler]]. Measurements in the alpine region started in 1825 with triangulations by [[Antoine-Joseph Buchwalder]]. This work would be finished in 1837 by [[Johannes Eschmann]]. At New Year 1838, the Topographical Bureau (''Eidgenössisches Topographisches Bureau'') was founded in [[Carouge]], [[Geneve (canton)|Geneve]] by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]]. This bureau published its first map the same year, the ''Carte topographique du Canton de Genève''. Topographic surveys also started in the alpine regions of Switzerland. These had their first results in 1845, a year later than planned, when a map scaled 1:100.000 was published. This was the start of what are termed ''Dufourkarten'' (''Dufour's Maps''). The topographic survey finished in 1862. To honour [[Guillaume Henri Dufour|Dufour]], the Swiss government decided to rename the highest peak on the ''Dufourkarten'' from ''Höchste Spitze'' to [[Dufourspitze]]: it still carries that name today. In 1863, the [[Schweizerische Alpenclub|SAC]] published a 1:50.000 map of the region [[Tödi]], based on unpublished survey material. A year later, the last map of the ''Dufourkarten'' was published, and the following year, Dufour retired and [[Hermann Siegfried]] became Chief of the Topographical Bureau.

=== Siegfriedkarten ===
In 1865, [[Herman Siegfried]] becomes the Chief of the Topographical Bureau, and the bureau moves from [[Geneva]] to [[Bern]]. Over the next few years, a composite map is published of [[Ticino]], soundings start to measure the depth of the major Swiss lakes, and a first map is published scaled 1:250.000. In 1868, a Federal Act is passed to enforce the continuation of the initial topographic surveys, as well as the publication of the results. This results in new topographical surveys in 1869 and the publication of the first 13 ''Siegfriedkarten'' (1:25.000 and 1:50.000) in 1870. In 1878, a 1:1.000.000 map is published, and the next year, the height of the [[Pierre du Niton]] is measured to be 376.86 metre. In 1880, Herman Siegfried is succeeded by [[Jules Dumur]].

In 1895, the Topographical surveys for the ''Siegfriedkarten'' are finished. As of 1901, 581 sheets of the ''Siegfriedkarten'' have been published, with only a few individual more maps to come (there would be 604 maps in 1926). On old maps of the modern series, a reference to those maps can still be found: until the seventies of the 20th century, the ''Siegfriedkarte'' was the best scale available for some areas of Switzerland, and therefore used by climbers and other [[Alpinism|alpinists]]. The printing of the ''Siegfriedkarten'' would continue until 1952.

=== New century ===
In 1887, the first maps with relief shading are published. In 1889, a photographic studio is appended to the bureau. In the years after 1894, a wall-map for schools is published, in response to a request from the parliament to do so. In 1898, the soundings of the major Swiss lakes are finished. In 1901, the bureau is moved into an independent division within the military, and the name ''Eidgenössische Landestopographie'' becomes customary, a name still used by some people until today, and a name which can be found on some older maps. [[Hermann Kümmerly]] publishes a relief wall-map for schools in the same year. In 1908, map trials are started to serve as a replacement for the ''Dufourkarten''. Two years later, trials start to replace the ''Siegfriedkarten''. Much of this military work would remain secret for many years. In 1913, 1922 and 1924, trials are done with [[aerial photogrammetry]], first with balloons and later with aircraft, but only as of 1930 this is used for production of maps, and in 1940 terrestrial photogrammetry is abandoned.

=== Modern maps ===

On 21 June 1935, a Federal Act was passed on the production of the new National Map series, ranging in scale from 1:25.000 to 1:1.000.000. Because of the political situation in Europe, work was started on the 1:50.000 maps.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} For this purpose, a 'M18d' [[Messerschmidt]] was bought for aerial photography, the first aircraft owned by the ''Eidgenössischie Landestopographie''. In 1938, the first 1:50.000 map was published: ''263 Wildstrubel''. From 1939 to 1945, all sales were suspended because of [[World War II]]. In 1939, the ''Eidgenössische Landestopographie'' also procured its first vehicle.

The first 1:25:000 map, ''1145 Bielersee'', was published in 1952. The last 1:25.000 map, ''1292 Maggia'', was published in 1979. This marked the finish of the lowest-scale mapping of Switzerland. The first composite in this scale, ''2501 St. Gallen'', was published in 1956.

The 1:50.000 series was completed in 1963 with ''285 Domodossola''. With the publication of this map, the ''Siegfriedkarten'' have been entirely replaced. The first composite on this scale, ''5001 Gotthard'', was published in 1954.

The 1:100.000 series started with ''41 Col du Pillon'' (1954), and finished with ''47 Monte Rosa'' in 1965. With this publication, the ''Dufourkarten'' have been entirely replaced.

The 1:200.000 series started with No. 3 in 1971 and finished with No. 4 in 1976.

The maps on the scales 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 were respectively first published in 1965 and 1994. With the publication of the latter map, the work required by the Federal Act of 1935 was finally finished.

Since 1951, different sorts of leisure maps have been published by the Federal Office of Topography. See above for a list of those.

In 1958, the [[Swiss coordinate system|coordinate system]] of the maps was changed. Before 1958, the centre of the coordinate system, [[Bern]], had coordinates (0, 0). Subsequently, it has coordinates (600, 200). This was done so that any coordinate is either a x-coordinate or a y-coordinate: this prevents confusion about the order of the coordinates.

In 1968, the name officially became ''Eidgenössische Landestopographie'' instead of ''Abteilung für Landestopographie'', although this had been common practice for decades. The English name remained unchanged (''Topographical Survey of Switzerland'').

In 1979, the ''Eidgenössische Landestopographie'' was renamed to the current name ''Bundesamt für Landestopographie''. See above for the names in other languages. Since 2002, the international name ''Swisstopo'' has been used. This name had already been used since the website {{URL|http://www.swisstopo.ch}} went online in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/about/gesch.htm Swisstopo - history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912124532/http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/about/gesch.htm |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peculiarities ==

Some maps produced by Swisstopo scarcely have any Switzerland on it. This is especially true for the scales 1:100.000 and 1:50.000. As can be seen [https://web.archive.org/web/20090316024622/http://www.swisstopo.ch/images/maps/lk/100/mapview/45.jpg here], the map ''45 Haute Savoie'' only has a very little spot of Switzerland on it, in the extreme north-western corner. The same is true for the 1:50.000 map [https://web.archive.org/web/20090316024620/http://www.swisstopo.ch/images/maps/lk/50/mapview/285.jpg 285 Domodossola]. In both cases, no 1:25.000 maps have been published for the corresponding part of the 1:50.000 map: at the 1:25.000 scale, some maps are a tiny bit larger than others, to be able to get all of Switzerland onto a map without the need of maps with less than 0.1% domestic territory on it.

Initially, the plan was to be more generous also for 1:25.000 maps. Thirty-one maps were once planned, most of which did not have a single km^2 Switzerland on it, that were never published. Some of them (''1158 Zeinisjoch'') were up to ten kilometers away from the Swiss border. On old Swiss maps, one can still see the ''Blattübersicht'' were those are signified as ''planned maps''.

Some maps have been published in the past, but have been discontinued, also because they lack any part of Switzerland. ''1035 Friedrichshafen'' is an example of that. When one looks at the [http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/maps/lk/25overNE.htm Mapsheet Index Northeast], there is no map to the east or to the north of ''1055 Romanshorn''. However, when one then looks at the area of ''1055 Romanshorn'', it can be seen that these maps do in fact exist, but do not have any Swiss land on the map.

In July 2004, EADS Astrium SAS signed a contract for delivery of THEOS with GISTDA ([[Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency]]) of [[Bangkok]], Thailand. GISTDA is Thailand's leading national organization (i.e., space agency) in the field of space activities and applications. The Thai Ministry of Science and Technology funds the program.

THEOS was launched from [[Dombarovsky (air base)|Dombarovskiy]] at 06:37 [[GMT]] on 1 October 2008, by a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]].&lt;ref name="launch time" /&gt; The satellite was initially planned for a 2007 launch using the space vehicle [[Rokot]] of [[Eurockot Launch Services]] . The contract was however canceled when Eurockot faced a parts shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/5923-dnepr-rocket-launches-earth-watching-satellite-thailand.html|title=Dnepr Rocket Launches Earth-Watching Satellite for Thailand|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2014, THEOS captured images showing some 300 objects in close proximity to the suspected crash site of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370]], in the Indian Ocean. The discovery was reported by [[Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency|GISTDA]] on 27 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Thaichote-satellite-detects-debris-30230225.html |title=Thaichote satellite detects debris |work=The Nation |date=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objects have not yet been identified as debris.

== Benefits ==
THEOS was used to observe natural resources in the country by gathering information to be used by both the government and public for research and mapping. THEOS observation missions are conducted to observe agriculture sites, the production of agricultural crops, forest demolition, forest types, shrimp farms, water pollution from oil leaks, water sources, community areas, illegal farms, disaster areas, and the satellite can also be used for city planning. THEOS also reduces the cost of purchasing satellite images from other countries. Moreover, the information that is gathered from the satellite can also be sold to other countries. Thailand has also gained knowledge and technology for designing and building satellite from the French. In addition, specialists from France also travel to Thailand to teach Thai personnel every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theos.gistda.or.th/index.php/about-theos/background-of-the-project|title=ความเป็นมาของโครงการ|last=Administrator|website=theos.gistda.or.th|access-date=2016-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329064823/http://theos.gistda.or.th/index.php/about-theos/background-of-the-project|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
THEOS was designed to be a small sized satellite with a mass of 750&amp;nbsp;kg (include equipment and fuel). It has a hexagonal shape with a height of 2.4 meters and a width of 2 meters (when the solar panel folds). It was launched into low earth orbit in 2008 to an altitude of 822&amp;nbsp;km and with an inclination of 98 degrees. It is equipped with optical imagery which can observe in the visible band to near infrared. Its mission duration is expected to be at least 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theos.gistda.or.th/index.php/about-theos/theos-satellite-|title=รายละเอียดดาวเทียม|last=Administrator|website=theos.gistda.or.th|access-date=2016-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329113300/http://theos.gistda.or.th/index.php/about-theos/theos-satellite-|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tanezrouft''' ({{lang-ar|تنزروفت}}) is a [[natural region]] located along the borders of [[Algeria]], [[Niger]] and [[Mali]], west of the [[Hoggar Mountains|Hoggar mountains]]. It is one of the most desolate parts of the [[Sahara Desert]].

==Geographic features==
Tanezrouft is a barren plain extending to the west of the Hoggar mountains and to the southeast of the sandy [[Erg Chech]]. It is composed of differing materials: the Tanezrouft contains mostly sandstone deposits, whereas the Hoggar formations are [[metamorphic rock]]s.&lt;ref name="hoggar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoggar.org/|title=Hoggar|website=Hoggar.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanezrouft's sandstone hills contain steep canyon walls, some rising to 500 meters elevation. Numerous sand dunes rise from sandy stretches, interspersed with sandstone outcrops. The terrain shows stark evidence of long-ago water erosion (when the [[Sahara Desert]]'s climate was much wetter; present annual rainfall is much less than 20&amp;nbsp;mm). In the present era the terrain is being shaped by wind erosion, which occurs  much faster than in other areas, since there is little or no vegetation to hold the surface in place.&lt;ref name="hoggar.org"/&gt; The area is known for aridity and extreme heat, and high temperatures in summer can easily reach 52&amp;nbsp;°C (125.6&amp;nbsp;°F) or more.

Tanezrouft has been long-shunned by nearby civilizations (it is known as "Land of Thirst").&lt;ref name="hoggar.org"/&gt;  A trade route may have connected the area with [[Ghadames]] and the Hoggar, since perhaps 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Hugh&lt;/ref&gt; It is now spanned north-south by a trans-Saharan motor route, from [[Béchar]] in Algeria to [[Gao]] in Mali. [[Poste Maurice Cortier]] is a fueling station along the route. Tanezrouft is nearly uninhabited; its few nomadic dwellers are of the [[Tuareg people]]. There is a vast water-bearing stratum a few thousand feet below the dry lifeless desert surface.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
In the Niger portion of Tanezrouft, populations of the [[endangered]] [[African wild dog|painted hunting dog]] were previously viable west of the Hoggar Mountains,&lt;ref&gt;Hogan&lt;/ref&gt; but now the painted hunting dog is thought to be extinct for the entirety of Niger.

== Eponym ==

In 2018, the asteroid [[26871 Tanezrouft]] was named after the Tanezrouft Basin

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1043">In [[Zulu mythology]], '''Uhlanga''' is the [[marsh]] from which [[human race|humanity]] was born.

Hahn suggests that the amaZulu people borrowed this creation myth from the [[Khoikhoi]] from whom they appropriated their lands, but that they misunderstood the word ''uhlanga'' which in [[isiZulu]] means ''marsh reed'', but which means "offshoot" in some Khoikhoi languages.

However, myths about people emerging from a marsh, a cave, or a hole in the ground are widespread in [[Bantu language]] speaking societies.

[[Unkulunkulu]] is humanity's progenitor and was the offshoot of [[Umvelinqangi]].

[[File:YouHaveSeenTheirFaces.jpg|thumb|First p/b edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Modern Age Press)]]
'''''You Have Seen Their Faces''''' is a book by photographer [[Margaret Bourke-White]] and novelist [[Erskine Caldwell]]. It was first published in 1937 by [[Viking Press]], with a paperback version by Modern Age Books following quickly. Bourke-White and Caldwell married in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;See Erskine Caldwell&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
For this pictorial survey about rural American South and its troubles, Bronx-born Bourke-White took the pictures, while [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-born Caldwell wrote the text.  Together, they both wrote captions:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Bourke-White lay in wait for her subjects with a flash, and wrote with pleasure of having them “imprisoned on a sheet of film before they knew what had happened.” The resulting portraits are by turns sentimental and grotesque, and she and Caldwell printed them with contrived first-person captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Caleb|last=Crain|title=It Happened One Decade|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|accessdate=September 22, 2009|date= September 21, 2009|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/09/21/090921crbo_books_crain?currentPage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This book inspired [[James Agee]] to write ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name="theroux78"&gt;{{cite book |last=Theroux |first=Paul |date=2015 |title=[[Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads]] |location=London, UK |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |pages=78–79 |isbn=9780241146729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The book's title is reminiscent of two short stories by [[Whittaker Chambers]] in ''[[The New Masses]]'':  "You Can Make Out Their Voices" (March 1931) and "You Have Seen the Heads" (April 1931).  The former story  [[Hallie Flanagan]] (later director of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Theatre Project]]) made into a popular play under the title "Can You Hear Their Voices?"
