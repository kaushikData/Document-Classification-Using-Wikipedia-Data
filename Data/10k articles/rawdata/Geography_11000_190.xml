[[File:Adolf neubauer portrait.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Adolf Neubauer, from the 1906 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']]
'''Adolf Neubauer''' (11 March 1831 in [[Bittse]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 6 April 1907, London) was {{linktext|sublibrarian}} at the [[Bodleian Library]] and [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[Rabbinic Hebrew]] at Oxford University.

==Biography==
He was born in Bittse (Nagybiccse), [[Upper Hungary]] (now Bytča in Slovakia). The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. 
He received a thorough education in [[rabbinical literature]].

In 1850 he obtained a position at the Austrian consulate in [[Jerusalem]]. At this time, he published articles about the situation of the city's Jewish population, which aroused the anger of some leaders of that community, with whom he became involved in a prolonged controversy.

In 1857 he moved to Paris, where he continued his studies of Judaism and started producing scientific publications. His earliest contributions were made to the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums]]'' and the ''[[Journal Asiatique]]'' (Dec. 1861).

==Works==
In 1865 he published a volume entitled ''Meleket ha-Shir'', a collection of extracts from manuscripts relating to the principles of Hebrew versification. In 1864, Neubauer was entrusted with a mission to [[Saint Petersburg]] to examine the numerous, hitherto unpublished [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] manuscripts preserved there. As a result of this investigation he published a report in French, and subsequently ''Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek'' (1866).

The work which established his reputation, however, was ''La Géographie du Talmud'' (1868), an account of the geographical data scattered throughout the [[Talmud]] and early Jewish writings and relating to places in the [[Land of Israel]].

[[File:Bodleian catalog sample.png|thumb|The ''Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Libraries of Oxford'' by Neubauer (1886). Volume 1 contains approximately 900 such pages.]]
Starting in 1865 he lived in England and in 1868 his services were secured by the University of Oxford for the task of cataloging the Hebrew manuscripts in the [[Bodleian Library]]. The catalog appeared in 1886 after 18 years of preparation. The volume includes more than 2,500 entries, and is accompanied by a portfolio with forty facsimiles.

While engaged in this work Neubauer published other works of considerable importance. He purchased a manuscript of the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] ''[[Tolidah]]'' for the Bodleian and published its text in 1869. In 1875, he edited the Arabic text of the Hebrew dictionary of [[Jonah ibn Janah|Abu al-Walid]] (the ''Book of Hebrew Roots''), and in 1876 published ''Jewish Interpretations of the Fifty-third Chapter of [[Isaiah]]'', which was edited by Neubauer and translated by [[Samuel Rolles Driver]] jointly in 1877.

In the same year, he contributed ''Les Rabbins Français du Commencement du XIVe Siècle'' to ''L'Histoire Littéraire de la France'', though, according to the rules of the [[French Academy]], it appeared under the name of [[Ernest Renan|Renan]].

In 1878, Neubauer edited the [[Aramaic]] text of the [[Book of Tobit]]; in 1887, the volume entitled ''Mediæval Jewish Chronicles'' (vol. ii., 1895); and in 1897, with Cowley, ''The Original Hebrew of a Portion of [[Wisdom of Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]]''.

In 1892 together with Stern, he published a German translation of a medieval chronicle of the [[First Crusade]]: ''Hebräische Berichte über die Judenverfolgungen Während der Kreuzzüge''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_a3kRAAAAYAAJ Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland]'', ii., Berlin, 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first to discover fragment of the Hebrew text of [[Ben Sira]].

In 1884, a [[reader (academic rank)|readership]] in Rabbinic Hebrew was founded at Oxford, and Neubauer was appointed to the post, which he held for 16 years until failing eyesight compelled his resignation in May 1900. Neubauer's chief fame has been won as a librarian, in which capacity he enriched the Bodleian with many priceless treasures, displaying great judgment in their acquisition. Among other things he acquired manuscripts from the Cairo [[geniza]] as well as [[Yemen|Yemenite]] manuscripts.

He received the M.A. degree at Oxford in 1873 and was elected an honorary fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] in 1890. In the latter year, he received the honorary degree of PhD from the [[University of Heidelberg]] and was made an honorary member of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] at [[Madrid]].

'''Anders Rapp''' (1927–1998) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[geomorphologist]] and [[geographer]] who pioneered quantitative geomorphological approach on mass movements and erosion. He was the first to make a comprehensive study on [[avalanche boulder tongue]]s. Most of Rapp's works were made in the [[Scandinavian mountains]] and [[Spitsbergen]] including the areas of [[Kärkevagge]] near [[Abisko]] and [[Kebnekaise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic52-2-229.pdf Anders Rapp], Arctic 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying under [[Filip Hjulström]], Rapp got his [[Ph.D.]] at [[Uppsala University]] in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnea.com/~ans/doc/publications.doc Publications by Anders Rapp 1927-1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713211911/http://www.linnea.com/~ans/doc/publications.doc |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed professor of [[physical geography]] at [[Lund University]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_11_97/LUM11_27_geografi.html LUM - Lunds universitet meddelar - nr 11 1997: Geografin 100-årsjubilerar i Lund] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609174802/http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_11_97/LUM11_27_geografi.html |date=June 9, 2011 }} "Geography celebrates 100 years in Lund" {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

The '''Bloomfield Falls''' ([[Indigenous languages of Australia|Aboriginal]]: '''''Wajul Wajul'''''&lt;ref name=facts/&gt;&lt;ref name=plan/&gt;) is a [[Waterfall#Types|cascade waterfall]] on the [[Bloomfield River]] near [[Cape Tribulation, Queensland|Cape Tribulation]], close to [[Wujal Wujal]], that is located in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]{{endash}}listed [[Daintree National Park]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. 

==Features and location==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Bloomfield Falls are the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] [[Kuku Yalanji]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bamaway.com.au/Walker.aspx|title=Wujal Wujal, With the Walker Family|work=Walker Family Tours|publisher=The Bama Way|date=2014|accessdate=18 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519145642/http://www.bamaway.com.au/Walker.aspx|archivedate=19 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[visual arts]] a '''cityscape''' (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or [[urban area]]. It is the urban equivalent of a [[landscape]]. ''Townscape'' is roughly synonymous with ''cityscape,'' though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words ''city'' and ''town''.  In [[urban design]] the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space.  

==History of cityscapes in art==
From the first century A.D. dates a [[fresco]] at the [[Baths of Trajan]] in [[Rome]] depicting a bird's eye view of an ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio la Rocca: "The Newly Discovered City Fresco from Trajan's Baths, Rome." ''Imago Mundi''  Vol. 53 (2001), pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for [[portrait]]s and [[Bible|biblical]] themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] prints and [[etching]]s were made showing cities in [[aerial landscape art|bird's eye view]]. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.

Halfway the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the [[Netherlands]]. In his famous [[View of Delft (Vermeer)|'View of Delft']] in 1660-1661 [[Jan Vermeer]] painted a quite accurate portrait of the city [[Delft]]. Cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]] and [[The Hague]] also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e. [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in [[Venice]] ([[Canaletto]], [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]).

At the end of the 19th century the [[impressionists]] focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of [[everyday life]] in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and [[Rail yard|railway yards]] also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]], and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter [[Edward Hopper]], who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are [[Rackstraw Downes]], [[Antonio López García]], and [[Richard Estes]]. American artist [[Yvonne Jacquette]] has made a specialty of [[aerial landscape art|aerial]] cityscapes. [[Stephen Wiltshire]], a London born artist with autism, is known for his [[panoramic]] cityscape renderings composed from memory, usually after taking a short overhead view of the city he is about to draw.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1223790/Autistic-artist-draws-18ft-picture-New-York-skyline-memory.html|title=Autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire draws spellbinding 18ft picture of New York from memory... after a 20-minute helicopter ride over city|publisher=Daily Mail Reporter

The '''Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System''' (CSDMS) deals with the [[Earth]]'s surface and the observable and projected changes constantly taking place – the ever-changing dynamic interface between lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere.

CSDMS supports the development, integration, dissemination and archiving of community open-source software, that reflects and predicts earth-surface processes over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.

Over 500 research institutions from more than 65 countries comprise the community effort. CSDMS distributes hundreds of [[open-source model]]s and modeling tools, provides access to high performance computing clusters in support of developing and running earth surface models, and offers a suite of products for education and knowledge transfer.

The CSDMS architecture employs frameworks and services that convert stand-alone models into flexible "plug-and-play" components to be assembled into larger applications.   CSDMS focuses on the movement of fluids and the sediment and solutes they transport through landscapes, seascapes and sedimentary basins.  Began in 2007 under the leadership of [[James Syvitski]], formerly the director of the [[Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research]] (INSTAAR), Boulder, CO, CSDMS operates under continuing funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to coordinate this national effort related to surface dynamic modeling.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Norwich, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;William Charles Gilman, father of Daniel, and a graduate of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], relocated from [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] to [[Norwich, Connecticut]] in 1816, where he founded a highly successful factory to manufacture nails.[https://books.google.com/books?id=r7YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=giman+hingham+norfolk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fK4UjeIBJO&amp;sig=PiDD487enWcZRZxdQ-0HW3dFHhE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NZbZSrbJBY_itgOMke2FBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The life of Daniel Coit Gilman'']&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Eliza (''née'' Coit) and mill owner William Charles Gilman, a descendant of Edward Gilman, one of the first settlers of [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter, New Hampshire, of]] [[Thomas Dudley]], Governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and one of the founders of [[Harvard College]], and of Thomas Adgate, one of the founders of [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;[[Exeter, New Hampshire]] {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkxAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22daniel+coit+gilman%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=viiDPzaTc4&amp;sig=hXOjpRWaRN5rGDqnp3SLJ5f9KMA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWm-PuiKnSAhWGMSYKHbfYDWc4ChDoAQhZMBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daniel%20coit%20gilman%22&amp;f=false|title=The Life of Daniel Coit Gilman|last=Franklin|first=Fabian|publisher=Dodd Mead|year=1910|isbn=|location=Harvard College Library|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Coit Gilman graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1852 with a degree in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Daniel Coit Gilman |author=Fabian Franklin|year=1910|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VxAJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22daniel+coit+gilman%22+exeter+new+hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale he was a classmate of [[Andrew Dickson White]], who would later serve as first president of [[Cornell University]]. The two were members of the [[Skull and Bones]] secret society, and traveled to Europe together after graduation and remained lifelong friends. Gilman was also a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] Fraternity. Gilman would later co-found the [[Russell Trust Association]], the foundation behind [[Skull and Bones]]. After serving as [[attaché]] of the United States [[legation]] at [[St. Petersburg, Russia]] from 1853 to 1855, he returned to Yale and was active in planning and raising funds for the founding of [[Sheffield Scientific School]]. Gilman contemplated going into the ministry, and even took out a license to preach, but later settled on a career in education.&lt;ref name="nyt10"&gt;{{cite news |title= Daniel Coit Gilman, A Biography; Fabian Franklin Tells the Life Story of a Great Educational Organizer and Administrator |date= May 21, 1910 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935893.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
From 1856 to 1865 Gilman served as librarian of Yale College, and was also concerned with improving the [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] public school system. When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out, Gilman became the recruiting sergeant for the Norton Cadets, a group of Yale graduates and faculty who drilled on the [[New Haven Green]] under the oversight of Yale professor [[William Augustus Norton]]. In 1863, Gilman was appointed professor of geography at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]], and became secretary and librarian as well in 1866. Having been passed over for the presidency of Yale, for which post Gilman was said to have been the favorite of the younger faculty, he resigned these posts in 1872 to become the third president of the newly organized [[University of California]].&lt;ref name="nyt10"/&gt; His work there was hampered by the [[California Legislature|state legislature]], and in 1875 Gilman accepted the offer to establish and become first president of [[Johns Hopkins University]].

Before being formally installed as president in 1876, he spent a year studying university organization and selecting an outstanding staff of teachers and scholars. His formal inauguration, on 22 February 1876, has become Hopkins' Commemoration Day, the day on which many university presidents have chosen to be installed in office. Among the legendary educators he assembled to teach at Johns Hopkins were classicist [[Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve]], mathematician [[James Joseph Sylvester]], historian [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] and chemist [[Ira Remsen]].

Gilman's primary interest was in fostering advanced instruction and research, and as president he developed the first American graduate university in the [[Education in Germany|German]] tradition. The aim of the modern research university, said Gilman, was to "extend, even by minute accretions, the realm of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Delbanco]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/318 "The Decline and Fall of Literature"].  ''The New York Review of Books'', 4 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At his inaugural address at Hopkins, Gilman asked: "What are we aiming at?" The answer, he said, was "the encouragement of research and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."

In 1884, Gilman was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistg|title=MemberListG|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel Coit Gilman William Rainey Harper.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Gilman and [[University of Chicago]] president [[William Rainey Harper]], 1903]]
Gilman was also active in founding [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] (1889) and [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] (1893). He founded and was for many years president of the Charity Organization of [[Baltimore]], and in 1897 he served on the commission to draft a new charter for [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref name="NCRL"&gt;''New Century Reference Library'', 1907&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1897, he was a member of the commission to settle the boundary line between [[Venezuela]] and [[British Guiana]].&lt;ref name="NCRL" /&gt;

Gilman served as a trustee of the [[Slater Fund|John F. Slater]] and [[Peabody Education Fund|Peabody education funds]] and as a member of John D. Rockefeller's [[General Education Board]]. In this capacity, he became active in the promotion of education in the [[southern United States]]. He was also president of the [[National Civil Service Reform League]] (1901-1907) and the [[American Oriental Society]] (1893-1906), vice president of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], and executive officer of the Maryland Geological Survey.&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Gilman, Daniel Coit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from Johns Hopkins in 1901, but accepted the presidency (1902–4) of the newly founded [[Carnegie Institution]] of Washington.

His books include biographies of [[James Monroe]] (1883) and [[James Dwight Dana]], a collection of addresses entitled ''University Problems'' (1898), and ''The Launching of a University'' (1906).

===Personal life===
[[File:Daniel Coit Gilman House Baltimore Maryland 1936.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Home of Daniel C. Gilman in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]]]
Gilman married twice. His first wife was Mary Van Winker Ketcham, daughter of Tredwell Ketcham of New York. They married on December 4, 1861, and had two daughters: Alice, who married Everett Wheeler; and [[Elisabeth Gilman]], who became a social activist and was a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, and for governor and senator of Maryland, on the [[Socialist Party of America]] ticket. Mary Ketcham Gilman died in 1869, and Daniel Coit Gilman married his second wife, Elizabeth Dwight Woolsey, daughter of John M. Woolsey of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and niece of Yale president [[Theodore Dwight Woolsey]], in 1877. Daniel Gilman's brother Dr. Edward Whiting Gilman was married to Julia Silliman, daughter of Yale Professor and chemist [[Benjamin Silliman]]. Daniel Coit Gilman died in Norwich, Connecticut.&lt;ref name="nyt10"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The original academic building on the [[Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University|Homewood campus]] of the Johns Hopkins University, Gilman Hall, is named in his honor.  In 1897, he helped found a preparatory school called 'The Country School for Boys' on the Johns Hopkins campus.  Upon relocation in 1910, it was renamed in his honor and today, the [[Gilman School]] continues to be regarded among the nation's elite private boys' schools.

On the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus, [[Gilman Hall]], also named in his honor, is the oldest building of the [[Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]] and a National Historic Chemical Landmark. Named for Gilman as well is Gilman Street in Berkeley. Gilman Drive, which passes through the [[University of California, San Diego]] campus in La Jolla, CA is also named for Gilman. The [[Daniel Coit Gilman Summer House]], in Maine, was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000093}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Daniel Coit Gilman Summer Home; "Over Edge"|date=March 8, 1976 |format=PDF |author=Polly M.

'''Dilburnu Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Dilburnu Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[nature park]] in [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.

Dilburnu (literally "Cape Tongue") is situated on the western part of [[Büyükada]] (literally: Big Island), the biggest of the [[Princes' Islands]], a group of nine islands in the [[Sea of Marmara]], in [[Adalar]] district southeast of Istanbul Province. Dilburnu and its surrounding area were declared a [[nature park]] by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]] in 2011. It covers an area of about {{convert|6.88|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="b1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

The Indian subcontinent has a history of devastating [[earthquake]]s. The major reason for the high frequency and intensity of the earthquakes is that the Indian plate is driving into [[Asia]] at a rate of approximately 47&amp;nbsp;mm/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Earthquake Hazards and the Collision between India and Asia |url = http://cires.colorado.edu/science/reviews/noaa/2002/abstracts/18bendick.html |accessdate = 2006-05-13 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060919032236/http://cires.colorado.edu/science/reviews/noaa/2002/abstracts/18bendick.html |archivedate = 2006-09-19 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical statistics of India show that almost 54% of the land is vulnerable to earthquakes. A [[World Bank]] and United Nations report shows estimates that around 200 million city dwellers in India will be exposed to storms and earthquakes by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indian-cities-under-threat-of-storms-earthquakes-by-2050-world-bank-united-nations/articleshow/11039553.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Indian cities under threat of storms &amp; earthquakes by 2050: World Bank &amp; United Nations | date=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version of seismic zoning map of India given in the earthquake resistant design code of India [IS 1893 (Part 1) 2002] assigns four levels of seismicity for India in terms of zone factors. In other words, the earthquake zoning map of India divides India into 4 seismic zones (Zone 2, 3, 4 and 5) unlike its previous version, which consisted of five or six zones for the country. According to the present zoning map, Zone 5 expects the highest level of seismicity whereas Zone 2 is associated with the lowest level of seismicity.&lt;gallery mode="packed" widths="350" heights="350"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==National Center for Seismology==
National Center for Seismology,  [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] is nodal agency of [[Government of India]] dealing with various activities in the field of [[seismology]] and allied disciplines. The major activities currently being pursued by the National Center for Seismology include, a) earthquake monitoring on 24X7 basis, including real time seismic monitoring for early warning of tsunamis, b) Operation and maintenance of national seismological network and local networks c) Seismological data centre and information services, d) Seismic hazard and risk related studies e) Field studies for aftershock / swarm monitoring, site response studies f) earthquake processes and modelling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/welcome.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517050316/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/welcome.htm |archivedate=2015-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The MSK (Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik) intensity broadly associated with the various seismic zones is VI (or less), VII, VIII and IX (and above) for Zones 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, corresponding to [[Maximum Considered Earthquake]] (MCE). The IS code follows a dual design philosophy: (a) under low probability or extreme earthquake events (MCE) the structure damage should not result in total collapse, and (b) under more frequently occurring earthquake events, the structure should suffer only minor or moderate structural damage. The specifications given in the design code (IS 1893: 2002) are not based on detailed assessment of maximum ground acceleration in each zone using a deterministic or probabilistic approach. Instead, each zone factor represents the effective period [[peak ground acceleration]]s that may be generated during the '''maximum considered earthquake''' ground motion in that zone.

Each zone indicates the effects of an earthquake at a particular place based on the observations of the affected areas and can also be described using a descriptive scale like [[Mercalli intensity scale|Modified Mercalli intensity scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Vulnerability Zones in India |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/SKAR-64GBJW?OpenDocument |accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =  Lessons learned from the Gujarat earthquake -  WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia |url =  http://w3.whosea.org/gujarat/finalreport3.htm |archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20020825194819/http://w3.whosea.org/gujarat/finalreport3.htm |dead-url =  yes |archive-date =  2002-08-25 |accessdate =  2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zone 5==
Zone 5 covers the  areas with the highest risks zone that suffers earthquakes of intensity [[Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale|MSK IX]] or greater. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.36 for Zone 5. Structural designers use this factor for earthquake resistant design of structures in Zone 5. The zone factor of 0.36 is indicative of effective (zero period)  level earthquake in this zone. It is referred to as the Very High Damage Risk Zone. The region of [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]], the [[Western Himalaya|Western]] and [[Garhwal Himalaya|Central Himalayas]], [[North Bihar|North and Middle Bihar]], the [[Northeast India|North-East Indian region]], the [[Rann of Kutch]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman and Nicobar group of islands]] fall in this zone.

Generally, the areas having [[trap rock]] or [[basalt|basaltic rock]] are prone to earthquakes.

==Zone 4==

This zone is called the High Damage Risk Zone and covers areas liable to MSK VIII. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.24 for Zone 4 [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Sikkim]], the parts of [[Indo-Gangetic plains]] ([[Majha|North Punjab]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Western Uttar Pradesh]], [[Terai]], [[North Bengal]], [[Sundarbans]]) and the capital of the country [[Delhi]] fall in Zone 4.
In [[Maharashtra]], the [[Patan, Maharashtra|Patan area]] ([[Koynanagar]]) is also in zone no-4. In [[Bihar]] the northern part of the state like [[Raxaul]], Near the border of India and Nepal, is also in zone no-4.

==Zone 3==
This zone is classified as Moderate Damage Risk Zone which is liable to MSK VII. and also 7.8 The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.16 for Zone 3.

==Zone 2==
This region is liable to MSK VI or less and is classified as the Low Damage Risk Zone. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.10 (maximum horizontal acceleration that can be experienced by a structure in this zone is 10% of gravitational acceleration) for Zone 2.

==Zone 1==

Since the current division of India into earthquake hazard zones does not use Zone 1, no area of India is classed as Zone 1.

Future changes in the classification system may or may not return this zone to use.

Carriageways and [[cadastre]]s are examples of feature data. Features can be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]] when displayed on a map.

==Feature types==
The definition of features that share membership of a common theme is a ''feature type'', though there are a number of terms for this characteristic, including ''category'', ''feature class'', ''group'', ''layer'', ''level'', ''object'', and ''theme''.

''Layer'' served as the traditional term of choice, but use of this word has declined as data has become more object-oriented and less concerned with cartographic layering. 

Data modelers can use ''feature types'' to create a hierarchical structure. For example, a dataset may consist of types called highways, streets and lanes. The system may group these particular types together under a category called "Roads".

'''Gaofen-1''' ({{Zh|c=高分一号|p=Gāofēn Yī hào}}) is a high resolution Chinese [[Earth observation satellite]].

Gaofen-1 was launched on April 26, 2013 at 4:13 UTC with a Long March 2D carrier rocket from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] along with the three small experimental satellites: Turksat 3USat (Turkey), CubeBug-1 (Argentina) and NEE-01 Pegaso (Ecuador) in a sun-synchronous orbit.&lt;ref name="eoPortal"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/gaofen-1 | title=GF-1 (Gaofen-1) High-resolution Imaging Satellite | publisher=eoPortal Directory | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilian HDEOS (High-Definition Earth Observation Satellite) program was proposed in 2006 and received approval in 2010. Gaofen-1 is the first of six planned HDEOS spacecraft to be launched between 2013 and 2016. The satellite's primary goal is to provide near real time observations for disaster prevention and relief, climate change monitoring, geographical mapping, environmental and resource surveying as well as [[precision agriculture]] support.&lt;ref name="eoPortal" /&gt;

'''{{lang|non|Garðaríki}}''' (anglicized '''Gardariki''' or '''Gardarike''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/Gardarike Store Norske Leksikon] (2005–2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''{{lang|non|Garðaveldi}}''' is the [[Old Norse]] term used in [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] for the states of [[Kievan Rus']].

As the [[Varangians]] dealt mainly with Northern [[Rus' people|Rus']] lands, their [[saga]]s regard the city of {{lang|non|Holmsgardr|italic=no}} ({{lang|non|Holmgarðr}}, [[Veliky Novgorod]]) as the capital of {{lang|non|Garðaríki}}. Other local towns mentioned in the sagas are {{lang|non|Aldeigjuborg}} ([[Staraya Ladoga|Old Ladoga]]), {{lang|non|Kœnugarðr}} ([[Kiev]]), {{lang|non|Pallteskja}} ([[Polotsk]]), {{lang|non|Smaleskja}} ([[Smolensk]]), {{lang|non|Súrsdalar}} ([[Suzdal]]), {{lang|non|Móramar}} ([[Murom]]), and {{lang|non|Ráðstofa}} ([[Rostov]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Three of the [[Varangian runestones]], [[Gotland Runic Inscription 114|G 114]], [[Södermanland Runic Inscription 338|Sö 338]], and [[Veda Runestone|U 209]], refer to Scandinavian men who had been in {{lang|non|Garðar}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pritsak |first=Omeljan |authorlink=Omeljan Pritsak |title=The Origin of Rus': Old Scandinavian Sources Other than the Sagas |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1981 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=346, 396 |url= |isbn=0-674-64465-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The meaning of the word {{lang|non|Garðaríki}} is usually interpreted as {{wikt-lang|non|garðr}} + {{wikt-lang|non|ríki}}: "the kingdom of cities", or "the realm of towns",&lt;ref name="penguin"&gt;''[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141000039,00.html Sagas of the Icelanders]'', [[Penguin Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; which probably referred to a chain of forts along the [[Volkhov River]], starting with [[Lyubsha]] and [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (see [[Gord (archaeology)#Evolution of the word|Evolution of the word Gord]]). These forts had to assert themselves especially against the [[Khazars|Khazar Khaganate]] until the end of the 9th century and therefore they developed the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state which is known as [[Kievan Rus']].

{{lang|non|Garðr}} contains the same root as Slavic {{lang|sla|[[grad (geography)|gord]]}} ("town") and [[English language|English]] ''garden''. {{lang|non|Garðr}} refers to a wall or fortification but came to primarily mean what it contained. For the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[etymology]] of the latter element, see the article on {{lang|de|[[Reich]]}} and the archaic English term {{wikt-lang|ang|rike}}.

The '''geology of [[Kyrgyzstan]]''' began to form during the [[Proterozoic]]. The country has experienced long-running uplift events, forming the Tien Shan mountains and large, sediment filled basins. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=483-490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics==
The Precambrian tectonic evolution of the region is poorly understood. Geologists infer that the Northern Turkestan domain likely formed along the margin of the [[Proterozoic]] Baltica-Siberia continent. The Tarim Block may have belonged to [[Gondwanaland]], based on paleontological evidence. Although paleomagnetic data for the Tien Shan mountains is lacking, some have suggested that the ocean closed to form the Turkestan domain may have been a branch of the proto-Pacific Ocean. The [[Paleozoic]] rocks in the Tien Shan mountains are the remnants of accreted island arcs, mainly from the [[Ordovician]] onward. 

During the [[Vendian]], the Northern Turkestan domain was part of the Kipchak island arc system between the East European and Siberian continent, separated by the Terksey back-arc basin which had originated as a rift basin. The Tien Shan mountains began to form in the Ordovician out of three island arcs amalgamated by the subduction of Terksey oceanic crust beneath the Kungey Arc, Sandalash Arc and subduction of Paleotethys Ocean crust under the Yagnob Arc. The Kyrgyz Block formed in the middle Ordovician with closure of the Terksey Basin and then underwent deformation. Coarse [[molasse]]  sediments lie unconformably on top of subduction-related granite intrusions and volcanic rocks. North and south of the Terksey Suture, formed during the event, late Ordovician collision-related granites. 

Into the [[Silurian]], the Sandalash magmatic arc remained along the southern margin of the Kyrgyz Block. Turkestan oceanic crust was subducated beneath the Sandalash magmatic arc. By the early [[Devonian]], magmatic activity was taking place in the northern Tien Shan mountains, likely as a result of the subducting Turkestan crust. Sedimentation occurred in shallow seas and on the passive margin of the Tarim-Alay Block.

Magmatic activity resumed in the [[Carboniferous]], with spreading in the Turkestan Ocean and renewed subduction under the Kyrgyz Block. By the late Carboniferous, collision between the Tarim-Alay microcontinent and the Kyrgyz Block was underway, emplacing large [[nappe]] features with [[ophiolite]] deposits on top of the Tarim-Alay basement rocks. Magmatism continued through the [[Permian]] in the Tien Shan mountains, accompanied by deformation and the deposition of [[molasse]] sediments in different basins. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=488}}

Structural geologists distinguish a number of tectonic features from the Paleozoic including the Nikolaev's Line, Talas-Fergana Fault, Turkestan Suture and Terskey Suture.

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present)===
At the start of the [[Mesozoic]], depressions began to develop in the [[Triassic]], accumulating thick, coal-bearing sediments. The East Fergana pull-apart basin aligned along the Talas-Fergana Fault. The western edge of the basin has delta sediments while the center of the basin reflects deep water sediments. Material and fossils continued to accumulate into the Jurassic as the units were folded. 

A shallow water basin covered the region in the [[Cretaceous]], leaving behind salt water fauna west of the Talas-Fergana fault. Alluvial deposits mark the edges of the saline lake and Cretaceous deposits accumulated up to 500 meters thick. The lake became a shallow intracontinental sea, lasting into the [[Cenozoic]]. Lagoon deposits accumulated through the [[Eocene]], until the sea began to retreat in late [[Paleogene]] times. The retreat was brought on with the collision of India with Asia around 50 million years ago. Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary rocks are up to two kilometers thick in the Fergana Basin. The [[Oligocene]], the entire region had shifted to lagoon and continental deposition. 

To the east of the Fergana Range, there are no Cretaceous or [[Paleocene]] sediments. Continental sediments accumulated there beginning in the Eocene, formed clay, siltstone and sandstone, interbedded with thinner layers of gypsum, marl, conglomerate and limestone in river valleys formed in the central Tien Shan Mountains in the Oligocene and [[Miocene]]. These deposits range widely from several meters thick to several kilometers. They reach their greatest thickness of four kilometers in Fergana, Atbashi and Naryn basins. Tien Shan mountain rocks show no signs of folding from the Cretaceous through the Paleogene and lie with an angular unconformity atop basement rocks. 

Tectonic activity rapidly resumed in the late [[Pliocene]], leading to erosion of continental sediments into intermontane basins into the [[Quaternary]]. Folding developed into the [[Quaternary]] in the Tien Shan mountains as global changes in climate brought on the [[Pleistocene]] ice ages. Most ridges in the mountain range are asymmetric anticlines bounded by reverse and thrust faults. Folding and thrusting is often oriented toward major basins like the Fergana, Chur or Tarim basins. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=490}}

==Seismic activity==
Due to tectonic activity since the Pliocene, Kyrgyzstan has intense seismic activity on a regular basis. There have been more than 11 earthquakes magnitude 6 or greater on the [[Richter scale]] since 1865. The most activity centers on the Kyrgyz Ranges, Kungey Ranges and East Fergana region. 

==Natural resource geology==
Kyrgyzstan is notable for significant deposits of antimony and mercury, such as the Chauvay, Kadamzhai and Khaydarkan deposits. These are examples of quartz-fluorite-antimonite-cinnabar (also known as [[jasperoid]] type deposits), while others are quartz-dickite-cinnabar or magnesian-carbonate-cinnabar (or listvenite)_ types. The primary types of deposits are common at the contact between Carboniferous limestone and overlying Silurian shales and Devonian sandstone [[nappe]] formations. Listvenite deposits are typically associated with [[Serpentine subgroup|serpentine]] mélange. Contact metamorphism skarn deposit gold, hydrothermal gold, [[pegmatite]] hosted tin, cassiterite-quartz and iron ore in Proterozoic slates are also common together, with smaller amounts of zinc, aluminum, lead, vanadium and uranium. 

Oil and gas are found in commercial quantities in the Fergana Basin in Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rocks. The oil is low in sulfur and the natural gas is dry with up to 72 percent methane. The South Fergana Basin, the Uzgen Basin, Kavak Basin and Southern Issyk Kul Basin all host coal deposits from the Triassic and Jurassic formed under continental conditions, with 70 percent hard coal. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=491}}

{{About|static measurement of tilt|dynamic measurement|Tiltmeter}}

An '''inclinometer''' or '''clinometer''' is an [[measuring instrument|instrument]] used for measuring angles of [[slope]] (or tilt), [[elevation]], or [[depression (geology)|depression]] of an object with respect to [[gravity]]'s direction. It is also known as a ''tilt indicator'', ''tilt sensor'', [[tiltmeter|''tilt meter'']],  ''slope alert'', ''slope gauge'', ''gradient meter'', ''gradiometer'', ''level gauge'', ''level meter'', ''declinometer'', and ''pitch &amp; roll indicator''. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: [[degree (angle)|degrees]], [[percent]], and topo (see [[Grade (slope)]] for details). [[Astrolabes]] are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.

A ''tilt sensor'' can measure the [[wikt:tilt|tilt]]ing in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes.
In contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth's ground plane, is to use an [[accelerometer]]. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the "ball" in [[turn coordinator]]s or [[turn and bank indicator]]s is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer.

==History==
[[File:Eclimetro (disegno) IF 24935.jpg|thumb|Drawing of an inclinometer, Museo Galileo, Florence.]]
Inclinometers include examples such as Well's in-clinometer, the essential parts of which are a flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disc just half filled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb. Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple [[conversion tables]], the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line.

[[Image:Well's Clinometer - Project Gutenberg eText 19465.png|thumb|The Well's clinometer]]

The [[Abney level]] is a handheld [[surveying]] instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its [[crosshair]]) with the reflection of the bubble in the [[spirit level]] of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.

One of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP "The Spirit of St. Louis"—in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riekerinc.com/M-Inclinometer/ryan_nyp_spirit_of_st.htm|title=Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer|author=|date=|website=riekerinc.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give him climb and descent angle information.

==Uses==
Hand-held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for [[cave survey]]. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the [[strike and dip]] of geologic formations.  In forestry, [[tree height measurement]] can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major [[artillery]] guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances. 

Permanently-installed [[tiltmeter]]s are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure.

===Factors which influence the use of inclinometers===
(Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used)
* Gravity
* Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration. 
* A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed.
* A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision.
* The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec.
* The calibration of tilt sensors in the factory may differ on the actual site.

==Accuracy==
Certain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001°; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.01°. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity—electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from ±0.01–2° depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.

==Sensor technology==
Tilt sensors and inclinometers generate an [[artificial horizon]] and measure angular tilt with respect to this horizon. They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt.

Important specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, [[orthogonal]]. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. &lt;!-- doesn't matter what it's measured in, and last sentence just repeats the back end of the first --&gt;

Common implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, [[Liquid capacitive inclinometers|Liquid Capacitive]], electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum.

Tilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' and ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games.

Inclinometers are also used in [[civil engineering]], for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon.

Some inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on [[Controller area network|CAN (Controller Area Network)]]. In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized [[Canopen|CANopen]] profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable.

==Two-axis digital inclinometer==
[[File:DWL-8500.jpg|thumb|Two-axis digital inclinometer]]

Traditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum.

Typical advantages of using two-axis [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] inclinometers over conventional single-axis "bubble" or mechanical leveling instruments may include:

* Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch &amp; roll), can eliminate tedious swopping back-and-forth experienced when using a single-axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position.
* Digital compensation and precise calibration for non-linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range.
* The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure's positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up.

== Inclinometer with gyroscope ==
As inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the above mentioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.posital.com/en/products/inclinometers/mems/MEMS-Technology.php|title=MEMS Inclinometer from POSITAL: How do they work?|last=POSITAL|website=Posital|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Inclinometers are used for: 
* Determining latitude using [[Polaris]] (in the Northern Hemisphere) or the two stars of the constellation [[Crux]] (in the Southern Hemisphere).
* Determining the angle of the Earth's magnetic field with respect to the horizontal plane.
* Showing a deviation from the true vertical or horizontal.
* [[Surveying]], to measure an angle of inclination or elevation.
* Alerting an equipment operator that it may tip over.
* Measuring angles of elevation, slope, or incline, e.g. of an embankment.
* Measuring slight differences in slopes, particularly for [[geophysics]]. Such inclinometers are, for instance, used for monitoring [[volcano]]es, or for measuring the depth and rate of landslide movement.
* Measuring movements in walls or the ground in civil engineering projects.
* Determining the [[Strike and dip|dip of beds]] or strata, or the slope of an embankment or cutting; a kind of plumb level.
* Some automotive [[safety]] systems.
* Indicating pitch and roll of vehicles, nautical craft, and aircraft. See [[turn coordinator]] and [[slip indicator]].
* Monitoring the boom angle of cranes and material handlers.
* Measuring the "look angle" of a satellite antenna towards a satellite.
* Adjusting a [[solar panel]] to the optimal angle to maximize its output.

''Tilt indicators'' are disposable-grade, albeit reusable sensors attached to goods as part of packaging during shipping.&lt;ref name="Tilt Indicators for Fragile Goods in Transport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tilt Indicators for Fragile Goods in Transport|url=http://www.shockwatch.com/shipping_handling_monitors/tilt_indicator/index.php|publisher=Shockwatch|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
[[Nintendo]] used tilt sensor technology in five games for its [[Game Boy]] series of hand-held game systems.  The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature:

* ''[[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation]]'' (Game Boy Advance)
* ''[[WarioWare: Twisted!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(not released in Europe)
* ''[[Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!]]'' (Game Boy Advance)(Japan only)
* ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' ([[Game Boy Color]])(not released in Europe)
* [[Command Master]] ([[Game Boy Color]])(Japan only)

Tilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the [[Microsoft Sidewinder]] Freestyle Pro and Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] controller.

However, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]] and the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk attachment]]. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most [[Wii]] games.

It is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like [[motocross]]ing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, [[first-person shooter]], and other odd uses such as in ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]''

Another example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze. A homebrew tilt sensor interface was made for the [[Palm (PDA)]].

[[File:Jardin Atlantique Room of Undulating Grasses.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Room of undulating grasses, Jardin Atlantique]]

The '''Jardin Atlantique''' is a public park and garden located in the [[15th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], on the roof that covers the tracks and platforms of the [[Gare Montparnasse]] railway station.   It has an area of 3.4 hectares.  It was created by the [[landscape architect]]s Brun, Penna and Schnitzler, and opened in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Jarassé, pg. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The garden is placed atop the large roof, or dalle, that covers the tracks and platforms of the Gare Monparnasse, supported by twelve pillars, and seventeen meters above the street level.  Large ventilator shafts for the station are placed around the garden, and the announcement of the trains departing can be heard in the garden.  Cubes of stone filled with earth contain five hundred trees.   The garden is surrounded by office buildings and by a line of tennis courts on the west side.  It is also the site of a small museum honoring [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], commander of the  French armored division which entered Paris first during the liberation of the city from the Germans in August 1944. 

The plan of the garden is inspired the historical role of the Gare Montparnasse as the train station that connected Paris to [[Brittany]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  One theme is that of a ship;  the lamposts resemble the masts of sailing ships, and there are two elevated walkways on either side of the garden which resemble the bridges of ships.  The visitor to the garden is supposed to feel like a passenger on a cruise ship surrounded by a circle of office buildings. 

In the center of the garden, surrounded by a lawn, is a small square called the Isle of the [[Hesperides]], named for the legendary islands believed by the Ancient Greeks to be to the west of the [[Pillars of Hercules]].  In the "island" is a fountain, called the Fontaine des Hesperides, made by the sculptor [[Jean-Max Llorca]], composed of several gigantic meteorogical instruments for measuring the rain, temperature,  wind and atmospheric pressure, surrounded by jets of water. 

On the east side of the garden are a series of small thematic gardens, with different types of vegetation:  
*Salle des Plants ondoyantes.  (grasses moving in the wind.)
*Salle des Humidites. (Aquatic plants.)
*Salle des Bleus and Mauves.  (Flowers in blue and mauve.)
*Salle du Silence.  (A secluded garden for meditation.)
*Salle des Rivages (Plants of the coast.)

The large number of pine trees in the garden are also supposed to evoke the Atlantic coast of Brittany. 

The east side of the garden also has two pavillons, where visitors can climb to the roof and look over the garden.

The '''Jerusalem Forest''' is a [[municipal forest|municipal]] [[pine]] forest located in the [[Judean Mountains]] in the outskirts of [[Jerusalem]]. It is surrounded by the [[List of places in Jerusalem#Jerusalem neighborhoods|neighborhoods]] of [[Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem|Beit HaKerem]], [[Yefeh Nof|Yefe Nof]], [[Ein Kerem]], [[Har Nof]] and [[Givat Shaul]], and a [[moshav]], [[Beit Zeit]].  The forest was planted during the 1950s by the [[Jewish National Fund]], financed by private donors.

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12718 Jerusalem forest.JPG|thumb|Jerusalem Forest, 2011]]
In the early years of the state, Jewish National Fund planted thousands of trees along the western edge of Jerusalem, creating a [[green belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79147635.html The Jerusalem Forest, endangered national asset]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the forest extended over about 4 square kilometres. Over the years, it has shrunk due to urban expansion and today, it covers about 1.2 square kilometres. The [[Yad Vashem]] museum is located in the forest near [[Mount Herzl]]. In the middle of the forest, between Yad Vashem and Ein Kerem, there is a recreation center, the "Chaim Tzippori Guest House", (better known as the "Tzippori Center") which has a hotel and youth hostel. On this same campus is the office of "The Adam Institute for Democracy and Peace", an Israeli non-profit organization that runs educational programs promoting tolerance and coexistence.

The forest acts as a refuge for wildlife, and there are packs of [[jackal]]s that inhabit the forest.

==Forest conservation efforts==
Projects by the [[Jerusalem Municipality]] such as the planned [[Jerusalem Road 16]] threaten the continued existence of the forest, which causes concern among environmental organizations and residents of Jerusalem, especially those living in the nearby neighborhoods. At the end of the 1990s, environmental organizations and residents organized to fight for the future of the forest and its protection.

'''Juan de Cartagena''' (died c. 1520) was a Spanish [[accountant]] and major participant in Ferdinand Magellan’s quest to find a western sea route to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]].

==Early life==
Cartagena was the nephew, or possibly the illegitimate son, of Archbishop [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], the influential head of the [[Casa de Contratación]] which regulated trade with Spain’s American colonies.&lt;ref name=fifty5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ten&gt;Krom, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magellan's voyage==
Trained as an accountant, Cartagena had no experience as a seaman. Despite this, he used his influence with Fonseca to secure appointment as Inspector General (''Veedor General'') of Magellan's ''[[Armada de Molucca]]'' with authority to supervise the expedition's financial and trading operations.&lt;ref&gt;Krom, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] of Spain also directed Cartagena to report on the expedition directly, rather than through Magellan as captain-general. This split responsibility would be a source of difficulty during the subsequent voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Krom, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fifty5&gt;Bergreen, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of Cartagena's influence, and in order to please his supporters, Magellan named him captain of the largest ship of the expedition, the ''[[San Antonio (spanish ship)|San Antonio]]'', subject only to Magellan's own authority as captain-general of the fleet.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt; 

Tensions surfaced between Cartagena and Magellan as soon as the fleet departed Spain. In councils between captains, Cartagena routinely opposed Magellan's navigation decisions and refused to salute his superior when required by custom to do so. A storm delayed the fleet south of [[Tenerife]], and food had to be rationed; Cartagena took this opportunity to publicly criticise Magellan and suggest he was not competent to command. Magellan promptly had him arrested, relieved of his command and confined aboard the ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' for the remainder of the voyage to South America.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutiny===
Cartagena remained a captive until the fleet reached [[Patagonia]]. On 1 April 1520 he secretly left the ''Victoria'' and reboarded the ''San Antonio,'' where he rallied supporters among the Spanish crew and officers in opposition to the Portuguese Magellan. In company with ''[[Concepción (ship)|Concepción]]''{{'}}s captain Gaspar de Quesada, pilot [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and thirty Spanish crew members, Cartagena seized control of ''San Antonio'' and declared the vessel independent of Magellan's command. The officers of both ''Concepción'' and ''Victoria'' joined in the mutiny, and on 2 April 1520 a letter was sent to Magellan's flagship, the [[Trinidad (ship)|''Trinidad'']] demanding that the captain-general acknowledge that the fleet was no longer under his command.

Magellan brought the ''Trinidad,'' alongside ''Victoria'' and lowered a boat to carry back his reply. When the boat crew reached ''Victoria''{{'}}s deck they made a pretense of handing over a letter; when ''Victoria''{{'}}s captain sought to take it the boat crew stabbed him to death. Simultaneously, fifteen men from Magellan's ship climbed aboard and attacked the mutineers. ''Victoria''{{'}}s crew joined their cause and the ship was seized.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartagena had relocated to ''Concepción'' prior to the battle, and so remained temporarily free. However, only that vessel and ''San Antonio'' remained in the mutineer's hands. Magellan ranged his three ships across the mouth of the bay in which the fleet had anchored, and cleared the decks for engagement with Cartagena's two vessels. In strong winds overnight on April 2, ''San Antonio'' dragged its anchor and drifted helplessly toward ''Trinidad.'' Magellan ordered a broadside fired, at which the crew of ''San Antonio'' surrendered and allowed the vessel to be retaken. Realising the mutiny had failed, on April 3 Cartagena followed suit and surrendered ''Concepción'' without resistance.&lt;ref name=JCB26&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Forty of Cartagena's mutineers were sentenced to death, though Magellan immediately commuted the sentences and permitted the men to return to their previous stations within a few days and to serve in chains for a period of a few days. Stronger action was required against the ringleader Cartagena, but Magellan was reluctant to execute a close relative of Fonseca.&lt;ref name=one53&gt;Bergreen, page 153&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, on August 24 1520 Cartagena and another conspirator, the priest Pedro Sánchez de la Reina, were given a small supply of ship's biscuits and drinking water and then [[marooning|marooned]] on an island off the Patagonian coast. Neither was heard from again.&lt;ref name=JCB26/&gt;

'''Kampa''' (also ''Na Kampě'') is an [[island]] in the [[Vltava]] [[river]] in central [[Prague]] on the side of [[Malá Strana]].  [[Charles Bridge]] crosses its northern tip and is connected to the island by the street ulice Na Kampě. It is separated from Malá Strana by a narrow artificial channel to the west called the ''Devil's Stream'' ([[Čertovka]]), a waterway dug to power water mills (no longer existent). It is supposedly named after a sharp-tongued woman who lived in a local home called the Seven Devils. &lt;ref&gt;Levine, Dan. ''Avant Guide Prague'' New York: Empire Press Media, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was named in the 17th century as the ''campus'' ("field") by Spanish soldiers who tented here during the [[Battle of White Mountain]].

==Museum Kampa==

Kampa is home to [[Museum Kampa]], a modern art gallery showing central European (and in particular [[Czechs|Czech]]) work. The pieces are from the private collection of Meda Mládek, wife of
[[Jan V. Mládek]].  The museum, which opened in 2003, is housed in ''Sova's Mills'' on the eastern bank of the island. Magdalena Jetelova's huge chair sculpture, situated outside the museum above the river, is a prominent landmark visible from across the Vltava.

'''Karelia''' ([[Karelian language|Karelian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Karjala''; {{lang-ru|Карелия}}, ''Karelija'', historically Корела, ''Korjela''; {{lang-sv|Karelen}}), the land of the [[Karelians|Karelian people]], is an area in [[Northern Europe]] of historical significance for [[Finland]], [[Russia]], and [[Sweden]].  It is currently divided among the northwestern Russian Federation (the [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] of the [[Republic of Karelia]] and [[Leningrad Oblast]]) and Finland (the [[Regions of Finland|regions]] of [[South Karelia]] and [[North Karelia]]).

==Use of name==
[[File:Many Karelias.png|right|thumb|225px|Parts of Karelia, as they are divided today.]]
[[File:Kizhi church 1.jpg|thumb|187px|[[Kizhi Pogost]], one of many fine examples of wooden architecture surviving on [[Kizhi]] island.]]

Various subdivisions may be called Karelia. [[Finnish Karelia]] was an historical province of Finland, and is now divided between Finland and Russia, often called just ''Karjala'' in Finnish.  The eastern part of this chiefly [[Lutheran]] area was ceded to Russia after the [[Winter War]] of 1939–40.

The [[Republic of Karelia]] is a Russian federal subject, including the so-called East Karelia with a chiefly Russian Orthodox population.

Within present-day Finland, ''Karjala'' refers to the [[Regions of Finland|regions]] of [[South Karelia|South]] and [[North Karelia]], although parts of historical Karelia also lies within the region of [[Kymenlaakso]] ([[Miehikkälä]] and [[Virolahti]]), [[Northern Savonia]] ([[Kaavi]], [[Rautavaara]] and [[:fi:Säyneinen|Säyneinen]]) and [[Southern Savonia]] ([[Mäntyharju]]).

==Geography==

Karelia stretches from the [[White Sea]] coast to the [[Gulf of Finland]]. It contains the two largest lakes in Europe, [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]]. The [[Karelian Isthmus]] is located between the [[Gulf of Finland]] and [[Lake Ladoga]].

The border between Karelia and [[Ingria]], the land of the closely related [[Ingrians|Ingrian people]], had originally been the [[Neva River]] itself but later on it was moved northward into Karelian isthmus to follow the [[Sestra River (Leningrad Oblast)|Sestra River]] ({{lang-ru|Сестра}}), today in the [[Saint Petersburg]] metropolitan area, but in 1812–1940 the Russo-Finnish border.

On the other side of [[Lake Ladoga]], [[River Svir]] is usually thought of as the traditional southern border of Karelian territory, as [[Lake Saimaa]] marks the Western border while [[Lake Onega]] and the [[White Sea]] mark the Eastern border. In the North there were the [[nomadic]] [[Sami people|Samis]], but no natural border except for huge woods ([[taiga]]) and [[tundra]].

In historical texts Karelia is sometimes divided into ''East Karelia'' and ''West Karelia,'' which are also called [[East Karelia|Russian Karelia]] and [[Finnish Karelia]] respectively.  The area to the north of Lake Ladoga which belonged to Finland before [[World War II]] is called Ladoga Karelia, and the parishes on the old pre-war border are sometimes called Border Karelia. White Sea Karelia (sometimes the Finnish or Karelian term "Viena Karelia", or in some English-language sources, "White Karelia", is used) is the northern part of [[East Karelia]] and [[Olonets Karelia]] is the southern part.

[[Tver Karelia]] denotes the villages in the [[Tver Oblast]] that are inhabited by [[Tver Karelians]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Karelia}}

Karelia was bitterly fought over by [[Sweden]] and the [[Novgorod Republic]] for a period starting in the 13th-century [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]]. The [[Treaty of Nöteborg]] (Finnish: Pähkinäsaaren rauha) in 1323 divided Karelia between the two. [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Finnish: Viipuri) became the capital of the new Swedish province. In the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] in 1617 large parts of Russian Karelia were ceded to Sweden. Conflicts between the new Swedish rulers and the indigenous population of these areas led to an exodus: thousands of Karelians, including the ancestors of the [[Tver Karelians]], emigrated to Russia.

[[File:Pekka Halonen - Tienraivaajia Karjalassa.jpg|thumb|''Pioneers in Karelia'', 1900. By [[Eero Järnefelt]]]]
The [[Treaty of Nystad]] (Finnish: Uudenkaupungin rauha) in 1721 between [[Imperial Russia]] and Sweden ceded most of Karelia to Russia. The [[Treaty of Åbo]] in 1743 between Sweden and Russia then ceded South Karelia to Russia. After [[Finland]] had been occupied by Russia in the [[Finnish War]], parts of the ceded provinces ([[Old Finland]]) were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. In 1917, [[Finland's declaration of independence|Finland became independent]] and the border was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920.

[[Heimosodat|Finnish partisans were involved in attempts]] to overthrow the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevists]] in Russian Karelia ([[East Karelia]]) in 1918–20, such as in the failed [[Aunus expedition]]. They also wanted to incorporate the rest of Karelia into Finland, and cooperated with the short-lived [[Republic of Uhtua]]. These mainly private expeditions ended after the peace treaty of Tartu. After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] and the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the Karelian [[Autonomous republic of the Soviet Union]] (ASSR) in 1923.

In 1939, The Soviet Union attacked Finland, thus starting the [[Winter War]]. The [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] of 1940 handed most of [[Finnish Karelia]] to the Soviet Union. About 400,000 people, virtually the whole population, had to be relocated within Finland. In 1941, Karelia was liberated for three years during the [[Continuation War]] of 1941 to 1944 when East Karelia was occupied by the Finns. The Winter War and the resulting Soviet expansion caused considerable bitterness in Finland, which lost its second biggest city, [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], its industrial heartland along the [[river Vuoksi]], the [[Saimaa canal]] that connected central Finland to the [[Gulf of Finland]], access to the fishing waters of [[Lake Ladoga]] (Finnish: Laatokka), and made an eighth of her citizens refugees without chance of return. (From the areas ceded to the Soviet Union, the whole population was evacuated and resettled in other parts of Finland. The present inhabitants of the former Finnish Karelian parts of Russia, such as the city of Vyborg/Viipuri and the [[Karelian Isthmus]], are post-war immigrants and their descendants.)
[[File:Karelia today.png|right|thumb|225px|Map showing the Republic of Karelia and the two Finnish regions.]]
As a consequence of the peace treaty, the Karelian ASSR was incorporated with the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] 1941–1956, after which it became an ASSR again. Karelia was the only Soviet republic that was "demoted" from an SSR to an ASSR within the [[Russian SFSR]]. Unlike administrative republics, Soviet republics (in theory) had the [[Lenin's national policy|constitutional right to secede]]. The possible fear of secession, as well as the Russian ethnic minority in Karelia may have resulted in its "demotion." In 1991 the [[Republic of Karelia]] was created out of the ASSR.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The collapse of the Soviet Union brought an [[economic collapse]]. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the area has experienced massive [[urban decay]]. The hastily and poorly constructed buildings from the Soviet era, as well as older houses remaining from the Finnish era, are being abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{fi icon}} [http://karjalantragedia.info/kt/?x=collapse ROMAHTANUT YHTEISKUNTA ("Collapsed Society")] on ''Free Karelia'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[image:Petrozavodsk 06-2017 img71 Karelian Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Seat of the Legislative Assembly of Karelia]]
Karelia is politically divided between Finland and Russia. The [[Republic of Karelia]] is a [[federal subject of Russia]], which was formed in 1991 from the [[Karelian ASSR]]. The [[Karelian Isthmus]] belongs to the [[Leningrad Oblast]]. The Finnish side consists of parts of the regions (''maakunta'') of [[South Karelia]], [[North Karelia]] and [[Kymenlaakso]].

There are some small but enthusiastic groups of Finns campaigning for closer ties between Finland and Karelia. The political expression of these [[irredentism|irredentist]] hopes is called the [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|Karelian question]] and is about Finland's re-acquisition of the ceded [[Finnish Karelia]]. These hopes live on, for instance, in the ''[[Karjalan Liitto]]'' and [[ProKarelia]]. However, ambitions for closer ties with [[East Karelia]] do not include territorial demands.

==Demographics==
The [[Karelian language]] is spoken in the Republic of Karelia and in the Karelian villages of the [[Tver Region]] of Northwest Russia. The [[Veps language]] is spoken on both sides of the [[River Svir]]. The so-called Karelian dialects of Finnish language which are spoken mainly in Finnish South Karelia form the southeastern dialect group of Finnish. Similar dialects are also spoken in Ingria, which is an area between the Estonian border and Lake Ladoga. They appeared there in the 17th century after the Swedish conquest of the area. The older inhabitants of the Ingria, the Ingrians, have their own language which is related to the Karelian language and the south-eastern dialects of Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/kaakkois.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004124230/http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/kaakkois.html |archivedate=1999-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dialects in Finnish North Karelia belong to the large group of Savonian dialects in Eastern and Central Finland. [https://web.archive.org/web/19991006021001/http://www.internetix.ofw.fi/opinnot/opintojaksot/8kieletkirjallisuus/aidinkieli/murteet/savolais.html]
[[Karelians]] who evacuated from Finnish Karelia resettled all over Finland and today there are approximately one million people in Finland having their roots in the area ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. In Finland, about 5,000 people speak Karelian.

== Tourism ==
Karelia is one of the most famous Russian territories in international tourism for its unique architectural, cultural and historical sites such as [[Kizhi Pogost|Kizhi]] and [[Valaam Monastery|Valaam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ticrk.ru/en/karelia/|title=Karelia Tourism Information|last=|first=|date=|website=Karelia Tourism Portal|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is worth a trip in both summer and winter, when possible activities include riding in a sled behind a dog team and running from the banya to an ice hole and back. Summer hikers can visit the [[Kivach Falls|Kivach waterfall]] or the Demon's Chair plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbth.com/articles/2010/03/12/120310_karelia.html|title=Karelia will return in your dreams|last=VSEVOLOD|first=PULYA|date=|website=Russia Beyond the Headlines|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ko Sai''' (เกาะทราย) is one of the gulf islands of [[Thailand]]. It lies on the west side of the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about 2&amp;nbsp;km off-shore.&lt;ref&gt;Hydrographic Service of the [[Royal Thai Navy]], Chart 001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Ko Sai is the largest of a group of three rocky islets also known as "Pran Rocks", off the fishing village of Khao Takiab, just south of [[Hua Hin]]. This area belongs administratively to [[Prachuap Khiri Khan Province]].

Ko Sai has a maximum length of 0.4&amp;nbsp;km and its highest point reaches 35 m. Ko Sai vaguely resembles a sitting lion when seen from shore. Local tour operators call it "Lion Island" (Ko Singto) and organize regular sightseeing and snorkeling excursions to visit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaotakiab.com/island-trip.htm Alternative names]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjacent islands===
Two smaller islets are close to Ko Sai:
*'''Ko Sadao''' (เกาะสะเดา), south of Ko Sai. Its highest point 15m. This island is called "Ko Tao" (Turtle Island) by the travel agencies in the area, but it should not be confused with [[Ko Tao]] in [[Surat Thani Province]].
*'''Ko Khi Nok''' (เกาะขี้นก), is the smallest of the group. It is just a few hundred metres to the east of Ko Sadao. This is the lowest island and its name in Thai means "[[Guano]] Island". Its highest point is only 3 m and, unlike the other two islets, it barely has any vegetation. Ko Khi Nok is called "Ko Nok" (Bird Island) by the local tour organizers, but like the other alternative names above, it is not to be found in official documents.

'''Laguna Socompa''' is a small lake in the [[Salta Province]] of [[Argentina]], at the foot of [[Socompa]] volcano. It covers an area of about {{convert|200|ha}} and has an average depth of about {{convert|0.45|-|0.62|m}}. The lake is fed by [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] and [[spring (hydrology)|springs]], some of which are [[hot springs]]. Its waters are very rich in [[arsenic]] and otherwise salty and slightly alkaline; these properties and the regionally high [[UV radiation]] give Laguna Socompa extreme environmental conditions.

The lake features the highest known [[Stromatolite|stromatoliths]] known on Earth, these are structures formed by microorganisms; stromatoliths were the dominant lifeforms on Earth recorded between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago and may give insight on [[Earliest known life forms|early life on Earth]]. These stromatoliths are found on the southern shore of the lake and led to Laguna Socompa being declared a [[protected area]].

== Geography and geomorphology ==

Laguna Socompa is located at an elevation of {{convert|3570|m}}{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=866}} in the [[Los Andes Department]] of the [[Salta Province]] in [[Argentina]], close to the border with [[Chile]]. A [[railway]] to the border with [[Chile]] passes east of Laguna Socompa; the Socompa [[railway station]] lies {{circa}} {{convert|10|km}} north-northwest of the lake and the Quebrada del Agua station northeast of the lake is even closer.{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=118}} The area is far away from any city or town{{sfn|Farías|Rascovan|Toneatti|Albarracín|2013|p=2}} but [[sodium sulfate]] was produced in the area of Laguna Socompa.&lt;ref name="Barrientos1998" /&gt; The lake was defined a [[protected area]] in 2011&lt;ref name="CONICET" /&gt; but is also in the area of the Socompa [[geothermal power]] [[Prospecting|prospect]].{{sfn|Lelli|2018|p=23}}

The lake covers a surface of about {{convert|200|ha}}{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=119}} and has the form of an "L" upside down and backwards. Its depth fluctuates between {{convert|0.45|-|0.62|m}}{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=118}} with lower water levels during December to May.{{sfn|Farías|Rascovan|Toneatti|Albarracín|2013|p=2}} The northwestern and eastern shores feature well developed [[wetland]] vegetation{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=118}} and are about {{convert|5|km}} long, while dry [[beach]]es are found elsewhere along the shore. Sandy-stony ground with [[bush (plant)|bush]] vegetation characterizes the surrounding landscape{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=119}} which is in general mountainous.&lt;ref name="Volante2012" /&gt; Reportedly, the area of the lake smells of [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="Gil2018" /&gt;

Some [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] enter into Laguna Socompa,&lt;ref name="CCdlP2018" /&gt; and on the eastern side water flows from the Quebrada del Agua spring towards the lake; part of its water is piped to an old [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] at the railway. Additional [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]]{{sfn|Lelli|2018|p=6}} occur around{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=119}} and within the lake. On the western-southwestern margins of the lake,{{sfn|Lelli|2018|p=6}} [[hot spring]]s with temperatures of up to {{convert|26|C}}{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=18}}-{{convert|27.5|C}} are found; volcanic activity represented by the Socompa volcano is responsible for heating the waters of the hot springs. The activity of the hot springs has resulted in the deposition of [[diatomite]]&lt;ref name="Volante2012" /&gt; and [[sodium sulfate]] along the shores.{{sfn|Lelli|2018|p=6}}

The waters of the lake are somewhat [[alkaline]],&lt;ref name="AlbarracínKraiselburd2016" /&gt; turbid, [[brackish]]{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=118}} to [[hypersaline]]{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=18}} and have a high [[arsenic]] content.&lt;ref name="Kurth2017" /&gt; The lakefloor is covered by material with a composition resembling [[brine]], [[clay]] and [[silt]].{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=119}} [[Oncolite]]s have also been reported from Laguna Socompa.&lt;ref name="Rizzo2015" /&gt;

The lake is situated at the foot of the active volcano [[Socompa]]&lt;ref name="AlbarracínKraiselburd2016" /&gt; within a depression at its foot; the depression was formerly a north-northwest trendig valley{{sfn|van Wyk de Vries|Self|Francis|Keszthelyi|2001|p=227}} before the volcano grew in the valley.{{sfn|van Wyk de Vries|Self|Francis|Keszthelyi|2001|p=228}} The volcano features steaming ground and [[fumarole]]s at its summit.{{sfn|Lelli|2018|p=23}}

== Climate and environment ==

The lake is part of the cold, dry [[Altiplano|Puna]] where temperatures vary strongly between day and night and precipitation only occurs in summer.{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=118}} In summer temperatures range between {{convert|20|-|-10|C}} and in winter they can drop to {{convert|10|-|-20|C}}.&lt;ref name="Kurth2017" /&gt; The region has the highest quantities of incoming solar radiation in the world, including the largest amount of [[UV radiation]].&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt;

The small lakes in the Puna desert are influenced by extreme environmental conditions such as large amounts of toxic elements such as [[arsenic]], high [[salinity]] and strong [[ultraviolet radiation]]&lt;ref name="OrdoñezLanzarotti2013" /&gt; as the [[ozone]] column is less dense at high elevations;{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=866}} these lakes in general receive more [[insolation]] than any other place on Earth.{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=865}} Because of the dry climate, most of the lakes lose water mainly through [[evaporation]] and thus tend to accumulate salt and arsenic.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=15}}

== Biology ==

Small lakes in the Puna are places where [[bird]]s concentrate in comparison to the surrounding environments. About 27 bird species have been observed at Laguna Socompa, including both [[Water bird|waterbirds]] and terrestrial birds, the most common are ''[[Anas flavirostris]]'' (Yellow-billed teal), ''[[Hirundo rustica]]'' (Barn swallow), ''[[Larus seranus]]'', ''[[Lessonia rufa]]'' (Austral negrito) and ''[[Lophonetta specularioides]]'' (Crested duck).{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=117}} Among mammals, [[vicuña]]s have been reported from Laguna Socompa.&lt;ref name="Diaz2000" /&gt; 

The vegetation in the wetlands around the lake is characterized by [[cyperaceae]] and [[graminaceae]].{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=119}} Underwater vegetation does not occur in Laguna Socompa owing to the brackish water.{{sfn|Vides Almonacid|1990|p=126}} There is little [[phytoplankton]] in the lake waters, mainly [[cyanobacteria]] and [[diatom]]s.{{sfn|Farías|Rascovan|Toneatti|Albarracín|2013|p=2}}

=== Microorganisms ===

Microorganisms who live in the lakes and wetlands of the dry Andes have to resist harmful environmental traits{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=15}} and thus become extremely hardy with e.g high UV radiation tolerance. They often also produce [[secondary metabolite]]s that are of interest to the industry, such as [[medicine]], [[Sunscreen|UV blocking]] and [[bioremediation]],{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=865}} which has spurned research in these extreme environments.{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=866}} Furthermore, they are considered to be potential counterparts to [[extraterrestrial life]] in light of the environmental conditions.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=14}}

Several microorganisms in the lake have been isolated and researched, with their [[genome sequencing|genomes sequenced]].&lt;ref name="AlbarracínKraiselburd2016" /&gt; Among these is ''[[Exiguobacterium]] sp.'' strain 17 which was first isolated in Laguna Socompa; its sequenced genome contains a number of genes involved in metabolizing arsenic and other toxic compounds and protecting and repairing the genome.&lt;ref name="Farias2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OrdoñezLanzarotti2013" /&gt; Other strains from Laguna Socompa whose genome has been sequenced are ''[[Salinivibrio]] sp.'' strain 34 and 35.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=23}}

=== Stromatoliths ===
[[File:Stromatolites Volcanic Lake.jpg|thumb|Photo of stromatoliths in Laguna Socompa]]
In 2009,&lt;ref name="ElUniverso2009" /&gt; researchers discovered the presence of [[Stromatolite|stromatoliths]] at Laguna Socompa;&lt;ref name="Poiré2014" /&gt; stromatoliths are layered structures formed by microorganisms when their metabolism causes the accumulation of minerals.&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt; These are the first stromatoliths found in Argentina{{sfn|Rasuk|Ferrer|Kurth|Portero|2017|p=866}} and the highest site where stromatoliths have been recorded;&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt; their existence was the reason why the lake was made a protected area.&lt;ref name="CONICET" /&gt;

{{Life timeline}}
The discovery of stromatoliths at Laguna Socompa and the extreme conditions that exist there offers insights into the development of [[Earliest known life forms|early life on Earth]]{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=14}} as microbe-formed structures like stromatoliths were the main traces of life from between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago before stromatoliths declined between 1 and 0.7 billion years ago{{sfn|Farías|Rascovan|Toneatti|Albarracín|2013|p=1}} due to the increased presence of burrowing and grazing lifeforms at that time.&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt; Previously stromatoliths were known mainly from marine and carbonatic environments such as in the [[Bahamas]], the [[Coorong National Park|Coorong Lagoon]] and [[Shark Bay]] in [[Australia]], the [[Lagoa Salgada]] in [[Brazil]] and the [[Laguna Bacalar]] in [[Mexico]]. The Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are the first to be discovered at elevations exceeding {{convert|3500|m}};&lt;ref name="Poiré2014" /&gt; the presence of active [[hot spring]]s may be responsible for their formation at Laguna Socompa.&lt;ref name="HovlandRuesåtten2018" /&gt;

These stromatoliths have a layered structure and cone-like shapes that sometimes overlap and then form large domes,{{sfn|Farías|Rascovan|Toneatti|Albarracín|2013|p=2}} unlike the bushy or crustose stromatoliths found elsewhere,&lt;ref name="Poiré2014" /&gt; and are found underwater on the southern shores of the lake, protected from the strong UV radiation.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=18}} They have a layered structure, with very different environments between the surfaces and the interiors of the individual stromatoliths.&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt; The UV protective [[carotenoid]] pigment [[deinoxanthin]] gives them a pink colour.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=21}} Unusually, some stromatoliths are formed out of [[halite]] rather than the more common [[aragonite]]/[[carbonate]]&lt;ref name="Poiré2014" /&gt; although aragonite and [[silica]] are their most important building materials.{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=18}}

The dominant bacteria in the stromatoliths are ''[[Microcoleus]]'' [[cyanobacteria]] and [[deinococci]] in the surface;{{sfn|Albarracín|Gärtner|Farias|2016|p=21}} there are also [[eukaryotic]] [[alga]]e, [[diatom]]s.&lt;ref name="Albarracín2012" /&gt; Other taxa include [[desulfobacterales]], [[rhodobacteraceae]] and [[spirochaetes]] and are mostly novel lineages of bacteria;&lt;ref name="AlbarracínKraiselburd2016" /&gt; the diversity of the lifeforms increases away from the surface and towards the interior of the stromatolith.&lt;ref name="Toneatti2017" /&gt; Some of the Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are classified as ''Conophyton'' stromatoliths, which are otherwise only known as [[Precambrian]] (over 541 ± 1 million years old&lt;ref name="ICC2018" /&gt;) fossils.&lt;ref name="Poiré2014" /&gt;

The terms '''''landwehr''''' ("land defence"), '''''landgraben''''' ("land ditch") and '''''landhege''''' ("land enclosure") refer to [[border|border demarcations]] or border defences and enclosures in Central Europe that were either built by settlements with the right of [[enclosure]] or to mark and defend entire [[territories]]. These measures, usually comprising [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]] or dykes as well as [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]] and impenetrable lines of hedging, for protecting towns and villages date mainly to the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]] and consist, in some cases, of systems over a hundred kilometres long. Comparable earthworks have been recorded since [[Ancient History|Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kollmann: ''Landwehren''. In: Romerike Berge. Solingen. 57. Jahrgang, 2007, Heft&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;27–41&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman ''[[limes]]'' are the best known examples of earlier ''landwehrs''. The [[Danewerk]] is another example of this type of barrier.

Many of these ''landwehrs'' have survived, especially in woods and forests, and are often protected as [[heritage site]]s.

== Purpose ==
The construction of a ''landwehr'' was an effective way of protecting the population of a [[human settlement|settlement]] or territory against attacks by neighbours or enemies in [[feud]]s or war, and also to mark out the legal limits of an area. The ''landwehrs'' were a means of limiting the likelihood, success, effectiveness, and consequences of medieval warfare, and thus preventing them. They also hindered bands of robbers entering the area and hampered their retreat after a raid. The combination of fencing and thorn bushes was also useful in enclosing cattle pasture and as a guideline in wolf hunting. [[Wolf pit]]s are often found along the line of a ''landwehr''.

''Landwehrs'' were also used to on a large-scale to enclose woods and agricultural areas for the protection of the local population, where they were settled in dispersed dwellings and farmsteads within the protected area. The ''landwehr'' offered protection for the peasantry, in a way analogous to the population of fortified towns who were guarded by a town wall. Often too, the fields and outlying areas surrounding many towns had a ring-shaped enclosure, a so-called ''Stadtlandwehr'' ("town Landwehr"), ''Stadthagen'' or ''Stadthege'' ("town enclosure"). An example of this is the Westphalian city of Dortmund, which, in addition to the city wall, also had a large ''landwehr'' surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Kneppe: ''Landwehren – Von der mittelalterlichen Wehranlage zum Biotop''; LWL Archäologie in Westfalen, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a map of 1748 portrays, Dortmund's [[Stone Tower (Dortmund)|Stone Tower]] was part of this ''landwehr'' ring.

The only gaps in ''landwehr'' defences were on roads entering the area where, like the gates in a [[town wall]], people and goods were checked as they passed through. For example, ''landwehrs'' often acted as effective customs posts, usually imposing a [[Road toll (historical)|road toll]].

[[Trade route]]s, particularly in the area of check points, were accompanied on both sides by ''landwehrs''. In addition to protecting travellers from ambushes, these ''landwehrs'' on either side of the route were mainly used to channel the flow of traffic and effectively prevent people bypassing or avoiding check points and customs posts.

== History ==
=== Pre- and early history ===
[[Hedge]]s are one of the most natural forms of boundary defence and enclosure. Their simplest and, even today, most common use is as a garden hedge. Even in [[prehistoric]] and [[early historic]] times, people built defensive enclosures using branches and [[brambles]] for the protection of storage places (including caves), fortified residences, houses, estates and settlements from attack by [[predator]]s or enemies. This is common even today amongst [[nomad]]ic tribes. [[Julius Caesar]] tells e.g. of thick ''Hagen'' which were laid out by the [[Nervii]], one of the most powerful [[Belgic tribe]]s:

{{blockquote|Having no strength in cavalry (for even to this day they care naught for that service, but all their power lies in the strength of their infantry), the easier to hamper the cavalry of their neighbours, whenever these made a raid on them, they cut into young saplings and bent them over, and thus by the thick horizontal growth of boughs, and by intertwining with them brambles and thorns, they contrived that these wall-like hedges should serve them as fortifications which not only could not be penetrated, but not even seen through.|from [[De bello Gallico]], Book&amp;nbsp;II, Chapter 17}}

A more complicated form of defence was the classic [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] and [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]] system. In A.D. 16, [[Tacitus]] reported a border fortification built by the [[Angrivarii]], the [[Angrivarian Wall]], which was erected to defend them against the [[Cherusci]]. A [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall|great battle]] was fought there in 16 AD. The most important border fortifications were said to have been at [[Rehburg-Loccum]].

The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' speaks of a Bebbanburg around A.D. 547, which was ''"first fortified by a hedge"''. The [[capitularies]] of [[Charlemagne]] also mention ''"ramparts planted with hedges"''.

In [[England]], similar fortifications are called "[[dyke (fortification)|dykes]]" or [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]]. For example, [[Bokerley Dyke]] was built around A.D. 360, transitioning into [[Grim's Ditch]] which dates to 300 B.C., or the 270-kilometre-long [[Offa's Dyke]].

In the case of the Normans, too, the existence of ''Hagediken'' - embankments planted with hedges - is recorded.

=== Middle Ages and Modern Period ===
[[File:Kircheip nach van der Weye.jpg|thumb|The ''landwehrs'' near [[Dreiherrenstein]] at [[Kircheib]] on a 1605 map]]

As a rule, mediaeval ''landwehrs'' consist of one or more impenetrable lines of hedging made of [[pleach]]ed [[European hornbeam|hornbeam]] – (the ''Gebück'') - underplanted with thorny bushes suchs as [[blackthorn]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[dog rose]], [[brambles]] or [[holly]] – (the ''Gedörn'').

In addition there was also usually a combination of one or more of the following elements:

* One or more parallel earthen ramparts between or on which the hedge was planted
* A path for the maintenance of the hedge and for patrolling the ''landwehr''
* Ditches in front, between and behind the ramparts, which were sometimes filled with water, depending on the location e.g. in a valley. As a rule, the ramparts were made from the excavation of the ditches.
* [[Watchtower]]s, ''[[schanzen]]'', [[abatis]] and ''haspels'' at the checkpoints where roads passed through the ''landwehr''
* A "wet border" created by flooding and water ditches

From the time after the [[Frankish colonisation]] of Central Europe until the late [[Late Middle Ages]], the creation of fixed sovereign territories ruled by lords and princes led to the establishment of territorial ''landwehrs'' which enclosed the land which was legally held by states and settlements. The territories of ''[[Gaue]]'', counties (''Zenten''), regional magistracies (often coterminous with church parishes), ''[[Ämter]]'' and even entire states were enclosed by ''landwehrs'' in the form of defensive hedges.

There were also ''Landhagen'' and ''Stadthagen'', which were arranged in a circular shape around smaller settlements. The ''Landhegen'' bordered and protected entire regions as well as the areas surrounding towns and cities, for example the almost 70-kilometre-long [[Aachen Landgraben]] the former [[Aachener Reich]], similar to the ones in [[Frankfurt Landwehr|Frankfurt]], [[Rothenburg Landhege|Rothenburg]], [[Lübeck]] or [[Mühlhausen, Thuringia|Mühlhausen]]. The traces of the [[Rothenburg Landhege]] are still about 60 km long today, the [[Mühlhäusen Landgraben]], still some 26 km long, recalls the border between Mühlhausen and [[Eichsfeld]].

These earthworks served several functions. They marked, protected and helped to bring peace to territories that were under their reeve (''Greve''), [[count]] (''Graf'') or ''[[Amtmann]]''. This grouping of tasks for the protection of defended territories (''Landwehr'') resonated with the term ''Hege'' (a range of measures concerning hunting and wildlife) in terms such as ''Hege, Heege, Hag, Haag'' or ''Hecke'', but also with the term ''Schutzhecke'' or "protective hedge". Numerous [[toponym]]s such as ''Zarge, Gebück, Wehrholz'' or ''Gehag'' recall different variants of these defensive structures as e.g. hedges, excavation works or staggered constructions.

The main objective of these barriers was to protect the population and their land from the hostile claims, raids, predations and warlike assaults of other princes. ''Landwehrs'' were a clear border marking and, at the same time, when they defined the external border to another territory, also a customs border. Even within a territory, there were sometimes ''landwehrs'' which separated the individual districts (''Ämter'') from one another by the inclusion of streams and other natural obstacles. These 'internal' or 'intermediate' ''landwehrs'' (''Zwischenlandwehren''), were generally not as elaborate as those on the external borders.

[[File:Näfels Letzimauer.JPG|thumb|Letzi in Näfels, Switzerland]]
One particular variant was the so-called ''[[letzi]]'' in Switzerland, where it was often sufficient just to secure the access routes to a valley. Many of the battles of the [[Old Confederation]] with the Hapsburgs took place at such ''letzis'', such as [[Battle of Morgarten]], [[Battle of Näfels]] and [[Appenzell Wars|Battle of Stoss]].

Some ''landwehrs'' also functioned as a form of outwork for [[fortress]]es. They were built with the character of [[fieldworks]] as a first line of defence against enemy attack. Used until the [[Modern Era]], they were designed militarily, in the form of [[chevaux de frise]], to force the  attacker of a fortress into having to conduct a [[siege]] even before reaching the fortress. Their modern successors include the [[barbed wire]] used in both world wars.

The route of many simple ''landwehrs'' shows, according to new research, that they were completely unsuitable for defence purposes in many places. From this it can be concluded that some of these installations were mainly used for border marking and collecting customs duties. They nevertheless restricted the free mobility of enemy troops, so that they were certainly of some military utility. For example, the ''Stadthagen'' around [[Warendorf]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]] succeeded in protecting the town. Although the enemy did in fact break into the municipal territory, they did not risk a major attack simply because of the danger, in a counter-attack, of not being able to beat a [[Retreat (military)|retreat]] quickly enough through the narrow breach in the ''landwehr''.

As a border fortification around areas that had been given specific rights, ''landwehrs'' had gaps  in some places for roads, for counter-attack routes or for trade. These gaps (called ''Schlags'') were guarded by simple [[tollgate]]s, by side roads (so-called ''Schlingen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zweischlingen.de/geschichte.htm# |title=Zweischlingen (near Bielefeld)) - History: The Landwehr in Zweischlingen |access-date=2017-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925203240/http://www.zweischlingen.de/geschichte.htm# |archive-date=2016-09-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), or - by means of towers ([[watchtower]]s, ''Wighäuser'' or [[gate tower]]s). At the border crossing points there were usually also [[customs post]]s. The lucrative right to charge tolls (''Zollrecht''), often in connection with the right to sell alcohol (''Krugrecht'') could be given to local farmers.

== Construction ==

Most ''landwehrs'' consisted of a simple ditch as an obstacle - on the plains this was also a water channel or [[moat]] - behind which was an earthen bank made of the spoil from excavating the ditch. Behind the bank was the main barrier itself, a 20 to 50 metre-wide, dense, impenetrable thicket. In  upland areas, the route of the ''landwehr'' conformed to natural features such as rocks, steep slopes and [[watercourse]]s. Often a second ditch was dug at a distance of 10 to 30 metres.

The strips of vegetation and the embankments were covered with a hedge of [[hornbeam]] cut back to the height of a man, whose branches were bent, [[hedge laying|intertwined]] with the other branches and stuck into the ground as a further obstacle. This resulted in the so-called ''Gebück'', a plaited hedge. Understorey bushes, such as [[dog rose]], [[Crataegus|whitethorn]], [[blackthorn]] or [[brambles]] , were used to make the hedge impenetrable. Hence the local name, ''Gedörn'' ("thorn hedge") used in some places. The site was kept clear of higher vegetation. The ground in front was largely cleared.

The construction of a defensive hedge was described by a priest at Eberbach Abbey in 1790:

{{quote|text=The structure was achieved as follows. Trees in the area were cut down to different heights and these were cut back again and their branches bent downwards. These branches continued to grow in their new direction and were closely interwoven, and this subsequently produced such a thick and tangled wilderness that it was impenetrable to men and horses.|author=''Pater Hermann Bär''}}

With regular maintenance and care (''hege''), a nigh impenetrable woodland strip was created in the course of a decade. More elaborate ''landwehrs'' with a defensive function consisted of several parallel ditches and banks, planted with hedging. In particular, double ditches were designed to prevent them from being jumped by horsemen. Another design was the so-called ''Wehrhecke'' (''Wallhecke'' or ''Knick''), a hedge-planted bank, for the maintenance of which a tax called ''Knickgeld'' was raised.

In [[Hesse]], at the end of the 17th century, many villages on important roads or by borders, had  fortifications, excluding any [[fortified church]]es, as a Hessian chronicler described in 1697:

{{Quote|text=Today is almost the majority of large districts and villages in Hesse are surrounded by a moat and embankment / so that they can defend themselves against minor attacks.|author=Johann Just Winkelmann.}}

The fortification could be made of fences (known as ''Etter'' or ''Dorfetter''), hedges, bank and ditch (dry as well as wet) and gates.

Another temporary artificial obstacle which could be built relatively quickly in the event of an attack, or to close gaps in a ''landwehr'', was the [[abatis]]. This was also used as the first obstacle on the approach of castles, town and city walls, and ''[[schanzen]]'', and was made of felled trees and cut logs, shrubs and thorns. Abatis were also used during the building of a ''landwehr'', if necessary, until it was ready. Since the obstacle was made of dead wood, it was relatively easy to remove by burning once it had dried out.

Important roads passing through the ''landwehr'' at entry points were guarded with so-called barriers (''Schlägen'') and other reinforcements such as [[watchtower]]s. Road tolls were collected at the barriers which were paid to the territorial lord. From the beginning there were [[inns]] at these points. The innkeepers provided food and drink for the passers-by. They also exercised sovereign functions by observing the ground in front of the town and by closing the barriers at night.

In many cases, the roads were flanked by ditch-bank-ditch systems on both sides, so that no one could enter the villages outside the intended route. Wooden bridges often led across the ditches, so that in the event of a war, the road could be closed by removing the bridge.

News of approaching enemy troops or visitors, was relayed along the ''landwehrs'' to the Hinterland, using watchtowers (for example, in [[Münsterland]]). In upland regions this was also achieved by observation posts (''Warten'') at high lookouts from which one could see far into the surrounding countryside. Warning of approaching enemies was given by optical signals in the form of smoke signals, flags, mirrors and torches, or by signal horns and [[church bell]]s. The entire population of the village and its neighbouring villages were required to "immediately" respond to these emergency signals or the sounding the storm bell, but also in other emergencies, such as fire or flood, no matter what other work or activity was in progress. The striking of the bell was called ''Gerüfte'', for example, in the Münsterland.

== Maintenance ==
[[File:Warturm.JPG|thumb|[[Speyer Watchtower]], formerly ''Wormser Warte'', northernmost point of the Speyer ''landwehr'', to the west beyond the crossing is the start of the Landwehrstraße, which runs southwestwards.]]
To construct the ''landwehr'', the local territorial lord would use all his subjects in a service known as [[socage]]. Likewise the whole population were required to maintain it. Many ''landwehrs'' were built and maintained jointly by neighbouring princes, for example, in Central Hesse, the ''landheege'' on the ''Hörre'' between the county of Nassau on one side and the Landgraviate of Hesse and county of Solms on the other.

The construction and maintenance of ''landwehrs'' had to be carried out with a long-term perspective. Even with constant and time-consuming care (''Hegen und Pflegen'') it would be ten years before an impenetrable hedge was created. In addition, the ditches and ''Hählweg'', a patrolled road along the ''landwehr'' had to be kept free of vegetation and maintained in working order. For this reason, many ''landwehrs'' were abandoned or left unfinished for long periods of time for reasons of cost.

Intentional damage of a ''landwehr'' was punished with severe penalties. In the case of the over 100-kilometre-long Westphalian Landwehr in the [[Teutoburg Forest]], punishments ranged from cutting off the right hand to the death penalty. Even crossing a ''landwehr'' in authorised places  was often punished. On the [[Rhön]] Landwehr, cutting through the hedging or using the patrol road was punishable by a fine of up to five [[guilder]]s.

These border installations were constantly renewed and maintained until the 18th century and, in times of extreme danger, even reinforced and turned into fortifications.

In 1813 in [[Prussia]], the obligation to defend the earthworks, which were slighted under [[Napoleon]] but nevertheless remained functional, became part of the general service duties of the military formations of the Prussian [[Landwehr]] (a territorial force not to be confused with the subject of this article). In many cases the field fortifications of the Landwehr troops were abandoned after the end of an armed conflict or after the abolition of an official district, and the hedges and woods burned to make [[charcoal]].

The '''Lašva Valley''' ({{lang-sh|Lašvanska dolina}}/Лашванска долина) is a 17 kilometers long valley in [[central Bosnia]], defined geographically by the [[Lašva|Lašva River]]'s route. It is a tributary of the [[Bosna River]]. The Lašva River basin covers the territory of four municipalities: [[Travnik]], [[Novi Travnik]], [[Vitez]] and [[Busovača]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/119695 3 Pogodnost zemljišta Lašvanske doline za voćarsku proizvodnju]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
===Ancient times===

The favorable geographical position of the Lašva Valley enabled the beginning of civilization along the [[Lašva|Lašva River]].  However, due to the unprotected and open area numerous occupiers chose the mountainous regions to protect themselves.  The earliest known remnants of civilized people were the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].  Romans were adapt to the terrain and surrounding because of military might, which was of the utmost importance for survival.

Due to the presence of the [[Lašva|Lašva River]] many settlers began to exploit it for economic benefits.  They began trading goods which traveled from [[Travnik]] to [[Vitez]].  In addition to the river, the mountainous regions offered [[mineral deposits]] which in turn attracted even more settlers.  Remnants have been found belonging to the Romans in [[Turbe (Travnik)|Turbe]] and [[Mosunj]], where a settlement named [[Bistue]] is thought to have existed.&lt;ref&gt;Vitez Web. Lasvanska Dolina i njena  proslost. Retrieved August 8, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://vitezweb.com/lasvanska%20dolina.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721000732/http://www.vitezweb.com/lasvanska%20dolina.htm |archivedate=2008-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Ottoman period===

The name "Lašva" was first used as a regional term in the 13th century. [[Béla IV of Hungary]] first mentioned the area in his charter on 20 April 1244, which he issued to gain political favor from Pope Innocent IV by launching and winning the war against the ''[[Bosnian Church|Bosnian heretics]]'', as he called them. In the charter there is a mention of three [[Roman Catholic]] churches existing in the Lašva Valley{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, although only one can be confirmed by the gifting of the [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] [[Ban (title)|Ban]] [[Matej Ninoslav|Matthew Ninoslaus]] in 1250. 

The Lašva Valley is thought of having its own seat of power before the arrival of the [[Franciscans]] in the 13th century.  Their subsequent establishing of [[Vukarija]] in 1340 was the first officially known seat of power in the valley.  The [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] [[Vukarija]] had, according to the [[friar]] [[Bartolomej Polanski]] (1385/1390), [[monasteries]] in [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]], [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Lašva]] and [[Olovo]].  Therefore, the Lašva Valley was an occupied and developed region not unlike other parts of [[Bosnia]].

"Lašva" is only mentioned once in the 15th century by King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]] on 5 September 1425.  On that date the king rewarded his son the [[Paku]] estate in the county of [[Vuku]] for his loyalty to the king which he earned through battles against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In the book "[[Roots and Life]]," translated from "Korijeni i Život," the advent of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] expansion is mentioned.  "The coming of the [[Ottomans]] and their military victories at [[Jajce]] in 1463 saw the putting out of fire in chimneys at age old houses and churches.  With the arrival of the new oppressive and bloodthirsty masters from the [[East]], people began to flee over the borders to the south and north, while others sought refuge in mountains led by the [[Franciscans]]."

The last battle against Ottoman expansion in the Lašva Valley was lost on May 1463, when [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] on his return from [[Jajce]] defeated the last [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] king [[Stephen Tomašević]] at [[Milodraž]] in today's [[Brestovsko]]; located between [[Kiseljak]] and [[Busovača]].&lt;ref name="Vitez Web. August 8, 2008"&gt;Vitez Web. August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Period===
[[Image:Adhanema Lasva.jpg|100px|right|thumb|The [[Ahdname]] issued by [[sultan]] [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet]] instituting religious freedom in Bosnia.]]

Upon the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|Ottoman conquest]], the plaintiff of the [[Franciscans]] [[Anđeo Zvizdović]] advised the [[Sultan]] to stop forcing the people of [[Bosnia]] to flee because of [[religious persecution]].  Which, if continued, would lead to the eventual downfall of properties and infrastructures.  The [[Sultan]] agreed and issued the [[Ahdname of Milodraž]] in 1463 decreeing freedom of religion for the [[Roman Catholic]] population. 

Due to the sheer size of the [[Ottoman Empire]] [[jurisdictional]] and [[government]] overseeing was not a possibility, since the capitol [[Istanbul]] was long ways away.  [[Bosnia]] was used as a launching state for other wars, which consequently transformed the land into a military occupying region.  Most of the peoples along with the [[Franciscans]] sought to distance themselves from the Ottoman settlements, many times living in impoverished conditions.  New [[monasteries]] were not allowed to be built on the foundation of old ones and consequently only three remained at; [[Fojnica]], [[Kreševo]] and [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]].

At the dawn of Ottoman rule, the Lašva Valley began to be called "nahija Lašva," which was centered at [[Travnik]]. As a result, [[Travnik]] began to grow and emerge as an integral part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s jurisdiction over the Lašva Valley and [[Bosnia]].&lt;ref name="Vitez Web. August 8, 2008"/&gt;

===Post-Ottoman Period===

The Lašva Valley, as well as [[Bosnia]], was emancipated from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control in 1878 and entered a new phase in its history under [[Austro-Hungarian]] rule.  The area saw a reemerging of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] populations with overall improvements in infrastructures.  The modernization of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] rule transformed the Lašva Valley into a capable area worthy of competing against larger and more established regions.  The 19th century also saw the materialization of [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[nationalism]] along with the idea of a united South Slavic state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Modern Day===
The region saw fierce fighting between the [[Croatian Defence Council]] and the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] during the [[Croat-Bosniak War]]. Today the region is recovering from the war and has emerged as an economic powerhouse in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with cities such as [[Vitez]] leading the way.

The '''Lomond Hills''' (meaning either beacon hills or bare hills),&lt;ref name="glasgow.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fife-placenames.glasgow.ac.uk/placename/?id=949|title=Fife Place-name Data :: Lomond|website=fife-placenames.glasgow.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known outwith the locality as the '''Paps of Fife'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goddessalive.co.uk/issue16/scotland.html Stuart McHardy, ''The Goddess in the Landscape of Scotland''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529153618/http://www.goddessalive.co.uk/issue16/scotland.html |date=2011-05-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glasgow.ac.uk"/&gt; lie in western central [[Fife]] and [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Scotland]]. At 522m West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife.

==Natural geography==

The Lomond Hills contain two prominent peaks, [[West Lomond]] and East Lomond (or Falkland Hill) (448 m), which lie at either end of an [[escarpment]] roughly 6.5&amp;nbsp;km in length. The escarpment, made from beds of [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] and [[quartz-dolerite]], rises gradually from the south to a plateau of around 350 m in height between the peaks of East and West Lomond. To the north and west, this plateau terminates in steep and, in places, cliffy scarp slopes. From its western end, the escarpment continues southwards beyond the deep valley of the Glen Burn (Glen Vale) to Bishop Hill (461 m). The steep-sided peaks of East and West Lomond themselves are [[volcanic]] in origin. Along the edges of the sandstone bed at the foot of the scarp slopes are several strangely eroded outcrops, the most famous of which are the [[Bunnet Stane]] and [[John Knox's Pulpit]], so named because it is believed to be a spot where [[covenanter]]s held [[conventicle]]s in the 17th century. There are also strange outcrops in the [[columnar jointing]] at the edge of the dolerite sill on Bishop Hill, most notably [[Carlin Maggie]].

The [[River Eden, Fife|River Eden]], one of the two primary rivers in Fife, has its source on the slopes of West Lomond. On the northern slopes of the Lomond hills, two burns run down from the plateau in impressive gorges. These are the Maspie Burn and the Arraty Burn. Maspie Den has a path running along its length to an undercut waterfall at the top, which can be accessed just beyond Falkland House (approaching from the Falkland direction). Glen Vale with the Glen Burn, to the south of West Lomond, is equally impressive.

==History==

The Lomond Hills have a rich and varied history. From the [[Iron Age]] are the remains of several [[hill forts]], which can be found around the summits of both East and West Lomond as well as at Maiden Castle, a grassy knoll that lies between the two.

In more recent history, the Lomond Hills were mined for limestone, [[ore]] and lead, although there are no longer any working quarries there today. On the southwest slopes of East Lomond are the well preserved remains of a [[limekiln]] and quarry (in which the fossilised remains of prehistoric sea creatures can be found).

Both East and West Lomond can easily be climbed from Craigmead Car Park, which lies between the two at a height of around 300m. Alternative routes exist from the [[Bunnet Stane]], the village of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] and the car park at the masts, high on East Lomond. The views from both summits, due to their prominence, are magnificent, stretching from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], with the sea in the east.

Beneath the northern slopes of the escarpment lies Falkland Estate, an area of forest (now commercial plantation), where the kings of Scotland would have hunted whilst staying at nearby [[Falkland Palace]]. The present custodian of the palace is Ninian Crichton-Stuart, brother of the Marquess of Bute.

==The Lomond Hills today==

Due to the steep gradients and poor soil, the primary land uses on the Lomond Hills are sheep grazing and commercial forestry (predominantly on the steep north slopes) and water catchment. There are six reservoirs in the Lomond Hills that were originally constructed to supply water to the rapidly growing mining towns of west Fife.

The Lomond Hills lie within the boundaries of '''Fife Regional Park''', renamed the '''Lomond Hills Regional Park''' in 2003, and have their own ranger service who work principally with the landowners, estate managers and farmers on issues such as public access to help minimise the impact of recreational activities on their day-to-day business. The park covers approximately 65 square kilometres and is divided as follows: 1,120 hectares of land is in public ownership: 500 hectares belong to Fife Council and 620 are owned by Scottish Water. The balance of 5,355 hectares is privately owned.

As a result of their accessibility and proximity to several major population centres, the hills are very popular with walkers. This has resulted in a considerable amount of footpath erosion, particularly on the steeper sections, that the ranger service and volunteer workers are taking measures to counteract.

As well as walking, there are a number of more unusual recreational activities that take place in the Lomonds. East Lomond, due to the easy access from the high car park, is often used by [[paragliding|paragliders]] on windy days. The Falkland Hill Race is held annually and begins at the fountain in the centre of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] village. The competitors must run (or in many cases walk) to the summit of East Lomond before returning to the fountain. The wooded northern slopes of East Lomond also boast a series of downhill mountainbike tracks.

Gliders from the Scottish Gliding Centre at Portmoak between Bishop Hill and Loch Leven may be seen riding the thermals above the hills.

'''Mam Tor''' is a {{convert|517|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} hill near [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] in the [[Peak District National Park|High Peak]] of [[Derbyshire]], England. Its name means "mother hill",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castleton.co.uk/Mam_tor.aspx|title=Mam Tor (Shivering Mountain)|publisher=Peak Hideaways|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because frequent [[landslide|landslips]] on its eastern face have resulted in a multitude of "mini-hills" beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/mam-tor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302112627/http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/mam-tor |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 March 2009 |title=Mam Tor |publisher=National Trust |accessdate=9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These landslips, which are caused by unstable lower layers of [[shale]], also give the hill its alternative name of Shivering Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mtKvnPNNKTcC&amp;pg=PA11 ''Natural Curiosities of Derbyshire''], in: ''The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion. Vol III.'', ed. William Hone, (London: 1838) p&amp;nbsp;11–16. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the continual battle to maintain the [[A625 road]] ([[Sheffield]] to [[Chapel en le Frith]]) on the crumbling eastern side of the hill was lost when the road officially closed as a through-route.

The hill is crowned by a late [[Bronze Age]] and early [[Iron Age]] [[univallate hill fort]], and two Bronze Age [[bowl barrow]]s.&lt;ref name="nhle"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1011206 |desc=Slight univallate hillfort and two bowl barrows on Mam Tor|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the Tor and nearby are four show caves: [[Blue John Cavern]], [[Speedwell Cavern]], [[Peak Cavern]] and [[Treak Cliff Cavern]] where [[lead]], [[Derbyshire Blue John|Blue John]], [[fluorspar]] and other minerals were once mined.

[[Simon Jenkins]] rates the panorama from [[Kinder Scout]] to [[Stanage Edge]] as one of the top ten in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/countryside/10341432/Our-glorious-land-in-peril.html |title=Our glorious land in peril |first=Simon |last=Jenkins |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Mam-tor-from-castleton.jpg|thumb|Mam Tor dominates the skyline west of [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]]]] 
Mam Tor is on the southern edge of the Dark Peak (sandstones) and overlooks the White Peak (limestones), including the notable dry gorge of [[Winnats Pass]]. It is a dominating link between the eastern end of [[Rushup Edge]] and the western end of the [[Great Ridge]], which together separate the [[Hope Valley, Derbyshire|Hope Valley]] to the south from [[Edale]] to the north, and is a popular ridgewalk.

Mam Tor is made of rocks of [[Carboniferous]] age, approximately 320 million years old. The base of Mam Tor is composed of black [[shale]]s of the [[Bowland Shale Formation]] of [[Serpukhovian]] age overlain by [[Turbidite|turbiditic]] [[sandstone]] of the Mam Tor Sandstone Formation of [[Bashkirian]] age.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, C. N. and Davies S. J. (2006) ''Carboniferous: extensional basins, advancing deltas and coal swamps'' – Chapter 9 of  Brenchley, P. J. and Rawson P. F. (editors) (2006) ''The Geology of England and Wales'', 2nd edition, London, The Geological Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mam Tor landslide==
[[File:SubsidedRoad.jpg|thumb|Section of the abandoned road]]

The most notable feature of Mam Tor is the active [[landslide]] which invades its southeast side almost to the summit, and interrupts the ramparts of the hillfort, unless its builders used it as part of the defences. This rotational landslide began roughly 4,000 years ago. The toe is a [[debris flow]]. The landslide is due to weak [[shales]] underlying [[sandstones]], a common phenomenon all around the Dark Peak, notably at [[Alport Castles]], [[Longdendale]], [[Glossop]] and [[Canyards Hills]], Sheffield. Indeed, three larger landslides occur on the north side of Mam Tor, one of them cutting the main ridge at Mam Nick which allows a minor road over into Edale; another creates the striking crag of Back Tor well seen from Mam Tor.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R. and Jarman, D. 2007. Mam Tor, in Mass Movements in Great Britain, JNCC, 167–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the continued movement of the slide mass is demonstrated graphically by the severe damage to the old [[Mam Tor road]] that traversed this flow. The road was built at the beginning of the 1800s and was subsequently relaid until local authorities closed it in 1979. Layers of tarmac and gravel are up to {{convert|2|m}} thick in places, demonstrating the numerous efforts to keep the road open. A short tunnel could readily have been made avoiding the landslip zone, but the opportunity to exclude heavy business and lorry traffic from the middle of the National Park was preferred. A local diversion for light vehicles follows the limestone gorge of Winnats Pass. This is one of the most extreme cases of geological problems affecting main transport systems in Britain, comparable with the railway at [[Dawlish#Transport|Dawlish]].

Current mean annual movement is "up to 0.25 m; this increases greatly when winter rainfalls exceed thresholds of both 210 mm/month and 750 mm in the preceding six months".&lt;ref&gt;Waltham &amp; Dixon (2000), ''Movement of the Mam Tor landslide, Derbyshire, UK'', The Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, Volume 33, Number 2, May 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–123(19)&lt;/ref&gt; The debris flow poses no threat to any inhabited buildings; however, small farm buildings lying in the flow's path may soon be overwhelmed assuming a flow rate similar to that of the present. The 2000 study suggests that deep drainage may be the most effective means of stabilising the flow, though this may not completely stop movement.

==Prehistory==
The [[topographical summit|summit]] of Mam Tor is encircled by a late [[Bronze Age]] and early [[Iron Age]] [[univallate hill fort]]. [[Radiocarbon]] analysis suggests occupation from around 1200 BC. The earliest remaining features are two Bronze Age burial mounds, one just below the summit and the other on the summit itself, though now buried under the paving. At a later stage over a hundred small platforms were levelled into the hill near the summit, allowing inhabited timber huts to be constructed. The hill fort and burial mounds are a Scheduled Ancient Monument.&lt;ref name="nhle" /&gt;

There is also a prehistoric ridgeway track leading from the summit of the hill heading south, and can be traced to the suburbs of Nottingham. It passes by Burr Tor and [[Fin Cop]], two other significant late Bronze Age/early Iron Age hill forts in the area, and also passes through the villages of [[Wardlow]], [[Ashford-in-the-Water]] and [[Wirksworth]]. Much of it can still be walked today as for much of its length it is followed various modern roads.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The '''Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape''' (MLW) is an ecologically sensitive [[Landscape ecology|landscape]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] within the  [[Maringa River|Maringa]] / [[Lopori River|Lopori]] basin.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}
Since 1973 a Japanese team has been researching the [[bonobo]] population near the village of [[Wamba, Luo Reserve|Wamba]], and the [[Luo Scientific Reserve]] was established in 1990.
However, research was discontinued after political disorders started in 1991 followed by civil war in 1997, resuming only in the mid-2000s.{{sfn|Kimura|2009|pp=209-225}}

==Location==

The Maringa-Lopori-Wamba (MLW) forest Landscape covers {{convert|74000|km2|sqmi}} in north-central Democratic Republic of the Congo.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}
The human population as of 2007 was estimated to be 586,732 inhabitants with a density of 8 inhabitants/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
There were 2-4 inhabitants/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the proposed or existing protected areas and 31.8 inhabitants/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the proposed Sylvo-Agro-Pastoral zone.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=331}}

==History==

[[File:Congo concessions.JPG|thumb|Congo Free State concession companies, [[Abir Congo Company|ABIR]] shown in dark red]]
{{main|Abir Congo Company}}

The local populace in the MLW were [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[cassava]] farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and [[pygmy]] hunters.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=125}} 
In 1885 a force of the [[Manyema]] people, followers of [[Tippu Tip]], the [[Swahili people|Swahili]]-[[Zanzibar]]i slave trader, arrived at the head of the Lopori River from [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]]. 
They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for [[ivory]]. By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=126}}

The Belgian administrators of the [[Congo Free State]] were concerned by this development, and, in 1889, enacted the Monopoly Act, which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. 
The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at [[Basankusu]], in May 1890.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=126}}  
The entire basin was under Free State control by 1898.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=128}}
The Free State started to levy taxes, payable in ivory, but which soon switched to wild rubber.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=126}}
By September 1892, the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the [[Lulonga River|Lulonga]] and Maringa river valleys in order to expand its tax base.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=128}}
[[File:ABIR company posts.svg|thumb|ABIR company posts within the concession]]
The concession to farm rubber was granted to the [[Abir Congo Company]], which established its headquarters at Basankusu, in 1893.
Its position at the confluence of the Maringa and Lopori, allowed ABIR to expand along these rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=79}}
The company established posts throughout the region, staffed by agents who were mainly paid on commission and used brutal methods to force the villagers to pay their rubber taxes. 
The effort of rubber collection did not leave enough time for farming, and the villagers began to suffer from malnutrition and starvation. Fatal diseases, such as [[Smallpox]] and [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping Sickness]], also spread in the region. To save time, harvesters resorted to cutting down the rubber plants to obtain their sap.
Reports of abuses led the Free State to conduct investigations into Abir's conduct, and, in 1905, to take back the concession.
Soon after, with no remaining plants, the rubber tax was abolished.{{sfn|Harms|1983|p=79-88}}

==Threats==

The MLW Landscape is in one of the least developed and most remote parts of the Congo Basin. 
The inhabitants are among the poorest in Africa, depending on natural resources to meet their basic needs.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}
Most of the people live by [[slash-and-burn agriculture]], and rely on [[bushmeat]] such as [[porcupine]], [[sitatunga]], and [[forest hog]] for protein.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=331}}
Cash crops include [[maize]], [[cassave]] and [[groundnuts]].{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=332}} 
The growing population is placing more stress on the environment, and there is risk of a revival of [[logging]] that could harm the ability of the land to sustain the people and could jeopardize biodiversity.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}

Local and international institutions headed by the [[African Wildlife Foundation]] (AWF) have recently started developing a sustainable land use plan for the MLW. The plan aims to ensure that the economic and cultural needs of the inhabitants are met while conserving the environment.
The approach combines AWF's Heartland Conservation Process and the [[Central African Regional Program for the Environment]] (CARPE) Program Monitoring Plan.
A variety of tools are used including surveys, interviews with local people and satellite image interpretation.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}

'''Maud Rise''' ({{coord|66|S|3|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an [[oceanic plateau]] located in the [[Southern Ocean]]. Its name was approved by the [[Advisory Committee for Undersea Features]] in June 1987.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{cite gnis | type = antarid | id = 17142| name = Maud Rise | accessdate = 2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
Maud Rise formed part of the south-eastern African [[large igneous province]] (LIP) which developed south of Africa {{Ma|100|94}} (Ma).  This LIP first formed 140-122 Ma east of South Africa where the [[Mozambique Ridge]] is now located.  There it reached a maximum extent around 120 Ma when the [[Southwest Indian Ridge|African-Antarctic spreading zone]] was located below its eastern flank.  [[Astrid Ridge]] was possibly part of this LIP as well.&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Grobys|2011|loc=Timing and extent of Large Igneous Province formation, pp. 384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LIP formation then continued intermittently until it finally reached its maximum extent south of South Africa 100 Ma.  This volcanism ended 94 Ma after which sea-floor spreading divided the LIP into the [[Agulhas Plateau]] (south of South Africa), [[Northeast Georgia Rise]] (near [[South Georgia Island]] off South America), and Maud Rise.&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011" /&gt;

'''Mount Hawu''' is a small mountain located in Padalarang district in [[West Bandung Regency]], [[West Java]], Indonesia. [[Padalarang, West Bandung|Padalarang]] is renowned for its towering limestone mountains. One of the most popular among local climbers is the cliff of Hawu Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merahputih.com/post/read/yuk-liburan-seru-anti-mainstream-di-tebing-gunung-hawu&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Hawu cliff is located behind the [[Citatah Cliffs|Citatah 125 meters cliff]], another famous cliff among local climbers, or commonly called the Cretaceous Singgalang. To reach it, visitors have to walk around 30 minutes from Citatah cliff.{{cn|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Mount Hawu View.jpg|left|thumb|411x411px|The view around Mount Hawu, Padalarang, West Java]]
Hawu is derived from Sundanese which means a place for firewood or traditional "stove" for cooking commonly used by the local. The name comes from Mount Hawu shape that has a large hole in the middle part and hollow on the upper part.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Unfortunately, this shape that fits the name of Hawu can only be seen from the front section of Hawu mountain, or precisely from the Cidadap village. Visitors who come from behind mount Hawu or from Pamucatan village cannot see this shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogoga.blogspot.co.id/2013/01/info-jalan-jalan-ke-gunung-hawu.html|title=Info Jalan-jalan ke Gunung Hawu|website=blogoga.blogspot.co.id}}{{better source|reason=blogs are not reliable sources, see [[WP:RS]]|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Hawu is one of the [[limestone]] cliffs that belong to Citatah [[karst]] area with an area around one hectare wide. This mountain special feature is its natural bridge that occurs due to the process of vertical cave formation. The cave itself is called Karang Hawu Cave. This [[natural bridge]] is similar to the natural bridge in America, such as Virginia natural bridge and Arches National Monument in Utah. But ironically, the beauty of this limestone mountain is threaten by the presence of massive lime [[mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.co.id/2015/10/11/mongabay-travel-asyiknya-bermain-sekaligus-konservasi-di-tebing-padalarang/|title=Mongabay Travel : Asyiknya Bermain Sekaligus Konservasi Di Tebing Padalarang  – Mongabay.co.id|website=www.mongabay.co.id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolay Kolosovskiy''' (19 September 1891 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1954) was Russian and Soviet economic geographer, economist, one of founders of the Soviet Rayon (Regional) school of economic geography.

== Biography ==

Kolosovskiy was born in a family of [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair]] employee. In 1916 he graduated from [[Petersburg State University of Means of Communication|Petersburg University of Means of Communication]] and worked at construction of railways in [[Transbaikal]] region.

In years 1921-1931 he worked in [[Gosplan]] where was engaged in division of USSR into economic districts, working out of schemes of studying and development of resources of [[Siberia]] and the Far East (Uralo-Kuznetsk industrial complex, the Trans-Siberian superhighway, Angarostroi).

In years 1931-1936 Kolosovskiy worked in [[Hydroproject]], where he developed the project of power-industrial complex at [[Angara]] river. In years 1936-46 he worked in Soviet Academy of Sciences. During World War II he supervised war industries expansion in Ural, and decision of the transport problems connected with it. He was awarded [[Stalin prize]] in 1942.

== Scientific and teaching activity ==

After the end of war Kolosovsky has concentrated on teaching. He was the professor of [[Department of Economic And Social Geography of Russia]] [[MSU Faculty of Geography]], where he taught since 1931. He also taught at [[Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy]]. It were the author's course of lectures on economic division into districts is created, the conceptual device Soviet Rayon (Regional) school of economic geography economic geography is developed.

Kolosovskiy has entered such concepts into scientific practice as the power-production cycle (set of the manufactures united by communications on raw materials and energy), a territorial and production complex (set of manufactures from which placing on one platform additional economic benefit is reached).

== Former administrative boundaries ==
[[File:Oblast changes overview2.jpg|thumb|Change of oblast names and boundaries from 1954 to today]]
Over the last 60 years, both the distribution and names of regions of Kazakhstan have changed considerably. Major changes were several fusions and splits between Guryev and Mangystau, Karaganda and Dzhezkazgan, Almaty and Taldy-Kurgan, East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk and Kostanay, Turgay and Tselinograd, respectively. Changes in region names were often in line with the renaming of cities, such as in the case of Alma-Ata/Almaty. After the administrative reform in 1997, the last change happened since then took place in 1999, when parts of North Kazakhstan that originally belonged to Kokshetau region became part of Akmola. The 1990s merges were in order to dilute Russian population in the resulting region and to avoid having regions where Russians form a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/commentary/2016/08/25/ru-64345/j3vs|title=Три угрозы для Назарбаева: насколько стабилен Казахстан|last=Bologov|first=Pyotr|date=25 August 2016|publisher=carnegie.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Marine Sulphur Queen''''', a [[T2 tanker]] converted to carry molten [[sulfur|sulphur]], noted for its disappearance in 1963 near the southern coast of Florida, taking the lives of 39 crewmen.

In the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the ship was unsafe and not seaworthy, and never should have sailed. The final report suggested four causes of the disaster, all due to poor design and maintenance of the ship. The loss of the ship was the subject of lengthy litigation between the owner and families of the missing men.

Despite the clear cause of the disaster, an inaccurate and incomplete version of the ship's disappearance is often used to justify [[Bermuda Triangle]] conspiracies.

== History ==
The vessel, originally named '''SS ''Esso New Haven''''', was built by [[Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]], [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]], in March 1944, one of many T2 tankers built to carry and transport oil. In 1960, she was placed in dry dock by [[Bethlehem Steel Company]], [[Sparrows Point]], [[Maryland]], converted to carrying a cargo of molten sulphur, and given a name change to ''Marine Sulphur Queen''. In order to carry out the planned function of carrying molten sulphur, a continuous, independent tank 306 feet long, 30 feet 6 inches wide and 33 feet high was constructed out of the original holds, necessitating the removal of all transverse bulkheads in the original centerline tanks and modifying the internal structure; this tank in turn was divided into four smaller tanks internally. A void surrounded the tank on all sides, leaving a 2-foot clearance on the sides and bottom, with three feet left between the top and the ship's weather deck.&lt;ref name="pacbell1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/cgreport.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103209/http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/cgreport.html |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A steam system was installed throughout to maintain the molten sulphur at roughly {{convert|255|°F|°C}}.

The ship's last voyage began on 2 February 1963 out of Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of sulphur weighing 15,260 tons. On 4 February, near Florida, an ordinary radio message was sent by a crewman, giving the position of the ship at {{coord|25|45|N|86|00|W|name="''Marine Sulphur Queen''"}}. ''Marine Sulphur Queen'' was listed as missing on 6 February. A search of the [[Straits of Florida]] where the ship was believed to have gone down was called off after 19 days, after yielding life preservers and some debris, but no trace of the ship or the 39 men aboard her. At the time of her 4 February position, she was in rough, nearly-following seas of 16 feet, with northerly winds of 25–46 knots.&lt;ref name="pacbell1"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[Image:Msq1.jpg|right|thumbnail|The remains of the SS Marine Sulphur Queen, recovered by the US coast guard]]
A [[Coast Guard]] investigation concluded several facts about the ''Marine Sulphur Queen'' which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and along the sides of the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.

The Coast Guard also noted that the T2 tanker class had a characteristic that it has a "weak back", meaning the keel would split at a point weakened by corrosion, usually around midships. Such a splitting had happened on several T2 tankers, and many were discovered during inspections to have hairline or larger fractures within the keel and on major frames. Companies who owned T2 tankers were ordered to pay attention to the keel when inspecting. Former crewmen also testified that corrosion was everywhere, mentioning inoperable temperature gauges, a ruptured steam coil, and worn packing around the screws. It was recorded that ''Marine Sulphur Queen'' was scheduled for a drydock inspection in January 1963, but it was postponed by the owners, who had complained that cargo deliveries were behind and they needed their ships to catch up. One new crewman, on reporting to the ship just before it sailed for the last time, turned to his wife and pronounced it "a floating garbage can."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120912115201/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,896573,00.html Investigations: The Queen with the Weak Back]. ''TIME'' (8 March 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing of the inquiry the Coast Guard had this to say:

:"1. In view of the vast search operations conducted and the debris found and identified as coming from the MARINE SULPHUR QUEEN, the ship and her entire crew of 39 men are presumed to be lost.

:2. Concurring with the Board, the vessel apparently was lost on 4 February 1963 on its approach to, or in the vicinity of, the Straits of Florida.

:3. Further concurring with the Board, in the absence of survivors or physical remains of the ship, the exact cause of the loss of the MARINE SULPHUR QUEEN cannot be determined.

:4. The Board considered many possibilities which may have caused the loss of the ship and rightly declined to assign any order of probability to these causes. In its conclusions the Board commented on the following possible causes:
::a. An explosion may have occurred in the cargo tanks.
::b. A complete failure of the vessel's hull girder may have caused it to break in two 
::c. The vessel may have capsized in synchronous rolling 
::d. A steam explosion may have occurred as the result of a rapid filling of the void space with water.
::The record contains ample evidence to support the Board's suppositions ."

The Coast Guard also recommended that no remaining T2 tanker be converted into a sulphur carrier without taking into consideration the structure of the ship as originally built. "First, the acceptability of any conversion must be considered on its individual merits, having regard for the existing condition of the vessel and the proposed cargo, route, and service. Secondly, the objection to the conversion of an existing T2 or another tanker of comparable age is associated with the probable condition of the vessel, particularly the cargo portion, due to age, as much as it is due to design considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/remarks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514204012/http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/remarks.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Litigation ==
The loss of the ship was subject of a lawsuit filed within weeks of the sinking by relatives of the crew members seeking 2.5 million dollars in damages under two specific federal acts (the [[Jones Act of 1920|Jones Act]], [[Title 46 of the United States Code|46 U.S.C.]] § 688; and the [[Death on the High Seas Act]], 46 U.S.C. § 761), based upon maritime laws regarding the unseaworthiness of a vessel. Marine Sulphur Transport Corporation (the owners of the ship), and Marine Transport Lines, Inc. (demise charterer) petitioned for exoneration or at least a limitation of liability. The amount of damages sought would grow to $20 million by 1969.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|United States Court of Appeals (2nd Circuit)]] concluded that:
*the ship was not structurally sound as a result of the sulphur tank conversion;
*the tank was centered too narrowly within the ship resulting in a high center of gravity, which meant that during a roll in heavy seas, it would take longer to recover.
*the ship was not properly inspected nor maintained by the owners;

In its 25 April 1972 ruling the court denied the exoneration of the owners and found them liable in regard to the unseaworthiness of the ship. It awarded damages to the crew relatives, but denied them punitive damages; the reason for it, as stated in the Coast Guard report, was that no one knew how the ship was lost, and in the absence of the remains of the vessel, they could go no further:

"The wrongful death claimants therefore sustained their burden of proving unseaworthiness and there remained only the issue of whether or not one or more of the conditions of unseaworthiness or some other agency caused the disaster. The court found in explicit terms that 'no one knows how the ship was lost.' The resolution of the question of liability will, under the circumstances, be determined by the allocation of the burden of proof on the causation issue, the existence of a rebuttable presumption and whether or not that presumption has been met." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/court.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514214641/http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/court.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedent ==
[[Image:TankerSchenectady.jpg|right|thumbnail|T2 tanker [[SS Schenectady|SS ''Schenectady'']], showing her bad keel.]]

Nearly 20 years prior to the loss of the ''Marine Sulphur Queen'', the United States General Accounting Office published a report titled ''TO INQUIRE INTO THE DESIGN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION OF WELDED STEEL MERCHANT VESSELS, 15 July 1946'', which was essentially a report of concern over civilian merchant ships, specifically T2 tankers, fracturing amidships at the keel. Even during World War II, the federal government was concerned over the large number of merchant ship casualties not resulting from combat, and investigation centered on possible shoddy construction.

A sister ship, SS ''Sylvia L. Ossa'', went down in heavy seas east of Bermuda on 15 October 1976; all that was recovered was debris and a lifeboat in which the quick-release mechanism was still intact.

== Bermuda Triangle connection ==
The loss of the ship and crew with no trace other than bits of debris placed it on the list of incidents in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Writers of the subject have placed this ship in every work, sometimes agreeing with the Coast Guard report, other times coming up with their own theories. Vincent Gaddis was the first writer to coin the name ''Bermuda Triangle'' in his article for ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' Magazine in the February 1964 issue, and ''Marine Sulphur Queen'' was the first Triangle "victim" he mentioned, barely a year after the ship sank:

''"With a crew of thirty-nine, the tanker Marine Sulphur Queen began its final voyage on 2 February 1963, from Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of molten sulphur. Its destination was Norfolk, Virginia, but it actually sailed into the unknown..."''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.smu.edu/~pseudo/BermudaTriangle/vincentgaddis.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddis himself gave no theory as to the sinking, and ignored the many physical and personnel discrepancies cited by the Coast Guard. What he did was to reduce the loss of the ship to sailing "into the unknown", as did many writers after him. The effect was to leave an aura of mystery, and as such, many theories, some very outlandish, have been postulated to explain the disappearance of the ship.

The [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] posted a summary of its program ''The Bermuda Triangle: Startling New Secrets'' on its website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/trianglesecrets/timeline/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829032050/http://www.scifi.com/trianglesecrets/timeline/index.html |date=29 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it said that all that was recovered was a lifeboat. The Coast Guard had listed all that was recovered and identified for its report, as well as assembling the items for public display during the inquiry, which was photographed. A lifeboat was not among the debris, nor was one recovered.

A 1977 episode of ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search Of]]'' discussed the ''Marine Sulphur Queen'' incident.

'''Selfoss''' is a [[waterfall]] on the river [[Jökulsá á Fjöllum]] in the north of [[Iceland]].  The river drops over a number of waterfalls over about 30 km before flowing into Öxarfjörður, a bay of the Arctic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the edge: Extreme kayakers who laugh in the face of the world's most powerful waterfalls|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155371/Over-edge-Extreme-kayakers-dice-death-plummet-precipice-worlds-powerful-waterfalls.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river originates as melt water from the [[glacier]] [[Vatnajökull]] and therefore the water flow varies depending on the season, the weather and [[volcano|volcanic activity]].&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunrise on the Selfoss waterfall|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/photo-contest/2011/entries/108425/view/|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic Magazine]]|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few hundred meters downstream of the ''Selfoss'' waterfall ({{convert|11|m}} high), the [[Dettifoss]] waterfall is situated, the most powerful waterfall in [[Europe]]. The river falls {{convert|44|m}} over a width of {{convert|100|m}}. Below the falls, the river passes through a gorge which is part of the [[Jökulsárgljúfur National Park]].

'''Soufrière Estate''' (jointly controlled with '''Diamond Estate'''), located on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Saint Lucia]], was originally established in 1713 as a {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate granted to three Devaux brothers for services to [[King Louis XIV]] of France. Later on, mineral springs were discovered and were used as restorative baths by the French soldiers . In 1784, the Baron de Laborie, the French Governor of St Lucia, sent samples of the water to Paris for testing and it is believed to be good for rheumatism and skin complaints.

In the wars following the French Revolution, the baths fell into disuse and it was not until the 1930s when Andre duBoulay, the owner of Soufrière and Diamond Estates restored the baths for his private use. When his daughter Joan Devaux took over the management of the estate in 1983, she opened it up to the public seeing the tourism potential of the estate.

The Diamond Botanical Gardens (also known as the [[St. Lucia Botanical Gardens]]) is a {{convert|6|acre|m2|adj=on}} area planted within the estate and includes Diamond Falls. There is a river running through the estate called Diamond River, it is black through the volcanic mud and there are mineral deposits on the river's banks.

There are also nature trails as well as a watermill constructed in 1765. It was originally built to crush sugar cane, but more recently it was used to provide hydroelectric power for [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]].

It isn't clear whether the north-south divisions are common, or are ad-hoc for the particular sources (Panwar, for example, writes "for the sake of convenience the state [of West Bengal] has been divided into two parts: north Bengal and south Bengal"). Moreover, the sources don't agree about which districts are in the north and which are in the south. According to Christiana, for example, Murshidabad is in North Bengal, not South. --&gt;

'''Strategic geography''' is concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the [[national security|security]] and prosperity of [[nation]]s. Spatial areas that concern strategic geography change with human needs and development. This field is a subset of [[human geography]], itself a subset of the more general study of [[geography]].  It is also related to [[geostrategy]].

Strategic geography is that branch of science, which deals with the study of spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of a nation.

[[Fiji]] has no [[area codes]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.countrycallingcodes.com/country.php?country=Fiji%20Islands&lt;/ref&gt; and no leading trunk "0". The first digit of the number indicates usage or location.

All telephone numbers are seven digits long.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtocallabroad.com/fiji/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile telephone]]s are also seven digits long and begin with a 7,9,8 or 2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtocallabroad.com/fiji/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international access code]] is 00 or 052 depending on whom it is routed through: 00 is through FINTEL and 052 through Telecom Fiji.

'''RÉSO''', commonly referred to as '''The Underground City''' ({{lang-fr|La ville souterraine}}), is the name applied to a series of interconnected office towers, hotels, shopping centres, residential and commercial complexes, convention halls, universities and performing arts venues that form the heart of [[Montreal]]'s [[central business district]], colloquially referred to as [[Downtown Montreal]]. The name refers to the underground connections between the buildings that compose the network, in addition to the network's complete integration with the city's entirely underground [[rapid transit]] system, the [[Montreal Metro]]. Moreover, the first iteration of the Underground City was developed out of the open pit at the southern entrance to the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], where [[Place Ville Marie]] and [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]] stand today.

[[Image:Montreal 11 db.jpg|thumb|right|The lower floors of the [[Montreal Eaton Centre|Eaton Centre]] between the [[McGill (Montreal Metro)|McGill]] and [[Peel (Montreal Metro)|Peel]] Metro stations]]
Though most of the connecting tunnels pass underground, many of the key passageways and principal access points are located at ground level, and there is also one skybridge (between [[Lucien-L'Allier station (Montreal Metro)|Lucien-L'Allier Metro station]] and [[Lucien-L'Allier station (RTM)|Gare Lucien L'Allier]]). In this regard, the Underground City is more of an indoor city (ville intérieure) than a truly subterranean city, although there are vast commercial sectors located entirely underground.

The network is particularly useful during Montreal's long winters, during which time well over half a million people are estimated to use it every day. The network is largely climate controlled and well-lit, and is arranged in a U-shape with two principal north–south axes connected by an east–west axis. Combined, there are 32 kilometres' worth of tunnels over twelve square kilometres of the most densely populated part of Montreal. In total, there are more than 120 exterior access points to the network, not including the sixty or so Metro stations located outside the official limits of the RÉSO, some of which have their own smaller tunnel networks. Some of the city's larger institutions, namely [[McGill University]], the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Concordia University]] and the [[Université de Montréal]], also have campus tunnel networks separate from the Underground City.

==Overview==

In 2004, the downtown network of the underground city was re-branded and given the name '''RÉSO''', which is a [[homophone]] of the French word ''réseau'', or network. The "O" at the end of the word is the logo of the Montreal Metro. Schematic maps bearing the RÉSO logo are found throughout the network. The largest and best-known segment is located in the centre of downtown, delimited by the [[Peel (Montreal Metro)|Peel]] and [[Place-des-Arts (Montreal Metro)|Place-des-Arts]] Metro stations on the [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|Green Line]] and the [[Lucien-L'Allier (Montreal Metro)|Lucien-L'Allier]] and [[Place-d'Armes (Montreal Metro)|Place-d'Armes]] stations on the [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange Line]].

The underground city is promoted as an important tourist attraction by most Montreal travel guidebooks, and as an urban planning achievement it is impressive. For most Montrealers, however, it tends to be considered more as a large mall complex linking Metro stations&amp;nbsp;— they may not even know they are in it. Many Canadian cities have some kind of tunnel or skywalk system downtown to help people avoid the weather. Most parts of the Montreal underground city are open while the Metro is in operation (5:30 AM to 1:00 AM), though some are closed outside of business hours. Maps of the underground city and the Metro can be obtained free of charge from all Metro stations, and the network of buildings is indicated on most maps of the downtown core.

Nearly 500,000 people use it per day. It is also the largest underground complex in the world. It stretches for 32 kilometers (20 miles) and covers 4 million square meters. According to official statistics, its corridors link up with 10 metro stations, 2 bus terminals, 1,200 offices, about 2,000 stores including 2 major department stores, approximately 1,600 housing units, 200 restaurants, 40 banks, 40 movie theatres and other entertainment venues, 7 major hotels, 4 universities, Place des Arts, a cathedral, the Bell Centre (home of the Montreal Canadiens), and 3 exhibition halls: the Place Bonaventure, the Convention Centre (Palais des Congrès de Montréal) and the Olympic Centre.

==History of the central segment==

The vision for the underground city was originally that of [[urbanist]] [[Vincent Ponte]], for whom a commemorative plaque was unveiled in November 2006 at Place Ville-Marie.&lt;ref name=Founder&gt;{{cite web | title = Un hommage à l'initiateur du Montréal souterrain | publisher = Médias Transcontinental S.E.N.C. | date = 2006-11-19 | url = http://www.levm.ca/article-53263-Un-hommage-a-linitiateur-du-Montreal-souterrain.html | access-date = 2007-08-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063600/http://www.levm.ca/article-53263-Un-hommage-a-linitiateur-du-Montreal-souterrain.html | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first link of the underground city arose with the construction of the [[Place Ville-Marie]] office tower and underground [[shopping mall]], built in 1962 to cover an unsightly pit of railway tracks north of the [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]]. A tunnel linked it to Central Station and the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]].

The advent of the [[Montreal Metro]] in 1966, in time for [[Expo 67]], brought tunnels joining [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure]] station to the Château Champlain hotel, the Place du Canada office tower, [[Place Bonaventure]], Central Station, and [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]], forming the core of the Underground City. [[Square-Victoria-OACI (Montreal Metro)|Square-Victoria-OACI station]] connected to the Tour de la Bourse, Montreal's [[stock exchange]] building.

Adding to the development of the underground city was the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission's policy of offering the aerial rights above Metro station entrances for construction through [[emphyteutic lease]]s, an advantageous way to acquire prime real estate. When the Metro began running in 1966, ten buildings were already connected directly to Metro stations; development would continue until only three free-standing station entrances ([[Square-Victoria-OACI (Montreal Metro)|Square-Victoria-OACI]], [[Saint-Laurent (Montreal Metro)|St-Laurent]] and [[Place-des-Arts (Montreal Metro)|Place-des-Arts]]) remained in the central segment.

In 1974, the [[Complexe Desjardins]] office tower complex was constructed, spurring the construction of a "second downtown" underground city segment between [[Place-des-Arts (Montreal Metro)|Place-des-Arts]] and [[Place-d'Armes (Montreal Metro)|Place-d'Armes]] station, via Place des Arts, [[Complexe Desjardins]], the Complexe [[Guy Favreau]] federal government building, and the [[Palais des congrès de Montréal|Palais des Congrès]] (convention centre).

Between 1984 and 1992, the underground city expanded, with the construction of three major linked shopping centres in the Peel and McGill Metro station areas: Cours Mont-Royal, Place Montréal-Trust, and the [[Promenades Cathédrale]] (built underneath [[Christ Church Cathedral (Montreal)|Christ Church Cathedral]]). McGill station was already linked with [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]], [[Eaton's]] (now the [[Complexe Les Ailes (Montreal)|Complexe Les Ailes]]), [[Centre Eaton (Montreal)|Centre Eaton]], and two other office/mall complexes. Between 1984 and 1989, the underground city grew from {{convert|12|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of passages to almost {{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

Mega-projects added to the size throughout the 1990s, including Le [[1000 De La Gauchetière]] (the tallest building in Montreal), [[1250 René-Lévesque Ouest|Le 1250 René-Lévesque]], and the [[World Trade Centre Montreal|Montreal World Trade Centre]]. Although these buildings have only a secondary commercial sector, they use their connection to the underground city as a selling point for their office space. Also, the construction of a tunnel between Eaton Centre and [[Place Ville-Marie]] consolidated the two central halves of the underground city. The construction of the [[Bell Centre|Bell (originally Molson) Centre]] connected Lucien-L'Allier Metro station to the underground city, as well as replacing Windsor Station with the new [[Lucien-L'Allier (AMT)|Gare Lucien-L'Allier]] commuter train station.

[[Image:ville-souterraine-2.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The tunnel between the Centre CDP Capital and the Palais des Congrès. A display case sponsored by the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] holds a [[video art]]work about the underground city.]]

Finally, in 2003, the complete redevelopment of the [[Quartier international de Montréal]] consolidated several segments of the central underground city with continuous pedestrian corridors. The construction of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] headquarters joined [[Place Bonaventure]] to [[Square-Victoria-OACI (Montreal Metro)|Square-Victoria-OACI]] station, which in turn was joined to the [[Palais des congrès de Montréal|Palais des Congrès]] and [[Place-d'Armes (Montreal Metro)|Place-d'Armes]] station via the new [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec|Caisse de dépôt et de placement]] building and a tunnel under [[Place Jean-Paul Riopelle]]. Uniquely, the new tunnel sections in the Quartier International contain educational and artistic displays sponsored by major Montreal museums. As a result of this construction, one can now walk all the way across the centre of downtown, from the [[UQAM]] Sherbrooke Pavilion at the corner of Sainte Famille Street and [[Sherbrooke Street]] to the [[Lucien-L'Allier (Montreal Metro)|Lucien-L'Allier]] Metro station just south-west of the [[Bell Centre]], without going outside&amp;nbsp;— a span of {{convert|1.7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} as the crow flies, or approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} walking distance.

===Structural concerns, 2007 closure===

On Friday, August 24, 2007, construction crews discovered a seven-meter-long fissure in the ceiling of an underground corridor linking the [[McGill (Montreal Metro)|McGill]] station to [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|The Bay]] store located under [[de Maisonneuve Boulevard]], between Aylmer Street and Union Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=8c820fb4-b9ef-42d7-aa3f-2de729468063&amp;k=80190 |title=City core in chaos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827101435/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=8c820fb4-b9ef-42d7-aa3f-2de729468063&amp;k=80190 |archive-date=2007-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The station, the Underground City shops, and above ground streets and buildings were closed to assess whether there was any risk of collapse of the structure.  Service on the [[Montreal Metro|Métro]] [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|Green Line]] was halted between [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri-UQAM]] and [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel-Groulx]] stations until Sunday evening.  According to a spokesperson for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], city workers may have caused the damage by hitting a nearby pillar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20070825/CPACTUALITES/70825003/6730/CPACTUALITES Sara Champagne, Bruno Bisson et Martin Croteau : Le centre-ville paralysé | Actualités | Cyberpresse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the weekend, city workcrews worked non-stop to shore up the sagging slab of concrete, installing more than one thousand temporary metal supports.

On Monday, August 27, 2007, service was restored to the Green Line, and all streets but the block of de Maisonneuve boulevard between Union and Aylmer were reopened to traffic. The one block that was not open to traffic was open to pedestrians. All buildings reopened, including The Bay.

==Central segment==
The central segment interconnects the following seven Metro stations via indoor walkway. As the [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri-UQAM]] station, which allows transfers between the [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|Green]], [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange]] and [[Line 4 Yellow (Montreal Metro)|Yellow]] lines, is two Metro stops from the closest station in this segment, in many cases it is quicker to walk than to take the Metro. The lists of connected facilities which follow are grouped by segment and nearest Metro station.

[[File:WesternAustraliaMap.png|thumb|Western Australia highlighted within Australia.]]
The '''Western Australian border''' was originally designated as [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]] (129° east). However, the border marked on the ground is some distance from this line.&lt;ref name=notstraight&gt;{{cite conference | title=An Historical Perspective – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A. Division | accessdate=15 January 2012 | author=Porter, John, Surveyor-General of South Australia |date=April 1990 | conference=National Perspectives – 32nd Australian Surveyors Congress Technical Papers 31 March – 6 April 1990 | location=Canberra: The Institution | pages=18–24 | publicationdate=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kununurra]] is the closest town to the Western Australian border, being about 25&amp;nbsp;km west of the border. The closest settlement is [[Border Village]], 1,734&amp;nbsp;km to the south on the South Australian side of the border, on [[Eyre Highway]].

==Border delineation==
The Western Australian (WA) border marked on the ground, is not as straight as it looks on a map. The [[Northern Territory borders|Northern Territory border]] with Western Australia and the [[South Australian borders|South Australian border]] with Western Australia are displaced east–west by approximately 127 metres, due to errors within the limits of surveying technology available in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=notstraight /&gt;

Where Western Australia meets the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) and [[South Australia]] (SA) borders is a 127-metre segment running east–west along the [[26th parallel south]] [[latitude]] (26° south).&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

In June 1968, two monuments were erected to mark each end of this 127-metre segment, At the easternmost of these concrete [[Boundary marker|border markers]] all three borders meet, at [[Surveyor Generals Corner]].&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Australia history.gif|right|thumb|250px|Map showing the creation of the colonies/states and mainland territories.]]

===1788–1825===
In 1788 [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] claimed the continent of Australia only as far west as the [[135th meridian east]] (135° east) in accordance with his commission.&lt;ref name="NAA1787"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | title = Governor Phillip's Instructions 25 April 1787 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195616/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | archivedate = 15 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#26 January 1788|26 January 1788 – MAP]])

It has been suggested that the 1788 claim by the British of 135° east was in reference to [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] claims under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].  Spain was seen as no longer having an interest in the area.  On the other hand, the other signatories to the treaty, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] still had a presence in [[Macau]] and [[East Timor]].  Adoption of 135° east as a boundary would minimise provocation of the Portuguese.  By 1825, however, Britain was powerful enough and found it convenient to adopt the original line of the Portuguese under the treaty, 129° east.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web |last = Brown |first = A.

===1825–29===
The line of 129° east first became a border in Australia as the western border of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) in 1825 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#16 July 1825|16 July 1825 – MAP]]).

On 16 July [[1825 in Australia|1825]], the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated at 129° east to take in the new settlement at [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]].&lt;ref name="TaylorP118"&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor

From 1825 to 1829 129° east was the NSW border, except that the settlement of [[King George's Sound]], now [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], was part of New South Wales from its establishment on 26 December 1826, until 7 March 1831 when it was made part of the Swan River Colony.&lt;ref name=srnsw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517;jsessionid=A40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |title=King George's Sound Settlement |work=State Records |publisher=[[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120618/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517%3Bjsessionid%3DA40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1829–32===
Following the settlement of the [[Swan River Colony]] (SRC) in [[1829 in Australia|1829]] ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#2 May 1829|2 May 1829 – MAP]]), the eastern boundary was declared to be 129° east, that is coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time.&lt;ref name="NAA1831transcript"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/wa5i_doc_1831.pdf | title = Transcript of Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | format = pdf| work = Documenting a Democracy  | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swan River Colony, started in 1829, was commissioned as the colony of Western Australia in March [[1831 in Australia|1831]].&lt;ref name="NAA1831"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | title = Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207042047/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | archivedate = 7 February 2008 | df = dmy-all }} found cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1829 to 1832 129° east was the SRC/NSW border.

===1832–46===
The name of the Swan River Colony changed to Western Australia in 1832 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|6 February 1832 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1832 to 1846 129° east was the WA/NSW border.

===1846–47===
In 1846 the colony of North Australia (NA) was proclaimed by Letters Patent, which was all of New South Wales north of 26° south.

From 1846 to 1847 129° east was the WA/NA border north of 26° south and the WA/NSW border south of the 26th parallel.

===1847–60===
In 1847 the colony of North Australia was revoked and reincorporated into New South Wales. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|15 April 1847 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|Territorial evolution of Australia – 15 April 1847]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1847 to 1860 129° east was once again the WA/NSW border.

===1860–63===
In 1860 South Australia, which had been proclaimed a colony in 1836 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#28 December 1836|28 December 1836 – MAP]]), west to the [[132nd meridian east|132° east]], changed their western border from 132° east to 129° east ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|1860 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1863 129° east was the WA/NSW border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1863–1911===
In 1863 that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia by Letters Patent and became known as the Northern Territory of South Australia (NToSA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|6 July 1863 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 July 1863]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1863 to 1911 129° east was the WA/NToSA border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel

===1911–27===
In 1911 the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) was split off from South Australia to be administered by the Commonwealth. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|1 January 1911 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 January 1911]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1911 to 1927 129° east was the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1927–31===
In 1927 the Northern Territory was split into two territories, [[North Australia (territory)|North Australia]] (NA) and [[Central Australia (territory)|Central Australia]] (CA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|1 March 1927 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 March 1927]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixing the position of the border of Western Australia on the ground has a rich history. In March 1920 the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]], [[H. B. Curlewis]] gave a talk at the WA Museum about the history of the determination of [[longitude]], in relation to using what was at that time a new technology, by using [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] to determine the position of the border between South Australia and Western Australia, as close to the 129th east meridian as possible.&lt;ref name="curlewis-talk"&gt;

Preliminary work on the border determinations began in November [[1920 in Australia|1920]] when the [[South Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis met at [[Deakin, Western Australia]] on the [[Trans-Australian Railway|East-West Trans-Australian Railway]].&lt;ref name="scientific-interest"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The other members of the party were Messrs. [[Clive Melville Hambidge]] and J. Crabb, of the Survey Department; Warrant Officer V. D. Bowen, in charge of wireless apparatus lent by the Defence Department; and Mr. C. A. Maddern, of the [[Adelaide Observatory]], all from Adelaide.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concrete piers for the astronomical observing instruments were erected in readiness for the final determinations that were to be held in 1921. Observations were made for the purpose of testing under field conditions the instruments and methods to be used in 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

This expedition, to determine 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved the cooperation of the [[Astronomer Royal]] and the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], with [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the [[:fr:Observatoire de Lyon|Lyons astronomical observatory (Observatoire de Lyon)]] at [[Saint-Genis-Laval]], near [[Lyon, France|Lyons, France]], between 17 and 24 November 1920. Wireless time signals were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide sidereal clock to be used as a control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

After these initial tests a comprehensive program was then arranged for the second stage of the border determinations, which were to take place during the following year and dates were then set for that to happen, from 20 April to 10 May 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

=====Deakin Pillar=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
One of the concrete piers mentioned, which were cubic concrete blocks slightly smaller than a cubic metre, would later be named as the Deakin Pillar (1921), being from where the larger border marker, the Deakin [[Obelisk]] (1926), would be set out from.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

=====Deakin Obelisk=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
The Deakin Pillar is approximately 2.82&amp;nbsp;km west of the Deakin Obelisk. The Deakin Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of [[1926 in Australia|1926]] to 129° east.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Deakin Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisk, which determines, on the ground, the South Australian border with Western Australia by a line drawn south to the coastline of the [[Great Australian Bight]] and north through this point to 26° south.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
Shortly after the [[1921 in Australia|1921]] determinations of the border of South Australia and Western Australia, the Government Astronomer for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis and party travelled by the [[State Shipping Service of Western Australia|State Ship]] Bambra to the port of [[Wyndham, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;

&lt;!-- Name the other party members? --&gt;
From Wyndham they were guided by [[Michael Durack|Michael Patrick (&amp;quot;M.P.&amp;quot;) Durack]] to a point he perceived as the northern boundary between his [[Argyle Downs]] Station and Jack Kilfoyle's Rosewood Station, which was also Western Australia's border with the Northern Territory or 129° east.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt; Most of Rosewood station is in the Northern Territory but some distance further south Rosewood also extends into the East Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

From the chosen position, two concrete pillars were erected similar to those described above and portable radio masts set up, before the determinations were carried out by the scientists using the same methods of wireless time signals as were used at Deakin.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt;

=====Austral Pillar=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
One of the concrete pillars erected, which was the one used as the point of the determinations, was marked by the expedition party to show how far east of Greenwich they were in hours, minutes and seconds, and became known as the Austral Pillar.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Austral Pillar, the point selected for the scientific determinations of 1921 would later be found to be about 2&amp;nbsp;km east from the border of 129° east on that part of Rosewood Station, therefore inside the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

=====Kimberley Obelisk=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
The Kimberley Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of 1927 to 129° east. Over several weeks during [[1927 in Australia|1927]], a Western Australian [[Surveying|survey]] crew from the WA [[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia|Department of Lands and Surveys]] travelled to Wyndham, then to the Austral Pillar site to set out from that point to the border, where they then erected the much more substantial Kimberley Obelisk.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Kimberley Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top of the concrete obelisk, which officially determines the WA/NT border on the ground, near 129° east, by a line drawn north to the northern coastline near the [[Joseph Bonaparte Gulf]] and south through this point at the Kimberley Obelisk to the 26th parallel.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;
