The '''2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting''' resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least fifteen others at the Tel Aviv branch of the [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Israeli LGBT Association]], at the "Bar-Noar" ({{lang-he|ברנוער}}, "Youth Bar"), on Nahmani Street in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]], on 1 August 2009. A 26-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were killed.&lt;ref name="Hunt still on for TA gay center shooter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1248277947570&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Hunt still on for TA gay center shooter |date=2 August 2009 |publisher=''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; Three deaths were mentioned in earlier reports of the incident but one has since been discounted.&lt;ref name="Police hunt killer of Israel gays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8180173.stm|title=Police hunt killer of Israel gays|date=2 August 2009|publisher=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802100413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8180173.stm|archivedate=2 August 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three killed in Tel Aviv shooting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/middle-east/three-killed-in-tel-aviv-shooting-1849435.html|title=Three killed in Tel Aviv shooting|date=2 August 2009|publisher=independent.ie|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the injured were minors;&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; six were in serious condition. The city was subject to a "clampdown" after the attacks, and several hundred police launched a manhunt to locate the killer(s).&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5701V520090801|title=Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths|date=2009-08-02|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Hagai Felician was charged over the murder, but the Police retracted its allegations in March 2014, after revealing its key witness fabricated evidence.&lt;ref name="HF"/&gt;   

The shooting sparked widespread condemnation, with one lawmaker calling it the worst attack against the gay community in Israel's history. The location of the attack—at the heart of what is seen as Israel's most liberal city— resulted in protests by the gay community.&lt;ref name="Gay group killings prompt Israeli protests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5701V520090802|title=Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the police had yet to apprehend the shooter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/prison-allows-homosexual-conjugal-visit-for-first-time/ Israeli prison allows homosexual conjugal visit for first time], 25 April 2017 Sue Surkes, Times of Israel&lt;/ref&gt;
==Shooting==
[[File:Tel Aviv gay center shooting memorial.jpg|thumb|Cactus and Succulent plants memorial garden, near the gay center of Tel Aviv, in memory of Liz Troubishi and Nir Katz,  murdered  in the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. The plants were donated from the private garden of Eli Troubishi, Liz's father]]
On the evening of August 1 at around 23:00, an unknown person with firearms entered the [[Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association|Aguda]] building in [[Tel Aviv]], opened fire on the crowd attending a "Youth Get Together" event, and immediately escaped by foot. Two people were killed, and fifteen were wounded. Police launched a search campaign to find the shooter, and in addition immediately closed most entertainment locations for the gay community that operated during the same time of the shooting for fear of additional shooting.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

The building was frequented by gay teenagers who engaged in social activities and listened to music.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt; The centre was small with one terrace, thus preventing anyone from escaping. Attendees instead hid under a bed and tables as shots were fired.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt; Israeli television said the crime scene was a "bloodbath".&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt; Five of the injured were treated at [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]], while five were treated at [[Wolfson Medical Center]] in [[Holon]].&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104624.html|title=Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooter was masked, dressed in black and used a pistol to carry out the attack.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills 2 at Tel Aviv club for gay youths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pistol"/&gt; It was not believed his motive was related to nationalist terrorism.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; The city's gay community stated the killer had a homophobic motive, while police criticized them for rushing to make declarations about incitement being the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/police-source-we-have-lead-in-gay-lesbian-center-killings-1.281263]&lt;/ref&gt; Police were also investigating leads that the attack may have been due to a personal feud.&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1105047.html 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting report], ''Haaretz''; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manhunt===
A manhunt was immediately launched in an attempt to locate the gunman.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"/&gt; Roadblocks were set up in the city.&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-israel-shooting2-2009aug02,0,1458101.story|title=Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=chicagotribune.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074147/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-israel-shooting2-2009aug02,0,1458101.story|archive-date=2009-08-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police shut down all other gay clubs and buildings that had homosexual connections near the crime scene immediately after the shooting in case there were further attacks.&lt;ref name="Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104506.html|title=Two killed in shooting at Tel Aviv gay center|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt; Hundreds of police officers were conducting street and door-to-door searches in the city.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

Police soon discarded the possibility that the shooting was a terror attack.&lt;ref name="pistol"&gt;{{Citation|last=Boudreaux|first=Richard|title=Israeli gays left feeling vulnerable|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publication-place=Los Angeles, California|date=3 August 2009|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/03/world/fg-israel-attack3| accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reenactment===
Police in Tel Aviv accompanied a teenaged survivor of the attack to the basement to conduct a reenactment on 3 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Police conduct reenactment of Tel Aviv gay attack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418522966&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Police conduct reenactment of Tel Aviv gay attack |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2009 |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The dead were named as 26-year-old Nir Katz from [[Givatayim]] and 17-year-old Liz Troubishi from [[Holon]]. One 16-year-old victim spoke of his fear that the shooting would cause an effect of enforced [[Coming out|outing]] as parents find out their children are gay for the first time.&lt;ref name="Police still hunting for Tel Aviv gay center gunman"/&gt;

==Hagai Felician case==
Following a police investigation lasting nearly four years, three suspects were arrested. Their arrests were announced on 5 June 2013. A [[gag order]] was placed on the details of the investigation. The three suspects, all residents of [[Pardes Katz]], a neighborhood in [[Bnei Brak]], ranged in ages from 20 to 40. It was later announced that a prominent activist in the Israeli LGBT community had also been detained for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Senyor. [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4388862,00.html Investigation into 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting], ynetnews.com; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jerusalem Post'' reported that the shooting was planned by two young men, one of whom believed his teenaged relative had been abused by an activist at the Bar-Noar center. After the shooting, the gunman and his accomplice fled into Tel Aviv. The pistol used by the killer was found by hikers in December 2012 and the suspects were arrested some months later.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hartman.

On 11 June, the gag order was officially lifted. According to police, a few months before the killings, one of the suspects, then 15 years old, came to Barnoar struggling with his sexual identity. There he met with a veteran Barnoar figure, the fourth person to be arrested in the case. Hagai Felician, the teenager's relative, became aware that the teen had been seen a few times at Barnoar, and asked him what he was doing there. The teenager confirmed he had been going there, but that he was raped by the senior figure at the club. Felician allegedly decided to take matters into his own hands, and together with another suspect, Tarlan Hankishayev, and the state's witness, plotted to harm the activist. On the day of the shooting, Felician allegedly came to Barnoar looking for the activist. Unable to find him, Felician “lost it” and shot those present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/tel-aviv-gay-youth-center-attackers-sought-revenge-over-rape-of-teen-police-reveal.premium-1.529071|title=Tel Aviv gay youth center attackers sought revenge over rape of teen, police reveal|work=Haaretz.com|first=Yaniv|last=Kubovich|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 June 2013, charges were dropped against the other two suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Murder-charges-dropped-against-two-Bar-Noar-suspects-317473]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 2013, Hagai Felician was indicted on two counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/hagai-felician-indicted-bar-noar_n_3570891.html|title=Hagai Felician Indicted On 2 Counts of Murder in Tel Aviv Gay Center Shooting Case|work=The Huffington Post|first=Stuart|last=Hunter|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the prosecution's case against Hagai Felician collapsed after new information was uncovered that suggested that the state witness around whose testimony the case had been built had lied. Subsequently, the witness, who was identified in media reports as "Z" due to his identity being under gag order, was arrested on charges of fabricating evidence. On 26 February, Felician was released, although he was remanded to house arrest until 2 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Suspect-in-LGBT-murder-case-Felician-released-to-house-arrest-343638 Bar Noar double murder suspect Hagai Felician released after collapse of state case]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 2014, all charges against Felician were dropped.&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/charges-dropped-against-gay-youth-club-murder-suspect Charges dropped against gay youth club murder suspect], timesofisrael.com; accessed 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yaakov Felician rape case===
On 24 June 2013, it was cleared for publication that Felician's brother, Yaakov, had been arrested on rape charges, and was suspected of raping a female attorney who had applied to serve as part of Hagai's defense team. Under police interrogation, Yaakov Felician claimed that the attorney had only filed a rape complaint after he did not hire her to serve on his brother's defense team. He was released to house arrest after a [[polygraph]] test determined he was being truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relative of Bar Noar suspect accused of rape |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/relative-of-bar-noar-suspect-accused-of-rape |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HtqCpOU3?url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/relative-of-bar-noar-suspect-accused-of-rape/ |archivedate= 6 July 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=1 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4398534,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Brother-of-chief-suspect-in-Bar-Noar-case-arrested-for-rape-317557 "Brother of chief suspect in Bar Noar case arrested for rape"], jpost.com; accessed 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reaction===
The murderous event was broadly covered by the Israeli media, and was widely condemned by many public figures. President [[Shimon Peres]] reacted to the murder, stating that: "The horrifying murder that was carried out yesterday in Tel Aviv, against teenagers and young people, is a murder that civilized and enlightened people cannot accept. Murder and hatred are the two most serious crimes in society. The police must exert great efforts in order to catch the despicable murderer, and the entire nation must unite in condemning this abominable act." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3755617,00.html Peres: Enlightened nation cannot accept TA shooting], [[Yediot Ahronot]], 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104611.html|title=Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peres called the culprit a "lowly criminal" and urged the police to apprehend him quickly.&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt; 

[[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] also condemned the murder at the opening of his Cabinet meeting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3755571,00.html Netanyahu: Israel a country of tolerance], [[Yediot Ahronot]], 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his "shock and dismay", condemning the "shocking murder" and reminding Israeli citizens that "we are a democratic and tolerant country and we must respect every person as he is".&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0802/israel.html|title=Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

[[Nitzan Horowitz]], the only openly gay member of the [[Knesset]] at the time, condemned it as "the worst attack ever against the gay community in Israel [...] a blind attack against innocent youths.&lt;ref name="Gunman attacks Tel Aviv gay centre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunman kills two at gay center in Israel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

The [[Shas]] party said they were "shocked and bereaved, and denounce without reservation the murderous incident". Public Security Minister [[Yitzhak Aharonovich]], head of Israel's police force, called it "a serious and grave incident". Aharonovitch spoke of going to the crime scene, saying "it was a difficult sight".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

Opposition leader [[Tzipi Livni]] called it a "grave incident", saying "even if all the details surrounding the event are not yet clear, the hatred exists and must be dealt with".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt; She said it should "awaken society to rid itself of prejudice" and "shake up society, and all the circles inherent in it, including the political establishment and the education system, and on this day deliver an unequivocal message against intolerance, incitement and violence, and to act against any manifestation of these".&lt;ref name="Peres: An enlightened people can't accept Tel Aviv gay center murders"/&gt;

The Mayor of Tel Aviv, [[Ron Huldai]], said his city would still welcome members of the gay and lesbian community, saying they would fight for their rights to live.&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli gays' safe haven turns deadly"/&gt; Tel Aviv's Head of Police, Shachar Ayalon, did not say the shooting was a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Two killed in Tel Aviv gun attack"/&gt;

On 8 August, days after the event, Peres came to the crime scene at Bar-Noar to show support for the community and the deadly attack on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html "Netanyahu visits Tel Aviv gay center"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5j5LVuvg9?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html |date=2009-08-17 }}, ''[[Yediot Ahronot]]'', 8 August 2009; accessed 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5j5LVuvg9?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3757975,00.html Archived records]; 16 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assaf Abu Rahhal was a native of [[Kfeir]], [[Hasbaya District]], Lebanon. He was married and a father of three. He died in [[Adaisseh]], Lebanon, while reporting for his newspaper, as a result of Israeli military fire.  Final services were held at Saint George Roman Orthodox Church in Kfeir for the deceased.&lt;ref name=dailystar /&gt; The village of Adaisseh commemorated Abu Rahhal's death on the second anniversary of his death.&lt;ref name=aa2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon’s Southern Border: Life is Not a Bed of Roses|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/lebanons-southern-border-life-not-bed-roses|publisher=Al-Akhbar|first=Amal|last=Khalil|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Abu Rahhal worked for the [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|''Al Akhbar'']] daily newspaper for four years where he was covering southern Lebanon.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt; Before that he was a journalist with ''[[Al-Mustaqbal (newspaper)|Al-Mustaqbal]]'', an Arabic daily newspaper, and he sometimes wrote for ''Shu’un Janoubiah'' magazine.&lt;ref name=dailystar /&gt;

The dispute began around noon on 3 August 2010 when Israeli forces began to dig up a tree at the border between [[Misgav Am]], [[Israel]] and Adaisseh, Lebanon. The [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] had given the Israelis permission to do the maintenance. The Lebanese claimed the Israelis had crossed border in conducting this work. The Israelis disputed this claim, and the UN Peacekeeping force also dismissed the border crossing claim.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Lebanese sniper fire ensued. Both sides agree that the Lebanese issued a verbal warning prior to the shooting and the Israelis stood their ground and claimed they were on Israeli territory.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/world/middleeast/04mideast.html?_r=2&amp;hpw|title=Lethal Clash at Israeli-Lebanon Border|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|last2=Bakri|first2=Nada|publisher=New York Times|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an Israeli reserve lieutenant colonel was killed and a captain was shot and injured, the Israelis responded to the sniper fire from the Lebanese side of the border.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=183525|title=IDF commander killed on Lebanon border|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN forces intervened to bring a halt to the armed conflict.

In all, one Israeli officer, three Lebanese soldiers and Lebanese journalist Abu Rahhal were killed in the incident.

==Reactions==
The killing of Abu Rahhal was condemned by [[Irina Bokova]], who is the director-general of [[UNESCO]]: "I am deeply concerned about the circumstances in which Assaf Abu Rahhal was killed and his colleague Ali Shoaib injured ... I would further underline that freedom of expression, a fundamental human right, implies the possibility of exercising this right in safety. Armed forces are obligated to respect it."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35541&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1=|title=UNESCO chief deplores killing of Lebanese journalist |publisher=UN News Centre|date=5 August 2010|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon’s Syndicate of Photographers and the Maharat Foundation condemned the attack.&lt;ref name=dailystar /&gt; The French-based Reporters Without Borders said Abu Rahhal's death was due to an "Israeli military blunder."&lt;ref name=rsf /&gt;

Al-Akhbar editor Omar Nashabe said, "It is totally unacceptable that a civilian, a dedicated journalist, husband and father, be targeted and killed while the international community and UN troops [in southern Lebanon] stand by idly."&lt;ref name=nl /&gt; News reports contradict the charge that Abu Rahhal was targeted.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

==Other journalists killed on the border==
According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, the following Lebanese and Israeli journalists have died along the Israeli-Lebanese border in addition to Assaf Abu Rahhal: [[Ahmed Haidar]] of Al-Manar died in 1993;&lt;ref name=cphhaidar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/1993/ahmed-haidar.php |title=Ahmed Haidar|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=26 July 1993|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Roeh]] of [[Israeli radio]] died in 1999.&lt;ref name=cpjroeh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/1999/ilan-roeh.php |title=Ilan Roeh|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=28 February 1999|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Layal Najib]], a freelance photographer, died in the border dispute in 2006.&lt;ref name=cpjnajib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/2006/layal-najib.php|title=Layal Najib |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=23 July 2006|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the last journalist to have been killed before Abu Rahhal.

The shooting of Lebanese TV journalist [[Ali Shabaan]] by Syrian forces on the Lebanese-Syrian border 9 April 2012 stirred up memories of Abu Rahhal at ''Al-Akhbar''.&lt;ref name=alishabaan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/blogs/angry-corner/ali-shabaan-and-assaf-abu-rahhal|title=Ali Shabaan and Assaf Abu Rahhal|first=As'ad|last=Abu Khalil|publisher=Al-Akhbar|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shabaan was the next journalist after Abu Rahhal to have been killed near the Lebanese border.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2016}}
In [[Islam]], '''''Barakah''''' or '''''Baraka''''' ({{lang-ar|بركة}}) is a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1216 |title=Home - Brill Reference |publisher=Brillonline.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|title=Sufi Essays|date=1972|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0873952332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Baraka can be found within physical objects, places, and people, as chosen by God. This force begins by flowing directly from God into creation that is worthy of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; These creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of God through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. God is the sole source of baraka and has the power to grant and withhold baraka.

==Islamic mysticism==
Baraka is a prominent concept in Islamic mysticism, particularly [[Sufism]]. It pervades Sufi texts, beliefs, practices, and spirituality. Sufism emphasizes the importance of esoteric knowledge and the spiritual union with God through the heart. Baraka symbolizes this connection between the divine and the worldly through God's direct and intentional blessing of those that are most reflective of Him and his teachings.

Baraka is not a state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It flows from God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have received baraka are thought to have the abilities to perform miracles (''karamat''), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|title=The Shambhala Guide to Sufism|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=9781570621802|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} However, according to [[Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri]], a prominent Sufi mystic, the use of these miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Sources, transmission, and traditional importance==

===Sources===
The [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], saints, prophets, Muhammad and his descendants are all powerful sources of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; Through these sources, one may achieve baraka by three methods: (1) visitation of saints and holy shrines charged with baraka, (2) attachment to the chain of spiritual masters through the [[khirqa]], and (3) emulation of the inner [[Sunnah]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through saints===
Saints as the source of baraka, can transmit baraka to ordinary men simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, "By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors".&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Valerie J.|title=Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt|date=2009|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=157003849X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} In this way, the saints provide a means for ordinary men to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as [[ziyara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamustafa|first1=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520252691}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through khirqa===
Sufis pass esoteric knowledge and baraka from the master [[sheikh]] to the aspirant through the passing of the [[khirqa]]. The khirqa is the initiatory cloak of the Sufi chain of spirituality. This cloak initiates an aspirant into the [[silsilah]], which is the chain of sheikhs that goes back to Muhammad. This chain serves as the channel through which baraka flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of baraka through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk. Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of baraka to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he has sworn. Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the "frock of blessing", is characterized by the passing of baraka to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he has encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|date=2013|publisher=Mizan|location=Jakarta Selatan|isbn=9794337978|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

The silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many hadiths is known as the [[isnad]]. It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that the Sufi tradition began accepting this form of [[isnad]] as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan A.C.|title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=1851686630|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission through Sunnah===
By following the practices and teachings of Muhammad, one can achieve baraka through the emulation of [[Sunnah]]. Because Muhammad is the source of Muhammadan baraka, by living in constant remembrance of [[Names of God in Islam|the names of God]] and in accordance to Muhammad's Sunnah. Those that live the inner Sunnah within the heart, are those that reflect the Light of Muhammad (al-nur al-muhammadi) and the Muhammadan baraka.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Those that live according to the Sunnah, live in constant remembrance of God, and live authentically from the heart are those to whom God opens the channel through which baraka can flow. By living in accordance to Muhammad, one can become worthy of God's direct blessing of baraka. If granted baraka, the saintly person is able to feel God's force from within and is nourished by the hadith while being guided by the baraka.&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Controversy of seeking baraka==
Seeking baraka has been a source of controversy throughout the Islamic world. Through the act of [[ziyara]], saints and the shrines of saints are seen as a means to access the baraka sent from God.  Because of this, many within Islam see ziyara as a form of [[idolatry]] in the way devotees may look towards the saints instead of towards God, Himself, for baraka.&lt;ref name="Sells"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seels|first1=Michael A.|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'raj, Poetic and Theological Writings|date=1996|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809136198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Although ziyara has been a source of great controversy, it remains one of the most typical ritual practices of Islamic spirituality.&lt;ref name="Sells"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

'''''Biotech Sweden''''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazine about and for the Scandinavian life science and biotech industry.

==History and profile==
''Biotech Sweden'' was first published on 9 April 2002 by IDG Sweden, a subsidiary of [[International Data Group|IDG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jan Sandred|title=Biotech Sweden – A Business Model Case Study in Innovation Journalism|url=http://innovationjournalism.org/archive/INJO-1-3_split/INJO-1-3_sandred.pdf|work=Innovation Journalism|accessdate=6 May 2015|format=Conference Paper|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sister publication of ''Bio-IT World''.&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; At its initial phase ''Biotech Sweden'' was published seven times a year.&lt;ref name=ada&gt;{{cite news|title=IDG to publish 'Biotech' magazine in Sweden|url=http://adage.com/article/btob/idg-publish-biotech-magazine-sweden/253684/|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=Ad Age|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it began to be published 11 times per year. The readers were mainly people working in the [[biotechnology]] [[Medical technology|medtech]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]] industry of the [[Nordic countries]]. It also carried the largest life science web news service of the Nordic countries, www.lifesciencesweden.se, with four newsletter distributed three times a week, subscription free-of-charge. On the website the magazine provided daily news in Swedish and a weekly news-letter covering life science news of the Nordic countries, plus also access to The Scandinavian Life Science Industry Guide, a database of all life science, medtech and labtech companies of Scandinavia. ''Life Science Sweden'' is also official media partner of Sweden Bio.

The [[editor-in-chief]]s included Ingrid Heath, Jörgen Lindqvist, Ingrid Helander and Loth Hammar.

In 2012, the magazine changed its name to ''Life Science Sweden'' and in 2013 it was sold to Mentor Communications AB.

'''Bluey''' (7 June 1910 – 14 November 1939) was an [[Australian Cattle Dog|Australian cattle dog]] owned by Les and Esma Hall of [[Rochester, Victoria|Rochester]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', Bluey lived 29 years, 5 months and is the oldest dog ever verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-dog |title=Oldest dog |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |year=2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ipfactly.com/oldest-living-creatures-earth/ | title=Oldest-Living Creatures on Earth: Oldest Living Dog — Bluey | publisher=IP Factly | work=An entry | date=June 6, 2015 | accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two owners have made claims for longer-lived dogs [[Max (dog)|Max]] and Bella, but these claims have not been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Knapton|first=Sarah|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2707307/Oldest-dog-Bella-the-Labrador-dies-aged-101.html|title=Oldest dog Bella the Labrador dies – aged 29|publisher=Telegraph|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2010-11-03 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053471/The-worlds-oldest-dog-dies-age-203-canine-years.html|title=The world's oldest dog dies at the age of 203 (in canine years)|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2010-11-03 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluey's age, along with that of "Chilla," a mixed-breed ([[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]-Australian Cattle Dog) reported to have lived to the age of 32 years and 12 days,&lt;ref name=Bluey&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1suAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZNoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3926,2238929&amp;dq=bluey+dog+oldest&amp;hl=en ''World's oldest pooch dies'', Beaver County Times, 13 March 1984.] Retrieved 9 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; prompted a study of the longevity of the Australian Cattle Dog to examine if the breed might have exceptional longevity. The 100-dog survey yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years.&lt;ref name="Pascal Lee Survey"&gt;Lee, P. (2011). Longevity of the Australian Cattle Dog: Results of a 100-Dog Survey. ACD Spotlight, Vol. 4, Issue 1, Spring 2011, 96-105. http://www.acdspotlight.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that while the Australian Cattle Dogs do live almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class on average, the cases of Bluey and Chilla should be regarded as uncharacteristic exceptions rather than as indicators of common longevity for this entire breed.&lt;ref name="Pascal Lee Survey" /&gt;

Boussus was ranked World No. 9 in 1930 and 1935 by [[A. Wallis Myers]] of [[The Daily Telegraph]], and the European No. 6 in 1931 (the latter by "Züricher Sport" newspaper).&lt;ref name="MontrealGazette1930" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tennis&amp;golf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReadingEagle1935"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I7MhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rZsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3522,3593589&amp;dq=wilmer-allison+world+ranking&amp;hl=en "Moody, Perry Rated Tops By British Expert"], ''Reading Eagle'', 17 October 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
At the peak of his career in 1932 his play was observed by [[Great Britain Davis Cup Team|Great Britain]]'s then active Davis Cup player [[Nigel Sharpe]] who described him as the greatest French left-hander in the following manner: "He relies upon an all-round game with volleying as his forte. There is nothing of hurricane speed in his game. He takes the ball on the rise and hist his forehand with an easy swing and without much topspin. He gets good pace in this stroke and usually relies upon it as the forerunner of a volleying campaign[…]His backhand is of the cut variety but although putting so much slice on it he does not let it stop him from hitting it pretty hard. This stroke, of course, has its limitations, as it is distinctly difficult to make good passing shots against an agile volleyer. This wing is Boussus' chief weakness[…] (he) is able to make his volley down the line with great speed[..]but does not use his wrist quite so much". He further analysed his service game and found it be most unorthodox. Boussus completely omitted to swing his racquet behind his head while serving making his serves rather ineffective. Although this style was useful in overhead smashes when accuracy is more important than the speed. With this type of serve he also put a great spin to the ball and kept it relatively low.&lt;ref name="straitstimes2" /&gt; Later in his career he adapted to baseline play and utilized a series of dropshots in his games.&lt;ref name="straitstimes"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5051">'''Cities for Life Day''' is a worldwide festivity that supports the abolition of the [[death penalty]]. It is celebrated on November 30 of each year.

==History==
[[Cesare Beccaria]] was one of the greatest Italian [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers, who was noted for his masterpiece ''Of Crimes and Punishments'' (1764), which was later translated into 22 languages. In it, Beccaria put forth some of the first modern arguments against the [[death penalty]]. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles.

As a consequence in [[Italy]] the first pre-unitarian state to abolish the [[death penalty]] was the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] as of November 30, 1786, under the reign of [[Pietro Leopoldo|Pietro Leopoldo, later Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]]. So Tuscany was the first civil state in the world to do away with torture and capital punishment.

Since then in the last two centuries the refusal of death penalty has been increasing all around the world:

"In 2012, 141 states have abolished either by law or on a de facto basis the death penalty, while it is still on the books in 51 countries. Since 2007, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called for a universal moratorium with a view toward total abolition of capital punishment. In 2011 progress was made in all regions of the world, particularly the United States: Illinois became abolitionist and in April 2012 Connecticut became the 17th state to abolish the death penalty, thus becoming the fifth American state to revoke capital punishment in the last five years."[http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/pageID/247/langID/en/The-International-Day-of-Cities-for-life--cities-against-the-death-penalty.html]

==Characteristics==
On the "Cities for Life Day", November 30, many important cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/pag.aspx?ln=en&amp;id=11 The cities / No to death penalty − Community of Sant'Egidio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108140330/http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/pag.aspx?ln=en&amp;id=11 |date=2011-01-08 }}. Nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org. Retrieved on 2010-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/pag.aspx?ln=en&amp;id=4 Cities For Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227065102/http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/pag.aspx?ln=en&amp;id=4 |date=2009-12-27 }}, Nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org. Retrieved on 2010-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; around the world celebrate the first abolition of the [[death penalty]] by a [[Europe]]an state, decreed by [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] of [[Habsburg|Habsburg-Lorraine]] in 1786 for his Grand Duchy of [[Tuscany]]. On this occasion the participating cities show their commitment for life and against the death penalty.

On this day, participating cities illuminate a symbolic monument, such as the [[Atomium]] in [[Brussels]], the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]] and the [[Plaza de Santa Ana]] in [[Madrid]]. Participating cities in 2009 include more than 60 [[Capital (political)|capitals]] worldwide, and over 1,200 cities and towns around the world, such as Rome, Brussels, [[Madrid]], [[Ottawa]], [[Mexico City]], [[Berlin]], [[Barcelona]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Dallas]], [[Antwerp]], [[Vienna]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Bogotá]], [[Santiago de Chile]].

By this symbolic action, these cities demand a stay of all [[execution (legal)|executions]] worldwide. This initiative is promoted by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]] and supported by the main international human rights organizations, gathered in the [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]] ([[Amnesty International]], [[Ensemble contre la Peine de Mort]], [[International Penal Reform]], [[FIACAT]]).

In 2005, the Cities for Life Day also featured the "Africa for Life" conference about the death penalty in [[Africa]], in which 14 [[minister of justice|ministers of justice]] from as many African countries participated. The conference took place in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]].

Cities continue to join this cause, many in countries that maintain the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/en/photos/mappe.aspx Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142719/http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/en/photos/mappe.aspx |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 there were 
1625, of which 72 were capitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/it/le-citta.aspx List of the Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144636/http://nodeathpenalty.santegidio.org/it/le-citta.aspx |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Ernest Hornell''' VC (26 January 1910 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1944) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Early life==
David "Bud" Hornell was born on Toronto Island and spent his later childhood and adolescence in the Toronto suburb of [[Mimico]]. He attended [[Mimico High School]], having obtained the Fred Werden scholarship, given in memory of the son of Mimico's postmaster, who was killed in the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mimico Story'', Harvey Currell, 1967, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
He enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in January 1941, and received his pilot's wings in September the same year. After further instruction in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], he was posted to the Royal Canadian Air Force station on North Vancouver Island. Commissioned in 1942, Flight Lieutenant Hornell completed 60 operational missions, involving some 600 hours flying.

===Victoria Cross===
Flight Lieutenant Hornell was flying as aircraft captain on a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated Canso]]&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/gal/vcg-gcv/bio/hornell-de-eng.asp |title=Victoria Cross - Second World War, 1939-1945: David Ernest Hornell |publisher=[[Chief of Military Personnel (Canada)|Chief of Military Personnel]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]], Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; amphibian aircraft with [[No. 162 Squadron RCAF|162 (Bomber Reconnaissance) Squadron, RCAF]], from [[Wick Airport#RAF Wick|RAF Wick]] in Northern Scotland, when the following action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 June 1944 on sea patrol near the [[Faroes]] in the North [[Atlantic]], Hornell's aircraft was attacked and badly damaged by the {{GS|U-1225}}. Nevertheless he and his crew succeeded in sinking the submarine. Hornell then managed to bring his burning aircraft down on the heavy swell. There was only one serviceable dinghy, which could not hold all the crew, so they took turns in the cold water.

By the time the survivors were rescued 21 hours later, Hornell was blinded and weak from exposure and cold. He died shortly after being picked up. He is buried in [[Lerwick]] Cemetery, Shetland Islands.&lt;ref name=VCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/scotland.htm |title=Grave Location ''[sic]'' for Victoria Cross Holders in: Scotland |publisher=victoriacross.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028142235/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/scotland.htm |archivedate=2004-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Citation====
{{quote|Flight Lieutenant Hornell was captain and first pilot of a twin-engined amphibian aircraft engaged on an anti-submarine patrol in northern waters. The patrol had lasted for some hours when a fully-surfaced U-boat was sighted, travelling at high speed on the port beam. Flight Lieutenant Hornell at once turned to the attack.

The U-boat altered course. The aircraft had been seen and there could be no surprise. The U-boat opened up with anti-aircraft fire which became increasingly fierce and accurate.

At a range of 1,200 yards, the front guns of the aircraft replied; then its starboard guns jammed, leaving only one gun effective. Hits were obtained on and around the conning-tower of the U-boat, but the aircraft was itself hit, two large holes appearing in the starboard wing.

Ignoring the enemy’s fire, Flight Lieutenant Hornell carefully manoeuvred for the attack. Oil was pouring from his starboard engine, which was, by this time, on fire, as was the starboard wing; and the petrol tanks were endangered. Meanwhile, the aircraft was hit again and again by the U-boat’s guns. Holed in many places, it was vibrating violently and very difficult to control.

Nevertheless, the captain decided to press home his attack, knowing that with every moment the chances of escape for him and his gallant crew would grow more slender. He brought his aircraft down very low and released his depth charges in a perfect straddle. The bows of the U-boat were lifted out of the water; it sank and the crew were seen in the sea.

Flight Lieutenant Hornell contrived, by superhuman efforts at the controls, to gain a little height. The fire in the starboard wing had grown more intense and the vibration had increased. Then the burning engine fell off. The plight of aircraft and crew was now desperate. With the utmost coolness, the captain took his aircraft into wind and, despite the manifold dangers, brought it safely down on the heavy swell. Badly damaged and blazing furiously, the aircraft rapidly settled.

After ordeal by fire came ordeal by water. There was only one serviceable dinghy and this could not hold all the crew. So they took turns in the water, holding on to the sides. Once, the dinghy capsized in the rough seas and was righted only with great difficulty. Two of the crew succumbed from exposure.

An airborne lifeboat was dropped to them but fell some 500 yards down wind. The men struggled vainly to reach it and Flight Lieutenant Hornell, who throughout had encouraged them by his cheerfulness and inspiring leadership, proposed to swim to it, through he was nearly exhausted. He was with difficulty restrained. The survivors were finally rescued after they had been in the water for 21 hours. By this time Flight Lieutenant Hornell was blinded and completely exhausted. He died shortly after being picked up.

Flight Lieutenant Hornell had completed 60 operational missions, involving 600 hours’ flying. He well knew the danger and difficulties attending attacks on submarines. By pressing home a skilful and successful attack against fierce opposition, with his aircraft in a precarious condition, and by fortifying and encouraging his comrades in the subsequent ordeal, this officer displayed valour and devotion to duty of the highest order.&lt;ref name=CMP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 36630|date=25 July 1944|page=3523|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Dinah Abrahamson''' (1954{{spaced ndash}}December 17, 2013) was an American author and politician. A native of [[Omaha, Nebraska]], Abrahamson was a member of the Nebraska State Central Committee as well as an active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. She was also known for her appearance on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] special on the lives of [[Hasidic Jews]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKaYu4-dM0|title=Oprah Meets a Black Hasidic Family - Oprah's Next Chapter - Oprah Winfrey Network|first=|last=OWN|date=12 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrahamson and her family were most memorable for being one of few [[African American]] families associated with the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=A Young Man From Omaha, Who May Perfectly Represent Brooklyn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/nyregion/16bigcity.html|accessdate=|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Abrahamson was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1954, the daughter of immigrants.  Her father was of [[Afro-Panamanian]] descent and her mother was caucasian of [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent from Germany.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Raised by her mother and maternal grandparents, Abrahamson grew up in a secular Jewish household and would only attend [[synagogue]] on events within the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Michel|title=Black Family Bears Unique Jewish Distinction|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92230958|accessdate=July 18, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 4, 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
In 1993, Abrahamson and her two children joined the Hasidic Jewish dynasty, Chabad Lubavitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92230958|title=Black Family Bears Unique Jewish Distinction|website=npr.org|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being raised in a secular household, Abrahamson became religious as she grew older and got to know herself better. The Abrahamsons were one of few Hasidic families, let alone black Hasidic families, in the Omaha area.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

Her daughter Sarah eventually moved to Brooklyn, New York to work at a Hasidic Jewish day school. Shortly afterwards, Abrahamson and her son Yosef joined Sarah in New York City in order to be closer to a larger Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/nyregion/16bigcity.html|title=A Young Man From Omaha, Who May Perfectly Represent Brooklyn|first=Susan|last=Dominus|date=16 June 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family ultimately settled in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], a neighborhood known for both its large African-American and Hasidic Jewish communities who live side by side in the area.

==Politics==
Abrahamson was an active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. She was a member of the Nebraska State Central Committee, as well as a supporter of Nebraska politician [[Lee Terry]] who was a family friend of Abrahamson.

==Writing==
At the time of her death, Abrahamson had self-published a book on race relations in America.

==Death==
Abrahamson died on December 17, 2013. She was survived by her children, her sister, and a granddaughter.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Dybbuk.jpg|thumb|300px|Dybbuk, by [[Ephraim Moses Lilien|Ephraim Moshe Lilien]] (1874–1925).]]

In [[Jewish mythology]], a '''dybbuk''' ({{lang-yi|דיבוק}}, from the [[Hebrew]] verb {{hebrew|דָּבַק}} ''dāḇaq'' meaning "adhere" or "cling") is a malicious [[spiritual possession|possessing]] [[spiritual being|spirit]] believed to be the dislocated [[soul]] of a dead person. It supposedly leaves the host body once it has accomplished its goal, sometimes after being [[Exorcism#Judaism|helped]].&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z10-Xz9Kno4C&amp;lpg=PA538&amp;ots=aitC-oaSO_&amp;dq=dybbuk&amp;pg=PA538#v=onepage&amp;q=dybbuk&amp;f=false A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, by Avner Falk, p.538, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution=Dybbuk| contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174964/dybbuk| title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| url=http://www.britannica.com/| accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EJ"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_05197.html "Dibbuk", Encyclopedia Judaica], by [[Gershom Scholem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"'''Dybbuk'''" is an abbreviation of {{Hebrew|דיבוק מרוח רעה}} ''dibbūq mē-rūaḥ rā‘ā'' ("a cleavage of an evil spirit"), or {{Hebrew|דיבוק מן החיצונים}} ''dibbūq min ha-ḥīṣōnīm'' ("dibbuk from the outside"), which is found in man. "Dybbuk" comes from the Hebrew word {{hebrew|דִּיבּוּק}} ''dibbūq'' which means "the act of sticking" and is a nominal form derived from the verb {{hebrew|דָּבַק}} ''dāḇaq'' "to adhere" or "cling".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.nl/books?id=EZCgpaTgLm0C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22qittul%22+pattern&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YfozMVFICC&amp;sig=GDMTg-xNYuhKvxBeYSucLRi8VWI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBWoVChMIqJilgcWFyQIVC3EUCh2TCgTl#v=onepage&amp;q=%22qittul%22%20pattern&amp;f=false A. Sáenz-Badillos &amp; J. Elwolde, ''A History of the Hebrew Language'', 1996, p. 187] on the ''qiṭṭūl'' pattern.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term first appears in a number of 16th century writings,&lt;ref name="Falk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldish"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CF1C84xHeucC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;ots=CvbxBG1z6W&amp;dq=dybbuk&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=dybbuk&amp;f=false ''Spirit Possession in Judaism: Cases and Contexts from the Middle Ages to the Present, by Matt Goldish'', p.41, Wayne State University Press, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; though it was ignored by mainstream scholarship until [[S. Ansky]]'s play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' popularised the concept in literary circles.&lt;ref name="Goldish" /&gt; Earlier accounts of possession (such as that given by [[Josephus]]) were of demonic possession rather than that by ghosts.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=60iVk1p8Y9IC&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;ots=WYDSSzpy-j&amp;dq=dybbuk&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=dybbuk&amp;f=false ''Tree of Souls:The Mythology of Judaism'', by Howard Schwartz, pp. 229–230, Oxford University Press, 1 Nov 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  These accounts advocated orthodoxy among the populace&lt;ref name="Falk" /&gt; as a preventative measure. For example, it was suggested that a sloppily made [[mezuzah]] or entertaining doubt about [[Crossing the Red Sea|Moses' crossing of the Red Sea]] opened one's household to dybbuk possession. Very precise details of names and locations have been included in accounts of dybbuk possession. Rabbi [[Yoel Teitelbaum]], the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar rebbe]] (1887–1979) is reported to have supposedly advised an individual said to be possessed to consult a [[psychiatrist]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt;

Ansky's play is a significant work of [[Yiddish theatre]], and has been adapted a number of times by writers, composers and other creators including [[Jerome Robbins]]/[[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Tony Kushner]]. In the play, a young bride is possessed by the ghost of the man she was meant to marry, had her father not broken a marriage agreement.

There are other forms of soul transmigration in Jewish mythology. In contrast to the dybbuk, the [[ibbur]] (meaning "impregnation") is a positive possession, which happens when a righteous soul temporarily possesses a body. This is always done with consent, so that the soul can perform a [[mitzvah]]. The [[gilgul]] ({{lang-he|גלגול הנשמות}}, literally "rolling") puts forth the idea that a soul must live through many lives before it gains the wisdom to rejoin with God.

In psychological literature the Dybbuk has been described as an [[Hysteria|hysterical]] syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Billu | first1 = Y | last2 = Beit-Hallahmi | first2 = B | year = 1989 | title = Dybbuk-Possession as a hysterical symptom: Psychodynamic and socio-cultural factors | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Science | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 138–149 | pmid = 2606645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
===Film===

The [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Ezra (2017 film)|Ezra]]'' (2017) revolves around a Dybbuk box, with references to Kabbalist traditions and occultism.

[[Michał Waszyński]]'s 1937 film ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'', based on the Yiddish play by [[S. Ansky]], is considered one of the classics of [[Yiddish cinema|Yiddish film-making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dybbuk|url=http://www.jewishfilm.org/Catalogue/films/dybbuk.html|publisher=[[The National Center for Jewish Film]]|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dybbuk was featured as the main antagonist in the horror films ''[[The Unborn (2009 film)|The Unborn]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Possession (2012 film)|The Possession]]'' (2012).

In ''[[Love and Death]]'', [[Woody Allen]]'s 1975 satire of Russian literature, Boris (Allen) flirts with Sonja ([[Diane Keaton]]), who is with the fish monger she is set to marry. The fiancée keeps getting in the way of Boris' advances, which leads him to ask Sonja, "Did you have to bring the dybbuk?"

''[[A Serious Man]]'' opens with a story about a couple who suspect that the rabbi they're hosting for dinner is a dybbuk.

[[Marcin Wrona]]'s ''[[Demon (2015 film)|Demon]]'' is the story of a groom possessed by a dybbuk the night before his wedding.

In the [[Christopher Guest]] 1997 movie ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', dentist Allan Pearl discusses his family history with show business: "I think I got a, a, an entertaining bug... from my grandfather... uh, Chaim Pearlgut, who was very very big in the, um, Yiddish, uh, theater, back in New York. He was in the, the very... the sardonically irreverent... "Dybbuk Shmybbuk, I Said 'More Ham'" ... and that revue I believe was 1914, and that revue was what made him famous. Incidentally, the song "Bubbe Made A Kishke" came from that revue."

===Print===
In [[Romain Gary]]'s 1967 novel ''The Dance of Genghis Cohn'', a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] warden is haunted by the dybbuk of one of his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Howard| authorlink =Howard Schwartz|title=Reimagining the Bible: The Storytelling of the Rabbis|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195104998|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K8X2DymK5UcC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=dyke+dybbuk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ODnZU4j5e&amp;sig=ALuneEdEJb7o71S3MJRGXjamXO4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2y1RVMv6McflaLHSgNgP&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=dyke%20dybbuk&amp;f=false|ref=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ellen Galford]]'s 1993 novel ''The Dyke and the Dybbuk'', lesbian taxi-driver Rainbow Rosenbloom is haunted by, and gets the better of, a female dybbuk haunting her as a result of a curse placed on her ancestor 200 years ago.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

The dybbuk appears in the fictional novel, ''The Inquisitor's Apprentice'' (2011) by [[Chris Moriarty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/books/review/books-about-young-crimefighters-in-new-york.html|title=Books About Young Crimefighters in New York|last=Bird|first=Elizabeth|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic series ''[[Girl Genius]]'', the forcible insertion of the mind of Agatha's mother, the main villain Lucrezia Mongfish/"The Other", into her own was compared to a dybbuk by one of her followers when reporting the situation to someone else.

[[Richard Zimler]]'s 2011 novel ''[[The Warsaw Anagrams]]'' is narrated by a dybbuk desperately trying to understand why he has remained in our world. This is in keeping with kabbalistic belief that dybbuks fail to pass over to the Other Side because of a [[mitzvah]] or duty that they have failed to fulfill.

===Television===

The Dybbuk is mentioned in the paranormal TV show ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'', season 2, episode 4 "The Dybbuk Box".

The "Dybbuk Box" was shown on the first episode of ''[[Deadly Possessions]]'' (spin off of Ghost Adventures). In which the son of the relative of a holocaust survivor accounts the tale of the Dybbuks' attachment to the deaths relating around the box.

In the TV show ''[[Difficult People]]'', season 3, episode 3 [[Difficult People#Season 3 .282017.29|"Code Change]]", Billy helps his sister-in-law Rucchel exorcise what she perceives to be a Dybbuk from her basement.

In the episode of ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', "Drool, the Dog-faced Goblin," the Ghostbusters discuss with Peter Venkman the many different forms an antagonistic ghost they are facing can take, with Egon Spengler mentioning a dybbuk. Peter asks Egon what a dybbuk is with Egon replying it's best if he didn't know. In a later episode titled "The Devil to Pay," the Ghostbusters deal with a demon named Dib Devlin who swindles Ray Stanz and Winston Zeddemore into selling their souls to compete in his game show. Dib Devlin is later revealed to be a dybbuk.

Grandpa Boris tells a scary story to the babies involving a Dybbuk in an early episode of ''[[Rugrats]]''.

An '''energy being''' or '''astral being''' is a theoretical [[life form]] that is composed of [[energy]] rather than [[matter]]. They appear in [[myth]]s/[[legend]]s, [[paranormal]]/[[UFO]] accounts, and in various works of [[speculative fiction]].

Energy beings are typically rendered as a translucent glowing fluid or as a collection of flames or electrical sparks or bolts; somewhat in common with the representations of [[ghost]]s.

Energy beings have a variety of capacities. The Taelons (from ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'') are barely more powerful than mortals, while others such as ''[[Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s Ascended Ancients/Ori, ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''{{'}}s [[List of Ben 10 characters#Verdona Tennyson|Anodites]], or the Meekrob from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' possess god-like powers.

She won one of those finals, defeating [[Sylvia Lance Harper]] in 1927. Robertson participated in the first women's singles final at the Australian Championships in 1922 against fellow Australian [[Margaret Molesworth]].

SR = the ratio of the number of Grand Slam singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Through 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals. The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussels, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities. The results from the 1922 and 1923 editions of that tournament are shown here. The Olympics replaced the WHCC in 1924, as the Olympics were held in Paris. Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.

'''''Ethnic Cleansing''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]] computers, created by the American [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]  (and published by its record label [[Resistance Records]]) on January 21, 2002. As part of a "[[Race war|Race War]]", the player controls a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] skinhead or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] and is tasked with killing stereotypical [[African-American]], [[Mexican-American|Mexican]], and [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] enemies, ending with then-[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]].

Using the [[Genesis3D]] engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the [[Anti-Defamation League]] taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled ''White Law'', has been released.

==Gameplay==
''Ethnic Cleansing'' is a standard, short-length [[first-person shooter]] set in a single [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. The player can select a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], a [[White power skinhead|Skinhead]], or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] to control. They run through a [[ghetto]] that has been compared to [[New York City]] and shoot [[African-American]]s and [[Mexican American|Mexican]]s, before descending into a subway system to kill [[Jewish-Americans|Jews]]. Finally, the player reaches the "[[Zionist Occupied Government|Yiddish Control Center]]", where a fictionalized version of [[Ariel Sharon]], then [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] of [[Israel]], is directing plans for world domination.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; He carries a [[rocket launcher]]; the player must kill him to complete the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; The [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up]] display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ethnic Cleansing|publisher=[[Resistance Records]]|developer=[[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]|date=January 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's soundtrack consists of [[White power music#White power rock|white power rock music]]. The game's art assets and sound effects feature [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]]: when shot, black enemies make monkey noises and Jewish enemies are dressed as [[rabbi]]s and shout "[[oy vey]]!".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Mexican characters shout "I need to take a siesta now". In addition, black enemies are drawn to resemble apes&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and some wear T-shirts with the lettering "[[Nigga|NIGZ]]",&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; while Mexican enemies wear [[sombrero]]s.&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt;

''Ethnic Cleansing'' was developed by members of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], an American [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organization, and published by [[Resistance Records]], its subsidiary record label that specializes in [[white power music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/476/f3d/719/united-states-v-ross|publisher=OpenJurist|title=476 F. 3d 719 - United States v.

The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

Shaun Walker, the chairman of the National Alliance, explained to the [[United Press]] that the intent was to produce a racially provocative video game and promote [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Ellie|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|title=Racists launch PC game|date=July 18, 2005|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026055233/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|archive-date=2014-10-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Alliance founder [[William Luther Pierce]], who also appears in the game to discuss an "upcoming [[European Americans|white]] revolution", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] (January 21) of 2002.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promote hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|title=Racist Groups Use Computer Gaming to Promote Hate|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220545/http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was priced at [[U.S. dollar|USD $]]14.88,&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; a reference to the white supremacist [[Fourteen Words]] slogan and the neo-Nazi numerical code "88" (which stands for "HH" or "Heil Hitler").

==Reception and controversy==
[[File:Ethnic Cleansing shot.png|thumb|left|275px|Here, the player shoots two African-American men. The game received backlash for its racist themes.]]
While it received little attention from the mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans on both sides of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208065556/http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|url=http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|last=Leonard|first=David|title=White Supremacist Games or Just More of the Same?|date=February 26, 2004|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|archivedate=December 8, 2009|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], an [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] organization that especially covers [[anti-Semitism]], publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] to encourage its members to adopt such policies.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

The game's reception from critics was extremely negative. David Leonard of [[PopMatters]] described the game's graphics and "playability". While not approving of the game's message, he argued that it was only the latest in a long line of racist video games that included the likes of ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', ''[[NFL Street]]'', and ''[[Freedom Fighters (video game)|Freedom Fighters]]''.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; In January 2003, ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' named ''Ethnic Cleansing'' the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only "very stupid children" would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like "small-minded assholes".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|title=50 Most Controversial Games Ever|journal=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]|date=January 2003|page=75|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305160325/https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|publisher=''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''|title=The 10 Most Racist Video Games|accessdate=October 21, 2014|last=Hester|first=Larry|date=June 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021100656/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|archive-date=2014-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[UGO]]'' ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. ''UGO'' staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it "profoundly stupid".&lt;ref name="ugo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|publisher=[[UGO]]|last=Jensen|first=K. Thor|title=The 11 Most Racist Video Games|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128214108/http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce estimated that "a couple thousand" copies of the game had been sold within a month of its release and that 90 percent of consumers had been white teenage boys.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

==Sequel==
The National Alliance and Resistance Records released a similar game, ''White Law'', in June 2003. It starred an [[Irish-American]] police officer taking up arms to protect his territory from racial minorities. It has been compared to [[Freedom Fighters (video game)|''Freedom Fighters'']],&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''. The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|last=Scheeres|first=Julia|title=Games Elevate Hate to Next Level|date=February 20, 2002|accessdate=October 21, 2014|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929044711/http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|archive-date=2014-09-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=February 19, 2002|title=ADL Report: Growing Proliferation of Racist Video Games Target Youth on The Internet|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817194717/http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|archive-date=2014-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freeman family murders''' took place in [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]] on February 26, 1995. Together with their cousin, Nelson "Ben" Birdwell III, Bryan and David Freeman killed their parents, Brenda and Dennis Freeman, and their 11-year-old brother, Erik Freeman. For several years the brothers had been embracing neo-Nazi culture, though this had escalated in the months before the killings, with them going so far as to tattoo Nazi slogans on their foreheads. At the time of the murders, Bryan was 17 years old and David was 16. Both brothers and their cousin were given life sentences without the possibility of parole, though none of the three were convicted in the murder of Erik Freeman. It was reported in 2014 that those sentences would be upheld, despite the recent [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that mandatory life-without-parole sentences were unconstitutional for juveniles convicted of murder.&lt;ref name=mc1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-01-18/news/3658213_1_dennis-freeman-david-freeman-guilty-plea|title=Admitted killer Bryan Freeman proclaims innocence in mom's death|date=January 18, 2006|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lL4oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QgYGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1494%2C12327|title=Police suspect skinhead brothers killed family|date=March 1, 1995|work=The Item}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wfmz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/lehigh-valley/conversation-with-convicted-killer-bryan-freeman_20160530063901772/21041927|title=Conversation with convicted killer Bryan Freeman|date=February 25, 2015|work=WFMZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-03-29/news/1995088041_1_bryan-freeman-dennis-freeman-david-freeman|title=2 of 3 skinheads held in murders start to talk|date=March 29, 1995|work=The Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inmatelocator&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inmatelocator.cor.pa.gov/#/|title=Inmate Locator|work=Pennsylvania Department of Corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jmhfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=62ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3932%2C1727805|title=Younger Freeman brother to be tried as an adult for murder in family slaying|date=September 7, 1995|work=Observer-Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/03/us/2-skinhead-brothers-charged-with-killing-family-members.html|title=2 Skinhead Brothers Charged With Killing Family Members|date=March 3, 1995|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/one-familys-nightmare-180940?rm=eu|title=One family's nightmate|date=March 13, 1995|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/lehigh-county/index.ssf/2014/04/judge_denies_appeals_for_freem.html|title=Life sentences will stand for Salisbury Township's Freeman brothers who killed parents|date=April 1, 2014|work=Leigh Valley Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=remorse&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-freeman-howorth-murders-anniversary-20150227-story.html|title=Freeman brothers remorseful 20 years after murdering their parents|date=February 28, 2015|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-02-27/news/3587623_1_dennis-freeman-nelson-birdwell-iii-brothers|title=Decade after murders, are we safer?|date=February 27, 2005|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/neo-nazi-brothers-accused-of-killing-parents-1609881.html|title=Neo-Nazi brothers accused of killing parents|date=March 3, 1995|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1995-03-04/news/3017953_1_freemans-killings-frank-s-father|title=Skinhead Says He Was Unaware Of Accusations Against Freemans|date=March 4, 1995|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1995-09-22/news/3044069_1_dennis-freeman-david-freeman-shirt|title=Birdwell Faces Trial In Freeman Killings|date=September 22, 1995|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1996-04-27/news/3094229_1_david-freeman-death-penalty-dennis-freeman|title=Birdwell To Serve Life In Prison For Murder Birdwell Guilty Of Killing Uncle Verdict Doesn't Answer The Question Of Who Killed Erik|date=April 27, 1996|work=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GngyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GrYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4119%2C2001694|title=Skinhead given life in prison;

On 29 September 2013, gunmen from [[Boko Haram]] entered the male dormitory in the [[College of Agriculture, Gujba|College of Agriculture]] in [[Gujba]], [[Yobe State]], [[Nigeria]], killing forty-four students and teachers.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Nigerian Sharia conflict}}
[[Boko Haram]] was founded in 2002 to fight against the de-[[Arabization]] of Nigeria, which the group maintains is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Extremist attack in Nigeria kills 42 at boarding school|first=Damien|last=McElroy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10163942/Extremist-attack-in-Nigeria-kills-42-at-boarding-school.html|date=6 July 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2013, violence linked to the Boko Haram insurgency resulted in 3,600 deaths, including 1,600 civilians.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsday/&gt; In mid-May 2013, the federal government declared a state of emergency in [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]], [[Borno State|Borno]], and [[Yobe State]]s, as it aimed to end the Boko Haram insurgency.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria school attack claims 42 lives|agency=AFP|work=The Australian|date=6 July 2013|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/nigeria-school-attack-claims-42-lives/story-e6frg6so-1226675417375|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting crackdown has led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they have increasingly targeted civilians.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news|last=Adamu|first=Adamu|last2=Faul|first2=Michelle|title=School attack kills 30 in northeast Nigeria|date=6 June 2013|agency=AP|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/30-killed-in-school-attack-in-nigeria-1.5638194|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Boko Haram has targeted schools, killing hundreds of students. A spokesperson said such attacks would continue as long as government continued to interfere with traditional [[Koran]]-based education. More than 10,000 children are no longer able to attend school due to attacks by the Boko Haram.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Roughly 20,000 people fled Yobe State to [[Cameroon]] during June 2013 to escape the violence.&lt;ref name=Newsday/&gt;

==Attack==
Gunmen from [[Boko Haram]] entered  the college at 1 a.m. local time and opened fire on the students while they were asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/09/gunmen-storm-nigerian-college-201392910646471222.html|title=Tens killed in Nigeria college attack|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the male sleeping quarters were targeted.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic terrorists kill at least 40 students in attack on Nigerian college|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/29/college-provost-says-suspected-islamic-extremists-kill-about-50-students-in/|accessdate=29 September 2013|agency=[[Fox News]]|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-two bodies were recovered by Nigerian soldiers while eighteen injured were transported to Damaturu Specialist Hospital. Two of the wounded later died.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{Cite news|last=Adamu|first=Adamu|last2=Faul|first2=Michelle|title=Boko Haram blamed after attack on Nigerian college leaves as many as 50 dead|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/at-least-42-killed-18-injured-in-nigeria-college-attack-by-suspected-islamic-extremists/article14589188/|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002234600/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/at-least-42-killed-18-injured-in-nigeria-college-attack-by-suspected-islamic-extremists/article14589188/|archivedate=2 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one survivor, the attackers drove into the college in two double-cabin pickup [[all-terrain vehicles]].  Some were wearing Nigerian military uniforms. A survivor said that nearly all of those killed were [[Muslim]]s, as is the majority of the student body. This attack followed a 6 July 2013 [[Yobe State school shooting|attack at Mamudo]] outside Damaturu that killed 29 students and a teacher, some by burning alive, which left many schools in the area closed, and other attacks in the week following killed 30 more civilians. Boko Haram's name means "Western education is sinful".&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

After the attacks, 1000 other students fled the college. The militants appeared to be based in the Gwoza Hills, finding shelter in caves from repeated military bombardments. An engagement with the Nigerian military left 100 militants and 16 soldiers dead. In [[Gwoza]] town, where some of the victims were being treated, militants drove away medical officers from the government hospital and set fire to three public schools, and the town was reported to be deserted. More than 30,000 people from the region fled to [[Cameroon]] and [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42950">'''HIV in pregnancy''' is the presence of [[HIV]] in a woman while she is [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]. HIV in pregnancy is of concern because women with [[HIV/AIDS]] may transmit the infection to their child during pregnancy, [[childbirth]] and while [[breastfeeding]]. However, the risk of [[Vertically transmitted infection|mother-to-child transmission]] of HIV may be reduced by treatment of the HIV infection with [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]] (ART). This lifelong therapy may be initiated in women before, during, and after pregnancy. After delivery, children are also given the medication temporarily as a [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|prophylactic]] measure to reduce the risk of infection. Because HIV may also be spread through [[breast milk]], mothers in the United States who are infected are encouraged to avoid [[breastfeed]]ing.&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/perinatal_FS_en.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150421024106/http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/perinatal_FS_en.pdf | archive-date = 21 April 2015 | dead-url = yes | title = HIV and Pregnancy  | website =aidsinfo.nih.gov | access-date = 1 August 2015 | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | authors = (HHS) Panel on Treatment of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, a working group of the ''Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council'' (OARAC) }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[developing countries]] such as South Africa, where the risk of death of the infant associated with avoiding [[exclusive breastfeeding]] is higher than the risk of contracting HIV, exclusive breastfeeding in a mother who is virally suppressed is encouraged.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246260/9789241549707-eng.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Guideline: Updates on HIV and infant feeding|publisher=World Health Organisation, UNICEF|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infection with HIV/AIDS is not a [[contraindication]] to pregnancy. Women with the disease may choose to become pregnant if they desire, however, they are encouraged to talk with their doctors beforehand. Some women are unaware they have the disease until they become pregnant. In this case, they should begin antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt; With the appropriate treatment, the risk of [[HIV/AIDS#Mother-to-child|mother-to-child infection]] can be reduced to below 1%.&lt;ref name="Mother2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coutsoudis A, Kwaan L, Thomson M | title = Prevention of vertical transmission of HIV-1 in resource-limited settings | journal = Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 1163–75 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20954881 | doi = 10.1586/eri.10.94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the risk of transmission is 15–45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mother-to-child transmission of HIV|url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/mtct/en/|website = World Health Organization|access-date = 2015-11-18|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 1.4 million HIV positive women who become pregnant and contribute to more than 300,000 neonatal and fetal deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 2013 | title = Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/82207/1/WHO_RHR_13.02_eng.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of ART, transmission of HIV from the mother to child has decreased according to reports by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). In 2009, there were an estimated 400,000 children born with HIV and by 2013, there were 240,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Children and Pregnant Women Living with HIV | publisher = UNAIDS |year = 2014 |isbn = 978-92-9253-062-4 | url  = http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/09_ChildrenandpregnantwomenlivingwithHIV.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] are worst affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 2010, 30% of all pregnancies in the region were affected by HIV. In 2011, HIV was responsible for 50% of the deaths of children below the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission in South Africa|url = http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/1/12-106807/en/|website = www.who.int|access-date = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], fewer than 200 babies are born with HIV every year.&lt;ref name=aidsinfo2012/&gt;

As of 2015, [[Cuba]] has become the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 2010, the WHO partnered with the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) to implement an initiative that would provide early [[prenatal care]] and [[HIV Testing|HIV testing]] for all pregnant women in Cuba. For women who tested positive, ART was provided for both the mother and child, [[cesarean sections]] were performed, and alternatives to breastfeeding were provided. In implementing these measures, the country was successfully able to eradicate HIV transmission during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/mtct-hiv-cuba/en/|title=WHO validates elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis in Cuba|publisher=[[WHO]]| date=30 June 2015| access-date =30 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pregnancy planning==
In couples where the male and female are both HIV positive, conception may occur normally without concern for disease transmission. However, in couples where only one partner is HIV positive there is risk of transmitting the infection to the uninfected partner. These couples, known as [[serodiscordant]] couples, are advised not to engage in unprotected intercourse. Instead, [[Assisted reproductive technology|assistive reproductive method]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Leeuwen E, Prins JM, Jurriaans S, Boer K, Reiss P, Repping S, van der Veen F | title = Reproduction and fertility in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–206 | date = 2007-03-01 | pmid = 17099206 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dml052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all serodiscordant couples, the infected partner is advised to begin ART so that their [[Viral load monitoring for HIV|viral load]] is undetectable prior to attempting conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen MS, Chen YQ, McCauley M, Gamble T, Hosseinipour MC, Kumarasamy N, Hakim JG, Kumwenda J, Grinsztejn B, Pilotto JH, Godbole SV, Mehendale S, Chariyalertsak S, Santos BR, Mayer KH, Hoffman IF, Eshleman SH, Piwowar-Manning E, Wang L, Makhema J, Mills LA, de Bruyn G, Sanne I, Eron J, Gallant J, Havlir D, Swindells S, Ribaudo H, Elharrar V, Burns D, Taha TE, Nielsen-Saines K, Celentano D, Essex M, Fleming TR | display-authors = 6 | title = Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 6 | pages = 493–505 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21767103 | pmc = 3200068 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1105243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In couples where the woman is HIV negative and the man is HIV positive, sperm is collected from the male partner and HIV is removed from the specimen using a technique called [[sperm washing]]. This process is then followed by [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) or [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF). Couples may also use donor sperm from a non-infected male if desired.&lt;ref name="Savasi2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Savasi V, Mandia L, Laoreti A, Cetin I | title = Reproductive assistance in HIV serodiscordant couples | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–50 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23146867 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In couples where the woman is HIV positive and the man is HIV negative, [[artificial insemination]] is recommended.&lt;ref name="Savasi2013" /&gt;

In areas where assistive reproductive techniques, such as IUI or IVF, are not available, techniques used during intercourse can be attempted to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name = "lvguidelines" /&gt; Most importantly, the [[HPTN 052]] trial showed that when HIV infected partners were on ART and their viral load was undetectable no transmission occurred; in partners with a detectable viral load on ART there was 96% less transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen MS, Chen YQ, McCauley M, Gamble T, Hosseinipour MC, Kumarasamy N, Hakim JG, Kumwenda J, Grinsztejn B, Pilotto JH, Godbole SV, Mehendale S, Chariyalertsak S, Santos BR, Mayer KH, Hoffman IF, Eshleman SH, Piwowar-Manning E, Wang L, Makhema J, Mills LA, de Bruyn G, Sanne I, Eron J, Gallant J, Havlir D, Swindells S, Ribaudo H, Elharrar V, Burns D, Taha TE, Nielsen-Saines K, Celentano D, Essex M, Fleming TR | display-authors = 6 | title = Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 6 | pages = 493–505 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21767103 | pmc = 3200068 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1105243 | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:26667502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many serodiscordant couples use [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP) to limit transmission of the infection to the uninfected partner. Daily use of PrEP has been shown to decrease transmission of the infection by an average of 63–75%. However, use of PrEP during pregnancy has not yet been studied and its long-term effects on the foetus are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thigpen MC, Kebaabetswe PM, Paxton LA, Smith DK, Rose CE, Segolodi TM, Henderson FL, Pathak SR, Soud FA, Chillag KL, Mutanhaurwa R, Chirwa LI, Kasonde M, Abebe D, Buliva E, Gvetadze RJ, Johnson S, Sukalac T, Thomas VT, Hart C, Johnson JA, Malotte CK, Hendrix CW, Brooks JT | display-authors = 6 | title = Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis for heterosexual HIV transmission in Botswana | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 5 | pages = 423–34 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22784038 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although assisted reproductive techniques are available for serodiscordant couples, there are still limitations to achieving a successful pregnancy. Women with HIV have been shown to have decreased fertility, which can affect the available reproductive options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glynn JR, Buvé A, Caraël M, Kahindo M, Macauley IB, Musonda RM, Jungmann E, Tembo F, Zekeng L | title = Decreased fertility among HIV-1-infected women attending antenatal clinics in three African cities | journal = Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–52 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11114835 | doi = 10.1097/00126334-200012010-00008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with HIV are also more likely to be infected with other sexually transmitted diseases, placing them at higher risk for infertility. Males with HIV appear to have decreased semen volume and sperm motility, which decreases their fertility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ART may also affect both male and female fertility and some drugs can be [[Teratogen|toxic]] to embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kushnir VA, Lewis W | title = Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and infertility: emerging problems in the era of highly active antiretrovirals | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 546–53 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21722892 | pmc = 3165097 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.05.094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there have been cases where an HIV-negative partner was infected with the disease despite artificial insemination with washed sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = HIV-1 infection and artificial insemination with processed semen | journal = MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 39 | issue = 15 | pages = 249, 255–6 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 2109169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV testing in pregnancy==
{{Further|Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS}}
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] for all pregnant women as a part of routine prenatal care. The test is usually performed in the first trimester of pregnancy with other routine laboratory tests. HIV testing is recommended because HIV-infected women who do not receive testing are more likely to transmit the infection to their children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Opt-Out{{!}} Pregnant Women, Infants, and Children {{!}} Gender {{!}} HIV by Group {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/pregnantwomen/opt-out.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV testing may be offered to pregnant women on an ''opt-in'' or an ''opt-out'' basis. In the ''opt-in'' model, women are counseled on HIV testing and elect to receive the test by signing a consent form. In the ''opt-out'' model, the HIV test is automatically performed with other routine prenatal tests. If a woman does not want to be tested for HIV, she must specifically refuse the test and sign a form declining testing. The CDC recommends ''opt-out'' testing for all pregnant women because it improves disease detection and treatment and helps reduce transmission to children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If a woman chooses to decline testing, she will not receive the test. However, she will continue to receive HIV counseling throughout the pregnancy so that she may be as informed as possible about the disease and its impact. She will be offered HIV testing at all stages of her pregnancy in case she changes her mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/hivtestingandpregnancy_fs_en.pdf | access-date = 1 February 2012 | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) | title = Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV testing begins with a [[Screening (medicine)|screening test]]. The most common screening test is the [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|rapid HIV antibody test]] which tests for HIV [[Antibody|antibodies]] in blood, urine, or oral fluid. HIV antibodies are only produced if an individual is infected with the disease. Therefore, presence of the antibodies is indicative of an HIV infection. Sometimes, however, a person may be infected with HIV but the body has not produced enough antibodies to be detected by the test. If a woman has risk factors for HIV infection but tests negative on the initial screening test, she should be retested in 3 months to confirm that she does not have HIV.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cornett JK, Kirn TJ | title = Laboratory diagnosis of HIV in adults: a review of current methods | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 712–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23667267 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cit281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another screening test that is more specific is the [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV antigen/antibody test]]. This is a newer blood test that can detect HIV infection quicker than the antibody test because it detects both virus particles and antibodies in the blood.&lt;ref name="pmid23911678"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masciotra S, Luo W, Youngpairoj AS, Kennedy MS, Wells S, Ambrose K, Sprinkle P, Owen SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Performance of the Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Rapid Test with specimens from HIV-1 seroconverters from the US and HIV-2 infected individuals from Ivory Coast | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology : the Official Publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology | volume = 58 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e54–8 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23911678 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcv.2013.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any woman who has a positive HIV screening test must receive follow-up testing to confirm the diagnosis. The follow-up test can differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 and is a more specific antibody test. It may also detect the virus directly in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Prevention of mother-to-child transmission==
HIV/AIDS may be [[Vertically transmitted infection|vertically transmitted]] from a mother to her child. This means the infection may be spread during pregnancy, [[Childbirth|labor]], delivery, or breastfeeding. 70% of transmissions are believed to occur during delivery when the baby comes into direct contact with the mother's infected blood or genital secretions/fluid in the birth canal. 30% of infections occur [[in utero]] during the pregnancy with 66% occurring within the last 14 days of a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Minkoff H | title = Human immunodeficiency virus infection in pregnancy | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 101 | issue = 4 | pages = 797–810 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12681888 | doi = 10.1097/00006250-200304000-00038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism for in utero infection is not well understood, but the current belief is that infected maternal secretions may cross the placenta during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee TH, Chafets DM, Biggar RJ, McCune JM, Busch MP | title = The role of transplacental microtransfusions of maternal lymphocytes in in utero HIV transmission | journal = Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–7 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20683195 | pmc = 3509795 | doi = 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181eb301e }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of HIV transmission from a mother to child is most directly related to the plasma [[viral load]] of the mother. Untreated mothers with a viral load &gt;100,000 copies/ml have a transmission risk of over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garcia PM, Kalish LA, Pitt J, Minkoff H, Quinn TC, Burchett SK, Kornegay J, Jackson B, Moye J, Hanson C, Zorrilla C, Lew JF | display-authors = 6 | title = Maternal levels of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA and the risk of perinatal transmission. Women and Infants Transmission Study Group | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 341 | issue = 6 | pages = 394–402 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10432324 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199908053410602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For women with a viral load &lt;1000 copies/ml, the risk of transmission is less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = European Collaborative Study | title = Mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 458–65 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15668871 | doi = 10.1086/427287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the lower the viral load the lower the risk of transmission. For this reason, ART is recommended throughout the pregnancy so that viral load levels remain as low as possible and the risk of transmission is reduced.

Women with an established diagnosis of HIV often begin ART before becoming pregnant to treat the infection. It is recommended that all pregnant women begin ART regardless of CD4 counts or viral load to reduce the risk of transmission. The earlier ART is initiated, the more likely the viral load will be suppressed by the time of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend CL, Byrne L, Cortina-Borja M, Thorne C, de Ruiter A, Lyall H, Taylor GP, Peckham CS, Tookey PA | display-authors = 6 | title = Earlier initiation of ART and further decline in mother-to-child HIV transmission rates, 2000-2011 | journal = AIDS | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 1049–57 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24566097 | doi = 10.1097/QAD.0000000000000212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women are concerned about using ART early in the pregnancy, as babies are most susceptible to drug toxicities during the first trimester.  However, delay in ART initiation may prove less effective in reducing infection transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffman RM, Black V, Technau K, van der Merwe KJ, Currier J, Coovadia A, Chersich M | title = Effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy duration and regimen on risk for mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Johannesburg, South Africa | journal = Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–41 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20216425 | pmc = 2880466 | doi = 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181cf9979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiretroviral therapy is used at the following times in pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV:&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt; 
* During pregnancy: pregnant women infected with HIV receive an oral regimen of at least three different anti-HIV medications (such as [[Tenofovir disoproxil|tenofovir]], [[emtricitabine]] and [[efavirenz]]).
* During labor and delivery: pregnant women infected with HIV and already on triple ART are recommended to continue with their oral regimen. If their viral load is &gt;1,000 copies/ml or there is question about whether medications have been taken consistently, then [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[zidovudine]] (AZT) is added at the time of delivery.&lt;ref name = "lvguidelines" /&gt; Pregnant women who have not been on ART prior to delivery or who have been on ART for less than four weeks should also be given intravenous AZT or a single dose of [[nifedipine]] (NVD), tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and a three-hourly dose of AZT.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Indications to start medications===
According to current recommendations by the WHO, US CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), all individuals with HIV should begin ART. The recommendation is stronger under the following conditions:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title = When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy {{!}} HIV/AIDS Fact Sheets {{!}} Education Materials {{!}} AIDSinfo|url = https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets/21/52/when-to-start-antiretroviral-therapy|website = AIDSinfo|access-date = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CD4 count]] below 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* High viral load (&gt;100,000 copies/ml)
* Progression of HIV to AIDS
* Development of HIV-related infections and illnesses
* Pregnancy
Women are encouraged to begin treatment as soon as they are diagnosed with HIV. If they are diagnosed prior to pregnancy, they should continue with ART during the pregnancy. If the diagnosis of HIV is made during the pregnancy, ART should be initiated immediately.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Medications during pregnancy===
The goal of antiretroviral use during pregnancy is to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. It is important to choose medications that are safe for the mother and the fetus and which are effective at decreasing the total viral load. Some studies have shown an increase in stillbirths, preterm delivery, and delayed fetal growth in women using high doses of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. However, the overall benefits of ART are believed to outweigh the risks and all women are encouraged to use ART for the duration of their pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JY, Ribaudo HJ, Souda S, Parekh N, Ogwu A, Lockman S, Powis K, Dryden-Peterson S, Creek T, Jimbo W, Madidimalo T, Makhema J, Essex M, Shapiro RL | display-authors = 6 | title = Highly active antiretroviral therapy and adverse birth outcomes among HIV-infected women in Botswana | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 206 | issue = 11 | pages = 1695–705 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23066160 | pmc = 3488194 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jis553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to physiological changes in the body during pregnancy, it may be necessary to alter the dosing of medications so that they remain effective. Generally, the dose or the frequency of dosing are increased to account for these changes.

The recommended ART regimen for HIV-positive pregnant women consists of drugs from 4 different classes of medications listed below. In the United States, the favored regimen is a three-drug regimen where the first two drugs are NRTIs and the third is either a protease inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor, or an NNRTI.&lt;ref name="lvguidelines"&gt;{{cite web | author = Panel on Treatment of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. | title = Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/PerinatalGL.pdf | access-date = 20 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs) are considered the "backbone" of ART and 2 medications are generally used in combination. Due to its known safety profile and extensive use in pregnant patients, [[zidovudine]]-[[lamivudine]] (ZDV/3TC) is the preferred choice as the NRTI backbone. Zidovudine may worsen anemia, so patients with anemia are advised to use an alternative agent. For women who are coinfected with [[hepatitis B]], [[tenofovir]] (TDF) with either [[emtricitabine]] (FTC) or lamivudine is the preferred NRTI backbone.&lt;ref name="lvguidelines" /&gt; NRTI use may cause [[lactic acidosis]] in some women, so it is important to monitor patients for this complication. Deaths from lactic acidosis and liver failure have been associated with the use of two NRTIs, [[stavudine]] and [[didanosine]] (d4t and ddl, respectively); therefore, combinations involving these drugs should be avoided in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt;
*[[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|Protease inhibitor]]s (PIs) have been studied extensively in pregnancy and are therefore the preferred third drug in the regimen. [[Atazanavir]]-[[ritonavir]] (ATV/r) and [[darunavir]]-ritonavir (DRV/r) are two of the most common PIs used during pregnancy. There is conflicting data regarding their association with preterm births, so women who are at a high risk for premature delivery are advised not to use PIs.&lt;ref name="lvguidelines" /&gt; Some PIs have been associated with [[hyperglycemia]] but is unclear whether they add to the risk of developing [[gestational diabetes]].&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt; Some PIs have been noted to cause [[hyperbilirubinemia]] and nausea, so these side effects should be monitored for closely.
*[[Integrase inhibitor]]s (IIs) are generally the third drug in the regimen when a PI cannot be used. They rapidly reduce the viral load and for this reason, they are often used in women who are diagnosed with HIV late in their pregnancy. [[Raltegravir]] (RAL) is the most common used.
*[[Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NNRTIs), the most popular being [[efavirenz]] (EFV) and [[nevirapine]] (NVP), may be used during pregnancy. However, there are significant toxicities associated with their use, making them a less desirable option. 
**[[Efavirenz]] ([[brand name]] Sustiva, shortened as EFV, and a component of the combination drug [[Atripla]]) is classified as a [[Pregnancy category|category D]] drug by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] indicating there are risks associated with its use during pregnancy. In a study analyzing the use of the drug in pregnant women, 2.3% of births were associated with birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021360s024lbl.pdf|title = HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION|access-date = 2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a systematic review of the safety of EFV use in humans during the first trimester found no increase in birth defects among women using the drug.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford N, Calmy A, Mofenson L | title = Safety of efavirenz in the first trimester of pregnancy:  an updated systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = AIDS | volume = 25 | issue = 18 | pages = 2301–4 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21918421 | doi = 10.1097/QAD.0b013e32834cdb71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the uncertain potential for risk, the U.S. DHHS recommends against using EFV in the first trimester of pregnancy or in women who may become pregnant. They instead recommend a protease inhibitor based regimen with [[lopinavir]] (LPV) or ATV.&lt;ref name="lvguidelines" /&gt; However, to simplify regimens and provide a uniform recommendation for HIV-infected individuals during pregnancy, the WHO continues to recommend efavirenz as a first line agent for HIV positive women.&lt;ref name="who2013"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013/download/en/|title = WHO {{!}} Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection |date = June 30, 2013|isbn = 978 92 4 150572 7|pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women using EFV prior to their pregnancy may continue with the drug as it is more dangerous to stop or change medications during pregnancy because this can result in improper control of the viral load.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
**[[Nevirapine]] ([[trade name]] Viramune, and shortened NVP) increases the risk of very serious liver damage in women with CD4 counts greater than 250 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; . It is generally avoided in pregnant women. Women taking NVP safely prior to pregnancy may continue with the medication because NVP-related liver damage has not been seen in women previously using the medication.&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt;

===Nutritional supplements===
[[Vitamin A]] plays a role in the [[immune system]] and is a low-cost intervention that has been suggested to help with preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. A Cochrane review&lt;ref&gt;Wiysonge CS, Ndze VN, Kongnyuy EJ, Shey MS. Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2017, Issue 9. Art. No.: CD003648. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003648.pub4.&lt;/ref&gt; summarised the evidence of five trials conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005, where none of the participants received [[antiretroviral therapy]]. They found that giving vitamin A supplementation to pregnant women or to women after they delivered a baby probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The intervention has been largely superseded by antiretroviral therapy.

===Labor and delivery===
Women should continue their ART regimen through childbirth.

The viral load helps determine which mode of delivery is safest for the mother and the baby. In cases where the viral load is low (&lt;1000 copies/mL), the risk of transmission is low and a vaginal delivery may be performed. A cesarean section, on the other hand, is generally performed at 38 weeks gestation under the following circumstances:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title = HIV and pregnancy|url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics|website = www.uptodate.com|access-date = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Viral load is high (&gt;1000 copies/mL) or unknown at the time of delivery
* Mother did not receive ART during the pregnancy
* Mother is concerned about exposing her child to infected blood and genital secretions during the delivery
If, before her scheduled cesarean section, a woman's [[rupture of membranes|water breaks]] and she goes into labor, a cesarean section may not significantly reduce the risk of infection transmission. Under this circumstance, if there is no other medical reason to proceed with a cesarean section, a vaginal delivery may be performed and may be the safest for the mother and the baby.&lt;ref name=aidsinfo2012/&gt;

Women who present to the hospital in labor with an unknown HIV status should undergo immediate HIV testing. If the initial screening test is positive, the mother should immediately be given a single dose of nifedipine (NVD), tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and a three-hourly dose of zidovudine (AZT) and the baby should receive prophylactic ART after birth. This will help reduce the risk of HIV transmission during labor and delivery. A confirmatory HIV test should also be performed in the meantime. If the test results are positive, treatment should continue. If the results are negative, the medications may be stopped.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Breastfeeding ===
Women may transmit HIV to their child via [[Breast milk|breastmilk]]. For this reason, [[breastfeeding]] is discouraged in the United States amongst HIV-positive women.&lt;ref name="aidsinfo2012" /&gt; However, in [[developing countries]] such as [[South Africa]], where the risk of death of the infant associated with avoiding [[exclusive breastfeeding]] is higher than the risk of contracting HIV, exclusive breastfeeding in a mother who is virally suppressed is encouraged.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In [[developed countries]], where clean water and infant formula are both accessible and available, HIV-positive women should not breastfeed. They should use formula to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the child. Even if the mother is on ART, she should avoid breastfeeding as HIV can still be transmitted through the breastmilk. Some women elect to use [[Human milk banking in North America|donor milk]] (breast milk donated from non-HIV infected mothers) instead of formula so that their child may receive the health benefits of breast milk, the most notable being increased immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoddinott P, Tappin D, Wright C | title = Breast feeding | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7649 | pages = 881–7 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18420694 | pmc = 2323059 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39521.566296.BE | hdl = 1893/10055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In underdeveloped countries, where clean water and formula are not as readily available, breastfeeding is encouraged to provide the child with adequate food and nutrients. The benefit of nourishment outweighs the risk of HIV transmission so breastfeeding is acceptable.&lt;ref name="who2013" /&gt; The [[South African Department of Health]] guidelines state that HIV-infected mothers should exclusively breastfeed, that is the infant's diet should consist of breastmilk only and should not be supplemented with water, other liquids or foods, for 6 months after birth. After 6 months, the mother should introduce complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to 24 months.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.sahivsoc.org/Files/ART%20Guidelines%2015052015.pdf | title=National Consolidated Guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and the management of HIV in children, adolescents and adults |publisher=National Department of Health, South Africa|year=|isbn=|location=|publication-date=April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:7&lt;/sup&gt;

In a study conducted in South Africa, 1.1% of children born to HIV-infected mothers who were uninfected at 6 weeks of age, were infected within 1 month of breastfeeding and 4.0% were infected by 6 months of age.&lt;ref name="pmid17398310"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coovadia HM, Rollins NC, Bland RM, Little K, Coutsoudis A, Bennish ML, Newell ML | display-authors = 6 | title = Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection during exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life: an intervention cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9567 | pages = 1107–16 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17398310 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60283-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Malawi found that the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding was 7% in children who breastfed for one year and 10% in children who breastfed for two years. The risk of HIV infection appears to be highest in the early months of breastfeeding and HIV-infected mothers who are not virally suppressed should avoid breastfeeding entirely if possible.&lt;ref name="pmid10463709"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miotti PG, Taha TE, Kumwenda NI, Broadhead R, Mtimavalye LA, Van der Hoeven L, Chiphangwi JD, Liomba G, Biggar RJ | display-authors = 6 | title = HIV transmission through breastfeeding: a study in Malawi | journal = Jama | volume = 282 | issue = 8 | pages = 744–9 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10463709 | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.8.744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a systematic review commissioned by the WHO found that there is a very low risk (1.1%) of postnatal HIV transmission in infants breastfed by mothers on lifelong ART that was initiated in early to mid pregnancy. The overall risk of transmission was 3.3%, including exposures ''in utero'' and during childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bispo S, Chikhungu L, Rollins N, Siegfried N, Newell ML | title = Postnatal HIV transmission in breastfed infants of HIV-infected women on ART: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of the International AIDS Society | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 21251 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28362072 | pmc = 5467610 | doi = 10.7448/IAS.20.1.21251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another systematic review found that prolonged breastfeeding for infants born to mothers on lifelong ART is beneficial in terms of HIV‐free survival at least up to 24 months of age – increasing HIV-free survival rates from 89% to 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chikhungu LC, Bispo S, Rollins N, Siegfried N, Newell ML | title = HIV-free survival at 12-24 months in breastfed infants of HIV-infected women on antiretroviral treatment | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 820–8 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27120500 | pmc = 5096069 | doi = 10.1111/tmi.12710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the mother has a high HIV [[viral load]] (&gt;1000 copies/L), replacement feeding, such as formula, is only initiated as per the [[UNAIDS]] guidelines, termed the AFASS criteria, "where replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/feeding.htm|title=WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF infant feeding guidelines|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unicef.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:95-6&lt;/sup&gt; A mother may only be given infant formula, as explained by the WHO, if the following conditions are met:&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

* "Safe water and sanitation are assured at the household level and in the community; and
* the mother or other caregiver can reliably provide sufficient infant formula milk to support the normal growth and development of the infant; and
* the mother or caregiver can prepare it cleanly and frequently enough so that it is safe and carries a low risk of diarrhoea and malnutrition; and 
* the mother or caregiver can exclusively give infant formula milk in the first six months; and 
* the family is supportive of this practice; and 
* the mother or caregiver can access health care that offers comprehensive child health services."

==Other considerations during pregnancy==
Pregnant women with HIV may still receive the trivalent inactivated [[influenza vaccine]] and the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="MadhiCutland2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Madhi SA, Cutland CL, Kuwanda L, Weinberg A, Hugo A, Jones S, Adrian PV, van Niekerk N, Treurnicht F, Ortiz JR, Venter M, Violari A, Neuzil KM, Simões EA, Klugman KP, Nunes MC | display-authors = 6 | title = Influenza vaccination of pregnant women and protection of their infants | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 10 | pages = 918–31 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25184864 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1401480 | hdl = 2263/42412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many patients who are HIV positive also have other health conditions known as [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]]. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis and injection drug use are some of the most common comorbidities associated with HIV. Women who screen positive for HIV should also be tested for these conditions so that they may be adequately treated or controlled during the pregnancy. The comorbidities may have serious adverse effects on the mother and child during pregnancy, so it is extremely important to identify them early during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomon SS, Hawcroft CS, Narasimhan P, Subbaraman R, Srikrishnan AK, Cecelia AJ, Suresh Kumar M, Solomon S, Gallant JE, Celentano DD | display-authors = 6 | title = Comorbidities among HIV-infected injection drug users in Chennai, India | journal = The Indian Journal of Medical Research | volume = 127 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–52 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18653907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postnatal care==
Babies born to HIV-positive women should receive a 6-week or 12-week course of zidovudine (AZT). The medication should ideally be started within the first 6 to 12 hours of life, but can be started up to 72 hours after birth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; A 6-week course should be initiated if the mother has been on ART for more than four weeks before birth, and a 12-week course should be initiated if the mother is newly diagnosed or has been on ART for less than four weeks before birth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The baby should be tested for HIV at birth, 4 weeks after cessation of AZT (10 weeks or 16 weeks, depending on length of AZT course, after birth), 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding and at 18 months.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Usual antibody based testing is unreliable in infants until the age of 18 months due to the transmission of [[maternal antibodies]]. A qualitative HIV [[DNA]] [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] assay is recommended as it will detect pro-viral HIV DNA since HIV RNA may be suppressed by ART.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Read JS | title = Diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in children younger than 18 months in the United States | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = e1547-62 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18055670 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure the baby is HIV-negative, there must be two negative test results. Since zidovudine has been known to cause or worsen anemia, the baby's blood count should be routinely checked during AZT therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States. | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines | access-date = 21 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the risk of developing ''[[Pneumocystis pneumonia|Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|pneumonia]] (PJP), all infants born to HIV-positive mothers should receive [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] (cotrimoxazole) from 4–6 weeks after birth, and stop prophylaxis when they are no longer at risk of contracting HIV from their mother.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Although the risk is very low, HIV can also be transmitted to a baby through food that was previously chewed (pre-chewed) by a mother or caretaker infected with HIV. To be safe, babies should not be fed pre-chewed food.&lt;ref name=aidsinfo2012/&gt;

'''Jean Jolliffe Yancey''' (August 18, 1914 – September 15, 2000) was an American entrepreneur, [[small business]] consultant, women's business mentor, and motivational speaker. After working in retail and fashion in [[New York City]] and [[Denver]], Colorado, she opened Jean Yancey &amp; Associates in the latter city in 1973, offering training, consulting, and education for women entrepreneurs. In close to 30 years, she assisted more than 1,000 women launching businesses in public relations, advertising, politics, publishing, and other fields, and was known in Denver as "the mother of all businesswomen". She received many awards, including the 1982 National Advocate for Women in Small Businesses award presented by US President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a ceremony in the [[White House Rose Garden]]. She was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1985.

== Early life ==
Yancey was born Martha Jean Jolliffe on August 18, 1914, in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=dp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/business/biz0921a.htm|title=Friend to businesswomen dies at 86|first=George|last=Lane|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=21 September 2000|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was eight years old, her family relocated to [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eadsrv.denverlibrary.org/sdx/pl/doc-tdm.xsp?id=WH1176_d0e35&amp;fmt=text&amp;base=fa|title=Biographical Note|publisher=[[Denver Public Library]]|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student at [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]], she and her friend Jane Smith persuaded the president of [[The Denver Dry Goods Company]] to host the first high school fashion show in the United States.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; The three-day event drew 5,000 teens and their mothers.&lt;ref name=next&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62369769.html|title=Jean Yancey: The Next Generation|first=Irene|last=Rawlings|date=1 May 2000|accessdate=12 September 2018|work=ColoradoBiz|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Yancey studied drama and theatre at the [[University of Denver]] for two and a half years,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; becoming a member of [[Gamma Phi Beta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gpbarchives.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1934_May.pdf |title=Chapter Letters: Theta Denver|journal=The Crescent of Gamma Phi Beta|date=May 1934|volume=34|issue=2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 she moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career in [[Broadway theatre]].&lt;ref name=next/&gt; In New York, she met and married Lenard Royston Yancey Jr. in April 1937.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; The couple had three sons.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

==Career==
In New York, Yancey worked in the bridal department at [[B. Altman and Company]] and at Joseph Bryne, organizing a large trade show for the latter.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=next/&gt; During World War II, when her husband was stationed in Denver, she worked as a buyer for teen fashions at Denver Dry Goods.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1944 her husband was stationed in [[Tampa, Florida]], and in 1948 in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].

'''John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV''' (July 13, 1864 – April 15, 1912) was an American businessman, real estate builder, investor, inventor, writer, lieutenant colonel in the [[Spanish–American War]], and a prominent member of the [[Astor family]].

Astor died in the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of RMS ''Titanic'']] during the early hours of April 15, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Noted Men On The Lost Titanic. Col.

==Early life, education, and family==
John Jacob Astor IV was born on July 13, 1864 at his parents' country estate [[Ferncliff forest|Ferncliff]] in [[Rhinebeck, New York]]. He was the youngest of five children and only son of businessman, collector, and race horse breeder/owner [[William Backhouse Astor, Jr.]] and socialite [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor|Caroline Webster "Lina" Schermerhorn]]. His four elder sisters were Emily (1854–1881), Helen (1855–1893), Charlotte (1858–1920), and Caroline ("Carrie") (1861–1948). He was a great-grandson of fur-trader [[John Jacob Astor]] and Sarah Cox Todd (1761–1834), whose fortune made the Astor family one of the wealthiest in the United States. Astor's paternal grandfather [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.]] was a prominent real estate businessman. Through his paternal grandmother Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong (1800–1872), Astor was also a great-grandson of Senator [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] and Alida Livingston (1761–1822) of the [[Livingston family]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Abraham Schermerhorn]], a wealthy merchant, and socialite Helen Van Courtlandt White. He was also a nephew of financer/philanthropist [[John Jacob Astor III]] and grandnephew of occasional poet John Jacob Astor, Jr. (1791–1869). His sister Helen's husband was diplomat [[James Roosevelt Roosevelt|James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt]], half-brother of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] of the [[Roosevelt family]]. Another sister, Carrie, a noted philanthropist, was the wife of Marshall Orme Wilson (1860–1926), brother of banker [[Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr.]] and socialite [[Grace Vanderbilt|Grace Graham Wilson]]. Astor was also a first cousin of [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor]]

Astor attended [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] and later attended [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt;  Astor went by the name "Jack". His ungainly appearance and the perception that he was an aimless dilettante led one newspaper to give him the name "Jack Ass-tor".&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite web|title=An Age of Splendor, and Hotel One-Upmanship |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/business/yourmoney/18shelf.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]|quote=His younger cousin, known as Jack, enrolled in Harvard, left without a degree, traveled and joined 'about two dozen clubs.' He tinkered with inventions, married unwisely and, inspired by Jules Verne, wrote a work of science fiction. Often ridiculed in the press, he bore the sobriquet 'Jack Ass.'|date=June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Alan Morrison, Waldorf Astoria, Arcadia Publishing - 2014, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1891,&lt;ref name=TitanicProfile&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonel John Jacob Astor IV|url=http://www.titanicpages.com/1stclass/johnjacobastor|publisher=Titanic History Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astor married socialite [[Ava Lowle Willing]], a daughter of Edward Shippen Willing and Alice Barton. The couple had two children:
* [[Vincent Astor|William Vincent Astor]], born in 1891. He later became a businessman and philanthropist
* [[Ava Alice Muriel Astor]], born in 1902.
Astor and Willing divorced in November 1909.  Compounding the scandal of their divorce was Astor's announcement that he would remarry.&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt; At the age of 47, Astor married 18-year-old socialite [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Talmage Force]], the sister of real estate businesswoman and socialite [[Katherine Emmons Force]]. Their parents were William Hurlbut Force and Katherine Arvilla Talmage. Astor and Force were married in his mother's ballroom at [[Beechwood (mansion)|Beechwood]], the family's [[Newport, Rhode Island]], mansion. There was also much controversy over their 29-year age difference.&lt;ref name="titanic survivor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanic Survivor Stories - Madeleine Talmage Force Astor|url=http://www.rmstitanic.net/community/blog/268-titanic-survivor-madeleine|publisher=rmstitanic.net|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Vincent despised Force,&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web|title=Part II: Vincent, the Astor Who Gave Away the Money|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/317873/print|publisher=NewYorkSocialDaily|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet he served as best man at his father's wedding.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia titanica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Col. Astor Weds Madeleine Force  |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/col-astor-weds-madeleine-force.html|publisher=encyclopedia titanica|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple took an extended honeymoon in [[Europe]] and [[Egypt]] to wait for the gossip to calm down. Among the few Americans who did not spurn him at this time was [[Margaret Brown]], later fictionalized as ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]''. She accompanied the Astors to Egypt and [[France]]. After receiving a call to return to the United States, Brown accompanied the couple back home aboard {{RMS|Titanic}}.&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt;

==Careers==
Among Astor's accomplishments was ''[[A Journey in Other Worlds]]'' (1894), a science fiction novel about life in the year 2000 on the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foster, John Wilson |title=The Age of Titanic: Cross-Currents in Anglo-American Culture |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also patented several inventions, including a bicycle brake in 1898, a "vibratory disintegrator" used to produce gas from [[sphagnum|peat moss]], and a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] road-improver, and he helped develop a [[turbine|turbine engine]]. Astor made millions in real estate. In 1897, Astor built the Astoria Hotel, "the world's most luxurious hotel",&lt;ref name=WaldorfAstoriaHotel&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkel|first=Stanley|title=The Original Waldorf/Astoria Hotel|url=http://www.hotelinteractive.com/article.aspx?articleid=7469|publisher=hotelinteractive.com|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City, adjoining the Waldorf Hotel owned by Astor's cousin and rival, William. The complex became known as the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. The Waldorf-Astoria would later be the host location to the U.S. inquiries into the sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'', on which Astor died.&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt;

===Military service===
From 1894 to 1896, he was a colonel on the military staff of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Levi P. Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Astor, John Jacob (capitalist)|display=Astor, John Jacob. An American capitalist, inventor, and soldier|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, Astor personally financed a volunteer artillery unit known as the "Astor Battery", which saw service in the Philippines. In May 1898, Astor was appointed a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the U.S. Volunteers and served as an officer on the staff of Major General [[William Shafter]] in [[Cuba]], during the [[Siege of Santiago|Santiago Campaign]]. He was later given a brevet (honorary promotion) to colonel in recognition of his services.  He was mustered out of the Volunteer Army in November 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (April 16, 1912).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, he allowed his [[yacht]] ''Nourmahal'' to be used by the U.S. government. He appeared in the films ''President McKinley's Inspection of Camp Wikoff'' (1898) and ''Col. John Jacob Astor, Staff and Veterans of the Spanish–American War'' (1899).&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt; As a result of his military service, Astor was entitled to the [[Spanish Campaign Medal]].  After the war, Astor was often referred to as "Colonel Astor."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:JJAstorIV.jpg|thumb|left|Astor and his second wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Talmage Force]].]]
Astor was a member of several military and hereditary societies. He was an early member of the New York [[Society of Colonial Wars]] and was assigned membership number 138. He was also a member of the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]], [[Society of the Army of Santiago de Cuba]], and the Society of the American Wars of the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Residence==
[[File:The Indoor Tennis Court.jpg|thumb|Le Court de Tennis intérieur.]]
Astor's estate "[[Ferncliff forest|Ferncliff]]", north of the town center of [[Rhinebeck, New York]], with a mile and a half of Hudson River frontage in the picturesque Lower [[Hudson River Valley]], had been purchased [[wikt:piecemeal|piecemeal]] by his father in the mid-19th century; Astor was born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Automobile Club of America|work=The Club Journal|issue=2|date=November 12, 1910|title=Little Journeys to the Homes of Members: Ferncliff|page=1002ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's Italianate house of 1864 was partly rebuilt in 1904 to designs by [[Stanford White]] of [[McKim, Mead, and White]], retaining its conservative exterior, and a sports pavilion in Louis XVI style was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldberger, Paul |title=A Monograph of the works of McKim, Mead &amp; White, 1879–1915|date= 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Casino" or "Astor Courts" reportedly housed the first residential indoor swimming pool in the U.S., an indoor tennis court with vaulting of [[Guastavino tile]],  and guest bedrooms; in the lower level were a bowling alley and a shooting range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astorcourts.com/about.htm|website=AstorCourts.com|title=About|accessdate=September 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914054331/http://www.astorcourts.com/about.htm|archive-date=September 14, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate, reduced to {{convert|50|acre|m2}} and renamed "Astor Courts", eventually became a wedding venue.

==''Titanic''==
[[File:Madeleine JackAstor.jpg|thumb|Astor with his wife, Madeleine Force Astor, and their Airedale, Kitty.]]
[[File:Titanic-New York Herald front page 2.jpeg|thumb|''[[The New York Herald]]'' report of the sinking of ''Titanic''. Most reports featured the Astors in the headlines.]]

While traveling, Madeleine Force Astor became pregnant. Wanting the child born in the U.S., the Astors boarded ''Titanic'' on her [[maiden voyage]] to New York. They embarked in [[Cherbourg]], France, in first class and were the wealthiest passengers aboard. Accompanying the Astors were Astor's valet, Victor Robbins; Force's maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Louise Endres. They also took their pet [[Airedale Terrier|Airedale]], Kitty. The Astors were deeply fond of their dog and had come close to losing her on a previous trip when she went missing in Egypt. Kitty did not survive the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-10/fate-pets-who-sailed-titanic |title=Fate of the pets who sailed on the Titanic |publisher=Lostandfond.co.uk |date=October 2, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321205230/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-10/fate-pets-who-sailed-titanic |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanic-passengers.com/johnjacobastor.htm|accessdate=February 16, 2012|title=John Jacob Astor IV|publisher=titanic-passengers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short while after ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg that caused her to sink, Astor informed his wife of the collision but told her the damage did not appear to be serious. Some time later, as the ship's [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|lifeboats]] for first class were being manned, Astor remained unperturbed; he and his family played with the mechanical horses in the gymnasium. At some point Astor is thought to have sliced the lining of an extra lifebelt with a pen knife to show his wife its contents, either to prove they were not of use or to reassure her that they were. He even declared: "We are safer here than in that little boat."{{sfn|Lord|1976|pp=73–4}}&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt;

When Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] later arrived on A Deck to finish loading Lifeboat 4, Astor helped his wife, with her maid and nurse, into it. He then asked if he might join his wife because she was in "a delicate condition"; however, Lightoller told him men were not to be allowed to board until all the women and children had been loaded. According to ''Titanic'' passenger [[Archibald Gracie IV]], "She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, "No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off." Mr Astor then said, "Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards," or words to that effect. The answer came back, "Number 4."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq11Gracie01.php |website=United States Senate Inquiry into the Titanic|title= Online reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to child survivor Betty, as quoted on ''Children on the Titanic'' (2014), Astor was boarding the final lifeboat with his pregnant wife when he saw two scared children on deck and stepped aside,  giving his place to them.&lt;!--can be seen on ''Children on the Titanic'' (2014) - timestamp 31:30" on [[Hulu Plus]]--&gt; A conflicting news article posted in the ''[[Chicago Record-Herald|Chicago Record Herald]]'' tells of Astor placing his wife into the final lifeboat then ordering Ida Sophia Hippach and her 17-year-old daughter Jean Gertrude to take the final two places before the boat set sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicagoans saved by Astor - Chicago Record Herald|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/chicagoans-saved-by-astor.html|accessdate=1 March 2015|publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica|date=22 April 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lifeboat 4 was lowered at 1:55 am, Astor is said to have stood alone while others tried to free the remaining collapsible boats;&lt;ref name=titanic/&gt; he was last seen alive on the starboard bridge wing, smoking a cigarette with [[Jacques Futrelle]]. A mere half hour later, the ship disappeared beneath the ocean. Survivor Philip Mock claimed to have seen Astor in the water clinging to a raft with [[William Thomas Stead]]. "Their feet became frozen," said Mock, "and they were forced to release their hold.

==Legacy==
According to Walter Lord, "After [the Titanic] sank, the ''[[New York American]]'' broke the news on April 16 with a lead devoted almost entirely to John Jacob Astor; at the end it mentioned that 1800 others were also lost."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ice-so-funny/&lt;/ref&gt; Astor's prominence led to the creation of many exaggerated and unsubstantiated accounts about his actions during the sinking of the ''Titanic''. One story alleges that he opened the ship's [[kennel]] and released the dogs, including his own beloved Airedale, Kitty; in another, he placed a woman's hat on a boy to make sure the child was able to get into a lifeboat. Another legend claims that after the ship hit the iceberg, he quipped, "I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous." These stories appeared in newspapers, magazines, and even books about the sinking. In reality, none of the claims about Astor's actions were substantiated, as nobody who recognized him survived other than the women who boarded lifeboats relatively early on.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Wyn Craig |title=Titanic: End of a Dream |publisher=Penguin Books |orig-year=1979, 1986 (revised) |location=New York City |pages=70–73 |isbn=978-0140166910}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wade wrote that the ice joke is almost certainly apocryphal, as Astor was not known for making jokes, and that the story about the hat (like many other "survivor stories" published shortly after the sinking) may have been invented by the reporter.&lt;ref name=wade/&gt; Another legend is that Astor was crushed to death by one of the ship's falling [[smokestack|funnels]].&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'', December 1985, Vol. 168, No.6 page 712&lt;/ref&gt; However, this legend was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wormstedt.com/GeorgeBehe/page12.htm |title=The Two Deaths of John Jacob Astor -George Behe's "Titanic" Tidbits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayals===
Astor's fame has made him a frequent character in films about the ''Titanic''. German actor [[Karl Schönböck]] played Astor in the 1943 [[Nazi]] propaganda film ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]''.

'''''Life Is a Dream''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|La vida es sueño}} {{IPA-es|la ˈβiða es ˈsweɲo|}}) is a [[Spanish-language]] play by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]. First published in 1635 (or possibly in early 1636) during the Spanish Baroque period (NADV1),&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/  Introduction to Pedro Calderon De La Barca's, "The Wonder-Working Magician" on barca.classicauthors.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }} Retrieved 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it is a philosophical allegory regarding the human situation and the mystery of life.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The play has been described as "the supreme example of [[Spanish Golden Age theatre|Spanish Golden Age drama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Racz | first=Gregary | year=2006 | title=Pedro Calderón de la Barca: Life Is a Dream | publisher=Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-310482-7|page= viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the fictional Segismundo, Prince of Poland, who has been imprisoned in a tower by his father, King Basilio, following a dire prophecy that the prince would bring disaster to the country and death to the King.  Basilio briefly frees Segismundo, but when the prince goes on a rampage, the king imprisons him again, persuading him that it was all a dream.

The play's central themes are the conflict between [[free will]] and [[Destiny|fate]], as well as restoring one's honor (NADV1). It remains one of Calderón's best-known and most studied works.  Other themes include dreams vs. reality and the conflict between father and son.  The play has been adapted for other stage works, in film and as a novel.

==Historical context==
[[File:Lope de vega 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title page of a comedy by Spanish playwright [[Lope de Vega]]]]
[[Spanish Empire|Catholic Spain]] was the most powerful European nation by the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cowans, Jon (ed). ''Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History'', University of Pennsylvania Press (2003), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by England in 1588, however, while Spain was trying to defend the northern coast of Africa from the expansion of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drama for students [Volume 23]: presenting analysis, context and criticism on commonly studied dramas|year=2006| location=Detroit| isbn=978-0-7876-8119-7| url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE%7C5FCO&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_main&amp;it=aboutBook&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1| editor=Sara Constantakis|format=Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gold and silver that Spain took from its possessions in the [[New World]] were not adequate to sustain its subsequent decades of heavy military expenses. Spain's power was rapidly waning by the time Calderón wrote ''Life Is a Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream| year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado| pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, "Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age" (Ch. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of Calderón was also marked by deep religious conviction in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd| first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic church had fostered Spanish pride and identity, to the extent that "speaking Christian" became, and remains, synonymous with speaking Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado| location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}} This religious fervor permeated the theatre of the time in that a prevalent theme was free will versus predestination.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another current that permeated Spanish thinking was the radical departure from the medieval ideal that royal power resided in God's will, as noted in [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Prince]]'' (1532). [[Francisco Suárez|Francisco Suarez’s]] treatise ''On the Defense of Faith'' (''De defensio fidei'', 1613) stated that political power resided in the people and rejected the divine rights of kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suarez| first=Francisco| title=DEFENSA DE LA FE (DEFENSIO FIDEI)|year=1971|publisher=Instituto de Estudios Politicos de Madrid| location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juan Mariana]]'s ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599) went even further by stating that the people had the right to murder despotic kings.&lt;ref&gt;Mariana, Jaun. ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}}

Amidst these developments during the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain experienced a cultural blossoming referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. [http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm "The Spanish Empire" (Ch. 13)] in ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', vol. 1, The Library of Iberian Resources Online (1973), accessed December 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Golden Age was brought about by the colonization of Americas, as they took advantage of the newfound resources. It saw the birth of notable works of art: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] (1605), played with the vague line between reality and perception.&lt;ref&gt;Constantakis, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lope de Vega]], in his play ''[[Fuente Ovejuna]]'' (1619), talks about a village that rebels against authority. 
==Synopsis==

===Act I===
[[File:La vida es sueño, en el 35 Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico (16).jpg|thumb|''La vida es sueño'', 35th Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico, [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]] (2012)]]
Rosaura walks through the mountains of Poland, dressed as a man. She finds Clarín, a jester, who tries to make her forget how miserably Poland receives visitors. They arrive at a tower, where they find Segismundo imprisoned, bound in chains. He tells them that his only crime was being born. Clotaldo, Segismundo's old warden and tutor, arrives and orders his guards to disarm and kill the intruders, but he recognizes Rosaura's sword as his own that he had left behind in [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muskovy]] (for a favor that he owed) years ago for his child to bear. Suspecting that Rosaura is his child (he thinks she is male), he takes Rosaura and Clarín with him to court. Fife also appears in this play, who is Rosaura's friend.

[[File:Royal Castle in Warsaw during the reign of John Sobieski.jpg|left|thumb|The royal palace in medieval Poland]]
At the palace, Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, discusses with his cousin, Princess Estrella (Segismundo's cousin), that as they are the nephew and niece of King Basilio of Poland, they would be his successors if they married each other. Estrella is troubled by the locket that Astolfo wears, with another woman's portrait. Basilio reveals to them that he imprisoned his infant son, Segismundo, due to a prophecy by an oracle that the prince would bring disgrace to Poland and would kill his father, but he wants to grant his son a chance to prove the oracle wrong. If he finds him evil and unworthy, he will send him back to his cell, making way for Astolfo and Estrella to become the new king and queen. Clotaldo enters with Rosaura, telling Basilio that the intruders know about Segismundo. He begs for the king's pardon, as he knows he should have killed them. The king says he should not worry, for his secret has already been revealed. Rosaura tells Clotaldo that she wants revenge against Astolfo, but she won't say why. Clotaldo is reluctant to reveal that he thinks he is Rosaura's father.

===Act II===
Clotaldo gives Segismundo a sedative that "robs one in his sleep of his sense and faculties" (109), which puts him in a sleep similar to death. In the Royal Palace of the capital city of Warsaw, Clotaldo has learned that Rosaura is a woman; Clarín explains that Rosaura is Princess Estrella's maid but has been going by the name of Astrea. When Segismundo is awakened and arrives at court, Clotaldo tells him that he is the prince of Poland and heir to the throne. He resents Clotaldo for keeping this secret from him for all those years. He finds Duke Astolfo irritating and is dazzled by Estrella's beauty.  When a servant warns him about the princess's betrothal to Astolfo, Segismundo is enraged by the news and throws the servant from the balcony.

The king demands an explanation from his son. He tries to reason with him, but Segismundo announces he will fight everyone, for his rights were denied him for a long time. Basilio warns him that he must behave, or he might find out he's dreaming. Segismundo interrupts a conversation between Rosaura and Clarín. Rosaura wants to leave, but Segismundo tries to seduce her. Clotaldo steps up to defend his child, but Segismundo pulls out a dagger threatening to kill him. As Clotaldo begs for his life, Astolfo challenges Segismundo to a duel. Before they proceed, the king sedates the prince again and sends him back to his cell.

The king dreams he is a king,
And in this delusive way
Lives and rules with sovereign sway;
All the cheers that round him ring,
Born of air, on air take wing.
And in ashes (mournful fate!)
Death dissolves his pride and state:
Who would wish a crown to take,
Seeing that he must awake
In the dream beyond death's gate?

....

'Tis a dream that I in sadness
Here am bound, the scorn of fate;
'Twas a dream that once a state
I enjoyed of light and gladness.
What is life? 'Tis but a madness.
What is life? A thing that seems,
A mirage that falsely gleams,
Phantom joy, delusive rest,
Since is life a dream at best,
And even dreams themselves are dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Denis Florence Mac-Carthy in ''Calderon's Dramas'', pp. 78-79. London: Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Segismundo.ogg|title=Segismundo's soliloquy (in Spanish)|format=[[Ogg]]}}
After recriminating Astolfo for wearing another woman's portrait around his neck, Estrella commands Rosaura (still going by Astrea) to fetch this locket for her. When she approaches Astolfo for the locket, he says he recognized her as Rosaura and refuses to give her the locket, because the portrait inside is hers. Estrella walks in and demands to see it immediately, but, afraid of being discovered, Rosaura says the locket in Astolfo's hand is actually her own, and that he has hidden the one she was sent to fetch. Estrella leaves furious. Meanwhile, Clotaldo sends Clarín to prison, believing that Clarín knows his secret.

Segismundo mutters in his sleep about murder and revenge. When the prince wakes up, he tells Clotaldo about his "dream". Clotaldo tells him that even in dreams, people must act with kindness and justice. When he leaves, Segismundo is left reflecting on dreams and life.

===Act III===
The people find out that they have a prince and many rebel, breaking him out of his prison tower, although at first they comically mistake Clarin for the prince. Segismundo finds Clotaldo, who is afraid of his reaction. Segismundo forgives him, asking to join his cause, but Clotaldo refuses, swearing allegiance to the king. Back in the palace, everyone prepares for battle, and Clotaldo speaks with Rosaura. She asks him to take Astolfo's life, as he had taken her honor before leaving her. Clotaldo refuses, reminding her that Duke Astolfo is now the heir to the throne. When Rosaura asks what will be of her honor, Clotaldo suggests that she spend her days in a nunnery. Disheartened, Rosaura runs away.

As war nears, Segismundo sees Rosaura, who tells him that she was the youth who found him in his prison and also the woman who he tried to seduce in court. She tells him that she was born in Muscovy of a noble woman who was disgraced and abandoned. She had the same fate, falling in love with Astolfo and giving him her honor before he abandoned her to marry Estrella. She followed him to Poland for revenge, finding that Clotaldo is her father, but he is unwilling to fight for her honor. Rosaura compares herself to female warriors Athena and Diana. She wants to join Segismundo's battle and to kill Astolfo or to die fighting. Segismundo agrees. While soldiers cheer for Segismundo, Rosaura and Clarín are reunited, and the king's soldiers approach.

Segismundo's army is winning the battle. Basilio, Clotaldo and Astolfo are preparing to escape when Clarín is killed in front of them. Segismundo arrives and Basilio faces his son, waiting for his death, but Segismundo spares his life. In light of the Prince's generous attitude, the King proclaims Segismundo heir to his throne. As King, Segismundo decides that Astolfo must keep his promise to marry Rosaura to preserve her honor. At first Astolfo is hesitant because she is not of noble birth, but when Clotaldo reveals that she is his daughter, Astolfo consents. Segismundo then claims Estrella in marriage himself. Segismundo resolves to live by the motto that "God is God", acknowledging that, whether asleep or awake, one must strive for goodness.

==Themes and motifs==
[[File:Pedro Calderón de la Barca 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Calderón]]
;Dreams vs. reality
The concept of life as a dream is an ancient one found in Hinduism and Greek philosophy (notably Heraclitus and the famous Platonic [[Allegory of the Cave]]), and is directly related to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' [[dream argument]]. It has been explored by writers from [[Lope de Vega]] to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ De La Barca, Pedro Calderón. Introduction to "The Wonder-Working Magician"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }}, barca.classicauthors.net. Retrieved 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Key elements from the play may be derived from the Christian legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]], which Lope de Vega had brought to the stage.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia Reidy|first=Alejandro|title=Las posibilidades dramaticas de Barlaam y Josafat: De Lope de Vega a sus epigonos |url=https://www.academia.edu/825478/Las_posibilidades_dramaticas_de_la_historia_de_Barlaam_y_Josafat_de_Lope_de_Vega_a_sus_epigonos|publisher=Universidad de Santiago de Compostela|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This legend is, itself, a derivation of the story of the early years of [[Siddharta Gautama]], which serves as the basis for the film ''[[Little Buddha]]'' that illustrates the [[maya (Hinduism)|Hindu-Buddhist concept of reality as illusion]].&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; 

;Father vs. son conflict
One of the major conflicts of the play is the opposition between king and prince, which parallels with the struggle of Uranus vs. Saturn or Saturn vs. Jupiter in classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;De Armas, Frederick A. "The Critical Tower", ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of La vida es sueño'', pp. 3–14, Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle is a typical representation of the opposition in baroque comedy between the values represented by a fatherly figure and those embodied by the son.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; An opposition which, in this case, may have biographical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Alexander A. "The Father-Son Conflict in the Drama of Calderón", ''Forum for Modern language Studies'', 2 (1966), pp. 99–113&lt;/ref&gt;

;Honor
The theme of honor is major to the character Rosaura. She feels she has been stripped of her honor, and her aim is to reclaim it. She feels that both her and her mother were subjected to the same fate. She pleads to Clotaldo about earning her honor back, which he denies and sends her to a nunnery.

;Other motifs and themes
Motifs and themes derived from a number of traditions found in this drama include the [[labyrinth]], the monster, free will vs. predestination, the four elements, original sin, pride and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Timothy.

==Analysis and interpretations==

===Rosaura subplot===
[[File:Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca.jpg|thumb|upright|Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca]]
The Rosaura subplot has been subjected to much criticism in the past as not belonging to the work. Menéndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, ''Calderón y su teatro''. Madrid: A. Perez Dubrull, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Sloman, "The Structure of Calderón's ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón''," ed. Bruce W. Wardropper, 90–100. New York: New York University Press, 1965"&lt;/ref&gt; Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Wilson, "On ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Whitby "Rosarura's Role in the Structure of ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 101–13&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse/hippogriff to the plot of [[Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For [[Frederick de Armas]], Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of ''auroras'', "dawns") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. de Armas, ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderón''. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Segismundo's conclusions===
There have been many different interpretations of the play’s ending, where Segismundo condemns the rebel soldier who freed him to life imprisonment in the tower. Some have suggested that this scene is ironic – that it raises questions about whether Segismundo will in fact be a just king. Others have pointed out that Calderón, who lived under the Spanish monarchy, could not have left the rebel soldier unpunished, because this would be an affront to royal authority.

It is worth considering that Segismundo’s transformation in the course of the play is not simply a moral awakening, but a realization of his social role as the heir to the throne, and this role requires him to act as kings act. For some, the act of punishing the rebel soldier makes him a Machiavellian prince.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Hall, "Segismundo and the Rebel Soldier," Bulletin of Hispanic Studies 45 (1968): 189–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, while this action may seem unjust, it is in keeping with his new social status as the king. Daniel L. Heiple traces a long tradition of works where treason seems to be rewarded, but the traitor or rebel is subsequently punished.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Heiple, "The Tradition Behind the Punishment of the Rebel Soldier in ''La vida es sueño''," ''Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'' 50 (1973): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may well be that, rather than intending his audience to see this action as purely right or wrong, Calderón purposefully made it ambiguous, creating an interesting tension in the play that adds to its depth.

{{World Rally Championship}}
The '''list of fatal World Rally Championship accidents''' consists of drivers and co-drivers who have died at [[FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC) rallies. The list also includes fatal accidents in the [[International Championship for Manufacturers]] (IMC), the predecessor to the World Rally Championship, which was contested from 1970 to 1972. Well-known fatalities involving officials, spectators and team members are also mentioned.

The fatal accidents of the [[Group B]] era resulted in its demise. Only hours after [[Henri Toivonen]]'s crash at the 1986 [[Tour de Corse]], [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]] president [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] announced that Group B cars were banned for the [[1987 World Rally Championship season|1987 season]]. However, driver fatalities peaked in [[1989 World Rally Championship|1989]], when five competitors died in the first three rallies of the season (two during reconnaissance, two who were spectating having only done reconnaissance for the event, and only one as an active competitor). [[Markko Märtin]]'s co-driver [[Michael Park (co-driver)|Michael Park]]'s death at the 2005 [[Wales Rally GB]] was the WRC's first fatality in over eleven years.

==Other fatalities==
===Team members===
At the 1975 [[Safari Rally]], a service car with four mechanics crashed into a truck near [[Mombasa]]. Carlino Dacista, Brian Fernandez and Willie Uis died instantly. The driver David Joshi sustained serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Carlino Dacista | work=Motorsport Memorial | url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=4095 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1978 [[Monte Carlo Rally]], two mechanics, Bernard Balmer and Georges Reinier, died when their van collided with a truck near [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], [[Hautes-Alpes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bernard Balmer | work=Motorsport Memorial | url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=6939 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day of the 1987 [[Rallye Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Toyota Team Europe]]'s [[Cessna 340]] crashed and exploded, killing all four inside; manager and former co-driver [[Henry Liddon (driver)|Henry Liddon]], his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator.

===Officials===
At the end of the fourth stage of the 1981 [[1000 Lakes Rally]], [[Audi Sport]] driver [[Franz Wittmann, Sr.|Franz Wittmann]] and his co-driver Kurt Nestinger did not notice the flying finish which marks the end of the stage.

Raul Falin, chairman of [[AKK-Motorsport|AKK]], Finland's sporting authority for motorsport and the country's representative in the FIA, was quickly taken to a hospital but died from his injuries soon after. Boris Rung, co-founder and chairman of the European Rallycross Association and member of FIA's Off-Road Commission, survived the accident along with Greek FIA observer Costas Glossotis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Raul Falin | work=Motorsport Memorial | url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=2387 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectators===
At the 1978 Safari Rally, five passers-by and four spectators were killed in unrelated accidents, both involving non-competitive drivers crashing into competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1978 Safari Rally | work=Motorsport Memorial | url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=5350 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first stage of the 1986 [[Rally Portugal]], [[Joaquim Santos]] lost control of his [[Ford RS200]] while trying to avoid spectators on the road, crashing into a crowd of spectators, killing three and injuring over thirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | title=3 Portuguese spectators killed by skidding racer | pages=29 | date=6 March 1986 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X-EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RGYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5652,5698183}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the factory teams &amp;ndash; [[Audi]], [[Austin Rover]], [[Ford]], [[Lancia]], [[Peugeot]] and [[Volkswagen]] &amp;ndash; withdrew from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=20º Rallye de Portugal Vinho do Porto | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&amp;rallyid=217 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marquardt space sled.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The Marquardt Space Sled, on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]]]

The '''Marquardt Space Sled''' was developed by the [[Marquardt Corporation]] in the 1960s as part of an effort to build a device that would allow [[astronaut]]s to maneuver freely in space without needing to be tethered to their spacecraft or stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/spaesled.htm|title=Space Sled|publisher=Astronautix|access-date=6 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126000000/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/spaesled.htm|archivedate=26 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was shelved in favor of technology that evolved into maneuvering systems like the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit|MMU]] of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue|SAFER]] system used by the crew of the [[International Space Station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1336">A '''mental property''' or  a '''mind property''' is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of a/the [[mind]]. The term is mostly used in [[philosophy of mind]], without prejudice as to the [[ontology|ontological]] status of mental properties. Examples might include general properties, such as being able to [[think]] or [[Recall (memory)|remember]], or more specific actions such as "having a thought about Paris". The term is often used in the context of the [[mind body problem]]. For (non eliminative) [[physicalism|physicalists]], mental properties are a kind of high level property which can be understood in terms of fine-grained [[neurology|neural]] activity. [[Property dualism|Property dualists]], on the other hand, claim that no such [[reductionism|reductive explanation]] is possible. [[Eliminativism|Eliminativist]]s may reject the existence of mental properties, or at least of those corresponding to [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] categories such as thought and memory. Some philosophers seek to find a unifying characteristic for the generally accepted mental properties: a famous example is [[Franz Brentano]]'s claim that all mental properties are characterised by [[intentionality]] or "aboutness".

'''Nurin Jazlin Binti Jazimin''' (11 September 1999 – 16 September 2007) was an eight-year-old [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] murder victim, who was originally reported missing after she had gone to a [[wet market]] near her house in Section 1, [[Wangsa Maju]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] to buy a hair clip on the night of 20 August 2007. Her parents made a missing person report to the police and a search for her was made in the subsequent weeks, conducted by several organisations including the mainstream media and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bernama|title=CID Director Heads Special Probe Team On Nurin's Murder|date=21 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=286232}}{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=BabbaQ |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police were able to find [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage, from a nearby camera, showing her being dragged into a white van the night she went missing.  Her murder has not been solved.

==Abduction and death==
On the morning of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left in front of a shop lot in PJS 1/48, [[Petaling Jaya]], discovered by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which had been stuffed in the [[fetal position]]; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Star|date=18 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007|title=Child found sexually assaulted and killed|last=Hamid|first=Rashitha A.|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/9/18/nation/18914532&amp;sec=nation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017191141/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F9%2F18%2Fnation%2F18914532&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=17 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cucumber]] and a [[brinjal]] were found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her [[rectum]] to rupture.

Her body was later claimed by her family from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) and she was buried at the Muslim cemetery in [[Taman Ibukota]], [[Setapak]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] on 21 September after the [[Jumu'ah|Friday noon prayers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/9/22/nation/18964980&amp;sec=nation|title=Imam cries as he leads prayer|publisher=The Star|date=22 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925204556/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F9%2F22%2Fnation%2F18964980&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=25 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, federal agents raided a shop in Section 7, [[Shah Alam]], where they arrested four men and one woman between the ages of 27 and 35 in connection with the murder.

The '''O'Neill cylinder''' (also called an '''O'Neill colony''') is a [[space habitat|space settlement]] design proposed by American [[physicist]] [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] in his 1976 book ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]''.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"&gt;{{cite book  | last = O'Neill

An O'Neill cylinder would consist of two counter-rotating cylinders. The cylinders would rotate in opposite directions in order to cancel out any gyroscopic effects that would otherwise make it difficult to keep them aimed toward the Sun. Each would be {{convert|5|mi|km}} in diameter and {{convert|20|mi|km}} long, connected at each end by a rod via a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] system. They would rotate so as to provide [[artificial gravity]] via [[centrifugal force]] on their inner surfaces.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;

While teaching undergraduate [[physics]] at [[Princeton University]], O'Neill set his students the task of designing large structures in [[outer space]], with the intent of showing that living in space could be desirable. Several of the designs were able to provide volumes large enough to be suitable for human habitation. This cooperative result inspired the idea of the cylinder, and was first published by O'Neill in a September 1974 article of ''[[Physics Today]]''.&lt;ref name="ONeill-Colony"&gt;{{cite journal

O'Neill's project was not completely without precedent. In 1954, the German scientist [[Hermann Oberth]] described the use of gigantic habitable cylinders for space travel in his book ''Menschen im Weltraum – Neue Projekte für Raketen- und Raumfahrt ("People in space – New projects for rockets and space travel")''.

=== Islands===
O'Neill created{{when|date=June 2018}} three reference designs, nicknamed "islands":

Island One is a rotating sphere measuring one mile in circumference (1,681&amp;nbsp;feet or 512.27 meters in diameter), with people living on the equatorial region (see [[Bernal sphere]]). A later NASA/Ames study at Stanford University developed an alternative version of Island One: the [[Stanford torus]], a toroidal shape {{convert|1600|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=SSA1977/&gt;

Island Two is also spherical in design, and is 1,600 meters in diameter.{{fact|date=December 2014}}

The '''Island Three''' design, better known as the O'Neill cylinder, consists of two counter-rotating [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, each {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} in [[diameter]], and capable of scaling up to {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} long.&lt;ref name="NSS-ONeill"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.nss.org/settlement/space/oneillcylinder.htm | title = O'Neill Cylinder| work = Orbital Space Settlements| publisher = [[National Space Society]]| accessdate = November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cylinder has six equal-area stripes that run the length of the cylinder; three are transparent windows, three are habitable "land" surfaces. Furthermore, an outer [[agricultural]] ring, {{convert|10|mi|km}} in radius, rotates at a different speed to support farming. The habitat's industrial manufacturing block is located in the middle, to allow for minimized gravity for some manufacturing processes.

To save the immense cost of rocketing the materials from Earth, these habitats would be built with materials launched into space from the Moon with a magnetic [[mass driver]].&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;

===Artificial gravity===
[[Image:Lunar base concept drawing s78 23252.jpg|thumb|right|A NASA lunar base concept with a mass driver (the long structure that extends toward the horizon that is a part of the plan to build O'Neill Cylinders)]]
The cylinders rotate to provide [[Artificial gravity#Rotation|artificial gravity]] on their inner surface. At the radius described by O'Neill, the habitats would have to rotate about twenty-eight times an hour to simulate a standard Earth [[Standard gravity|gravity]].

indicate that, at such low rotation speeds, few people would experience [[motion sickness]] due to [[Coriolis effect|coriolis forces]] acting on the inner ear. People would, however, be able to detect spinward and antispinward directions by turning their heads, and any dropped items would appear to be deflected by a few centimetres.&lt;ref name="Space Exploration 1970"/&gt; The central axis of the habitat would be a [[zero-gravity]] region, and it was envisaged that recreational facilities could be located there.

===Atmosphere and radiation===
The habitat was planned to have oxygen at partial pressures roughly similar to terrestrial air, 20% of the Earth's sea-level air pressure. Nitrogen would also be included to add a further 30% of the Earth's pressure. This half-pressure atmosphere would save gas and reduce the needed strength and thickness of the habitat walls.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSA1977&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/nasa/75SummerStudy/Design.html ''Space Settlements: A Design Study'' (1977)]. NASA SP-413. NSS.org. Retrieved September 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Internal view of the O'Neill cylinder.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's depiction of the interior of an O'Neill cylinder, illuminated by reflected sunlight]]
At this scale, the air within the cylinder and the shell of the cylinder provide adequate shielding against [[Health threat from cosmic rays|cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt; The internal volume of an O'Neill cylinder is great enough to support its own small weather systems, which may be manipulated by altering the internal atmospheric composition or the amount of reflected sunlight.&lt;ref name="NSS-ONeill"/&gt;

===Sunlight===
Large mirrors are hinged at the back of each stripe of window. The unhinged edge of the windows points toward the Sun. The purpose of the mirrors is to reflect [[sunlight]] into the cylinders through the windows. Night is simulated by opening the mirrors, letting the window view empty space; this also permits heat to radiate to space. During the day, the reflected Sun appears to move as the mirrors move, creating a natural progression of Sun angles. Although not visible to the naked eye, the Sun's image might be observed to rotate due to the cylinder's rotation. Light transmitted through glass at an angle is somewhat [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]], which might confuse pollinating [[bee]]s.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;

To permit light to enter the habitat, large windows run the length of the cylinder.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;  These would not be single panes, but would be made up of many small sections, to prevent catastrophic damage, and so the aluminum or steel window frames can take most of the stresses of the air pressure of the habitat.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt; Occasionally a meteorite might break one of these panes. This would cause some loss of the atmosphere, but calculations showed that this would not be an emergency, due to the very large volume of the habitat.&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;

===Attitude control===&lt;!-- This is the correct spelling; attitude control is the change of a spacecraft's orientation. Do not change to "altitude" --&gt;
The habitat and its mirrors must be perpetually [[Attitude control (spacecraft)|aimed at the Sun]] to collect solar energy and light the habitat's interior. O'Neill and his students carefully worked out a method of continuously turning the colony 360 degrees per orbit without using rockets (which would shed reaction mass).&lt;ref name="ONeill-HighFrontier"/&gt;
First, the pair of habitats can be rolled by operating the cylinders as [[momentum wheel]]s. If one habitat's rotation is slightly off, the two cylinders will rotate about each other. Once the plane formed by the two axes of rotation is perpendicular in the roll axis to the orbit, then the pair of cylinders can be [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]]ed to aim at the Sun by exerting a force between the two sunward bearings. Pushing the cylinders away from each other will cause both cylinders to gyroscopically [[precession|precess]], and the system will yaw in one direction, while pushing them towards each other will cause yaw in the other direction. The counter-rotating habitats have no net [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect, and so this slight precession can continue throughout the habitat's orbit, keeping it aimed at the Sun.
&lt;!--==Criticism of the design==
O'Neill's designs for the colonies are inefficient in their construction, in terms of materials used per square meter of living area. For example, to hold air at 40% of Earth's surface pressure with a standard 5-fold safety margin, the smallest design, the 1.5-km-diameter Island One, would require a steel shell with 2 metric tons of steel per square meter of shell. In contrast, a habitat made of linked 10-meter balls would require only 24 kilograms of steel per square meter. The habitable area is distributed in different ways in such different designs, but the difference in costs remains huge. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Comparing a design with a relatively smaller one with also relatively inconvenient use of space requires a reliable and reasonable source. see talk.--&gt;

==Design update and derivatives ==
in 2014, a new construction method where  suggested by inflating a bag and then taping it with a spool (from asteroid materials) like the construction of a [[Composite overwrapped pressure vessel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Third Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop, Nov 10-11, 2014, Oak Ridge, TN, Dr. Gordon Woodcock (Boeing/NSS)|title=10.0  A Construction Scenario for O'Neill Cylinder Space Settlement Habitats|date=2014-12-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1yOe-exq6c|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 and 2007, a smaller design derivative was presented, Kalpana one, that deals with the wobbling effect of a rotating cylinder by increasing the diameter and shortening the length, the logistics challenges of the [[Health threat from cosmic rays|radiation shield]] by building the station in LEO, and by removing the windows to make it a closed cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Kalpana/KalpanaOne.html|title=Kalpana One Space Settlement|website=settlement.arc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alglobus.net/NASAwork/papers/2007KalpanaOne.pdf|title=The Kalpana One Orbital Space Settlement Revised|last=Globus|first=Al|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of this writing, a physics engine called [[Sibernetic]] has been built for the project and models of the neural [[connectome]] and a muscle cell have been created in [[NeuroML]] format. A 3D model of the worm anatomy can be accessed through the web via the OpenWorm browser.

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

{{Paleontology}}
[[File:OrdFossilsMN.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brachiopods]] and [[bryozoans]] in an [[Ordovician]] limestone, southern Minnesota]]
'''Paleobiology''' (UK &amp; Canadian English: '''palaeobiology''') is a growing and comparatively new discipline which combines the methods and findings of the [[natural science]] [[biology]] with the methods and findings of the [[earth science]] [[paleontology]]. It is occasionally referred to as "[[geobiology]]".

Paleobiological [[research]] uses biological [[field research]] of current [[biota (ecology)|biota]] and of [[fossil]]s millions of years old to answer questions about the [[molecular evolution]] and the [[evolutionary history of life]]. In this [[scientific]] quest, [[macrofossil]]s, [[microfossil]]s and [[trace fossil]]s are typically analyzed. However, the 21st-century [[biochemical]] analysis of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] samples offers much promise, as does the [[biometric]] construction of [[phylogenetic tree]]s.

An investigator in this field is known as a paleobiologist.

==Important research areas==
*[[Paleobotany]] applies the principles and methods of paleobiology to [[flora]], especially [[Embryophyta|green land plants]], but also including the [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[seaweed]]s ([[algae]]). See also [[mycology]], [[phycology]] and [[dendrochronology]].
*[[Paleozoology]] uses the methods and principles of paleobiology to understand [[fauna]], both [[Vertebrata|vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.  See also [[vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate paleontology]], as well as [[paleoanthropology]].
*[[Micropaleontology]] applies paleobiologic principles and methods to [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], [[Protista|protists]] and [[microscopy|microscopic]] [[pollen]]/[[spore]]s.  See also [[microfossil]]s and [[palynology]].
*[[Paleovirology]] examines the evolutionary history of viruses on paleobiological timescales.
*[[Biochemistry|Paleobiochemistry]] uses the methods and principles of [[organic chemistry]] to detect and analyze [[molecular biology|molecular-level evidence]] of ancient life, both [[microscopic]] and [[macroscopic]].
*[[Paleoecology]] examines past [[ecosystem]]s, [[paleoclimatology|climate]]s, and [[Paleogeography|geographies]] so as to better comprehend [[Evolutionary history of life|prehistoric life]].
*[[Taphonomy]] analyzes the [[post-mortem]] history (for example, decay and [[decomposition]]) of an individual organism in order to gain insight on the [[Ethology|behavior]], [[death]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] of the [[fossilization|fossilized]] organism.
*[[Ichnology|Paleoichnology]] analyzes the [[animal tracks|tracks]], [[bioerosion|borings]], trails, [[burrow]]s, impressions, and other [[trace fossil]]s left by ancient organisms in order to gain insight into their behavior and [[ecology]].
*[[Stratigraphic paleobiology]] studies [[geologic time scale|long-term secular]] changes, as well as the (short-term) [[stratigraphy|bed-by-bed sequence]] of changes, in  [[Cladistics|organismal characteristics]] and behaviors.  See also [[Stratification (archeology)|stratification]], [[sedimentary rock]]s and the [[geologic time scale]].
*[[Evo-devo|Evolutionary developmental paleobiology]] examines the [[evolution]]ary aspects of the modes and trajectories of growth and development in the [[timeline of evolution|evolution of life]] – [[clade]]s both [[extinct]] and [[Extant taxon|extant]]. See also [[adaptive radiation]], [[cladistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[phylogenetic tree]].

==Paleobiologists==
The founder or "father" of modern paleobiology was Baron [[Franz Nopcsa von Felsö-Szilvás|Franz Nopcsa]] (1877 to 1933), a Hungarian scientist trained at the University of Vienna. He initially termed the discipline "paleophysiology."

However, credit for coining the word ''paleobiology'' itself should go to Professor [[Charles Schuchert]]. He proposed the term in 1904 so as to initiate "a broad new science" joining "traditional paleontology with the evidence and insights of geology and isotopic chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;Schuchert is cited on page 170 of ''Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils'' (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]) by [[J. William Schopf]] (1999). {{ISBN|0-691-00230-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], a [[Smithsonian]] adventurer, has been cited as the "founder of [[Precambrian]] paleobiology." Although best known as the discoverer of the mid-[[Cambrian]] [[Burgess shale]] animal fossils, in 1883 this American curator found the "first Precambrian fossil cells known to science" – a [[stromatolite]] reef then known as ''Cryptozoon'' [[algae]]. In 1899 he discovered the first [[acritarch]] fossil cells, a Precambrian [[alga]]l [[phytoplankton]] he named ''Chuaria''. Lastly, in 1914, Walcott reported "minute cells and chains of cell-like bodies" belonging to Precambrian [[purple bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Walcott's contributions are described by J. William Schopf (1999) on pages 23 to 31. Another good source is E. L. Yochelson (1997), ''Charles Doolittle Walcott: Paleontologist'' (Kent, Ohio: [[Kent State University Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later 20th-century paleobiologists have also figured prominently in finding [[Archean|Archaean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eon [[microfossil]]s: In 1954, [[Stanley A. Tyler]] and [[Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn|Elso S. Barghoorn]] described 2.1 billion-year-old [[cyanobacteria]] and [[fungi]]-like [[microflora]] at their [[Gunflint Chert]] fossil site. Eleven years later, Barghoorn and [[J. William Schopf]] reported finely-preserved Precambrian microflora at their Bitter Springs site of the [[Amadeus Basin]], Central Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The paleobiologic discoveries of Tyler, Barghoorn and Schopf are related on pages 35 to 70 of Schopf (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1993, Schopf discovered O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-producing [[blue-green bacteria]] at his 3.5 billion-year-old [[Apex Chert]] site in [[Pilbara Craton]], [[Marble Bar]], in the northwestern part of [[Western Australia]]. So paleobiologists were at last homing in on the origins of the Precambrian "[[Oxygen catastrophe]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Apex chert microflora is related by Schopf (1999) himself on pages 71 to 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9046">'''Paradox of nihilism''' is the name of several paradoxes.

== Meaning ==
According to Hegarty, the paradox of nihilism is "that the absence of meaning seems to be some sort of meaning".&lt;ref name="Hegarty2006"/&gt;

== Religion ==
Rivas locates the paradox in the "conservative attitude of [[Roman Catholicism]]" developed in reaction to [[Nietzsche]]an nihilism, in that it "betrays a form of nihilism, that is, the forced oblivion of the real ambiguity and the paradox that inform the distinction between the secular and the sacred".&lt;ref name="Rivas2008"/&gt;

== Critical legal theory ==
In [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS) theory, the arguments used to criticize the centrist position also undermine the position of CLS.&lt;ref name="Belliotti"/&gt;{{Clarify|What centrist position?|date=February 2012}}

==Ethical nihilism==
According to Jonna Bornemark, "the paradox of nihilism is the choice to continue one's own life while at the same time stating that it is not worth more than any other life".&lt;ref name="Bornemark2006"/&gt; Richard Ian Wright sees [[relativism]] as the root of the paradox.{{Clarify|Which paradox exactly?|date=February 2012}}&lt;ref name="Wright1999"/&gt;

In other words, from a Nietzschean perspective, Marx's foundational principles are not sufficient to defend his humanistic values. Thus it can be argued that they still maintain the residue of the Christian ethics and Platonic metaphysics which have permeated western thought for several thousand years and which continue to provide modem thinkers with many of their illusory presuppositions. Nevertheless, one is justified in asking: Without such presuppositions, does not the critique of law, politics, or "this earth" lose its ultimate justification or meaning? How can one critique laws without holding on to a sense of justice? And herein lies the crux of the paradox of nihilism. If nihilism is the basis of human existence then all values are relative, and as such, particular values can only be maintained through a "will to power." (page 97)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''placental infarction''' results from the interruption of [[blood]] supply to a part of the [[placenta]], causing its [[cell (biology)|cells]] to [[Cell death|die]].

Small placental infarcts, especially at the edge of the placental disc, are considered to be normal at [[full term|term]]. Large placental infarcts are associated with vascular abnormalities, e.g. [[hypertrophic decidual vasculopathy]], as seen in [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Marcorelles | first1 = P. | title = [Placenta and preeclampsia: relationships between anatomical lesions and clinical symptoms]. | journal = Ann Fr Anesth Reanim | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = e25-9 |date=Mar 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.annfar.2010.02.013 | PMID = 20338716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large infarcts lead to placental insufficiency and may result in [[fetal demise|fetal death]].

==Relation to maternal floor infarct==
''Maternal floor infarcts'' are ''not'' considered to be true placental infarcts, as they result from deposition of [[fibrin]] around the [[chorionic villi]], i.e. perivillous fibrin deposition.

'''''Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis''''' is a [[frog]] species belonging to the family [[Sooglossidae]]. It can be found in the [[Western Ghats]] in [[India]]. Names in English that have been used for this species are '''purple frog''', '''Indian purple frog''', or '''pignose frog'''. Although the adult frog was formally [[species description|described]] in October 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biju|first=S. D.|author2=Bossuyt, F. |title=New frog family from India reveals an ancient biogeographical link with the Seychelles|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=425|issue=6959|pages=711–714|doi=10.1038/nature02019|pmid=14562102}}&lt;/ref&gt; the taxon was recognized much earlier by its [[tadpole]], which had been described in 1918.&lt;ref name="Annandale, N. &amp; Rao, C.R.N. 1917 185–186"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Annandale, N.  |author2=Rao, C.R.N.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1917| title=Indian tadpoles|journal=Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|volume=13|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the discovery==
The species was described from specimens collected in the [[Idukki]] district of [[Kerala]] by S.D. Biju from the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in [[Palode]], India, and Franky Bossuyt from the ''[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]'' (Free University of Brussels), in 2003. However, it was already well known to the local people and several earlier documented specimens and publications had been ignored by the authors in the 2003 paper that describes the genus and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=Indraneil|title=Some forgotten descriptions of ''Nasikabatrachus'' (Anura - Sooglossidae)|journal=Herpetological Review|year=2007|volume=38|pages=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The scientific name ''Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis'' is a latinized form, composed of respectively derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''nāsikā'' (नासिका) for "nose", [[Greek language|Greek]] ''batrachos'' (βάτραχος) for "frog", and [[Sahyadri]], the native name of the mountain range of the [[Western Ghats]] which he inhabits.

==Description==
[[File:Vocal-Behavior-of-the-Elusive-Purple-Frog-of-India-(Nasikabatrachus-sahyadrensis)-a-Fossorial-pone.0084809.s005.ogv|thumb|left|Video recording of a vocalizing male.]]
The body of ''Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis'' appears robust and bloated and is relatively rounded compared to other more [[dorsoventral]]ly flattened [[frogs]]. Its arms and legs splay out in the standard [[anura (frog)|anura]]n body form. Compared to other frogs, ''N. sahyadrensis'' has a small head and an unusual pointed snout. Adults are typically dark purplish-grey in color. Males are about a third of the length of females.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zachariah, A |author2=RK Abraham |author3=S Das |author4=KC Jayan |author5=R Altig  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012| title=A detailed account of the reproductive strategy and developmental stages of ''Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis'' (Anura: Nasikabatrachidae), the only extant member of an archaic frog lineage |journal=Zootaxa |volume=3510|pages= 53–64 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2012/f/z03510p064f.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holotype|specimen]] with which the species was originally described was 7.0&amp;nbsp;cm long from the tip of the snout to the vent. Tadpoles of the species had been described in 1917 by [[Nelson Annandale]] and [[C. R. Narayan Rao]] as having oral suckers that allowed them to live in torrential streams.&lt;ref name="Annandale, N. &amp; Rao, C.R.N. 1917 185–186"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Annandale|first=N. |year=1918|title= Some undescribed tadpoles from the hills of southern India|journal= Records of the Indian Museum|volume= 15| pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suckers are also present in [[Rheophile|rheophilic]] fishes of genera such as ''[[Glyptothorax]]'', ''[[Travancoria]]'', ''[[Homaloptera]]'', and ''[[Bhavania]]'', adaptations that are the result of [[convergent evolution]]. Some of these fishes co-occur with ''Nasikabatrachus'' tadpoles in the hill streams.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Annandale, N.  |author2=Hora, S.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1922| title= Parallel evolution in the fish and tadpoles of mountains torrents| journal=Records of the Indian Museum| volume=24|pages=505–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vocalization is a drawn-out harsh call that sounds similar to a chicken clucking.

==Distribution==
Earlier thought to be restricted to the south of the [[Palghat Gap]] in the [[Western Ghats]], additional records have extended its known range farther north of the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Das, K. S. Anoop 2006 Record of ''Nasikabatrachus'' from the Northern Western Ghats.

==Ecology==

The frog spends most of its life underground and surfaces only during the [[monsoon]], for mating.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Marshall | first=Presented by Michael | title=Eight ugly animals we should save anyway | website=BBC Earth | date=17 October 2014  | url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141017-eight-ugly-animals-we-should-save | accessdate=3 January 2015|quote=India’s purple frog spends almost all the year underground, surfacing for around two weeks in the monsoon to breed in temporary ponds created by the torrential rain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With few field scientists out in the field during the rainy season the species was discovered and studied only in recent times. Males emerge to call beside temporary rainwater streams. They mount females and grip them ([[amplexus]]) along the veterbral column. Around 3000 eggs are laid in a rock pool and the tadpoles [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] after around 100 days.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

[[File:Purple frog babies by Nihal jabin.jpg|thumb|Purple frog young babies]]

Unlike many other burrowing species of frogs that emerge and feed above the ground, this species has been found to forage underground, feeding mainly on termites using its tongue and a special buccal groove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radhakrishnan | first1 = C. | last2 = Gopi | first2 = K.

'''Robert II''' (c. 1065 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1111) was [[Count of Flanders]] from 1093 to 1111. He became known as ''Robert of Jerusalem'' (''Robertus Hierosolimitanus'') or ''Robert the Crusader'' after his exploits in the [[First Crusade]].

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of [[Robert I of Flanders]] and [[Gertrude of Saxony]].{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=166}} His father, hoping to place the cadet branch (or "Baldwinite" branch) of Flanders over the county, began to associate him with his rule around 1086.{{sfn|Nicholas|2013|p=58}} From 1085 to 1091 he was regent of the county while his father was away on [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]].{{sfn|Kostick|2008|p=257}}

==First Crusade==
{{Main article|First Crusade}}

After becoming count in 1093, Robert joined the First Crusade, launched by [[Pope Urban II]] in 1095. He made his wife [[Clementia of Burgundy]] regent in Flanders,{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=166}} and formed an [[The Army of Robert the Crusader|army]] that followed the retinue of his kinsman [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Duke of Lower Lorraine]]. After reaching [[Constantinople]], the crusaders were obliged to swear an oath of fealty to [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]] and promise to return to the [[Byzantine Empire]] any land they might capture. Robert, whose father had already served Alexius during his pilgrimage in the 1080s, had no problem swearing this oath, but some of the other leaders did and there was some delay in leaving the city.

Robert then participated in the [[Siege of Nicaea]], after which the army was split into two groups. Robert marched with [[Stephen, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]], [[Robert Curthose]], and the Byzantine guides, one day ahead of the rest of the crusaders. This army was surrounded by the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] sultan [[Kilij Arslan I]] at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]] on 30 June 1097.{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=186}} The next day, the second army, led by [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]], Godfrey of Bouillon, and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], arrived and broke the encirclement; the two armies joined together, with Robert and Raymond forming the centre. The Turks were defeated and the crusaders continued their march.

At the end of 1097 the crusaders arrived at [[Antioch]]. The [[Siege of Antioch]] lasted many months; in December, Robert and Bohemund briefly left the army to raid the surrounding territory for food, and on 30 December they defeated an army sent to relieve Antioch, led by [[Dukak]] of [[Damascus]]. Antioch was eventually betrayed to Bohemund by an Armenian guard, and Robert was among the first to enter the city, but only a few days later they were themselves besieged by [[Kerbogha]] of [[Mosul]]. On 28 June 1098, the crusaders marched out to meet him in battle;{{sfn|Runciman|1951|p=244-246}} Robert and Hugh of Vermandois led the first of six divisions. Kerbogha was defeated and the Muslim-held citadel finally surrendered to the crusaders. Robert, along with Bohemund, Raymond, and Godfrey, occupied the citadel, but Bohemund soon claimed the city for himself. Raymond also claimed it, but Robert supported Bohemund in this dispute.

[[File:Robert2Flandry.jpg|thumb|A 14th-century depiction of [[Robert&amp;nbsp;II, Count of Flanders]] from a manuscript in the care of the [[National Library of the Netherlands]]]]

The dispute delayed the crusade even further. Raymond left Antioch to attack [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]], which was captured; Robert took part in this siege as well. Raymond then tried to bribe Robert and the other leaders to follow him instead of Bohemund; Robert was offered six thousand ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sou]]s'', but each attempted bribe was ignored. Raymond continued south to Jerusalem in January, 1099, but Robert and Godfrey remained behind in Antioch until February. They rejoined Raymond's army at the [[Siege of Arqa]]. In June, Robert and [[Gaston IV of Bearn]] led the vanguard which arrived at [[Ramla]], and with [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred of Taranto]] he led an expedition into [[Samaria]] to find wood in order to construct [[siege engine]]s for the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]]. When Jerusalem was captured on 15 July, Robert supported Godfrey's claim over that of Raymond, and on August 9 marched out with him to meet the [[Fatimid]] army under [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] which was coming to relieve Jerusalem. Robert formed part of the centre wing in the ensuing [[Battle of Ascalon]], which resulted in a crusader victory. However, Godfrey and Raymond quarrelled over possession of Ascalon, and even Robert could not support Godfrey in this dispute; the city remained uncaptured, although the victory allowed for the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

At the end of August, Robert returned home with Robert Curthose and Raymond. On the way back they captured [[Latakia]], which was returned to the Byzantine emperor, as promised years before. Raymond remained there but both Roberts continued home by way of Constantinople, after declining Alexius' request to stay there in his service. Robert brought back with him a precious [[relic]], the arm of [[Saint George]], a gift from Alexius. The relic was placed in the church of [[Anchin Abbey]] in Flanders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2002|p=151}} After he returned, Robert built the monastery of St. Andrew in [[Betferkerke]], near [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Frankopan|2012|p=257}} Because of his crusade and the spoils he brought home, he was nicknamed Robert of Jerusalem.

==Later life==

During his absence, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] had tried to seize imperial Flanders. Robert responded by supporting the revolt of the Commune of [[Cambrai]] against the emperor and his supporter, Bishop Gaulcher, and seized a number of [[castle]]s. Peace was restored in 1102 paid homage to the emperor for imperial Flanders, but after 1105, the new emperor, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], marched on Flanders, with the aid of [[Baldwin III, Count of Hainaut]] and an army from [[Holland]]. Robert stopped them outside of [[Douai]] and a new peace was signed, in which the emperor recognized Robert's claim to Douai and Cambrai.

In 1103 he made an alliance with King [[Henry I of England]], offering 1000 cavalry in exchange for an annual tribute of £500,{{sfn|Nicholas|2013|p=58}} but when Henry refused to pay, Robert allied with his nominal overlord, [[Louis VI of France]], and attacked [[Normandy]]. With the king diverted, [[Theobald II of Champagne|Theobald IV of Blois]] led a revolt of the French barons. Robert led an army against [[Meaux]]; during the battle he fell off his horse and was [[Trampling|trampled]] to death.{{sfn|Nicholas|1999|page=118}}

==Family==
He married [[Clementia of Burgundy]], sister of [[Pope Callistus II]] and daughter of [[William I, Count of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Bouchard|1987|p=146}} They had three children, but only the oldest survived to adulthood. He succeeded Robert as [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]].

'''Sean Leslie Flynn''' (May 31, 1941 – June 1971; [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]] in 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Young, Perry Deane; ''Two of the Missing: Remembering Sean Flynn &amp; Dana Stone '' p. 271 (Press 53: 2009) {{ISBN|978-0-9816280-9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American actor and freelance [[photojournalism|photojournalist]] best known for his coverage of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roth, Mitchel P.|title=Historical Dictionary of War Journalism|page=106|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-29171-3
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og8-5_oqumYC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flynn was the only child of Australian-American actor [[Errol Flynn]] and his first wife, French-American actress [[Lili Damita]]. After studying briefly at [[Duke University]], he embarked on an acting career. He retired by the mid-1960s to become a freelance photojournalist under contract to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

In search of exceptional images, he traveled with [[special forces]] units and irregulars operating in remote areas. While on assignment in [[Cambodia]] in April 1970, Flynn and fellow photojournalist [[Dana Stone]] were captured by communist guerrillas. Neither man was seen or heard from again.

In 1984, Flynn's mother had him [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']].

==Early life==
Flynn's parents separated when he was young. He was raised by his mother, Lili Damita.

==Entertainment career==
[[File:Sonofcaptainblood1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|&lt;center&gt;Original film poster - 1964&lt;br&gt;U.S. Release&lt;/center&gt;]]

Flynn first appeared in front of the cameras at the age of fifteen, when he appeared in an episode of his father's television show, ''[[The Errol Flynn Theatre]]''. The episode, "Strange Auction," was broadcast in the U.K. in 1956 and in the United States in 1957.

When Errol Flynn died, he left his son $5,000 to help with his college education (Errol left his two eldest daughters $10,000 each.)&lt;ref&gt;Bulk of flynn estate left to widow; see court fight.

Flynn was studying at Duke University. Over a summer break in June 1960, he was visiting his mother in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. At the suggestion of his friend, actor [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], Flynn filmed a scene in Hamilton's picture ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'', which was shooting in Fort Lauderdale at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn's son making his movie debut.

===Movie Star===
In May 1961, at the age of 20, Flynn accepted a contract with Sage Western Pictures to appear in the 1962 ''Il Figlio del Capitano Blood'', a sequel to his father's hit film ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]''.  He was paid $110 a week for the testing period, going up to $10,000 for 12 weeks work in the film. As Flynn was still legally a minor he needed his mother's permission, which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;Errol flynn's son, 20, gets film contract. (1961, May 27). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/167874324?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt; The test was successful.&lt;ref&gt;FILMLAND EVENTS.

In 1962 George Hamilton announced that he wanted to make ''The Brothers'', based on a story by Hamilton, starring himself and Flynn and [[Terry-Thomas|Terry Thomas]], but the film was never made.&lt;ref&gt;Scheuer, P.

He made a few more films in Europe, including ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Il segno di Zorro|it|3=Il segno di Zorro (film 1963)}}'' (1963; released in 1964 as ''Duel at the Rio Grande''), ''Verspätung in Marienborn'' with [[José Ferrer]] (1963; released in 1964 as ''[[Stop Train 349]]''),   ''Agent Special a Venise "Voir Venise et...Crever"'' (1964; sold to U.S. television syndication as ''Mission to Venice''), and ''Sandok, Il Maciste della Jungla'' (1964; released in 1966 as ''Temple of the White Elephant'').

Flynn became bored with acting, and he went to Africa in late 1964 to try his hand at being a guide for safaris and [[big-game hunting]]. He also spent time as a game warden in [[Kenya]]. In the latter part of 1965, he needed money, so he made two [[Spaghetti Western]]s in Spain and Italy that were released in 1966: ''Sette Magnifiche Pistole'' (''Seven Guns for Timothy'') and ''Dos Pistolas Gemelas'' co-starring the Spanish twin performers ''[[Pili &amp; Mili]]''. In the summer of 1966, Flynn went to Singapore to star in his eighth and final film, the French-Italian action film ''[[Cinq Gars Pour Singapour]]'' (1967; released in 1968 as ''[[Five Ashore in Singapore]]'').

===Singing career===
In September 1961 it was announced Flynn had signed a recording contract for a company known as Hi-Fidelity R.V. Records, and had already recorded four songs for them.&lt;ref&gt;YOUNG FLYNN'S DISC CONTRACT APPROVED. (1961, Sep 22). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/167898981?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

Two came out "Stay in My Heart" b/w "Secret Love". The songs were released regionally as a 45rpm single (Arvee 5043). The single is now a rare collector's item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaldogproductions.info/a/arvee-orbit-hifi.html 45 Discography for Arvee/Orbit/HiFi Records, retrieved 26 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photojournalism career==
===Vietnam===
Flynn arrived in South Vietnam in January 1966 as a freelance photojournalist, first for the French magazine ''[[Paris Match]]'', then for [[Time Life]], and finally for [[United Press International]]. His photos were soon published around the world. He made a name for himself as one of a group of high-risk photojournalists (which included [[Dana Stone]], [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]], [[Henri Huet]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[Perry Deane Young]], [[Nik Wheeler]], [[Chas Gerretsen]], and others) who would do anything to get the best pictures, even go into combat.

In March 1966, Flynn was wounded in the knee while in the field.

In April 1966 he was on patrol with some Green Berets and Chinese mercenaries, [[Nùng people|Nungs]], when they were ambushed by the Viet Cong. Flynn was carrying an M-16 rifle at the time and had to fight his way out along with the other soldiers. "I thought not only me but all of us were greased." Flynn had been given the rifle by the Green Berets and been under fire with them before.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn's son baffles out of red trap. (1966, Apr 27). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/155439283?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

In May he was the only journalist who made it into the [[Tinh Hai]] pagoda in [[Da Nang]].&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, S. (1966, May 22). Dead in pagoda await burial. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/178980304?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1966, he left Vietnam long enough to star in his last movie. It was to be shot in Paris and Singapore based on the 1959 novel, ''Cinq Gars Pour Singapour'' by [[Jean Bruce]] and was tentatively called ''OSS117 Goes to Singapore'', but was released as ''[[Cinq Gars Pour Singapour]]'' (Five Ashore in Singapore.).&lt;ref&gt;Erroll Flynn's son off to Paris for spy film role.

He returned to Vietnam. In November 1966 he was credited with saving an Australian platoon from being decimated by a mine by identifying that mine while photographing the troops near [[Vung Tau]].&lt;ref&gt;FLYNN'S SON CREDITED WITH SAVING AUSSIES. (1966, Nov 30). Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/155620844?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

He made a parachute jump with the 1st Brigade, [[101st Airborne Division]] in December 1966.

In February 1967 he and Hamilton went on a skiing holiday in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton goes skiing. (1967, Feb 11). The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) Retrieved from https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.sl.nsw.gov.au/docview/143281853?accountid=13902&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In 1967, he went to Israel to cover the [[Six-Day War|Arab-Israeli war of 1967]].

===Return to Vietnam===
He returned to Vietnam in 1968, after the [[Tet offensive]].

In September 1968 he was working as a cameraman for CBS when he was injured slightly by grenade fragments while shooting a battle between US and enemy forces 85 miles south of [[Danang]].&lt;ref&gt;Errol flynn's son hurt.

He went to Cambodia in early 1970, when news broke of North Vietnamese advances into that country.

==Disappearance==
On April 6, 1970, Flynn and a group of journalists left the city of [[Phnom Penh]] to attend a government sponsored press conference in [[Saigon]]. Flynn (who was freelancing) and fellow photojournalist [[Dana Stone]] (who was on assignment for [[CBS News]]) chose to travel on [[motorcycle]]s instead of the limousines that the majority of the other journalists were traveling in (the limousines had been previously used by tourists before the journalists took them over). Reporter [[Steve Bell (anchorman)|Steve Bell]], who was one of the last Westerners to see the two alive, later said that after the press conference, Flynn and Stone had gotten word that there was a checkpoint on [[National Highway 1 (Cambodia)|Highway 1]] manned by members of the [[Viet Cong]]. Eager to get a photograph of the Viet Cong, Flynn and Stone decided to set out on Highway 1 alone.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-errol-flynns-son-was-lost-in-cambodia-ndash-all-but-a-pile-of-bones-1931662.html|title=How Errol Flynn's son was lost in Cambodia – all but a pile of bones|date=March 31, 2010|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they left, Bell snapped the last known photo ever taken of Flynn and Stone.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/may152008/sean_flynn_5-14-08.php|title=Remembering Sean Flynn: A Photojournalist Who Died at War|last=King|first=Tim|date=May 15, 2008|publisher=salem-news.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is known that Flynn and Stone were captured by Viet Cong [[guerrilla]]s at a checkpoint on Highway 1, their true fate is unknown. It has been suggested that they died in the hands of "hostile" forces.&lt;ref&gt;PYLE, Richard &amp; FAAS, Horst. ''Lost over Laos; a true story of tragedy, mystery, and friendship'' pp. 43-45. (Da Capo Press: 2003) {{ISBN|0-306-81251-7}} Accessed Via Google Books June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Citing various government sources, the current consensus is that Flynn and Stone were held captive for over a year before they were killed by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in June 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Thomas A., ''The Spy Who Loved Us: The Vietnam War and Pham Xuan An's Dangerous Game'' p. 187, (PublicAffairs: 2009) {{ISBN|9781586484095}} Accessed Via Google Books June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Page (photographer)|Page, Tim]], ''Derailed in Uncle Ho's Victory Garden: Return to Vietnam and Cambodia '' p. 171 (Scribner: August 2, 1999) {{ISBN|0684860244}} Accessed via Amazon's LOOK INSIDE feature June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn's mother, [[Lili Damita]], spent an enormous amount of money searching for her son, with no success.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey; '' Inherited Risk: Errol Flynn and Sean Flynn in Hollywood and Vietnam '' p. 318 (Simon &amp; Schuster: 2002) {{ISBN|0-7432-1090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 she had him declared legally dead. She died in 1994.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

In March 2010, a British team searching for Flynn's body thought they had found it, when they uncovered the remains of a Western hostage allegedly executed by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1261281/Found-Cambodian-jungle--remains-Errol-Flynn-s-war-photographer-son.html |title=Found in a Cambodian jungle - but are they the remains of Errol Flynn's war photographer son? &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-03-27 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Test results on the human remains found at the grave site in eastern Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, were released on June 30, 2010, and they were found not to be the remains of Sean Flynn. Lt. Col. Wayne Perry of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command ([[JPAC]]) said there was no match between DNA from the recovered remains and DNA samples they had on file from the Flynn family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/cambodia/7863383/Sean-Flynn-not-buried-in-Cambodia-war-grave.html  Sean Flynn not buried in Cambodia war grave], [[The Daily Telegraph]].

==In popular culture==
The story of Sean Flynn was recounted by [[The Clash]] in the song "[[Sean Flynn (song)|Sean Flynn]]" from the album ''[[Combat Rock]]''.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;

Flynn has a prominent role in [[Michael Herr]]'s book about his experiences as a war correspondent, ''[[Dispatches (book)|Dispatches]]''.

Flynn was portrayed by [[Kevin Dillon]] in the 1992 British/Australian [[miniseries]] ''[[Frankie's House (miniseries)|Frankie's House]]'', based on a book by Flynn's friend and colleague, photojournalist [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=John|date=February 22, 1993|title=Television: Indochina Syndrome|journal=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC|volume=26|issue=8|page=62|issn=0028-7369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uiIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=mythic+films+frankie%27s+house#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Mythic Films had optioned the rights to the [[Perry Deane Young]] memoir, ''Two of the Missing''. At that time, Young was working on a screenplay with director [[Ralph Hemecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/movie-sean-flynn-be-made-117536|title=Movie about Sean Flynn to be made|date=August 14, 2008|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steve Peregrin Took''' (born '''Stephen Ross Porter'''; 28 July 1949 – 27 October 1980) was an English musician and songwriter. He is best known for his membership of the duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]] with [[Marc Bolan]]. After breaking with Bolan, he concentrated on his own [[Singer-songwriter|singer-songwriting]] activities, variously as a solo artist or as a [[frontman]] for several [[Musical ensemble|bands]].

==Career==
===Early life (1949-1967) and Tyrannosaurus Rex (1967–1969)===
{{main|T. Rex (band)}}

Took was born Stephen Ross Porter in [[Eltham]], London, on 28 July 1949, and attended [[Shooters Hill Sixth Form College|Shooters Hill School]]. He took his name from the [[hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. At the age of 17, having played drums for some months with a [[mod (subculture)|mod]] band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains), he answered an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], the electric band that [[Marc Bolan]] was forming following his departure from [[John's Children]]. After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London,&lt;ref name="TR1"/&gt; Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo, [[busking]] in [[subway (underpass)|subway]]s on acoustic guitar and [[Bongo drum|bongos]], Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in.

The [[Flower power|flower-power]] unit, championed by [[John Peel]] onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops, released three albums and achieved two [[top 40]] hits. Took contributed harmony backing vocals, which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings, and provided bongos, African drums, [[kazoo]], [[pixiphone]], and Chinese [[gong]]. Took's arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan's music from the straightforward rock 'n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan's new audience of [[hippie]]s. Towards the end of his time in the band, as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar, Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts.&lt;ref name="biog2" /&gt;

The band’s producer [[Tony Visconti]] credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an interview for the documentary “Marc Bolan: The Final Word”, Visconti opined that “Marc and Steve were a true 50:50 partnership. Steve was a remarkable musician, he could play many instruments. He played percussion, he could pick up a bass or a guitar. He would also sometimes play some cello parts. And then his backing vocals were great too.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn59mHnXNK8 |title=Tony Visconti on Steve Took |publisher= |date= |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Took developed his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex's third LP, ''Unicorn'', Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with "revolutionary" underground acts, such as [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] and [[The Pretty Things]]. The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they "cordially detested each other".&lt;ref name=TR2&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Took's friendship with Bolan's idol [[Syd Barrett]] had also developed through their shared interests in both [[LSD]] and "strange musical noises". [[Mick Farren]], in his memoir ''Give The Anarchist A Cigarette'', recalled that Took would "drag a bemused Syd Barrett along" to events in [[Ladbroke Grove]] in the late 1960s; Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s. Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased "Ramadan" tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=David|title=Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett, 1965–1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took also appeared as a backing vocalist on a session for [[David Bowie]], the results of which can be heard on the BBC sessions album ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]''.&lt;ref name="biog2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/bowie.html |title=Steve Took'S Musical Associations With David Bowie |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Took donated two of his songs - Three Little Piggies and The Sparrow Is A Sign - to former [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]] and [[The Pretty Things|Pretty Things]] drummer [[Twink (musician)|Twink]]'s 1969 solo album, ''[[Think Pink]]''.&lt;ref name="TR1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex— Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management sacked Took. Another contributing factor was an incident at the launch party for the UK edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', where jugs of [[punch (drink)|punch]] prepared for the event were [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|spiked]] with the [[hallucinogen]] [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|STP]]. Took had already earned himself the nickname "The Phantom Spiker" (in which he rejoiced) through previous similar pranks.&lt;ref name="TR1"/&gt; Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect.&lt;ref name="biog2" /&gt;

Took was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs. Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the [[shock rock]] style of [[Iggy Pop]]; as Took explained to the [[NME]] in 1972 "I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach."&lt;ref name=csm&gt;[http://stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/nme-murray-1972.html ''Steve Took - From Bolan Boogie To Gutter Rock'' [[Charles Shaar Murray]], [[NME]] 14 October 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking. Bolan replaced Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], and after [[A Beard Of Stars|one further album]] renamed the duo [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], later expanding to a full band again.&lt;ref name="biog2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-2.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER ONE -BEGINNINGS – (Steve's life up to his departure from Tyrannosaurus Rex in 1969 and the genesis of his songwriting career) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=28 July 1949 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pink Fairies (1969–1970)===
{{main|Pink Fairies}}
After being sacked by Bolan, Took formed a prototype version of the [[Pink Fairies]] with [[Twink (musician)|Twink]] and [[Mick Farren]], recently ousted from his own band, the Deviants. This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year, along with other leading lights of the underground scene. Together with Twink's girlfriend Silva Darling, they performed what Farren would later describe as "less of a gig than a protracted harangue" at the [[University of Manchester]] in October 1969, which rapidly dissolved into chaos. Took appeared prominently on Farren's first solo album ''[[Mona – The Carnivorous Circus]]'' (recorded December 1969, released 1970). Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the [[Pink Fairies]] (mark 2), without Took or Farren.&lt;ref name="biog3" /&gt;

===Shagrat (1970–1971)===
{{main|Shagrat (band)}}
In February 1970, Farren and Took headhunted guitarist [[Larry Wallis|Larry (or "Lazza") Wallis]] and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band, the Entire Sioux Nation. A month later, Farren dropped out, leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career. With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir, Shagrat was formed (named after an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). They recorded three tracks, "Peppermint Flickstick", "Boo! I Said Freeze" and "Steel Abortion", at [[Strawberry Studios]] and played live at the [[Phun City]] festival, before Lenoir and Taylor left. Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell, rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar, Wallis on [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]] and Bidwell on [[tambourine]]. This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos, "Amanda", "Strange Sister", "Still Yawning Stillborn" and "Beautiful Deceiver", at Wallis's father's home studio in [[South London]], which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001.&lt;ref name="biog3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-3.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 2 – SHAGRAT STORY – (Steve's part in the formation of the Pink Fairies – The Band, and how he came to become an outright frontman for his own group) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=26 July 1970 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their ''Kings of Oblivion'' LP, substantially transforming the sound and style of the band. He and Took would work together again at various intervals in 1972, 1975–76 and 1977.&lt;ref name="biog5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biog7" /&gt;

===Solo acoustic performer (1971–1972)===
With Wallis and Bidwell otherwise committed to [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Savoy Brown]] respectively, the acoustic Shagrat was effectively reduced down to just Took himself performing solo on an acoustic guitar, usually sitting on a stool interspersing his songs with jokes and other onstage monologues. In this format, Took made some headway as a live performer. "Tookie" appeared in frequent support slots for [[Hawkwind]] and the Pink Fairies, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw's ''Breakthrough'' programme on [[BBC Radio London]].&lt;ref name="biog4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steve-bradshaw.com/radio.html |title=radio |publisher=Steve Bradshaw |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1971, he headlined a three-date mini-tour of southwest England.&lt;ref name="flyer" /&gt;

He also performed at various benefit events, including the "Nasty Balls" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazine&lt;ref name="flyer" /&gt; (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] festival at [[Aldermaston]],&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/gig-flyer.html |title=Steve Took – Gig Flyers, Posters &amp; Adverts |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/aldermaston.html |title=Memories of Aldermaston Free Festival – Interview By Charles Sharr Murray |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve's account of which was reprinted by [[Charles Shaar Murray]] in his book ''Shots From The Hip''.&lt;ref name="biog4" /&gt; Writing for the [[NME]] in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: "Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does. A few more know him as a somewhat bizarre figure who materialises at concerts, armed only with an Epiphone guitar, and performs a freeform set of songs, raps, jokes and anything else that flashes through his mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Charles Shaar|title=Steve Took—From Bolan Boogie To Gutter Rock|journal=NME|date=16 October 1972|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/nme-murray-1972.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Took could also often be seen participating in jamming sessions during encores at Hawkwind and Pink Fairies concerts. His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer, and he also once played bass guitar for the "Pinks", substituting for Duncan Sanderson.&lt;ref name="biog4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-4.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 3 – A ROCK 'N ROLL SINGER WITHOUT A BAND – (An account of Steve's career as a solo acoustic performer prior to his association with Tony Secunda) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management of Tony Secunda (1972–1973)===
During 1972, Took was approached by [[Tony Secunda]], recently fired as manager for [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], with a view to recovering [[royalties]] owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years. Emerging from these conversations, Secunda became Took's manager, with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan. Initially, Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song "Amanda" from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks, ''Blind Owl Blues'' and ''Mr Discrete'') with the assistance of the Pink Fairies rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of [[Paul Rudolph (musician)|Paul Rudolph]]. During this session, former [[Junior's Eyes (band)|Junior's Eyes]]/[[David Bowie|Bowie]] guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist.&lt;ref name="biog5" /&gt;

However, none of these tracks were ever completed to Took's satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as "[[cannabis (drug)|dope]]-induced thinking" and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies. (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis, leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above). Took and Secunda, meanwhile, embarked upon a different approach.&lt;ref name="biog5" /&gt;

Took moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda's Mayfair offices, which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease. The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene, who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took. As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, Secunda reported that Took received visits from [[Syd Barrett]], who at the time was living in Cambridge, but would shortly relocate back to London. From Secunda's account, it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends.&lt;ref name="biog5" /&gt;

Highlights of the session tapes were eventually released by [[Cleopatra Records]] in 1995, as ''The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex''. A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song "Beautiful Deceiver" is tracklisted on the CD as "Syd's Wine" and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond, an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]", written in tribute to Barrett. Stripped down versions of the track "Syd's Wine" reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises.&lt;ref name="biog5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-5.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 4 – SECUNDA AND THE REVENGE MASTERPLAN – (The story of Steve's association with Tony Secunda, the sessions recorded in his basement flat and the 1972 NME interview with Charles Shaar Murray) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=14 October 1972 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various projects (1973–1976)===
After splitting with Secunda, Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members, most notably [[Robert Calvert]], Adrian Wagner,&lt;ref name="pen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/penatration.html |title=Penetration Interview By Paul Welsh |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nik Turner]]. Took was scheduled to be the support act for Calvert's cancelled "[[Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters]]" tour. He and Bidwell formed at least two bands, the first with guitarist Eisuke Takahashi, the second with guitarist Hiroshi Kato and future Hawkwind bassist [[Ade Shaw|Adrian Shaw]].&lt;ref name="biog6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-6.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 5 – YOU SEE, I HAVE THIS REPUTATION TO CONTEND WITH' – (Steve's career during 1973–76, his 1974 band, the Penetration interview and work with Bob Calvert, Adrian Wagner and Nik Turner) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=22 July 1974 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter line-up recorded a session of four tracks in summer 1974 including Flophouse Blues (previously recorded twice in the 1972 Secunda sessions)&lt;ref&gt;Sleevenotes by [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] - Steve Peregrine Took - The Missing Link to Tyrannosarus Rex, Cleopatra Records CLEO 95282, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time around 1975, Took lived in the [[Kent]] towns of [[Canterbury]] and [[Margate]], where he took on local musician and promoter Les Best as his manager. While down there, Took formed a new band, Jolly Roger And The Crimson Gash, with Takahashi now on bass and two local musicians, Brian East on drums and a guitarist called Phil.  This band gigged locally and recorded at least four tracks, produced by Turner at his home studio in [[Westgate on Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;A Trip Through Ladbroke Grove - The Life And Times Of Underground Hero Steve Peregrin Took, by Fee Warner, {{ISBN|978-1-78808-168-9}} pp264-266, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steve Took's Horns (1976–1978)===
{{main|Steve Took's Horns}}
By 1976, Took was back in London and using the bandname Steve Took's Horns, so called after a horned [[pendant]] which he habitually wore. By mid 1977, this had solidified into a steady line-up featuring, in what would be the first of several bands together over many years, [[Trev Thoms|Trevor Thoms]] and [[Dino Ferari|Ermanno Ghisio-Erba]], later better known to [[Inner City Unit]] (ICU) fans as Judge Trev and Dino Ferari.&lt;ref name="biog7" /&gt;

This group, managed by Turner's friend since adolescence Tony Landau, recorded a session of three studio tracks – It's Over, Average Man and Woman I Need – at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977, before going on to perform a gig on 18 June 1978 at [[The Roundhouse]], as part of "Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In". Took felt the gig went badly, and decide to split up the band.&lt;ref name="biog7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-7.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 6 – 'HE SENT ME SOME TAPES AND THEY WERE INTERESTING'- (Steve's brief 1977-8 career revival, and the story of Steve Took's Horns) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pathway Studios session would be released on CD by [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] in 2004, as ''Blow It!!! The All New Adventures of Steve Took's Horns'', with the CD also featuring out-takes, remixes and fresh recordings of two other Took songs – Ooh My Heart and Too Bad – which the Horns had been rehearsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/horns.html |title=STEVE TOOK'S HORNS – History of the band and gig adverts |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with Inner City Unit (1979–1980)===
{{main|Inner City Unit}}
Despite the break-up, Steve Took's Horns had made a considerable impression on Took's circle of acquaintances. Consequently, Nik Turner, having first drafted Ghisio-Erba/Ferari into his band Sphynx for a live festival LP recorded that August, went on in 1979 to incorporate the Thoms/Ghisio-Erba partnership into his new [[Inner City Unit]].

Took guested with ICU a number of times, reuniting with his old Horns sidemen; the last recorded dates being 16 June 1980 at London's [[Koko (venue)|Music Machine]] and sometime around 21 June 1980 at the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in Wiltshire – a festival frequented by other 'Festival Bands', most famously Took's old [[Ladbroke Grove]] cohorts Hawkwind. Bootleg recordings exist of the above-mentioned Music Machine show and also an open-air performance on 6 May 1980&lt;ref name="gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawkwind.altervista.org/turner/nt1980-06-21bon.htm |title=Inner City Unit - 1980-06-21 - Maclen's Live Archive - audio archive list |publisher=Hawkwind.altervista.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Meanwhile Gardens in Notting Hill Gate, on both of which Took can be heard performing lead vocals on a cover of [[The Beatles]]' version of [[Larry Williams]]' "[[Slow Down (Larry Williams song)|Slow Down]]"&lt;ref name="gardens" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biog8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/icu.html |title=Inner City Unit &amp; Steve Took |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Took had one son &lt;!---Please do not name him unless he himself some day becomes Wikinotable in his own right ---&gt; in the early 1970s with partner Lindsay Tunstall aka Lou, later the partner of Landau.  Took also had relationships with, among others, Valerie "Sam" Billiet (1979-1980) [[Drug lord|drug baroness]] Gertrude de Freyne (1977-1978), a woman called Angie (1969-1971)&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Farren]]''Give The Anarchist A Cigarette'' Pimlico 2001, pages 259 and 265&lt;/ref&gt; and Tracy Inder, the mother of [[Lemmy]]'s son Paul Inder, to whom Took was a stepfather figure during the relationship (1974-1976.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/2015-news.html&lt;/ref&gt; as he later also was to Billiet's daughter.

==Death==

[[File:Steve Peregrin Took's Grave in February, 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Steve Peregrin Took's Grave at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London, in February 2014]]
Steve Took died on Monday 27 October 1980 at 14 Clydesdale House, 255  Westbourne Park Road, Notting Hill, London W11 1ED, aged 31, in the maisonette he shared with Billiet and her young daughter.  As a consequence of intervention by Best, now once again Took's manager, royalty cheques for the Tyrannosaurus Rex 'Blue Thumb' American releases had been arriving periodically, and Took had received one that week. The day prior to his death, Took purchased morphine and hallucinogenic mushrooms for himself and Billiet, and the evening before Took died, they both injected themselves with the morphine.&lt;ref name="biog8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-8.html |title=CAREER HISTORY – CHAPTER 7 – 'CAN I EVER HOPE TO DIE NATURALLY' – (Steve's last days, 1978–1980) |publisher=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=27 October 1980 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Took's death certificate records the cause of death as being asphyxiation after inhaling a cocktail cherry.

==Concert Tours==
===Headlining===
* Community Music tour of [[Devon]]/[[Cornwall]] - three dates December 1971 (two as outright headline, one as co-headline with [[Stealers Wheel]])&lt;ref name="flyer" /&gt;

===Opening act===
(Took, as a solo performer, was scheduled to have been the opening act on [[Bob Calvert]]'s cancelled 1974 ''Captain Lockheed'' UK tour.)

==Equipment==
As a singer songwriter, Took's two main guitars were an [[Epiphone]] acoustic guitar decorated with stickers (including one of [[Eddie Cochran]]) used for solo work, last known to have been in the possession of Billiet, and an electric [[Rickenbacker]] used as a rhythm guitar with Took's electric bands, currently owned by Best.  Both guitars feature prominently in [[Keith Morris]]' early 1970s publicity photographs of Took.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keithmorrisphoto.co.uk/steve-peregin-took-1974-london/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/outdoors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously as a member of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took's percussion and other equipment included bongos, tabla, finger cymbals, African talking drum, kazoos, a Chinese gong and a Pixiphone (toy xylophone).  As the duo reverted to electric music in early 1969, Took also played a [[Höfner 500/1]] bass and a [[Chad Valley (toy brand)|Chad Valley]] toy drumkit.  In later years, when performing solo support gigs for Hawkwind, Took would often include his bongos as part of his equipment itinery. so that, later in the evening, he could guest with Hawkwind on a few songs in their set.

{{Programming paradigms}}

{{Notice|This article mixes '''Dijkstra's Structured programming''' up with Mills's [[Structured program theorem|Structure theorem]]. Dijkstra's 'Structured programming' features 'Step-wise abstraction', 'Step-wise refinement', 'Joint refinement' and 'Hierarchy structure (Programs as necklaces strung from pearls)'.&lt;ref name="structured_programming"&gt;[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1969.PDF E. W. Dijkstra, “Structured Programming”, In ''Software Engineering Techniques'', B. Randell and J.N. Buxton, (Eds.), NATO Scientific Affairs Division, Brussels, Belgium, 1970, pp. 84–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dijkstra didn't persist in Control structures.&lt;ref name="structured_programming"/&gt; IBM researcher [[Harlan Mills]] let many people misunderstand that 'Structure theorem' is equal to Dijkstra's 'Structured programming'.}}

'''Structured programming''' is a [[programming paradigm]] aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a [[computer program]] by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection ([[Conditional (computer programming)|if/then/else]]) and repetition (while and [[For loop|for]]), [[Block (programming)|block structures]], and [[subroutines]].

It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the [[ALGOL 58]] and [[ALGOL 60]] programming languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Leslie B. Wilson, Robert G.|last2=Robert|first2=Clark|title=Comparative programming languages|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Harlow, England|isbn=9780201710120|page=20|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVSjoO8f2fMC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Comparative%20Programming%20Languages&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=Comparative%20Programming%20Languages&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126050203/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bVSjoO8f2fMC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=zItCa2GxG6&amp;dq=Comparative%20Programming%20Languages&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=Comparative%20Programming%20Languages&amp;f=false|archivedate=26 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter including support for block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the [[structured program theorem]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohm|first=Corrado|author2=Giuseppe Jacopini|date=May 1966|title=Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines and Languages with Only Two Formation Rules|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=9|issue=5|pages=366–371|doi=10.1145/355592.365646|url=http://www.cs.unibo.it/~martini/PP/bohm-jac.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211431/http://www.cs.unibo.it/~martini/PP/bohm-jac.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.119.9119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of the influential "[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]" open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], who coined the term "structured programming".{{sfn|Dijkstra|1968|ps=, "The unbridled use of the go to statement has as an immediate consequence that it becomes terribly hard to find a meaningful set of coordinates in which to describe the process progress.  ... The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive, it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one's program."}}

Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when [[exception handling]] has to be performed.

==Elements==

===Control structures===
Following the [[structured program theorem]], all programs are seen as composed of [[control structure]]s:
* "Sequence"; ordered statements or subroutines executed in sequence.
* "Selection"; one or a number of statements is executed depending on the state of the program. This is usually expressed with [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s such as [[Conditional (programming)|&lt;code&gt;if..then..else..endif&lt;/code&gt;]].
* "Iteration"; a statement or block is executed until the program reaches a certain state, or operations have been applied to every element of a collection.  This is usually expressed with keywords such as [[While loop|&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;]], [[Do while loop|&lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt;]], [[For loop|&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;]] or [[Do while loop|&lt;code&gt;do..until&lt;/code&gt;]]. Often it is recommended that each loop should only have one entry point (and in the original structural programming, also only one exit point, and a few languages enforce this).
* "Recursion"; a statement is executed by repeatedly calling itself until termination conditions are met. While similar in practice to iterative loops, recursive loops may be more computationally efficient, and are implemented differently as a cascading stack.

[[File:Structured program patterns.png|thumb|700px|center|Graphical representation of the [[structured program theorem|three basic patterns]] — sequence, selection, and repetition — using [[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram|NS diagrams]] (blue) and [[flow chart]]s (green).]]

===Subroutines===
[[Subroutine]]s; callable units such as procedures, functions, methods, or subprograms are used to allow a sequence to be referred to by a single statement.

===Blocks===
[[Block (programming)|Blocks]] are used to enable groups of statements to be treated as if they were one statement. ''Block-structured'' languages have a syntax for enclosing structures in some formal way, such as an if-statement bracketed by &lt;code&gt;if..fi&lt;/code&gt; as in [[ALGOL 68]], or a code section bracketed by &lt;code&gt;BEGIN..END&lt;/code&gt;, as in [[PL/I]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[whitespace character|whitespace]] indentation as in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] - or the curly braces &lt;code&gt;{...}&lt;/code&gt; of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Curly brace family#Curly-bracket languages|many later languages]].

==Structured programming languages==
It is possible to do structured programming in any programming language, though it is preferable to use something like a [[procedural programming language]]. Some of the languages initially used for structured programming include: [[ALGOL]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], but most new procedural programming languages since that time have included features to encourage structured programming, and sometimes deliberately left out features – notably GOTO – in an effort to make [[unstructured programming]] more difficult.
''Structured programming'' (sometimes known as modular programming) enforces a logical structure on the program being written to make it more efficient and easier to understand and modify.

==History==

===Theoretical foundation===
The [[structured program theorem]] provides the theoretical basis of structured programming. It states that three ways of combining programs&amp;mdash;sequencing, selection, and iteration&amp;mdash;are sufficient to express any [[computable function]]. This observation did not originate with the structured programming movement; these structures are sufficient to describe the [[instruction cycle]] of a [[central processing unit]], as well as the operation of a [[Turing machine]]. Therefore, a processor is always executing a "structured program" in this sense, even if the instructions it reads from memory are not part of a structured program. However, authors usually credit the result to a 1966 paper by Böhm and Jacopini, possibly because [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]] cited this paper himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dijkstra |first=E. W. |title=Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=March 1968 |pages=147–148 |issn=0001-0782 |doi=10.1145/362929.362947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structured program theorem does not address how to write and analyze a usefully structured program. These issues were addressed during the late 1960s and early 1970s, with major contributions by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]], [[Robert W. Floyd]], [[Tony Hoare]], [[Ole-Johan Dahl]], and [[David Gries]].

===Debate===
[[P. J. Plauger]], an [[early adopter]] of structured programming, described his reaction to the structured program theorem:
:Us converts waved this interesting bit of news under the noses of the unreconstructed assembly-language programmers who kept trotting forth twisty bits of logic and saying, 'I betcha can't structure this.' Neither the proof by Böhm and Jacopini nor our repeated successes at writing structured code brought them around one day sooner than they were ready to convince themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Knuth]] accepted the principle that programs must be written with provability in mind, but he disagreed (and still disagrees{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}) with abolishing the GOTO statement. In his 1974 paper, "Structured Programming with Goto Statements",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/CS185C/KnuthStructuredProgrammingGoTo.pdf Donald Knuth - Structured programming with go to statements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061601/http://cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/CS185C/KnuthStructuredProgrammingGoTo.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he gave examples where he believed that a direct jump leads to clearer and more efficient code without sacrificing provability. Knuth proposed a looser structural constraint: It should be possible to draw a program's [[flow chart]] with all forward branches on the left, all backward branches on the right, and no branches crossing each other. Many of those knowledgeable in [[compiler]]s and [[graph theory]] have advocated allowing only [[reducible flow graphs]]{{definition|date=April 2012}}.{{Who|date=May 2011}}

Structured programming theorists gained a major ally in the 1970s after [[IBM]] researcher [[Harlan Mills]] applied his interpretation of structured programming theory to the development of an indexing system for ''[[The New York Times]]'' research file. The project was a great engineering success, and managers at other companies cited it in support of adopting structured programming, although Dijkstra criticized the ways that Mills's interpretation differed from the published work.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

As late as 1987 it was still possible to raise the question of structured programming in a computer science journal. Frank Rubin did so in that year with an open letter titled ""GOTO considered harmful" considered harmful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frank Rubin |date=March 1987 | url = http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-20 |format=PDF| title = "GOTO Considered Harmful" Considered Harmful | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–196 | doi = 10.1145/214748.315722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous objections followed, including a response from Dijkstra that sharply criticized both Rubin and the concessions other writers made when responding to him.

===Outcome===
By the end of the 20th century nearly all computer scientists were convinced that it is useful to learn and apply the concepts of structured programming. High-level programming languages that originally lacked programming structures, such as [[FORTRAN]], [[COBOL]], and [[BASIC]], now have them.

==Common deviations==

While goto has now largely been replaced by the structured constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), few languages are purely structured. The most common deviation, found in many languages, is the use of a [[return statement]] for early exit from a subroutine. This results in multiple exit points, instead of the single exit point required by structured programming. There are other constructions to handle cases that are awkward in purely structured programming.

===Early exit===
The most common deviation from structured programming is early exit from a function or loop. At the level of functions, this is a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement. At the level of loops, this is a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement (terminate the loop) or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statement (terminate the current iteration, proceed with next iteration). In structured programming, these can be replicated by adding additional branches or tests, but for returns from nested code this can add significant complexity. [[C (programming language)|C]] is an early and prominent example of these constructs. Some newer languages also have "labeled breaks", which allow breaking out of more than just the innermost loop. Exceptions also allow early exit, but have further consequences, and thus are treated below.

Multiple exits can arise for a variety of reasons, most often either that the subroutine has no more work to do (if returning a value, it has completed the calculation), or has encountered "exceptional" circumstances that prevent it from continuing, hence needing exception handling.

The most common problem in early exit is that cleanup or final statements are not executed – for example, allocated memory is not deallocated, or open files are not closed, causing [[memory leak]]s or [[resource leak]]s. These must be done at each return site, which is brittle and can easily result in bugs. For instance, in later development, a return statement could be overlooked by a developer, and an action which should be performed at the end of a subroutine (e.g., a [[Tracing (software)|trace]] statement) might not be performed in all cases. Languages without a return statement, such as standard [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], do not have this problem.

Most modern languages provide language-level support to prevent such leaks;{{sfn|Elder|Jackson|Liblit|2008}} see detailed discussion at [[resource management (computing)|resource management]]. Most commonly this is done via unwind protection, which ensures that certain code is guaranteed to be run when execution exits a block; this is a structured alternative to having a cleanup block and a &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;. This is most often known as &lt;code&gt;try...finally,&lt;/code&gt; and considered a part of [[exception handling]]. Various techniques exist to encapsulate resource management. An alternative approach, found primarily in C++, is [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization]], which uses normal stack unwinding (variable deallocation) at function exit to call destructors on local variables to deallocate resources.

[[Kent Beck]], [[Martin Fowler]] and co-authors have argued in their [[refactoring]] books that nested conditionals may be harder to understand than a certain type of flatter structure using multiple exits predicated by [[guard clause]]s. Their 2009 book flatly states that "one exit point is really not a useful rule. Clarity is the key principle: If the method is clearer with one exit point, use one exit point; otherwise don’t". They offer a cookbook solution for transforming a function consisting only of nested conditionals into a sequence of guarded return (or throw) statements, followed by a single unguarded block, which is intended to contain the code for the common case, while the guarded statements are supposed to deal with the less common ones (or with errors).&lt;ref name="FieldsHarvie2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay Fields|author2=Shane Harvie|author3=Martin Fowler|author4=Kent Beck|title=Refactoring: Ruby Edition|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-321-60350-0|pages=274–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herb Sutter]] and [[Andrei Alexandrescu]] also argue in their 2004 C++ tips book that the single-exit point is an obsolete requirement.&lt;ref name="SutterAlexandrescu2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herb Sutter|author2=Andrei Alexandrescu|title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-265442-5|quote="Example 4: Single entry, single exit ("SESE"). Historically, some coding standards have required that each function have exactly one exit, meaning one return statement. Such a requirement is obsolete in languages that support exceptions and destructors, where functions typically have numerous implicit exits.")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 textbook, [[David Watt (computer scientist)|David Watt]] writes that "single-entry multi-exit control flows are often desirable". Using Tennent's framework notion of [[S-algol|sequencer]], Watt uniformly describes the control flow constructs found in contemporary programming languages and attempts to explain why certain types of sequencers are preferable to others in the context of multi-exit control flows. Watt writes that unrestricted gotos (jump sequencers) are bad because the destination of the jump is not self-explanatory to the reader of a program until the reader finds and examines the actual label or address that is the target of the jump. In contrast, Watt argues that the conceptual intent of a return sequencer is clear from its own context, without having to examine its destination. Watt writes that a class of sequencers known as ''escape sequencers'', defined as a "sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure", encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. Watt also notes that while jump sequencers (gotos) have been somewhat restricted in languages like C, where the target must be an inside the local block or an encompassing outer block, that restriction alone is not sufficient to make the intent of gotos in C self-describing and so they can still produce "[[spaghetti code]]". Watt also examines how exception sequencers differ from escape and jump sequencers; this is explained in the next section of this article.&lt;ref name="WattFindlay2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Anthony Watt|author2=William Findlay|title=Programming language design concepts|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85320-7|pages=215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the above, [[Bertrand Meyer]] wrote in his 2009 textbook that instructions like &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; "are just the old &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; in sheep's clothing" and strongly advised against their use.&lt;ref name="Meyer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Meyer|title=Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-92144-8|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exception handling ===
Based on the coding error from the [[Cluster (spacecraft)|Ariane 501 disaster]], software developer Jim Bonang argues that any exceptions thrown from a function violate the single-exit paradigm, and proposes that all inter-procedural exceptions should be forbidden. In C++ syntax, this is done by declaring all function signatures as &lt;code&gt;noexcept&lt;/code&gt; (since C++11) or &lt;code&gt;throw()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-04/the-pragmatic-defense|title=PragPub April 2012 - The Pragmatic Defense -  The Pragmatic Bookshelf|author=|date=|website=pragprog.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710032214/https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-04/the-pragmatic-defense|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonang proposes that all single-exit conforming C++ should be written along the lines of:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
bool myCheck1() throw()
{
  bool success = false;

  try 
  {
    // do something that may throw exceptions
    if(myCheck2() == false) 
    {
        throw SomeInternalException();
    }

    // other code similar to the above
    success = true;
  }

  catch(...)
  {
      // all exceptions caught and logged
  }

  return success;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Peter Ritchie&lt;!--not the lawyer, don't wikilink--&gt; also notes that, in principle, even a single &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; right before the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; in a function constitutes a violation of the single-exit principle, but argues that Dijkstra's rules were written in a time before exception handling became a paradigm in programming languages, so he proposes to allow any number of throw points in addition to a single return point. He notes that solutions which wrap exceptions for the sake of creating a single-exit have higher nesting depth and thus are more difficult to comprehend, and even accuses those who propose to apply such solutions to programming languages which support exceptions of engaging in [[Cargo cult#Metaphorical uses of the term|cargo cult]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msmvps.com/blogs/peterritchie/archive/2008/03/07/single-entry-single-exit-should-it-still-be-applicable-in-object-oriented-languages.aspx |title=Single-Entry, Single-Exit, Should It Still be Applicable in Object-oriented Languages? – Peter Ritchie's MVP Blog |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114195652/http://msmvps.com/blogs/peterritchie/archive/2008/03/07/single-entry-single-exit-should-it-still-be-applicable-in-object-oriented-languages.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Watt also analyzes exception handling in the framework of sequencers (introduced in this article in the previous section on early exits.) Watt notes that an abnormal situation (generally exemplified with arithmetic 
overflows or input/output failures like file not found) is a kind of error that "is detected in some low-level program unit, but [for which] a handler is more naturally located in a high-level program unit". For example, a program might contain several calls to read files, but the action to perform when a file is not found depends on the meaning (purpose) of the file in question to the program and thus a handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located in low-level system code. Watts further notes that introducing status flags testing in the caller, as single-exit structured programming or even (multi-exit) return sequencers would entail, results in a situation where "the application code tends to get cluttered by tests of status flags" and that "the programmer might forgetfully or lazily omit to test a status flag. In fact, abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored!" He notes that in contrast to status flags testing, exceptions have the opposite [[default (computer science)|default behavior]], causing the program to terminate unless the programmer explicitly deals with the exception in some way, possibly by adding code to willfully ignore it. Based on these arguments, Watt concludes that jump sequencers or escape sequencers (discussed in the previous section) aren't as suitable as a dedicated exception sequencer with the semantics discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Anthony Watt|author2=William Findlay|title=Programming language design concepts|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85320-7|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textbook by Louden and Lambert emphasizes that exception handling differs from structured programming constructs like &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops because the transfer of control "is set up at a different point in the program than that where the actual transfer takes place. At the point where the transfer actually occurs, there may be no syntactic indication that control will in fact be transferred."&lt;ref name="LoudenLambert2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth C. Louden|author2=Kenneth A. Lambert|title=Programming Languages: Principles and Practices|year=2011|edition=3|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-52941-3|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer science professor Arvind Kumar Bansal also notes that in languages which implement exception handling, even control structures like &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, which have the single-exit property in absence of exceptions, no longer have it in presence of exceptions, because an exception can prematurely cause an early exit in any part of the control structure; for instance if &lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; throws an exception in &lt;code&gt;for (init(); check(); increm())&lt;/code&gt;, then the usual exit point after check() is not reached.&lt;ref name="Bansal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Kumar Bansal|title=Introduction to Programming Languages|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6514-2|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing multiple prior studies by others (1999-2004) and their own results, Westley Weimer and [[George Necula]] wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they "create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about".&lt;ref name="toplas2008"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Weimer, W|author2=Necula, G.C.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Exceptional Situations and Program Reliability|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems |volume=30 |issue=2|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-toplas2008.pdf|year=2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211739/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-toplas2008.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8:27}}&lt;!--that is a single page number in the paper, where the quote is found--&gt;

The necessity to limit code to single-exit points appears in some contemporary programming environments focused on parallel computing, such as [[OpenMP]]. The various parallel constructs from OpenMP, like &lt;code&gt;parallel do&lt;/code&gt;, do not allow early exits from inside to the outside of the parallel construct; this restriction includes all manner of exits, from &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; to C++ exceptions, but all of these are permitted inside the parallel construct if the jump target is also inside it.&lt;ref name="Chandra2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rohit Chandra|title=Parallel Programming in OpenMP|year=2001|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-671-5|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple entry===
{{further|Coroutine}}
More rarely, subprograms allow multiple ''entry.'' This is most commonly only ''re''-entry into a [[coroutine]] (or [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]]/semicoroutine), where a subprogram yields control (and possibly a value), but can then be resumed where it left off. There are a number of [[Coroutine#Common uses|common uses]] of such programming, notably for [[Stream (computing)|streams]] (particularly input/output), state machines, and concurrency. From a code execution point of view, yielding from a coroutine is closer to structured programming than returning from a subroutine, as the subprogram has not actually terminated, and will continue when called again – it is not an early exit. However, coroutines mean that multiple subprograms have execution state – rather than a single call stack of subroutines – and thus introduce a different form of complexity.

It is very rare for subprograms to allow entry to an arbitrary position in the subprogram, as in this case the program state (such as variable values) is uninitialized or ambiguous, and this is very similar to a goto.

===State machines===
Some programs, particularly [[parsers]] and [[communications protocol]]s, have a number of [[state (computer science)|states]] that follow each other in a way that is not easily reduced to the basic structures, and some programmers implement the state-changes with a jump to the new state. This type of state-switching is often used in the Linux kernel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, it is possible to structure these systems by making each state-change a separate subprogram and using a variable to indicate the active state (see [[trampoline (computing)|trampoline]]). Alternatively, these can be implemented via coroutines, which dispense with the trampoline.

'''Therapeutic abortion''' is [[abortion]] induced following a diagnosis of medical necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=17777][http://www.thefreedictionary.com/therapeutic+abortion] American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Such abortions are carried out in order to avoid the risk of substantial harm to the mother or in cases of fetal unviability. In many countries therapeutic abortion is legal, including some where elective abortion is illegal.

==Etymology==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

According to Robert E. Cooke, the word therapeutic means “pertaining to treatment or healing.”&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Robert E., et al. The Terrible Choice: The Abortion Dilemma. New York: Bantam Books inc., 1968. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "abortion" in [[biology]] means "the arrested development of an embryo or an organ at a more or less early stage."&lt;ref&gt;"Abortion." Dictionary.com. Random House, Inc., 04 Mar 2010. Web. 13 Dec 2010. &lt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abortion&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Many therapeutic abortions are performed today, with some degree of controversy regarding the quality of life, if the baby has a genetic condition which is thought likely to lead to a shorter life than that of a healthy child (among such conditions would be: severe cases of certain genetic conditions, conditions which entail the inability of certain vital organs such as the heart or liver to function without sustained support which are not amenable to surgical repair or transplantation, severe cases of profound mental impairment, the lack of portions of the brainstem or the higher brain, such as the cerebral hemispheres, or [[anencephaly]], among others). 

There is little evidence that a pregnancy with a disabled child is any more dangerous for the mother than that with a healthy child.  All pregnancies pose some risk to maternal health, but it is extremely rare that a problem with the baby's health significantly increases the risk to the mother's health. In the vast majority of cases, pregnancies with babies with abnormalities progress without any extra risk to the mother.  Hence the controversy of using the term "therapeutic abortion" as a justification for aborting a baby with abnormalities.  Dangers in pregnancy to a mother's health normally are the result of some underlying medical condition of the mother's alone [citation needed]. 

In developed countries in the West (i.e., most European countries and the United States, among others), the state of medical care for those pregnant women or those women who could become pregnant (who can get access to affordable contemporary care and are given it in a timely manner) is such the rare cases that would pose an indisputable threat to the mother's life (e.g., most cases of ectopic pregnancy, uterine cancer, and certain other causes) this can be diagnosed in a timely enough manner that a medical or surgical therapeutic abortion is performed before the situation becomes medically unstable. That is decidedly not the case in remote areas of the Third World (many areas of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) with little access to advanced medical care, or in areas (or social, relational, and familial situations) where a woman's right to emergency medical care is violated. Many secular and religious ethical codes- even those that consider other abortions to be extremely immoral- will usually allow for an abortion, under the principle of [[double effect]], where the medical crisis is the result of a natural biological phenomenon and is absolutely necessary to save the woman's life; disagreement persists, however, about what does or does not constitute an ethical justification for a non-elective therapeutic abortion, particularly regarding genetic disorders or mental impairment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/therapeutic+abortion] Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; There are many situations in which therapeutic abortions are performed that do not involve a grave threat to the pregnant woman's life, mobility, or physical health, and there are many cases where therapeutic abortions are performed in situations where the embryo or fetus is capable of surviving outside the mother's body, with or without assistance or significant impairments. In some developed societies, merely a pregnant woman's stated desire to terminate her pregnancy is the only criterion necessary for an abortion to be deemed "therapeutic", though this should not be confused with a therapeutic abortion performed because of a medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/252560-overview] Suzanne R Trupin, MD, Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Illinois College of Medicine-Champaign; CEO and Owner, Women's Health Practice; CEO and Owner, Hada Cosmetic Medicine and Midwest Surgical Center&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
In many societies, a woman could only have as many children as she and her husband could provide for. Since [[contraceptives]] first had their commercial boom in the 20th century, it was difficult for women to take preventative actions against getting pregnant. In the present day, it is still difficult for many women to obtain proper contraceptives because of the economic situation of themselves or their country. In cases where a woman is pregnant but could not provide for the child, it would often be considered necessary to abort the baby to save the other children from starvation. For example, a study was done in Tuscany, Italy in 1427 that showed that the number of children per family had a direct correlation to the “economic curve and survival conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Ginette. The Psychology of Abortion. Trans. Joanna Mott. Putnam: Spring Publications, inc., 1992. Print. pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the 21st century there are still areas of the world that are in this situation. The nomadic hunter/gatherer people of the [[Kalahari Desert]] in Africa, called the Bushmen, can’t have another child until their next oldest one is weaned from its mother’s breast milk, which can be up to the age of 3 or 4. If a woman does get pregnant she “must think of the child she has already and act quickly," before her love of her baby renders her incapable of killing it and forces her to “wait and watch both of her children die.”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Elizabeth Thomas. The Harmless People. New York: Vintage Books, 1989. Print. pp. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris said that “the universal desire among women to control births expresses today, as it always has, the knowledge that survival depends on the ability to give each child what it needs for its full development, whether it be the survival of a mother, a family, or a community.”&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Ginette. The Psychology of Abortion. Trans. Joanna Mott. Putnam: Spring Publications, inc., 1992. Print. pp. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Harper Ince''' (November 16, 1880 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1924) was an American [[silent film]] [[film producer|producer]], [[film director|director]], [[screenwriter]], and [[actor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33S7-81SG-QFN?mode=g&amp;i=2052&amp;wc=9FH5-929%3A928312301%2C928595301%3Fcc%3D1968530&amp;cc=1968530|title=US World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 Thomas Harper Ince|work=FamilySearch.org}}  Although in later years Ince would remove two years from his age, he wrote on his Draft Registration Card that he was born in 1880. His christening records also show a birth date of 1880. {{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F8MD-G78|title=Rhode Island Birth and Christenings, 1600-1914|work=FamilySearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ince was known as the "Father of the [[Western (genre)|Western]]" and was responsible for making over 800 films.&lt;ref name="The Movie"&gt;{{cite news  |title=Thomas H. Ince, Father of the Western |work=''The Movie'', pp. 2170-2172. |first1=Marc |last1=Wanamaker |date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revolutionized the motion picture industry by creating the first major Hollywood studio facility and invented [[movie production]] by introducing the "[[assembly line]]" system of [[filmmaking]]. He was the first mogul to build his own film studio dubbed "Inceville" in [[Palisades Highlands, Los Angeles, California|Palisades Highlands]]. Ince was also instrumental in developing the role of the producer in motion pictures. Two of his films, ''[[The Italian (1915 film)|The Italian]]'' (1915), for which he wrote the [[screenplay]], and ''[[Civilization (film)|Civilization]]'' (1916), which he directed, were selected for [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] by the [[National Film Registry]]. He later entered into a partnership with [[D.W. Griffith]] and [[Mack Sennett]] to form the [[Triangle Film Corporation|Triangle Motion Picture Company]], whose studios are the present-day site of [[Sony Pictures Studios|Sony Pictures]]. He then built a new studio about a mile from Triangle, which is now the site of [[Culver Studios]].&lt;ref name="Favorite"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6Dyu3RbHKcsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=The+Edris+yacht+and+Ince&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xgk3dIaXJZ&amp;sig=iC8UMVwDpDVMrO6Pyn8NuUfri0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nQN3VcrSBIOKyASch4DgBg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Edris%20yacht%20and%20Ince&amp;f=false/ |title=''Our Favorite Things'' p. 62-70 |last1=Cerra |first1=Julie Lugo |last2=Wanamaker |first2=Marc |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |date=14 March 2011 |website=Google books |access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculverstudios.com/|title=The Culver Studios|work=theculverstudios.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ince's untimely death at the height of his career, after he became severely ill aboard the private [[yacht]] of media [[tycoon]] [[William Randolph Hearst]], has caused much speculation, although the official cause of his death was heart failure.&lt;ref name="Taves"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taves |first1=Brian.|title=''Thomas Ince: Hollywood's Independent Producer'' |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Thomas_Ince.html?id=H1BRDjArx64C |accessdate=10 January 2016 |date=2012 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0813134239}} Taves' extensive biography contains a strong rebuttal to the much rumored murder of Thomas Ince; see pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
[[File:Incethomas.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas Ince (c. 1910)]]
Thomas Harper Ince was born on November 16, 1880 in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the middle of three sons and a daughter raised by English immigrants, John E. and Emma Ince.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/Person/View/46190 Emma Brennan Ince;(mother of Thomas) Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was born in [[Wigan]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]], in 1841, and was the youngest of nine boys who enlisted in the British Navy as a "[[powder monkey]]". He later disembarked at [[San Francisco]], and found work as a [[reporter]] and [[coal miner]]. Around 1887, when Ince was about seven, the family moved to [[Manhattan]] to pursue theater work. Ince's father worked as both an actor and musical agent and his mother, Ince himself, sister Bertha and brothers, [[John Ince (actor)|John]] and [[Ralph Ince|Ralph]] all worked as actors. Ince made his [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] debut at 15 in a small role of a revival 1893 play, ''Shore Acres'' by [[James A. Herne]].&lt;ref name="Flom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FRUhxhNTZngC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=thomas+ince+and+Silent+Film+Stars+on+the+Stages+of+Seattle:+A+History+of+Performances+by+Hollywood+Notables&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CGrw5PetnW&amp;sig=YgtBCr4WnbdEDZwcSDvRBImbh9U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QQp3VZyxLpWzyASt8oHAAw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20ince%20and%20Silent%20Film%20Stars%20on%20the%20Stages%20of%20Seattle%3A%20A%20History%20of%20Performances%20by%20Hollywood%20Notables&amp;f=false |title=''Silent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle: A History of Performances by Hollywood Notables''; p. 89-90 |last=Flom |first=Eric L. |author-link= |publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc |date=5 March 2009 |website= |access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with several stock companies as a child and was later an office boy for theatrical manager [[Daniel Frohman]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genordell.com/stores/lantern/dox/THInce-autobio1924.txt |title=''In The Movies - Yesterday and Today'' |last=Ince |first=Thomas H. |author-link= |publisher=''Los Angeles Record'' |date=13 Dec 1924 |website= |access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oscars.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.oscars.org/link/bio/1094|title=Special Collections - Margaret Herrick Library - Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later formed an unsuccessful [[Vaudeville]] company known as "Thomas H. Ince and His Comedians" in [[Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey]]. In 1907, Ince met actress [[Elinor Kershaw]] ("Nell") and they were married on October 19 of that year. They had three children.

Ince's directing career began in 1910 through a chance encounter in [[New York City]] with an employee from his old acting troupe, [[William S. Hart]]. Ince found his first film work as an actor for the [[Biograph Company]], directed by his future partner, [[D.W. Griffith]]. Griffith was impressed enough with Ince to hire him as a [[Production coordinator]] at Biograph. This led to more work coordinating productions at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Motion Pictures Co.]] (IMP).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That same year, a director at IMP was unable to complete work on a small feature film, so in moment of bravado, Ince suggested to IMP's owner Laemmle of hiring him as a full-time director to complete the film. Impressed with the young man, Laemmle sent him to [[Cuba]] to make one-reel shorts with his new stars, [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Owen Moore]], out of the reach of [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Motion Picture Patents Company]]-—the trust that was attempting to crush all independent production companies and corner the market on film production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/498|title=MoMA|work=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ince's output, however, was small. And, although he tackled many different subjects, he was strongly drawn to [[Western film|Westerns]] and [[American Civil War]] dramas.

Clashes between the trust and independent films became exacerbated, so Ince moved to California to escape these pressures. He hoped to achieve the effects accomplished with minimal facilities like Griffith, which he believed, could only be accomplished in [[Hollywood]]. After only a year with IMP, Ince quit. In September 1911, Ince walked into the offices of actor-financier [[Charles O. Baumann]] (1874-1931) who co-owned the [[New York Motion Picture Company]] (NYMP) with actor-writer Adam Kessel, Jr. (1866-1946). Ince had found out that NYMPC had recently established a West Coast studio named Bison Studios at 1719 Alessandro (now known as Glendale Blvd.) in [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale]] (present-day [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]]) to make westerns and he wanted to direct those pictures.&lt;ref name="Poverty"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=s0NoBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Early+Poverty+Row+Studios+and+thomas+ince&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WWfJUsnzmm&amp;sig=OZMMa7Pr7wi45Ly5XW8W3Y11XLY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xd3Vf7QOYj5yQTo2YO4Dw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Poverty%20Row%20Studios%20and%20thomas%20ince&amp;f=false |title=''Early Poverty Row Studios'' p. 19 |last1=Stephens |first1=E.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The offer came as a distinct shock, but I kept cool and concealed my excitement. I tried to convey the impression that he would have to raise the ante a trifle if he wanted me. That also worked, and I signed a contract for three months at $150 a week. Very soon after that, with Mrs. Ince, my cameraman, property man and [[Ethel Grandin]], my leading woman, I turned my face westward.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Together with his young wife and a small entourage, Ince moved to Bison Studios to begin work immediately. He was shocked, however, to discover that the studio was nothing more than a "tract of land graced only by a four-room bungalow and a barn."

===Inceville===
Ince's aspirations soon led him to leave the narrow confines of Edendale and find a location that would give him greater scope and variety. He settled upon a {{convert|460|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of land called ''Bison Ranch'' located at [[Sunset Blvd.]] and [[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], (the present-day location of the [[Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine]]) which he rented by the day.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; By 1912, he had earned enough money to purchase the ranch and was granted permission by NYMP to lease another {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} in the [[Palisades Highlands, Los Angeles, California|Palisades Highlands]] stretching {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} up Santa Ynez Canyon between [[Santa Monica]] and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] where [[Universal Studios]] was eventually established, which was owned by [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|The Miller Bros]] out of [[Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]]. And it was here Ince built his first movie studio.&lt;ref name="Poverty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movielocationsplus.com/INCE.HTM|title=Inceville|work=movielocationsplus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Inceville.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|"Inceville" Studios. Santa Ynez Canyon, Calif. (c. 1919)]]
The "Miller 101 Bison Ranch Studio", which the Millers dubbed "Inceville" (and was later re-christened "Triangle Ranch") was the first of its kind in that it featured silent stages, production offices, printing labs, a commissary large enough to serve lunch to hundreds of workers, dressing rooms, props houses, elaborate sets, and other necessities - all in one location. While the site was under construction, Ince also leased the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|101 Ranch and Wild West Show]] from the Miller Bros., bringing the whole troupe from Oklahoma out to California via train. The show consisted of 300 [[cowboy]]s and cowgirls; 600 horses, cattle and other livestock (including steers and [[bison]]) and a whole [[Sioux]] Indian tribe (200 of them in all) who set up their [[Tipi|teepees]] on the property. They were then renamed "The Bison-101 Ranch Co.", and specialized in making westerns released under the name World Famous Features.

When construction was completed, the streets were lined with many types of structures, from humble cottages to mansions, mimicking the style and architecture of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soares |first=Andre |url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/hollywood/thomas-ince-inceville/ |title=Inceville: Film Pioneer Thomas Ince's Studios |publisher=Altfg.com |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive outdoor western sets were built and used on the site for several years. According to Katherine La Hue in her book, ''Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains Meet the Sea'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ince invested $35,000 in building, stages and sets&amp;nbsp;... a bit of Switzerland, a [[Puritan]] settlement, a [[Japan]]ese village&amp;nbsp;... beyond the breakers, an ancient [[brigantine]] weighed anchor, cutlassed men swarming over the sides of the ship, while on the shore performing cowboys galloped about, twirling their lassos in pursuit of errant cattle&amp;nbsp;... The main herds were kept in the hills, where Ince also raised feed and garden produce. Supplies of every sort were needed to house and feed a veritable army of actors, directors and subordinates.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the cowboys, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and assorted workmen lived at "Inceville", the main actors came from [[Los Angeles]] and other communities as needed, taking the [[Pacific Electric Railway|red trolley cars]] to the [[Long Wharf (Santa Monica)|Long Wharf]] at [[Temescal Canyon, Los Angeles County|Temescal Canyon]], where [[buckboard]]s conveyed them to the set.

Ince lived in a house overlooking the vast studio, later the location of Marquez Knolls. Here he functioned as the central authority over multiple production units, changing the way films were made by organizing production methods into a disciplined system of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Ince -- Encyclopædia Britannica [www.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "Inceville" became a prototype for Hollywood film studios of the future, with a studio head (Ince), producers, directors, production managers, production staff, and writers all working together under one organization (the unit system) and under the supervision of a General Manager, [[Fred J. Balshofer]].

Before this, the [[Film director|director]] and [[Cinematographer|cameraman]] controlled the production of the picture, but Ince put the [[Film producer|producer]] in charge of the film from inception to final product. He defined the producer's role in both a creative and industrial sense. He was also one of the first to hire a separate [[screenwriter]], director, and [[Film editing|editor]] (instead of the director doing everything themselves). By 1913, the concept of the [[Production management|production manager]] had been created. With the aid of George Stout, an accountant for NYMP, Ince re-organized how films were outputted to bring discipline to the process. After this adjustment the studio's weekly output increased from one to two, and later three two-reel pictures per week, released under such names as "Kay-Bee" (Kessel-Baumann), "Domino" (comedy), and "Broncho" (western) productions. These were written, produced, cut, and assembled, with the finished product delivered within a week. By enabling more than one film to be made at a time, Ince decentralized the process of movie production to meet the increased demand from theaters. This was the dawning of the assembly-line system that all studios eventually adopted.

With this model, developed between 1913 and 1918, Ince gradually exercised even more control over the film production process as a director-general. In 1913 alone, he made over 150 two-reeler movies, mostly Westerns, thereby anchoring the popularity of the genre for decades. While many of Ince's films were praised in [[Europe]], many American critics did not share this high opinion. One such picture was ''[[The Battle of Gettysburg (1913 film)|The Battle of Gettysburg]]'' (1913) which was five reels long. The picture helped bring into vogue the idea of the feature-length film. Another important early movie for Ince was ''[[The Italian (1915 film)|The Italian]]'' (1915), which depicted [[immigrant]] life in [[Manhattan]]. Two of his most successful films were among his first, ''War on the Plains'' (1912) and ''[[Custer's Last Fight]]'' (1912), which featured many Indians who had actually been in the battle.

Even though he was the first producer-director and directed most of his early productions, by 1913 Ince eventually ceased full-time directing to concentrate on producing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/498 |title=The Return of Thomas H. Ince |publisher=MoMA |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring this responsibility to such proteges as [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] and his brother [[John Ford]], [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], [[William Desmond Taylor]], [[Reginald Barker]], [[Fred Niblo]], [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]] and [[Frank Borzage]].&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ha-Ja/Ince-Thomas-H.html|title=Thomas H. Ince - Writer - Films as Director (selected list):, Films as Producer:, Films as Actor:, Publications|work=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was the preeminent aspect of Ince’s pictures. Films such as The Italian, The Gangsters and the Girl (1914), and [[The Clodhopper]] (1917) are excellent examples of the dramatic structure that resulted from his masterful editing. Film preservationist [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]] said of Ince in ''The American Film Heritage'':

{{quote|text=''(He) did everything. He was so proficient at every aspect of film making that even films he didn't direct have the Ince-print, because he exercised such tight control over his scripts and edited so mercilessly that he could delegate direction to others and still get what he wanted. Much of what Ince contributed to the American film took place off the screen; he established production conventions that persisted forbears, and, though his career in films lasted only fourteen years, his influence far outlived him.''}}

Ince also discovered many talents, including his old actor friend, William S. Hart, who made some of the best early westerns, beginning in 1914. Later, a rift developed between the two over sharing of profits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backlotfilmfestival.com/BioInce.htm The Backlot Film Festival - History - Thomas Ince Biography&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210010243/http://www.backlotfilmfestival.com/BioInce.htm |date=2008-02-10 }} at www.backlotfilmfestival.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, on January 16, 1916, a few days after the opening of his first [[Culver City]] studio, a fire broke out at "Inceville", the first of many that eventually destroyed all of the buildings.
Ince later gave up on the studio and sold it to Hart, who renamed it "Hartville." Three years later, Hart sold the lot to [[Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation]], which continued filming there until 1922. La Hue writes that "the place was virtually a ghost town when the last remnants of "Inceville" were burned on July 4, 1922, leaving only a "weatherworn old [[church (building)|church]], which stood sentinel over the charred ruins."

===Ince-Triangle Studios===
[[File:MGM Studios (00071567).jpg|thumb|Photograph of original colonnade of Triangle Film Corporation|Ince-Triangle Studios (c. 1916)]]
By 1915, Ince was considered one of the best-known producer-directors. Around this time, [[real estate]] mogul [[Harry Culver]] noticed Ince shooting a western in [[Ballona Creek]]. Impressed with his talents, Culver convinced Ince to move from Inceville and re-locate to what was to become [[Culver City]]. Taking Culver's advice, Ince left NYMP and on July 19 partnered with [[D.W. Griffith]] and [[Mack Sennett]] to form [[Triangle Film Corporation|The Triangle Motion Picture Company]] based on their prestige as producers. Triangle (so named because from an aerial point of view the property had a triangular shape) was built at 10202 W. [[Washington Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Washington Boulevard]] (the present-day site of [[Sony Pictures Studios]]), which Ince insisted be named "Ince-Triangle Studios". Thus, the first Culver City movie studio took shape in the form of a Greek colonnade – the impressive entrance of which still stands today and is an [[California Historical Landmark|historical landmark]].
 [[File:The Italian (1915).webm|thumb|thumbtime=8|left|[[The Italian (1915 film)|''The Italian'' (1915)]] directed by [[Reginald Barker]]; written &amp; produced by Thomas Ince.]]
With Ince as its [[vice-president]], Triangle announced that it would focus on feature-length "epic and quality dramas". Ince and his partners would charge more money for their prestige pictures based on their reputations as producers. The company was funded by Harry and Roy Aitken, two brothers from the farmlands of [[Wisconsin]] who also pioneered the studio system of Hollywood's Golden Age. Harry had been Griffith's partner at [[Reliance-Majestic Studios]], but had been fired by the [[Mutual Film|Mutual Film Corporation]] as a result the aftermath of Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/dwgriffith.htm |title=D. W. Griffith: Hollywood Independent |publisher=Cobbles.com |date=1917-06-26 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a box-office success, the film led to [[Race riot|riots]] in major northern cities due to its controversial content.

Triangle was one of the first vertically integrated film companies. By combining production, distribution, and theater operations under one roof, the partners created the most dynamic studio in Hollywood. They attracted directors and stars of the day, including Pickford, [[Lillian Gish]], [[Fatty Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] They also produced some of the most enduring films of the silent era, including the [[Keystone Kops]] comedy franchise. Originally a distributor of films produced by NYMP, the Reliance Motion Picture Corp., [[Majestic Pictures|Majestic Motion Picture Co.]], and [[Keystone Studios|The Keystone Film Co.]], by November 1916 the company's distribution was handled by Triangle Distributing Corporation.

Though Ince had many credits as a director at Triangle, he only supervised the production of most pictures, working primarily as executive producer. One of his important pictures as a director was ''[[Civilization (film)|Civilization]]'' (1916), an epic plea for peace and American neutrality set in a mythical country and dedicated to the mothers of those who died in [[World War I]]. The film competed with Griffith's famous epic, ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' and beat it at the [[box office]]. ''[[Civilization (film)|Civilization]]'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Ince added a few stages and an administration building to Triangle Studios before selling his shares to Griffith and Sennett in 1918. Three years later, the studios were acquired by [[Goldwyn Pictures]], and in 1924 the facility became [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios. Such classics as [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]], [[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]], and [[Citizen Kane]] were later filmed on that same lot.

===Thomas H. Ince Studios===
[[File:Thomas Ince 1920.jpg|thumb|Ince in 1920]]
For a while, Ince joined competitor [[Adolph Zukor]] to form Paramount-Artcraft Pictures (later [[Paramount Pictures]]). However, he yearned to go back to running his own studio. On July 19, 1918, following [[Samuel Goldwyn]]’s acquisition of the Triangle lot, he purchased a 14-acre (57,000 m2) property at 9336 West Washington Blvd. on an option basis from Culver along with a $132,000 loan. Thus was formed "Thomas H. Ince Studios", which operated from 1919 to 1924. Known later as the "40 Acres," it was to be another Culver City historic landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculverstudios.com/history/|title=History - The Culver Studios|work=theculverstudios.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When Ince conceived the idea of building his own studio, he was determined to have it different from the others. Among plans submitted to him by architects [[Meyer &amp; Holler]], was one that suggested the whole front administrative building made a replica of [[George Washington]]'s home at [[Mount Vernon]]. The resulting administration building, known as "The Mansion", was the first building on the lot. 
[[File:Mansion-front.jpg|thumb|"The Mansion" at Culver Studios today]]
In back of the impressive office building were approximately 40 buildings, most of which were designed in the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] style. A small group of bungalows, built for various movie stars and designed in styles popular in the 1920s and '30s, were constructed on the west side of the lot. By 1920, two glass stages, a [[hospital]], fire department, reservoir/swimming pool, and the back lot were completed. That same year, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] took a tour of the studios as did the [[Albert I of Belgium|King]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Queen of Belgium]], along with their son, [[Leopold III of Belgium|Prince Leopold]], among much pomp and ceremony.

Ince had two or three companies working continuously on the lot at any given time. According to film historian Marc Wanamaker, Ince worked with a team of eight directors but "he retained creative control of his films, developing the shooting scripts" and personally assembling each of his films.&lt;ref name="The Movie" /&gt; By now, Ince had drifted away from westerns in favor of social dramas and he made a few significant films including ''[[Anna Christie]]'' (1923), based on the play by [[Eugene O'Neill]], and ''[[Human Wreckage]]'' (1923), which was an early anti-drug film starring [[Dorothy Davenport]] (widow of addicted star [[Wallace Reid]]).

Although Ince found distribution for his films through Paramount and MGM, he was no longer as powerful as he once had been and tried to regain his status in Hollywood. In 1919, with several other independent entrepreneurs (notably his old partner at Triangle, Mack Sennett, [[Marshall Neilan]], [[Allan Dwan]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]]) he co-founded the independent releasing company, Associated Producers, Inc., to distribute their films. However, Associated Producers merged with [[First National Pictures|First National]] in 1922.

Though Ince still made some significant motion pictures, the studio system was starting to take over Hollywood. With little room for an independent producer and despite his attempts, Ince could not regain the powerful standing he once held in the industry. He and other independent producers tried to form the Cinematic Finance Corporation in 1921, which made loans to producers who already had been successful, but only accomplished its goal in a limited sense.

In 1925, a year after Ince’s death, the studio was sold (with [[Pathé|Pathé America]]) to Ince's friend [[Cecil B. Demille]]. Besides DeMille, among those who had offices on the lot were producer [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Selznick International Pictures]]. About four years later, DeMille sold his interest to Pathé and the studio became known as the Pathé Culver City Studio. By 1928 after mergers, the studio became [[RKO]]/Pathé. By 1957, a number of other studios followed: [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Culver]], Culver City Studios, Laird International Studios, etc.

In 1991, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased the property as the home for its [[television]] endeavors, renaming it [[Culver Studios]], and eventually selling it in 2004 to a group of investors. In his honor, the street intersecting the studios was renamed Ince Blvd. The studio is still home to [[Brooksfilms]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericowenmoss.com/index.php?/projects/project/ince_theater/ |title=Home |publisher=Ericowenmoss.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder or natural death debate ==
[[File:Oneida (SP-432) edit.jpg|thumb|left|Hearst's yacht, the [[USS Oneida (SP-432)|''Oneida'']] ]]
Ince's untimely death at the age of 44 has been the subject of much speculation and scandal, with rumors of murder, mystery, and jealousy. The official cause of his death was [[heart failure]], and while witnesses (including his widow Nell) corroborate that his medical condition brought about his death, rumors and sensationalism continued decades later, fueled with the 2001 release of the movie ''[[The Cat's Meow]]''.

Prior to the fatal event, Ince and [[William Randolph Hearst]] had been negotiating a deal whereby Hearst would use Ince's studio for filming of Hearst's [[Cosmopolitan Productions]]. Hearst visited Ince at his home, his "Dias Dorados" estate at 1051 [[Benedict Canyon]] Drive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halfpuddinghalfsauce.blogspot.ca/2012/11/a-country-house-in-early-californian.html|title=Half Pudding Half Sauce: "Dias Dorados" - A Country House in Early Californian Style|work=halfpuddinghalfsauce.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Saturday November 15 and invited him for a weekend cruise on his yacht to honor Ince's birthday and to work out details of the Ince/Cosmopolitan deal.&lt;ref name="Taves" /&gt; The next day, Ince boarded Hearst's lavish {{convert|280|ft|m|adj=on}} yacht, the ''[[USS Oneida (SP-432)|Oneida]]'', and set sail from [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[California]] heading for [[San Diego]]. Among Hearst's guests that weekend were his mistress, [[Marion Davies]], silent film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], author [[Elinor Glyn]], film actresses [[Aileen Pringle]], [[Jacqueline Logan]], [[Seena Owen]], [[Margaret Livingston]], and [[Julanne Johnston]]; actor, [[choreographer]] and [[ballet dancer]] [[Theodore Kosloff]], and [[Daniel Carson Goodman|Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman]], Hearst's film production manager. Ince, the guest in honor of his 44th birthday, was late since he was finalizing the production deal with Hearst and the yacht left without him. 


According to Ince's widow Nell, Ince took a train to [[San Diego]], where he joined the guests the next morning. At dinner that Sunday night, the group celebrated his birthday but later Ince suffered an acute bout of [[indigestion]] due to his consumption of salted almonds and champagne, both forbidden as he had [[peptic ulcers]]. Accompanied by Dr. Goodman, a licensed though non-practicing physician, Ince traveled by train to [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]], where he was taken to a hotel and given medical treatment by a second doctor and a nurse. Ince then summoned his wife and Dr. Ida Cowan Glasgow (Ince's personal physician) to Del Mar with Ince's eldest son William accompanying them. The group traveled by train to his Los Angeles home where Ince died. Nell said that Ince had been treated for chest pains caused by [[Angina pectoris|angina]], but years later his son William became a physician and said that his father's illness resembled [[thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="St. Johns"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Honeycomb |first1=Adela  |last1=Rogers St. Johns |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., pp.185-193.  Rogers St. Johns was a journalist, screenwriter, and personal friend of Elinor and Thomas Ince. |place=Garden City, NY |date=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Glasgow signed the [[death certificate]] citing heart failure as the cause of death. The front page of the Wednesday morning ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' supposedly sensationalized the story: '"Movie Producer Shot on Hearst Yacht!",&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times''. November 16, 1924 (morning edition. No record is available of this article on November 16.&lt;/ref&gt; but the headlines vanished in the evening edition. On November 20, the ''Los Angeles Times'' published Ince's obituary citing heart disease as the cause of death along with his failing health from an automobile accident two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas H. Ince, Pioneer of Films, Called By Death: Heart Disease Proves Fatal to Screen Magnate After Sudden Attack at Yacht Party". ''Los Angeles Times''.  November 20, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the San Diego District Attorney announced that Ince's death was caused by heart failure and no further investigation was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;"Ince's Death Natural, Prosecutor Asserts". ''The New York Times''. December 11, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ince and his wife were practicing [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] who preferred [[cremation]] and had arranged for it long before Ince's death.&lt;ref name="St. Johns" /&gt;  While rumors prevailed that Ince's widow suddenly departed the country after her husband's death, she actually left for Europe about seven months later in July 1925.&lt;ref name="Taves" /&gt;

But several conflicting stories circulated about the incident, often revolving around a claim that Hearst shot Ince in the head mistaking him for Chaplin. Chaplin's valet, Toraichi Kono, claimed to have seen Ince when he came ashore via stretcher in San Diego. Kono told his wife that Ince's head was "bleeding from a bullet wound." The story quickly spread among Japanese domestic workers throughout [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com |title=Los Angeles News and Events |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But during Ince's funeral, the ''Los Angeles Times'' noted that his casket would remain open for one hour "to afford friends and studio employees to pass for one last glimpse of the man they loved and respected", with no witnesses ever mentioning a bullet wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ince Will Lie in State One Hour |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 21, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Film World Mourns Ince |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 22, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas H Ince - Standing 1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ince (c. 1922)]]

[[File:HearstAbout1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Randolph Hearst]] (c.1910)]]
Movie columnist [[Louella Parsons]]' name also figured into the Ince scandal, with some speculating that she had been aboard the ''Oneida'' that fatal day.  When the ''Oneida'' sailed, Parsons was a New York movie columnist for one of Hearst's papers. Supposedly, after the Ince affair, Hearst gave her a lifetime contract and expanded her [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]. However, other sources show that Parsons did not gain her position with Hearst as part of "hush money" but had been the motion picture editor of the Hearst-owned ''New York American'' in December 1923 and her contract was signed a year before Ince's death.&lt;ref name="Taves" /&gt;  Another story circulated that Hearst provided Nell Ince with a [[trust fund]] just before she left for [[Europe]] and that Hearst paid off Ince's mortgage on his [[Château Élysée]] apartment building in Hollywood. But Nell was left a very wealthy woman and the [[Château Élysée]] was an apartment she had already owned and had built on the grounds where the Ince home once stood.&lt;ref name="St. Johns" /&gt;

Years later, Hearst spoke to a journalist about the rumor that he had murdered Tom Ince. "Not only am I innocent of this Ince murder", he said. "So is everybody else".  Nell Ince herself was increasingly frustrated over the Hearst rumors surrounding her husband's death and remarked: "Do you think I would have done nothing if I even suspected that my husband had been victim of foul play on anyone's part?"&lt;ref name="St. Johns" /&gt;

But the myth of Ince's death overshadowed his reputation as a pioneering filmmaker and his role in the growth of the film industry. His studio was sold soon after he died. His final film, ''Enticement'', a romance set in the [[French Alps]], was released posthumously in 1925.

==In popular culture==
''Murder at San Simeon'' ([[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]), a 1996 novel by [[Patty Hearst|Patricia Hearst]] (William Randolph's granddaughter) and Cordelia Frances Biddle, is a mystery based on the 1924 death of producer Thomas Ince aboard the yacht of William Randolph Hearst. This fictitious version presents Chaplin and Davies as lovers and Hearst as the jealous old man unwilling to share his mistress.

''[[RKO 281]]'' is a 1999 film about the making of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. The movie includes a scene depicting screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz telling director Orson Welles his account of the incident.

''[[The Cat's Meow]]'', the 2001 film directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]], is another fictitious version of Ince's death. Bogdanovich claims that he heard the story from director [[Orson Welles]], who said he heard it from screenwriter [[Charles Lederer]] (Marion Davies's nephew).&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence, [http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=213 "Peter Bogdanovich on Completing Orson Welles Long Awaited ''The Other Side of the Wind for Showtime''"] (March 9, 2008 interview). ''Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource'', March 14, 2008. Retrieved 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In Bogdanovich's film, Ince is portrayed by [[Cary Elwes]]. The movie was adapted by [[Steven Peros]] from his own play, which premiered in Los Angeles in 1997.

Ince's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] is located at 6727 Hollywood Blvd. in [[Los Angeles]].

'''Vostok 3''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восток-3'''}}, ''[[Orient]] 3'' or ''East 3'') was a spaceflight of the [[Soviet space program]] intended to determine the ability of the human body to function in conditions of weightlessness and test the endurance of the [[Vostok 3KA]] spacecraft over longer flights. Cosmonaut [[Andriyan Nikolayev]] orbited the Earth 64 times over nearly four days in space, August 11–15, 1962, a feat which would not be matched by [[NASA]] until the [[Gemini program]] (1965–1966).&lt;ref name="NASA_desc" /&gt;

This condition was unknown at the time, leading Soviet scientists to devote efforts to study the [[effect of spaceflight on the human body]].&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2"&gt;{{cite journal |date=6 September 1962|title="Group Space Flight" Described – Part 2 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |issue=2791 |volume=82 |pages=389–391 |publisher=Iliffe Transport Publications |location=London |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201887.html |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Soviet rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] pushed for a three-day spaceflight as a follow-up to Vostok 2. Such a mission was opposed by the head of cosmonaut training [[Nikolai Kamanin]] and the cosmonauts themselves, who were concerned about unforeseen health effects that might result from extending space flights too quickly. Plans for a three-day mission only went forward when the approval of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was obtained; in the end, Vostok 3 would last nearly four days.&lt;ref name="astronautix_vk3" /&gt;

One objective of the missions of Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 was the study of how the reactions of Nikolayev and [[Pavel Popovich]] might differ during a series of tests under similar circumstances. The close orbits and near-rendezvous of the two spacecraft would keep the number of variables to a minimum, allowing the measurement of individual differences in adaptation to spaceflight. The [[Vostok spacecraft]] were upgraded to increase the volume of information collected about the flight conditions and the crew.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt;

Training was expanded to condition cosmonauts against space sickness and select those candidate spacefarers deemed least susceptible.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt; Informed by Titov's experience in Vostok 2, Nikolayev and Popovich thoroughly rehearsed their spacecraft maneuvers and other planned activities in a simulator.&lt;ref name="gsf_described" /&gt;

The Vostok 3/4 flights were originally scheduled for November 1961, which would have had the propaganda value of the Soviet program having flown four men in space along with a dual mission in the same calendar year when the United States had yet to orbit a single man, but Korolev's plans were frustrated by the [[Zenit (satellite)|Zenit]] photo reconnaissance satellite program which needed to use the R-7 pads at Baikonur. He then suggested launching at the end of December or the start of January, but Chief of Cosmonaut Training [[Nikolai Kamanin]] and the State Planning Commission opposed launching in the wintertime due to harsh weather conditions and instead suggested waiting until March.

The first Zenit launch took place on 11 December, but the Blok E stage malfunctioned and the satellite was destroyed. Since this was the same model of booster used by the Vostok (8K72K), it was a concern for the program. While engineers attempted to resolve the problem, Vostok 3/4's mission was pushed back a month to April. However, further delays happened when the second Zenit satellite (Kosmos 4) experienced problems with its orientation system, necessitating another test and further delays.

On 1 June, an attempted launch of a [[Zenit (satellite)|Zenit]] photo reconnaissance satellite ended with the booster crashing near the pad. One of the strap-ons had also fallen back onto LC-1 and burned, resulting in extensive damage that took over a month to repair.&lt;ref name="astronautix_vk3" /&gt; By mid-July, the pad had been restored to use, but another delay occurred when the United States carried out a [[high altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] on 9 July known as [[Starfish Prime]]. The radiation from the test had unexpected consequences in that it released high levels of radiation into the upper atmosphere and space, knocking out several satellites and making any manned space launch unsafe for at least a month. By the second week of August, radiation levels had diminished enough that the Vostok 3/4 mission could go ahead.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt;

The Zenit launch accident had occurred in a new, uprated version of the R-7 launch vehicle (the 8A92) while the Vostok used the older 8K72K booster, so it was not a direct concern for the program. However, just to be cautious, it was decided to fly an additional Zenit satellite to verify the reliability of the R-7. In addition, since the Zenit satellite was essentially a modified Vostok, the flight doubled as an engineering test of certain Vostok components. This was done successfully on July 28, after which preparations at LC-1 began for Vostok 3.

Vostok 3 lifted off from [[Gagarin's Start]] at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at on August 11, 1962 at 08:24 UTC atop a [[Vostok 8K72K]] rocket.&lt;ref name="NASA_traj" /&gt; During his first day in orbit, Nikolayev unstrapped himself from his seat and became the first spacefarer to float freely in conditions of [[microgravity]] in space.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt;

Nikolayev's orbital companion Popovich was launched the next day aboard [[Vostok 4]]. The former adjusted his spacecraft's orientation to watch the launch, but failed to see anything despite reporting considerable details on the ground as he had passed over [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]].  Data on the two spacecraft's orbital parameters that were released periodically by Soviet news agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] seemed to indicate a change in Vostok 3's orbital trajectory within ten hours of Vostok 4's launch, leading to speculation that the former spacecraft modified its orbit to bring it closer to that of the latter.&lt;ref name="gsf_completed"&gt;{{cite journal |date=23 August 1962|title="Group Space Flight" Completed |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |issue=2789 |volume=82 |pages=288–289 |publisher=Iliffe Transport Publications |location=London |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201546.html |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vostok spacecraft is not believed to have had the ability to modify its orbit.&lt;ref name="astronautix_vk3" /&gt; Plans were for the spacecraft to approach to {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, but the closest distance achieved was  {{convert|6.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  At the start of Vostok 3's thirty-third orbit, this distance had diverged to {{convert|850|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and to {{convert|2850|km|mi|abbr=on}} at the start of the 64th.&lt;ref name=Gatland /&gt;

Nikolayev and Popovich made contact with one another via [[shortwave radio]] soon after their spacecraft approached one another; they would maintain regular ship-to-ship communications over the course of their mission in addition to their contact with the ground. Nikolayev reported sighting the Vostok 4 capsule after it entered orbit near him.&lt;ref name="gsf_described" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt;

The mission led Western observers to speculate that the Soviets must already have spacecraft capable of in-orbit maneuvering. Official press releases naturally made no mention that the Vostok spacecraft lacked this ability or that the two Vostoks were able to attain such close approach due to their extremely precise launches.

Both Nikolayev and Popovich spent time out of their seats each day, conducting a series of tests to determine their ability to maneuver and work in conditions of weightlessness.  Each test was said to last "about one hour."  The physical and mental state of the cosmonauts were monitored: biometric sensors relayed the cosmonauts' vital statistics to the ground; the cosmonauts' behavior and coordination was observed via a cabin-mounted video camera; and the cosmonauts' ability to perform various operations in coordination with ground controllers was considered.  The cosmonauts' speech was monitored both by controllers on the ground and one another.  The results of the tests were deemed positive, evidence of the ability of humans to function and work over longer periods in microgravity.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt; Nikolayev also spoke with Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] over the radio, but interference was so bad that he couldn't hear most of the conversation.

Attention was paid to the cosmonauts' ability to sleep, and their vital signs were monitored during their sleep periods.  Nikolayev reported that he slept well, but always woke after only six hours of his scheduled eight-hour sleep period, feeling "refreshed".&lt;ref name="gsf_described" /&gt;

Nikolayev fired his [[retrorocket]] pack and returned to Earth on August 15, 1962, landing at 06:52 UTC at {{coord|42|2|N|75|45|E}}, near [[Karaganda]].&lt;ref name="NASA_traj" /&gt; As with Titov on Vostok 2—but unlike Gagarin on [[Vostok 1]]—Nikolayev would admit to reporters that he ejected and parachuted to earth separately from his spacecraft.&lt;ref name="gsf_described_p2" /&gt;

'''''Your Neighbor's Son: The Making of a Torturer''''' ({{lang-da|'''Din nabos søn'''}} or {{lang|da|'''Din nabos soen'''}}) is a [[documentary film|documentary]] or [[docudrama]] directed by [[Jørgen Flindt Pedersen]] and [[Erik Stephensen]] in two versions, 1976 and 1981. The film documents the conversion of young  [[Greek Military Police]] (ESA) recruits into [[torture]]rs and touches on the subject of the power of the institution to compel otherwise [[morality|moral]] human beings to torture. The documentary examines the processes and methods of the [[military junta]] that ruled [[Greece]] from [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|1967 to 1974]].

==Plot==
The documentary dramatizes the recruiting and training of a number of young men into the Greek police force during the military junta rule. A number of otherwise decent young men are selected based on a number of traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters: illiterate, [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], young and male, drawing comparisons to the [[Cambodia]]n torturers at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]], many of whom were under 19 years old.&lt;ref name=NYT-review/&gt;

The film also interviews [[Michalis Petrou]], a conscript who served in the Military Police and was trained to become one of the most notorious torturers of the EAT-ESA. Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees.

During the dramatic recreation of the training camps, the directors draw parallels to modern military [[recruit training]]s and the methods used in the training of soldiers.

==Response==
''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] noted that while the film was technically flawed it was at the same time "memorable and unnerving" in its depiction of both the victims of the torture as well as the ordeals of the torturers themselves, and claimed "it is impossible to regard its torturers or its victims without realizing that the view may be a view into a mirror."&lt;ref name=NYT-review&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Lawrence Van Gelder]]|title= Din nabos soen (1981)|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/157325/Din-nabos-soen/overview|publisher=The NY Times|date=August 29, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
