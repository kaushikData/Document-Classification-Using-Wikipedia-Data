      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14981">The '''Supervisory Capital Assessment Program''', publicly described as the '''bank stress tests''' (even though a number of the companies that were subject to them were not banks), was an assessment of [[Capital requirement|capital]] conducted by the [[Federal Reserve System]] and [[Office of Thrift Supervision|thrift supervisors]] to determine if the [[Banking in the United States|largest U.S. financial organizations]] had sufficient capital buffers to withstand the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] and the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial market turmoil]]. The test used two [[macroeconomic]] scenarios, one based on [[Baseline (configuration management)|baseline conditions]] and the other with more pessimistic expectations, to plot a '[[What-if analysis|What If?]]' exploration into the banking situation in the rest of 2009 and into 2010.&lt;ref name=frb&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20090424a1.pdf The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation]. [[Federal Reserve System|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]. Published April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital levels at 19 institutions were assessed based on their [[Tier 1 capital|Tier 1 common capital]], although it was originally thought that regulators would use [[tangible common equity]] as the yardstick.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest:Stress Test|Bank Stress Tests]], Wikinvest&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the tests were released on May 7, 2009, at 5pm EST.

Before the tests were completed, the central problems facing the [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] were 1) whether the tests would increase or decrease confidence in any companies that did badly on their tests and 2) whether or not the $350 billion in bailout funds that remained could cover the needed funding after the tests.&lt;ref name=entail&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/25/eveningnews/main4829645.shtml What Does A Bank "Stress Test" Entail?] By Wyatt Andrews. [[CBS News]]. Published Feb. 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and purpose== 
The exercise was limited to bank holding companies (national banks and companies which own banks) with assets greater than $100 billion. The 19 banking organizations included in the exercise comprised the core of the US banking system, representing roughly two‐thirds of aggregate U.S. [[bank holding company]] assets.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/02/25/bank-stress-test-faq/ Bank Stress Test FAQ]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Published Feb. 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The supervisors conducted the capital assessments on an interagency basis to ensure that they were carried out in a timely and consistent manner.  Each participating financial institution was instructed to analyze potential firm‐wide losses, including in its loan and securities portfolios, as well as from any off‐balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities/exposures, under two defined economic scenarios over a two-year [[time horizon]] (2009 – 2010).  In addition, firms with trading assets of $50 billion or more were asked to estimate potential trading‐related losses under the same scenarios.

Participating financial institutions also forecasted internal resources available to absorb losses, including pre‐provision [[Net profit|net revenue]] and the allowance for loan losses.  As part of the supervisory process, the supervisors met with [[senior management]] at each financial institution to review and discuss the institution’s loss and revenue forecasts.  Based on those discussions, the supervisors assessed institution‐specific potential losses and estimated resources to absorb those losses under the baseline and more adverse case, and determined whether the institution had a sufficient capital buffer necessary to ensure it had the amount and quality of capital necessary to perform its vital role in the economy.

==Macroeconomic scenarios and assumptions==
The capital assessment covered two economic scenarios:  a baseline scenario and a more adverse scenario.

===Baseline scenario===
For implementation of the supervisory capital assessment program, the baseline assumptions for real [[Economic growth|GDP growth]] and the [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] for 2009 and 2010 were assumed to be equal to the average of the projections published by Consensus Forecasts, the [[Blue Chip Economic Indicators]] survey, and the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] in February  2009.  This baseline was intended to represent a consensus view about the depth and duration of the recession. Given the current uncertain environment, there is a risk that the economy could turn out to be appreciably weaker than expected in the baseline outlook.

The assumptions for the baseline economic outlook are consistent with the [[Real estate pricing|house price]] path implied by futures prices for the [[Case‐Shiller]] 10‐City Composite index and the average response to a special question on house prices in the latest Blue Chip survey.

===More adverse scenario===
To aid financial institutions in their ongoing [[risk management]] practices, the supervisors have also put together an alternative “more adverse” scenario.  By design, the path of the US economy in this alternative more adverse scenario reflects a deeper and longer recession than in the baseline.  The consensus expectation is that economic activity is likely to be better than shown in the more adverse alternative; nonetheless, an outcome such as the alternative cannot be ruled out. The “more adverse” scenario was constructed from the historical track record of private forecasters as well as their current assessments of uncertainty. In particular, based on the [[Historicity|historical accuracy]] of Blue Chip forecasts made since the late 1970s, the likelihood that the average unemployment rate in 2010 could be at least as high as in the alternative more adverse scenario is roughly 10 percent.  In addition, the [[Bayesian probability|subjective probability]] assessments provided by participants in the January Consensus Forecasts survey and the February Survey of Professional Forecasters imply a roughly 15 percent chance that [[Gross domestic product|real GDP]] growth could be as least as low, and unemployment at least as high, as assumed in the more adverse scenario.

For the more adverse scenario, house prices are assumed to be about 10 percent lower at the end of 2010 relative to their level in the baseline scenario.  Based on the year‐to‐year variability in house prices since 1900, and controlling for macroeconomic factors, there is roughly a 10 percent probability that house prices will be 10 percent lower than in the baseline by 2010.

==Results and consequences==
The capital assessment is intended to capture all aspects of a financial institution’s business that would be impacted under the baseline and more adverse scenarios.   
 
Supervisors will carefully evaluate the forecasts submitted by each financial institution to ensure they are appropriate, consistent with the firm’s underlying portfolio performance and reflective of each entity’s particular business activities and risk profile.  The assessment of the firm’s capital and the size of any potential needed additions to capital will be determined by the supervisors.  
 
The assessment of [[Capital requirement|capital adequacy]] considers many factors including: the inherent risks of the institution’s exposures and business activities, the quality of its [[balance sheet]] assets and its [[off-balance-sheet]] commitments, the firm’s earning projections, expectations regarding economic conditions and the composition and quality of its capital.
  
Specific factors supervisors consider include: uncertainty about the potential impact on earnings and capital from current and prospective economic conditions;  asset quality and concentrations of credit exposures;  the potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values;  off‐balance sheet and [[Contingent Liabilities|contingent liabilities]] (e.g., implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments); the composition, level and quality of capital;  the ability of the institution to raise additional [[common stock]] and other forms of capital in the market;  and other risks that are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations.
     
Under current rules for [[Bank holding company|bank holding companies]], supervisors expect bank holding companies to hold capital above minimum regulatory capital levels, commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.  That amount of capital held in excess of minimum capital requirements should be commensurate with their firm‐specific risk profiles, and account for all material risks.  The assessment of capital under the two macroeconomic scenarios being used in the capital assessment program will permit supervisors to ascertain whether the buffer over the regulatory capital minimum is appropriate under more severe but plausible scenarios.  
 
An institution that requires additional capital will enter into a commitment to issue a CAP convertible preferred security to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] in an amount sufficient to meet the capital requirement determined through the supervisory assessment.  Each institution will be permitted up to six months to raise private capital in public markets to meet this requirement and would be able to cancel the capital commitment without penalty.  The CAP convertible preferred securities will be converted into common equity shares on an as‐needed basis. Financial institutions that issued preferred capital under Treasury’s existing [[Capital Purchase Program]] (TARP 1) will have the option of redeeming those securities and replacing them with the new CAP convertible preferred securities. 
 
The capital assessment is part of the supervisory process and thus subject to the same framework used for bank examinations or bank holding company inspections.  There will be ample opportunity for discussions between the financial institutions and supervisory agencies regarding the loss estimates and earnings forecasts during the capital assessment process.

==Banks tested==
The nineteen bank holding companies being stress-tested are as follows:

|}

The capital needs found by the test are based on the adverse scenario for the recession. All of these bank holding companies currently exceed the legally mandated capital requirements. However, the government will try by extra-legal means to compel those who are found to need more to obtain it.

'''Antimilitarism''' (also spelt '''anti-militarism''') is a doctrine that opposes war, relying heavily on a critical theory of [[imperialism]] and was an explicit goal of the [[First International|First]] and [[Second International]]. Whereas [[pacifism]] is the doctrine that disputes (especially between countries) should be settled without recourse to violence, Paul B. Miller defines anti-militarism as ''"ideology and activities...aimed at reducing the civil power of the military and ultimately, preventing international war"''.&lt;ref&gt;''From Revolutionaries to Citizens : Antimilitarism in France, 1870–1914'' by Paul B. Miller. Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8223-2757-0}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cynthia Cockburn]] defines an anti-militarist movement as one opposed to "[[Military dictatorship|military rule]], high military expenditure or the imposition of foreign bases in their country".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Cockburn, ''Antimilitarism: Political and Gender Dynamics of Peace Movements''. London, Palgrave Macmillan. 2012. {{ISBN|0230359752}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Ceadel points out that anti-militarism is sometimes equated with [[pacificism]]—general opposition to war or violence, except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of peace.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;Martin Ceadel, 'Thinking about peace and war''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0192192000}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction between antimilitarism and pacifism ==
[[Pacifism]] is the belief that disputes between nations can and should be settled peacefully. It is the opposition to war and the use of violence as a means of settling disputes. It can include the refusal to participate in military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = pacifism|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pacifism|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimilitarism does not reject war in all circumstances, but rejects the [[Militarism|belief or desire to maintain a large and strong military organization in aggressive preparedness for war]].&lt;ref&gt;"Antimilitarism is not pacifism or the total rejection of war". Lisa M. Mundy, ''American militarism and anti-militarism in popular media, 1945–1970''. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2012. {{ISBN|9780786466504}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = militarism|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/militarism|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms on violence==
[[File:Detail of the Piano Score of Oscar Straus' The Chocolate Soldier.jpg|thumb|Cover of the Piano Score for the [[light opera]] ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'', based on [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' – both of which make fun of armies and militarist virtues and present positively a deserter who runs away  from the battlefield and who carries chocolate instead of ammunition.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]] advocated the use of violence as a form of [[direct action]], calling it "revolutionary violence", which he opposed in ''Reflections on Violence'' (1908) to the violence inherent in [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reflections of Violence, by Georges Sorel – History in Review|url = http://www.historyinreview.org/gsorel.html|website = www.historyinreview.org|access-date = 2016-02-16|first = Rochelle|last = Caviness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities are seen between Sorel and the [[International Workingmen's Association|International Workingmens' Association]] (IWA) theorization of [[propaganda of the deed]].

[[Walter Benjamin]], in his ''Critique of Violence'' (1920) demarcates a difference between "violence that founds the law", and "violence that conserves the law", on one hand, and on the other hand, a "divine violence" that breaks the "magic circle" between both types of "state violence".  What distinguishes these two kinds of violence fundamentally is their mode of operation; whereas law-establishing and law-preserving violence operate instrumentally on a continuum of means and ends, wherein the means of physical violence justify the political-juridical ends of the law, the Benjaminian concept of 'divine violence' is unique insofar as it is a bloodless violence 'of pure means' through which the law itself is destroyed. The example Benjamin provides in his essay is that of a [[General Strike]], the latter of which is a key element of Sorel's Reflections on Violence (cited in this essay by Benjamin). The "violence that conserves the law" is roughly equivalent to the state's monopoly of legitimate violence. The "violence that founds the law" is the original violence necessary to the creation of a state. "Revolutionary violence" removes itself from the sphere of the law by shattering its instrumental logic of violence  (i.e. its deployment of violence as a means of instituting, preserving and enforcing its own authority).  &lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, ''Zür Kritik der Gewalt'' (1920) in ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. II, 1 (1977) ("Criticisms on Violence")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Agamben]] showed the theoretical link between the law and violence permitted Nazi-thinker [[Carl Schmitt]] to justify the "[[state of exception]]" as the characteristic of [[sovereignty]]. Thus indefinite suspension of the law may only be blocked by breaking this link between violence and right.

== Henry David Thoreau's anti-military views ==

[[Image:Mihály Zichy The Triumph of the Genius of Destruction 1878.jpeg|thumb|250px| [[Mihály Zichy]] painting "The Victory of the Genius of Destruction", made for [[Exposition Universelle (1878)| Paris Exposition]] of 1878,  was banned by French authorities because of its daring antimilitarist message.]]
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1849 essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]" ([[wikisource:Civil Disobedience|see text]]), originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government", can be considered an antimilitarist point of view. His refusal to pay taxes is justified as an act of protest against [[slavery]] and against the [[Mexican–American War]], in accordance to the practice of [[civil disobedience]]. (1846–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-militarism in the 19th Century|url = http://jjohansen.net/2014/01/05/anti-militarism-in-the-19th-century/|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in his essay that the individual is not with obligations to the majority of the State. Instead the individual should "break the law" if the law is "of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Thoreau: Civil Disobedience {{!}} Walden Woods|url = https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Civil_Disobedience|website = www.walden.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism and the military-industrial complex==
[[Capitalism]] has often been thought by antimilitarist literature to be a major cause of wars, an influence which has been theorized by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] under the name of "[[imperialism]]". The [[military-industrial complex]] has been accused of "pushing for war" in pursuit of private economic or financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = War and Economic History|url = http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgeconhi.htm|website = www.joshuagoldstein.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second International]] was opposed to the participation of the working classes in war, which was analyzed as a competition between different national [[bourgeois]] classes and different state imperialisms. The assassination of French [[Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière|socialist]] leader [[Jean Jaurès]] days before the proclamation of World War I resulted in massive participation in the coming war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First World War.com – Who's Who – Jean Jaures|url = http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/jaures.htm|publisher = www.firstworldwar.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The other assassination that led up to World War I|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/31/the-other-assassination-that-led-up-to-world-war-i/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-07-31|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Ishaan|last = Tharoor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mars; or,The Truth About War'' (1921), [[Émile Chartier|Alain]] criticizes the destruction brought about by [[militarism]], and demonstrated that it wasn't [[patriotism]] that forced the soldiers to fight, but the [[bayonet]]s behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alain {{!}} French philosopher|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Alain|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, US President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s 1961 issued a warning on the influence of the "[[military-industrial complex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Military-Industrial Complex Speech, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961|url = http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html|website = coursesa.matrix.msu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right-wing antimilitarism in the United States ==
American right-wing antimilitarists draw heavily upon the statements of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] condemning standing armies and foreign entanglements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Civilian and the Military: A History of the American Antimilitarist Tradition|url = http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=88#t-2|website = The Independent Institute|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's beliefs on maintaining a standing army are as follows: "There are instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation and which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors that those governors, whether legislative or executive, should be restrained from keeping such instruments on foot but in well-defined cases. Such an instrument is a standing army."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jefferson on Politics &amp; Government: The Military|url = http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Politics/ThomasJefferson/jeff1480.htm|website = famguardian.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing antimilitarists in the United States generally believe that "A well regulated [[militia]], composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country", as stated by [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The James Madison Research Library and Information Center|url = http://madisonbrigade.com/library_jm.htm|website = madisonbrigade.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, there is much overlap between the [[Militia movement]] and right-wing antimilitarists, although the two groups are not mutually inclusive. The term "well regulated" in the above quote (and in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]) is taken by such antimilitarists not to mean "regulated by the state" but rather "well equipped" and "in good working order", as was a common usage of the word "regulated" in the late 18th century.

==Antimilitarism in Japan==
After World War II Japan enacted its [[Constitution of Japan|postwar constitution]] which, in article 9, stated that "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." Such antimilitarist constitution was based on the belief that Japan's military organizations were to blame for thrusting the country into World War II.

In Yasuhiro Izumikawa's article "Explaining Japanese Antimilitarism: Normative and Realist Constraints on Japan's Security Policy", the evidences for the constructivist's belief in the existence of the single norm of antimilitarism in Post war Japan are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Izumikawa|first1=Yasuhiro|title=Explaining Japanese Antimilitarism: Normative and Realist Constraints on Japan's Security Policy|journal=International Security|date=October 2010 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=123–160 |doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00020|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00020|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These evidences include the [[Yoshida Doctrine]], adopted after the World War II, which emphasized the importance of Japan’s economic development and acceptance of the U.S. security umbrella. Also the institutional constraints imposed on Japan’s security policy after World War II and Japan’s [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]] which is about not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear  weapons into Japan are mentioned as the evidences for antimilitarism. In contrast to the constructivist's view, in Izumikawa's article, the realists are said to believe that the postwar security policy in Japan is a combination of pacifism, antitraditionalism, and the fear of entrapment rather than just being based on the single norm of antimilitarism.

However, the postwar constitution on which Japan’s antimilitarism is based has seen some proposed amendments, and article 9 has been renounced by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Some [[2015 Japanese military legislation|new legislation]] allows Japan’s Self Defense Forces to act more like a conventional army, reinterpreting the constitutional restrictions. This legislation has been strongly opposed by Japanese opposition parties, especially the [[Japanese Communist Party]], which is strongly opposed to militarism.

== Antimilitarist groups ==
{{see also|List of anti-war organizations|Peace movement}}

Until its dissolution, the [[Second International]] was antimilitarist. Jaurès' assassination on July 31, 1914, marks antimilitarism's failure in the socialist movement. The [[American Union Against Militarism]] is an example of a US antimilitarist movement born in the midst of the First World War, from which the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) formed from after the war. In 1968, [[Benjamin Spock]] signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also arrested for his involvement in anti-war protests resulting from his signing of the anti-war manifesto "A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority" circulated by members of the collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].&lt;ref&gt;Barsky, Robert F. Noam Chomsky: a life of dissent. 1st ed. Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1998. Web. &lt;{{cite web|url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/4/5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116133359/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/4/5.html |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The individuals arrested during this incident came to be known as the [[Boston Five]].&lt;ref&gt;Kutik, William M,. "Boston Grand Jury Indicts Five For Working Against Draft Law." Harvard Crimson. 08 Jan 1968: n. page. Web. 4 Jun. 2014. &lt;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/1/8/boston-grand-jury-indicts-five-for/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Refusenik (Israel)|''Refuseniks'']] in Israel, who refuse the draft, and draft resisters in the USA can be considered by some to be antimilitarist or pacifist.

[[War Resisters' International]], formed in 1921, is an international network of pacifist and animilitarist groups around the world, currently with 90 affiliated groups in over 40 countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3399">'''Attorney at law''' or '''attorney-at-law''', usually abbreviated in everyday speech to '''attorney''', is the preferred term for a practising [[lawyer]] in certain jurisdictions, including [[Attorneys in South Africa|South Africa]] (for certain lawyers), [[Attorney at law (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka]], and the [[Attorney at law (United States)|United States]]. In Canada, it is used only in [[Quebec]]. The term has its roots in the verb ''[[wikt:attorn|to attorn]]'', meaning to transfer one's rights and obligations to another.

==Previous usage in Ireland and Britain==
Historically, the term was used in the [[jurisdictions]] of [[England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The title has been replaced by ''[[solicitor]]'', but still appears in old [[statutes]] in these jurisdictions.

===England and Wales===
The term was also used in England and Wales for lawyers who practised in the [[common law]] courts. They were officers of the courts and were under judicial supervision.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;A. H. Manchester, ''A Modern Legal History of England and Wales, 1750&amp;ndash;1850'', Butterworths: London, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Solicitors, those lawyers who practised in the [[courts of equity]], were considered to be more respectable than attorneys and by the mid-19th century many attorneys were calling themselves solicitors.&lt;ref name="Manchester" /&gt; In 1873, the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873|Supreme Court of Judicature Act]] abolished the term "attorney", and attorneys were redesignated solicitors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law]]'' 3rd edition, London: Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited 2010, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  Attorneys did not generally actually appear as advocates in the higher courts, a role reserved (as it still usually is) for [[barrister]]s.

In England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Solicitors Act 1974]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/47/section/90 section 90(4)]&lt;/ref&gt; references in any enactment to attorneys must be construed as references to solicitors of the Senior Courts.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Solicitors Act 1974]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/47/section/89 section 89(6)] as read with [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/47/section/87 section 87(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ===
In both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, various pre-partition statutes dealing with the whole of Ireland and governing court structures, procedures, and court officers remain in force, such as the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877]]. 

References in any statutory provision in force in Northern Ireland to attorneys must be construed as references to solicitors of the Court of Judicature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/23/section/105 section 105(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland, references in any enactment to an attorney (or proctor) are to be construed as a reference to a solicitor.&lt;ref&gt; The Solicitors Act 1954, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1954/en/act/pub/0036/sec0084.html section 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research graphical timeline}}
The '''Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research''' ('''CBER''') is one of six main centers for the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which is a part of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. The current Director of CBER is Dr. [[Karen Midthun]], M.D. CBER is responsible for assuring the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of [[biologic medical product|biologics]] and related products (such as [[vaccine]]s, live biotherapeutics ([[probiotic]]s), [[blood product]]s, and [[Cell therapy|cell, tissue]], and [[Gene therapy|gene]] therapies). Not all biologics are regulated by CBER. [[Monoclonal antibodies]] and other therapeutic proteins are regulated by the FDA [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER).

==Scope==
*[[Blood]] for transfusion and as a raw material for drug products, as well as reagents used for blood typing and other related activities -and- [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derivatives, including [[intravenous immunoglobulin|immunoglobulins]], [[Hyperimmune globulin|hyperimmune]] products, and [[antitoxin]]s.
**Blood and blood products activities are managed through the Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ucm602922.htm|title=Director, Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)|last=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt;|first=|date=28 March 2018|website=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|publisher=FDA|type=Job posting|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 March 2018}}{{self-published source|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), except vascularized organs for transplantation and the associated blood vessels.
*[[Vaccine]]s for use in humans.
*Diagnostic and therapeutic [[Allergen|allergenic extracts]].
*Live biotherapeutics ([[probiotic]]s).
*Some medical devices, specifically test kits for [[HIV]], tests used to screen blood donations, blood bank collection machines and equipment, and blood bank computer software.
*[[Xenotransplantation]]
*Historically, CBER was responsible for some therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies.  Control of these has been transferred to CDER.  Some other drugs, such as certain anticoagulants and plasma volume expanders remain under the control of CBER.

==Authority==
As of July 2006 CBER's authority resides in sections 351 and 361 of the [[Public Health Service Act]] and in various sections of the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/default.htm CBER website, About CBER] Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act requires licensure of biological products that travel in [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] in the [[United States]].  CBER may deny licensure or suspend or cancel a current license if a manufacturer does not comply with requirements.  Unlicensed blood products used within the boundaries of a state are not unusual, and these products are subject to general regulations from other FDA legal authorities.

Section 361 of the same act allows the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] to make and enforce regulations to control the interstate spread of communicable disease.  This broad authority has been delegated to the FDA through a Memorandum of Understanding.  Many of the products overseen by CBER are also considered drugs, and are subject to the same rules and regulations as any other drug product from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

From these legal authorities, CBER publishes regulations which are included in the first chapter [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations]].  Most of the regulations specific to CBER are found from 21CFR600-680.  21CFR1271 contains the rules for HCT/Ps.  For products which are also drugs, such as blood for [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], rules in 21CFR200 and following apply.  Other general rules, such as the regulations for clinical trials involving human subjects in 21CFR50, may also apply.

In addition to these laws and guidances, CBER also publishes guidance documents.  These are not requirements, but are generally followed by industry.  Licensed manufacturers are expected to adopt either the guidance or an equivalent process.  In some cases, the guidance documents have the force of regulation because they are written to clarify existing rules.

==Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System==

As of 2003, the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] was based on a data integration platform from [[Informatica]]. The FDA uses this software to analyze data on adverse reactions to vaccines and other biologicals in order to improve regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping the public healthy |newspaper=KM World
 |date=October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flu vaccines==

CBER's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets annually for a discussion and vote concerning the next year's [[influenza vaccine]] virus selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin.www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4087T1.DOC |website=origin.www.fda.gov |title=Transcript of U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee's 101st meeting of February 16, 2005 |format=DOC }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8hPXwU4pfyAJ:origin.www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4087T1.DOC+CDC+H5N1+research+%22two+clades%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=18|title=in Google provided HTML format|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review and approval times==

According to numbers from the FDA, in 2001 the CBER reviewed 16 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) with a median review time of 13.8 months and a median approval time of 20.3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ZOON RESIGNS POSITION AT CBER, PLANS MOVE TO CANCER INSTITUTE |author=Kim Coghill |newspaper=BIOWORLD Today |date=16 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CBER's history began with [[Jim (horse)|a horse named Jim]], a vaccine-contamination scandal that prompted the [[Biologics Control Act]] of 1902.  Originally, CBER was part of what became the [[National Institutes of Health]], rather than the FDA.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Its mission included a mandate to foster the development of new vaccines.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  

The Bureau was transferred from the NIH to the FDA in 1972, where it was renamed  '''Bureau of Biologics''' and focused on vaccines, serums for [[allergy shot]]s, and blood products.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  

Ten years later, with the beginning of the [[biotechnology revolution]], the line between a drug and a biologic, or a device and a biologic, became blurred.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  It was merged with the FDA's Bureau of Drugs to form the ''Center for Drugs and Biologics'' during an agency-wide reorganization under Commissioner [[Arthur Hayes]].&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  This reorganization similarly merged the bureaus responsible for medical devices and radiation control into the [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]].

In 1987, under Commissioner [[Frank Edward Young (physician)|Frank Young]], CBER and the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER) were split into their present form.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The two groups were charged with enforcing different laws and had significantly different philosophical and cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER took a more collaborative, public-health driven approach to working with the industry, and in the 1980s was quicker to approve products than their drugs counterparts.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The growing crisis around [[HIV]] testing and treatment, and an inter-agency dispute between officials from the former Bureau of Drugs and officials from the former Bureau of Biologics over whether to approve Genentech's Activase ([[tissue plasminogen activator]]), led to the split.  CBER was declared the primary agency for HIV/AIDS-related products, since HIV had been spread significantly by blood transfusion and related products.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

In 1997, Congress re-authorized user fees, and research previously done at taxpayer expense began to be charged to manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER's research work has diminished dramatically since then.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

In 2002, the FDA transferred a number of biologically produced therapeutics to CDER.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  CBER regulates a number of biologics-related products, including blood tests, computer software, and devices related to blood transfusion, which industry representatives would like to see handled by the much brisker Center for Devices and Radiological Health.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Ken. "CBER and CDER have long history of being lumped together and split up." ''Bioresearch Monitoring Alert'' Sept. 2002. page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12614">The '''Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI''' was a [[leftist]] activist group operational in the US during the early 1970s.  Their only known action was breaking into a two-man [[Media, Pennsylvania]] office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and stealing over 1,000 classified documents.  They then mailed these documents anonymously to several US newspapers to expose numerous illegal FBI operations which were infringing on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of American civilians.  Most news outlets initially refused to publish the information, as it related to ongoing operations and they contended disclosure might have threatened the lives of agents or informants.  However, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', after affirming the veracity of the files which the Commission sent them, ran a front-page story on March 24, 1971. {{external media | width = 210px | align = right | topic = One Veteran's Square, Media, PA | headerimage= [[File:One Vets Sq Media Delco PA.JPG|210px]]| video1 =[http://www.retroreport.org/video/stealing-j-edgar-hoovers-secrets/ Stealing J.

"The complete collection of political documents ripped off from the F.B.I. office in Media, Pa., March 8, 1971" was published for the first time as the March, 1972 issue of ''WIN Magazine'', a journal associated with the [[War Resisters League]]. The documents revealed the [[COINTELPRO]] operation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Phillips, Tim| url= http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/activists-confess-to-breaking-into-federal-bureau-of-investigation-office-more-than-forty-years-ago/ |title=Activists Confess to Breaking Into Federal Bureau of Investigation Office More Than Forty Years Ago|website= Activist Defense|date= January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the [[Church Committee]] and the cessation of this operation by the FBI. [[Noam Chomsky]] has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to its analysis of the documents in this FBI office, 1 percent were devoted to organized crime, mostly gambling; 30 percent were "manuals, routine forms, and similar procedural matter"; 40 percent were devoted to political surveillance and the like, including two cases involving right-wing groups, ten concerning immigrants, and over 200 on left or liberal groups. Another 14 percent of the documents concerned draft resistance and "leaving the military without government permission." The remainder concerned bank robberies, murder, rape, and interstate theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199909--.htm |author=Chomsky, Noam|journal=

The theft resulted in the exposure of some of the FBI's most self-incriminating documents, including several documents detailing the FBI's use of postal workers, switchboard operators, etc., in order to spy on black college students and various non-violent black activist groups.

Some 40 years after their successful infiltration, some of the perpetrators decided to go public. In 2014, [[Betty Medsger]]'s book ''The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I.'' was released, which contains the burglars' description of the burglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight burglars.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I.|first=Betty|last=Medsger|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-96295-9|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filmmaker Johanna Hamilton also made a documentary titled ''[[1971 (2014 film)|1971]]'' (2014).

== Members ==
On March 11, 1976, the FBI closed their investigation of the group's burglary without conclusively identifying any of the perpetrators. The members' identities remained a secret until early 2014, when all seven of the eight who could be found agreed to be interviewed by journalist Betty Medsger, who was writing a nonfiction book on the event: ''The Burglary''. 

Of these seven, five agreed to be publicly identified: Keith Forsyth, Bonnie Raines, [[John C. Raines]] (who 10  years prior to the burglary was a member of the [[Freedom Riders]]), and Robert Williamson; the recruiter and informal leader, [[William C. Davidon]], died in 2013 before the book was published but had planned to reveal his involvement, as well.&lt;ref name=nytimes2014&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/us/burglars-who-took-on-fbi-abandon-shadows.html|title=Burglars Who Took On F.B.I. Abandon Shadows|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 7, 2014|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two burglars who were interviewed for the hardcover edition chose to be identified by the [[pseudonym]]s "Susan Smith" and "Ron Durst". 

The final burglar, Judi Feingold, had, unlike the others, fled across the country in 1971 and could not be found for 43 years. When she discovered that the other burglars were breaking their silence, she contacted Robert Williamson and eventually was interviewed by Medsger as well, which was included in the epilogue to the paperback edition of ''The Burglary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thenation.com/article/181878/breaking-43-years-silence-last-fbi-burglar-tells-story-her-years-underground| title=Breaking 43 Years of Silence, the Last FBI Burglar Tells the Story of Her Years in the Underground| work=The Nation| date=2014-10-06| accessdate=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after the burglary, Forsyth and Williamson were also members of [[The Camden 28]], a separate activist group which broke into a [[draft board]] to destroy documents, in order to impede the war draft and make an anti-war statement.

The burglars did extensive surveillance of the FBI office, to ensure they knew when the office was empty. The break-in was perpetrated on the day of [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]'s [[Fight of the Century]], in the hope that any security guards would be glued to their radios;&lt;ref name="nbc" /&gt; Ali was himself a COINTELPRO target due to his involvement with the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[anti-war movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Medsger|first=Betty|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/|title=In 1971, Muhammad Ali Helped Undermine the FBI's Illegal Spying on Americans|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
In a 2014 interview, John Raines said that while returning from the burglary early in the morning, the group had stopped at a pay phone, called a [[Reuters]] journalist, and delivered the following statement:&lt;ref name=democracynow2014&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/1/8/from_cointelpro_to_snowden_the_fbi|title=From COINTELPRO to Snowden, the FBI Burglars Speak Out After 43 Years of Silence (Part 2)|work=[[DemocracyNow]]|date=January 8, 2014|first=Amy|last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the night of March 8, 1971, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI removed files from the Media, Pennsylvania, office of the FBI. These files will now be studied to determine: one, the nature and extent of surveillance and intimidation carried on by this office of the FBI, particularly against groups and individuals working for a more just, humane and peaceful society. Two, to determine how much of the FBI's efforts are spent on relatively minor crimes by the poor and the powerless against whom they can get a more glamorous conviction rate. Instead of investigating truly serious crimes by those with money and influence which cause great damage to the lives of many people—crimes such as war profiteering, monopolistic practices, institutional racism, organized crime, and the mass distribution of lethal drugs. Finally, three, the extent of illegal practices by the FBI, such as eavesdropping, entrapment, and the use of provocateurs and informers.

As this study proceeds, the results obtained along with the FBI documents pertaining to them will be sent to people in public life who have demonstrated the integrity, courage and commitment to democratic values which are necessary to effectively challenge the repressive policies of the FBI.

As long as the United States government wages war against Indochina in defiance of the vast majority who want all troops and weapons withdrawn this year, and extends that war and suffering under the guise of reducing it. As long as great economic and political power remains concentrated in the hands of a small clique not subject to democratic scrutiny and control. Then repression, intimidation, and entrapment are to be expected. We do not believe that this destruction of democracy and democratic society results simply from the evilness, egoism or senility of some leaders. Rather, this destruction is the result of certain undemocratic social, economic and political institutions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Investigation==
The FBI had up to 200 agents working on this case, but it was never solved, and the investigation was closed when the five-year statute of limitations ran out.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/06/22205443-after-43-years-activists-admit-theft-at-fbi-office-that-exposed-domestic-spying?lite|title=After 43 years, activists admit theft at FBI office that exposed domestic spying|first=Michael|last=Isikoff|date=Jan 6, 2014|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary films==
A [[documentary film]] titled ''[[1971 (2014 film)|1971]]'' was produced by Big Mouth Productions and co-produced by [[Laura Poitras]].&lt;ref name="Independent Lens"&gt;{{cite web|title=''1971'': Citizens Who Exposed COINTELPRO|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/1971/|website=Independent Lens|publisher=PBS|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 18, 2014.

[[Asher Smart]] released the [[film short|short]] [[live-action film]], ''[[The Media Heist]]'', in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smart, Asher|title=The Media Heist|date=2018|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RHpypgGaMqs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commodity form theory''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] advanced by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] legal theorist [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the "guardians" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical.

==The logical premise==
"Every legal relation" proclaims Pashukanis, "is a relation between subjects". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls "the legal subject".

[[Property]], says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property.

Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects.

Commodities according to [[Karl Marx]] relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers.

Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this.

==The historical premise==
The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all.

==Fetishism==
Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of [[commodity fetishism]]. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law&amp;nbsp;– as the universal political equivalent&amp;nbsp;– has a life of its own.

The '''Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material''' was adopted on 26 October 1979 in [[Vienna]], Austria. The initial signing ceremony took place in Vienna and at New York on 3 March 1980, and the convention entered into force on 8 February 1987. The convention is deposited with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. In July 2005 a diplomatic conference was convened to amend the Convention and strengthen its provisions,&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/cppnm.html International Conventions &amp; Agreements: Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material], on the website of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of which it was renamed the '''Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities'''.

As of October 2018, there are 157 state parties to the convention plus the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Mongolia]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]] have denounced the convention after having ratified it.

The [[United States Department of State]] says that:
{{quote|The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material provides for certain levels of physical protection during international transport of nuclear material. It also establishes a general framework for cooperation among states in the protection, recovery, and return of stolen nuclear material. Further, the Convention lists certain serious offenses involving nuclear material which state parties are to make punishable and for which offenders shall be subject to a system of extradition or submission for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. {{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/5079.htm |title=Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material |date=March 3, 1980 |website=Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}

The '''Crown of the Realm''' ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: ''Corona de Logu'') was a political institution in [[Sardinia]] that acted as legislature during Sardinia's [[Giudicati]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Domenico|first=Roy Palmer|title=The Regions of Italy: A Reference Guide to History and Culture|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2002|pages=257|isbn=0313307334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was made up of the ''majorales'' (or "wise men") of each region, including the ''[[Giudicati|curadores]]'' and the ''majores'' (or "aldermen") as well as the local ''[[Bishop|píscamos]]'' (who acted more like high prelates),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Frances|title=Churchmen and Urban Government in Late Medieval Italy, c.1200–c.1450: Cases and Contexts|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2013|isbn=1107661757|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existed to advise the  ''[[Giudicati| judiches]]''. The majorales were usually either relatives of the ''judiche'' or belonged to reliable local families. In essence, it was more-or-less identical to the [[witenagemot]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] in both its composition of officials and its purpose. The Crown nominated the "Deemster King" Judiche, and attributed the supreme power, maintaining the powers to ratify the acts and the laws which regarded the whole realm.

The Supreme Magistrate of the Crown was the "Deemster King" Judiche, although they could be substituted for a curadore or a majore if need be. The moots were in the capital (or wherever the judiche lived).

The Sardinian word ''logu'' literally means "place", but when capitalised it refers to a ''[[Giudicati|judicadu]]''. It is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''locus'' (originally "''stlocus''" in [[Old Latin]]) from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*stel-'' ("to place", "to locate").

'''Digital Rights Ireland''' is a [[digital rights]] advocacy and lobbying group based in Ireland. The group works for civil liberties in a [[Digital data|digital]] age.

== Telecommunications data retention ==
In 2012,&lt;ref name="CJEU case search"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/documents.jsf?num=C-293/12 |title=Case number C-293/12 |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |publisher=[[Court of Justice of the European Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; the group brought an action before the Irish High Court, who subsequently made a reference to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] to take legal action&lt;ref name="data-retention"&gt;[http://www.enn.ie/frontpage/news-9802490.html Digital rights group sues Irish government] — ElectricNews.net report, 14 September 2006, accessed 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it-data-retention"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2006/0729/1154075749923.html State may face legal challenge over its access to phone data] — ''The Irish Times'' newspaper article, 29 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; over [[telecommunications data retention]] which is provided for by the ''Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005''.&lt;ref name=criminal-justice-terrorist-offences-act-2005&gt;[http://oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2005/a0205.pdf Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital Rights Ireland argues that the act has led to [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] accessing retained data without having a specific crime to investigate, citing remarks by the Data Protection Commissioner.&lt;ref name=dri-data-retention-criticism&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2006/04/11/data-protection-commissioners-annual-report-dris-response/ DRI comments on Data Protection Commissioners' comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2014, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] declared the Directive invalid in response to a case brought by Digital Rights Ireland against the Irish authorities and others.&lt;ref name="CJEU case search"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJEU judgment press release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140054en.pdf |title=ECJ Press Release in Digital Rights Ireland Data Retention case |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |publisher=[[Court of Justice of the European Union]] |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJEU case judgment"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/216980523/Judgment-of-the-ECJ-in-Digital-Rights-Ireland-data-retention-challenge |title=Judgment of the ECJ in Digital Rights Ireland data retention challenge |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |publisher=[[Court of Justice of the European Union]], via [[Scribd]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== File sharing ==
The [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] has sent letters to people it accuses of [[file sharing]] their music, demanding damages for financial losses.&lt;ref name=irma-legal-action&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2005/11/16/irmas-legal-action/ DRI comments on the Irish Recorded Music Associations' legal actions]&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is how the files belonging to the alleged file-sharers were searched. [[MediaSentry]] software was used to search their machines, but as it doesn't limit itself to searching only folders used for file sharing, this led to questions of violation of privacy. MediaSentry itself is based in the United States, which has less legislation about [[Data privacy|data protection]] than the [[European Union]]. This has been an issue in cases in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/wp-content/TranslationVzrvs.Brein.pdf Translation of court ruling in 'FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN THE NETHERLANDS (BREIN) et al. v UPC NEDERLAND B.V., and ors']&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnil.fr/index.php?id=1881&amp;news%5buid%5d=284&amp;cHash=dd58aa6ed2 Commission Nationale de I’Informatique et Libertes (CNIL) announcement that it would not permit automated monitoring of P2P file sharers. (In French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is [[Internet service provider]]s being compelled to identify users.&lt;ref name=isps-ordered-to-hand-over-user-ids&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2006/01/25/isps-ordered-to-hand-over-user-details-to-record-labels/ DRI comments on an ISP being ordered to hand over details of users]&lt;/ref&gt;

Current action still causes concern to DRI.&lt;ref name=copyright-holder-tactics-against-filesharers&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2007/06/07/23-filesharers-to-be-identified-but-concerns-remain/ DRI concerns about legal tactics used against alleged filesharers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Teachta Dála|TD]] Dr. [[Jerry Cowley]] has requested&lt;ref name=jerry-cowley-tap-information-request&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2007/03/29/td-requests-phone-tap-investigation/ DRI comments on a Mayo TD who requested information on his phone apparently being tapped]&lt;/ref&gt; that the complaints referee investigate whether his telephone is being [[Telephone tapping|tapped]]. DRI expressed concern, noting that there is no Irish equivalent of the [[Wilson Doctrine]] in Irish law. [[Fine Gael]] has also shown concern at the number of telephone taps authorised by former Minister for Justice [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]].&lt;ref name=fine-gael-tap-concerns&gt;[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2007/03/23/fine-gael-concerns-about-phone-tapping/ DRIs concerns about phone tapping are apparently shared by Fine Gael]&lt;/ref&gt; DRI said that the reasons for withholding the information was unacceptable.

== Other areas of work ==
Other issues addressed by the group include:

'''The Elections Act 2001''' (c.7) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Because of the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis]] the Act postponed the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2001|2001 local government elections]] in England and Wales, from 3 May 2001 to 7 June 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The Elections Act 2001, sections 1(1) and 1(2) (the second relates to by-elections)&lt;/ref&gt; and in Northern Ireland, from 16 May 2001 to 7 June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;The Elections Act 2001, section 2(1) (did not include [[by-election]]s)&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, it also required polls to be taken together on the day.&lt;ref&gt;The Elections Act 2001, section 3&lt;/ref&gt; In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it also increased candidates expenses by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;The Elections Act 2001, sections 1(7) and 2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

It also defines the rules for taking both the parliamentary and local elections at the same time in Northern Ireland, amending [[Representation of the People Act 1985]].

Rubashkyn is a [[pharmacist]], [[chemist]] and [[polyglot]].

Rubashkyn's [[gender]] was recognised under the [[United Nations]]' 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/hong-kong-government-recognizes-transgender-woman-without-gender-reassignme|title=Hong Kong recognized Trans woman without Sex reassignment Surgery|author=Human Rights Campaign 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubashkyn's case attracted international media and legal attention after her mistreatment following her detention at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] because of the lack of congruence between her [[gender identity]] and her passport photo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/05/world/transgender-asylum-hong-kong/|title=Misunderstood and stateless in Hong Kong: A transgender woman's nightmare |publisher=CNN International|date= |accessdate=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refdaily?pass=463ef21123&amp;id=533cf1698|title=Transgender Refugee goes through hell in Hong Kong|publisher=UNHCR|date=|accessdate=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/hong-kong-hell-transgender-postgrad-student-turned-refugee-struggles-be-recognised-woman0504|title=Hong Kong is 'hell' Transgender postgrad student-turned-refugee struggles to be recognised as a woman|publisher=gaystarnews.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in several months of [[statelessness]] in Hong Kong, and inhumane reclusion into several refuge centers across Yuen Long.

==Personal life==
Rubashkyn was born in [[Colombia]] to [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Jews|Jewish]] parents who had moved there in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://xnet.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5252554,00.html|title=נולדה כאינטרסקס בקולומביה, שרדה אונס ואלימות, ואז התאהבה בישראלי|date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was assigned and raised male, and named Luis Alexander but born with an [[intersex]] condition known as [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome]] and [[46, XX/46,XY|genetic mosaicism 46XX and 46XY]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/node/eliana|title=專訪：前跨性別難民Eliana（國際特赦組織香港分會人權雜誌春季號）Interview: Former Transgender Refugee Eliana (Amnesty International Hong Kong) Human Rights Magazine Spring Issue)|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3news"&gt;{{cite web| title = Gender refugee hopes for NZ citizenship| url = http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/3d/gender-refugee-hopes-for-nz-citizenship-2015072616 | publisher = 3 Degrees - TV3 New Zealand|date = July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kienyke.com/historias/el-purgatorio-de-una-transgenero-victima-de-un-pasaporte-con-sexo-masculino/ | title = El purgatorio de una transgénero víctima de un pasaporte con sexo masculino | first = Alejandro | last = Vesga | date = July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubashkyn speaks five languages fluently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/05/world/transgender-asylum-hong-kong/index.html|title=Misunderstood and stateless in Hong Kong: A transgender woman's nightmare|first=Eliana|last=Rubashkyn|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 obtained her degree in pharmacy at the [[National University of Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11316450|title=Transgender refugee says NZ paradise|last=@LincolnTanNZH|first=Lincoln Tan Lincoln Tan is the New Zealand Herald’s diversity, ethnic affairs and immigration senior reporter lincoln tan@nzherald co nz|date=2014-08-29|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then granted a scholarship to [[Taipei Medical University]], and started her gender transition in [[Taiwan]]. Within a year, [[Hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]] changed Rubashkyn's physical appearance dramatically due to her intersex condition, and the Taiwanese immigration authorities required her to update her passport at the closest Colombian consulate before she could begin her second year of master's studies. She travelled to [[Hong Kong]] to do so, but when she arrived at Hong Kong International Airport's immigration facility, she was detained for over eight months in several detention and refugee centres because of her ambiguous legal condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/gente/articulo/la-transgenero-colombiana-atrapada-en-hong-kong/381292-3|title=The Colombian transgender woman stranded in Hong Kong|publisher=Revista Semana|date= |accessdate=2014-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1457021/transgender-refugee-goes-through-hell-hong-kong-be-recognised-woman |title=Transgender refugee goes through hell in Hong Kong to be recognised as woman|publisher=South China Morning Post |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering from abusive mistreatment and constant [[sexual abuse]] and harassment in several of the reclusion centres she lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/09/03/watch-trans-refugee-finally-finds-safety-new-zealand |title=Trans Refugee Finally Finds Safety in New Zealand|publisher=The Advocate |date= |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also restrained in a psychiatric ward of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Hong Kong)|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in [[Kowloon]], caused by an attempted suicide, after being constantly mistreated and sexually abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listverse.com/2015/08/07/10-harrowing-tales-of-stateless-people/ |title=10 Harrowing Tales Of Stateless People - 2 Eliana Rubashkyn|publisher=Listverse |date= |accessdate=2017-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/05/world/transgender-asylum-hong-kong/|title=Misunderstood and stateless in Hong Kong: A transgender woman's nightmare |publisher=CNN International|date= |accessdate=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to seek asylum to be granted protection as a refugee in Hong Kong due to that government not having ratified the UN Refugee Convention, she faced deportation, and suffered severe mistreatment in the airport's detention centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listverse.com/2015/08/07/10-harrowing-tales-of-stateless-people/ |title=10 Harrowing Tales Of Stateless People - 2 Eliana Rubashkyn|publisher=Listverse |date= |accessdate=2017-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubashkyn currently lives in [[Auckland|Auckland, New Zealand]], where she was eventually granted asylum as a refugee, she remained stateless until 3 April 2018, day in which she was granted with the [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand citizenship]]  based on her exceptional circumstances &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/shows/2018/04/raped-and-beaten-for-her-gender-identity-refugee-s-story-of-survival.html |title= Raped and beaten for her gender identity, refugee's story of survival |publisher=Newshub|date= 2018-04-14|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statelessness===

After her reclusion and abuse in the Airport and Refugee Centers, In 2013, the UN sought another country to resettle Eliana caused by the lack of protections for [[LGBT]] people and refugees in Hong Kong, she refused to contact her home embassy to prevent deportation after the lack of diplomatic assistance they offered and became since the 30 October 2012 ''[[Statelessness|stateless de facto]]'' to this date, her condition as refugee limited the contact she could have with authorities from the governments of [[Colombia]] and [[Hong Kong]] from which the U.N. offered her protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1457021/transgender-refugee-goes-through-hell-hong-kong-be-recognised-woman|title=Transgender refugee goes through 'hell' in Hong Kong to be recognised as a woman|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/gay-lesbian/features/65764/stuck-in-limbo-the-tragic-story-of-transgender-refugee-eliana-rubashkyn.html|title=Stuck in limbo the tragic story of the transgender refugee Eliana Rubashkyn|publisher=Time Out Hong Kong|date=|accessdate=2014-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4bc2ddeb9.pdf|title=UNHCR and De Facto Statelessness|publisher=Hugh Massey, Senior Legal Adviser, UNHCR Geneva|date=2010-04-01|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===

On 2 June 2015, Rubashkyn was married in New Zealand to an [[Israelis|Israeli]] man named Itamar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://xnet.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5252554,00.html|title=נולדה כאינטרסקס בקולומביה, שרדה אונס ואלימות, ואז התאהבה בישראלי|date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11458110|title=Transgender refugee set to wed|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=2 June 2015|first=Lincoln|last=Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to use her birth name of Luis Alexander on the marriage registration rather than Eliana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11459398|title=Past 'haunts' transgender wedding day|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=4 June 2015|first=Lincoln|last=Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International response ==

With the help of [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), she was granted [[refugee]] status. However, because Hong Kong is not a signatory of the 1951 refugee convention, it did not recognise her as a refugee and sought to deport her to Colombia.

Her case drew international attention, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]] and Colombia, where transgender people are often persecuted. Her case was also noted in [[New Zealand]], a country known for its stance on equality for LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotnews247.vn/v688/Con-ac-mong-cua-nguoi-chuyen-gioi-o-Hong-Kong.html |title=Cơn ác mộng của người chuyển giới ở Hong Kong |publisher=Hot News Vietnam |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101242/http://hotnews247.vn/v688/Con-ac-mong-cua-nguoi-chuyen-gioi-o-Hong-Kong.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shanghaiist.com/2014/04/03/transgender-refugee-hong-kong.php|title=Transgender refugee stranded in Hong Kong describes struggle to be recognized as woman|publisher=Shanhaiist|date=|accessdate=2014-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/judicial/noticias/historia-eliana-joven-transgenero-esta-atrapada-hong-kong|title=La historia de Eliana, la joven transgénero que está atrapada en Hong Kong|publisher=Diario El País|date=|accessdate=2014-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2013, the UN passed a resolution recognising Rubashkyn as woman under the UNHCR refugee system. She became the first transgender person recognised as a woman in [[China]] or Hong Kong without having undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/audio_programas/archivo_de_audio/eliana-rubashkyn-transexual-reconocida-como-mujer-en-china/20140317/oir/2132442.aspx|title=Transexual reconocida como mujer en China|author=caracol.com.co|date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20140315/18657221|title=行街紙隱去性別未變性博士准住女病房|publisher=Apple Daily Hong Kong|date=|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, New Zealand accepted Rubashkyn as a refugee and granted her asylum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/gente/articulo/eliana-rubashkyn-transgenero-colombiana-en-hong-kong-quedo-libre/394176-3|title=En libertad la transgénero presa en Hong Kong|publisher=Revista Semana|date=|accessdate=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extending a universal recognition of her gender. Her case was the first in the world in which the gender identity of a transgender person was recognised internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundaciontriangulo.org/noticias/425-eliana-rubashkyn-primer-caso-de-cambio-de-sexo-legal-por-asilo-internacional|title=Eliana Rubashkyn.

A [[CNN]] story about her struggle and a short documentary about her life in Hong Kong won a [[GLAAD Media Award]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glaad.org/tags/eliana-rubashkyn|title=Eliana Rubashkyn|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand citizenship ==

After six years of statelessness in April 2018, the government of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs granted the [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand citizenship]] based on her exceptional and unique circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/shows/2018/04/raped-and-beaten-for-her-gender-identity-refugee-s-story-of-survival.html |title= Raped and beaten for her gender identity, refugee's story of survival |publisher=Newshub|date= 2018-04-14|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair use''' is a [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] in the [[law of the United States]] that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the [[limitations to copyright]] intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226032280|pages=10-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OUcXGnexGYC|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The 1710 [[Statute of Anne]], an act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], created copyright law to replace a system of private ordering enforced by the [[Stationers' Company]]. The Statute of Anne did not provide for legal unauthorized use of material protected by copyright. In ''[[Gyles v Wilcox]]'',&lt;ref name="Gyles"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Gyles v Wilcox|vol=3|reporter=Atk|opinion=143;26 ER 489|court=Court of Chancery (England)|date=1740|url=http://copy.law.cam.ac.uk/cam/pdf/uk_1741_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Chancery]] established the doctrine of "fair abridgement," which permitted unauthorized abridgement of copyrighted works under certain circumstances. Over time, this doctrine evolved into the modern concepts of fair use and [[fair dealing]]. Fair use was a [[common law|common-law]] doctrine in the U.S. until it was incorporated into the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}.

The term "fair use" originated in the United States.&lt;ref name="Folsom"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Folsom v. Marsh |vol=9 |reporter=F. Cas. |opinion=342 |pinpoint=No. 4901 |court=C.C.D. Mass. |date=1841 |url=http://www.yalelawtech.org/wp-content/uploads/FolsomvMarsh1841.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234210/http://www.yalelawtech.org/wp-content/uploads/FolsomvMarsh1841.pdf |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=2017-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although related, the [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]] for teaching and library archiving in the U.S. are located in a different section of the statute. A similar-sounding principle, [[fair dealing]], exists in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions but in fact it is more similar in principle to the enumerated exceptions found under civil law systems. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.

In response to perceived over-expansion of copyrights, several electronic civil liberties and free expression organizations began in the 1990s to add fair use cases to their dockets and concerns. These include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] ("EFF"), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], the [[American Library Association]], numerous clinical programs at law schools, and others. The "[[Lumen (website)|Chilling Effects]]" archive was established in 2002 as a coalition of several law school clinics and the EFF to document the use of [[cease and desist]] letters. Most recently, in 2006, [[Stanford University]] began an initiative called "The [[Fair Use Project]]" (FUP) to help artists, particularly filmmakers, fight lawsuits brought against them by large corporations.

Examples of fair use in [[United States copyright law]] include commentary, search engines, criticism, [[parody]], news reporting, research, and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Netanei|first1=Neil Weinstock|title=Making Sense of Fair Use|journal=Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review|date=2011|volume=15|issue=3|page=715|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt5mh7w8hc/qt5mh7w8hc.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair use provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor [[Legal tests|test]].

The U.S. Supreme Court has traditionally characterized fair use as an [[affirmative defense]], but in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' (2015)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12567649168680108221 Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]'', 801 F.3d 1126, 1133 (9th Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; (the "dancing baby" case), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that fair use was not merely a defense to an infringement claim, but was an expressly authorized right, and an exception to the [[exclusive right]]s granted to the author of a creative work by [[copyright]] law: "Fair use is therefore distinct from affirmative defenses where a use infringes a copyright, but there is no liability due to a valid excuse, e.g., misuse of a copyright."

[[File:Joseph_Story.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|alt=Oil portrait of Joseph Story|Joseph Story wrote the opinion in ''[[Folsom v. Marsh]]''.]]
The four factors of analysis for fair use set forth above derive from the opinion of [[Joseph Story]] in ''[[Folsom v. Marsh]]'',&lt;ref name="Folsom" /&gt; in which the defendant had copied 353 pages from the plaintiff's 12-volume biography of [[George Washington]] in order to produce a separate two-volume work of his own.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Folsom v. Marsh and Its Legacy|journal=Journal of Intellectual Property Law|date=1998-04-01|first=L. Ray|last=Patterson|volume=5|issue=2|pages=431–452|url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1346&amp;context=fac_artchop|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the defendant's fair use defense with the following explanation:

{{quote|
[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticize, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a piracy ...

In short, we must often ... look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.
}}

The statutory fair use factors quoted above come from the Copyright Act of 1976, which is codified at {{USC|17|107}}. They were intended by Congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. As Judge [[Pierre N. Leval]] has written, the statute does not "define or explain [fair use's] contours or objectives." While it "leav[es] open the possibility that other factors may bear on the question, the statute identifies none."&lt;ref name=Leval /&gt; That is, courts are entitled to consider other factors in addition to the four statutory factors.

==== 1. Purpose and character of the use ====
The first factor is "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." To justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.

In the 1841 copyright case [[Folsom v. Marsh]], [[Joseph Story|Justice Joseph Story]] wrote:
{{quote|"[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a [[piracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises|vol=723 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=195 |court=2d Cir.|date=1985-05-20|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/471/539.htmll|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A key consideration in recent fair use cases is the extent to which the use is ''[[transformation (law)|transformative]]''. In the 1994 decision ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]'',&lt;ref name="510 US 569" /&gt; the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use.&lt;ref name=Unbundling&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=Pamela|title=Unbundling Fair Uses|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=2009|volume=77|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_77/Samuelson2_Vol_77_Apr.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the ''Campbell'' decision, federal Judge Pierre Leval argued that transformativeness is central to the fair use analysis in his 1990 article, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]].&lt;ref name="Leval"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leval|first=Pierre N.|year=1990|title=Toward a Fair Use Standard|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|volume=103|issue=5|pages=1105–1136|doi=10.2307/1341457|jstor=1341457}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blanch v. Koons]]'' is another example of a fair use case that focused on transformativeness. In 2006, [[Jeff Koons]] used a photograph taken by commercial photographer [[Andrea Blanch]] in a collage painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Blanch v. Koons|vol=467 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=244 |court=2d Cir.|date=2006-10-26|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1374144.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koons appropriated a central portion of an advertisement she had been commissioned to shoot for a magazine. Koons prevailed in part because his use was found transformative under the first fair use factor.

The ''Campbell'' case also addressed the subfactor mentioned in the quotation above, "whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." In an earlier case, ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court had stated that "every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair." In ''Campbell'', the court clarified that this is not a "hard evidentiary presumption" and that even the tendency that commercial purpose will "weigh against a finding of fair use . . . will vary with the context." The ''Campbell'' court held that hip-hop group [[2 Live Crew]]'s parody of the song "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" was fair use, even though the parody was sold for profit. Thus, having a commercial purpose does not preclude a use from being found fair, even though it makes it less likely.&lt;ref name=Reclaiming /&gt;

Likewise, the noncommercial purpose of a use makes it more likely to be found a fair use, but it does not make it a fair use automatically.&lt;ref name=Reclaiming&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|chapter=Appendix D: Myths and Realities About Fair Use}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in ''[[L.A. Times v. Free Republic]]'', the court found that the noncommercial use of ''Los Angeles Times'' content by the Free Republic Web site was not fair use, since it allowed the public to obtain material at no cost that they would otherwise pay for. [[Richard Story]] similarly ruled in ''Code Revision Commission and State of Georgia v. [[Public.Resource.Org]], Inc.'' that despite the fact that it is a non-profit and didn't sell the work, the service profited from its unauthorized publication of the [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] because of "the attention, recognition, and contributions" it received in association with the work.&lt;ref name="ars-georgiacopy"&gt;{{cite web|title=If you publish Georgia's state laws, you'll get sued for copyright and lose|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/public-records-activist-violated-copyright-by-publishing-georgia-legal-code-online/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is whether the use fulfills any of the preamble purposes, also mentioned in the legislation above, as these have been interpreted as "illustrative" of transformative use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. | vol=510 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=569 | pinpoint=584 | date=1994 | url=https://advance.lexis.com/api/permalink/a5fa374f-da05-4ac4-8da7-152a0b0828b4/?context=1000516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is arguable, given the dominance of a rhetoric of the "transformative" in recent fair use determinations, that the first factor and transformativeness in general have become the most important parts of fair use.

==== 2. Nature of the copyrighted work ====
[[File:J. D. Salinger Signature.svg|thumb|alt=Signature of J.D. Salinger in 1950|The unpublished nature of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s letters was a key issue in the court's analysis of the second fair use factor in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''.]]

Although the Supreme Court has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books]]'', 575 F. Supp. 2d 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, [[idea-expression divide|facts and ideas are not protected by copyright]]—only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The [[Zapruder film]] of the [[assassination of President Kennedy]], for example, was purchased and copyrighted by ''Time'' magazine. Yet its copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when ''Time'' tried to [[enjoin]] the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in ''Time Inc v. [[Bernard J. Geis|Bernard Geis]] Associates''.&lt;ref&gt;293 F. Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decisions of the [[Second Circuit]] in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Salinger v. Random House, Inc. |vol=811 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=90 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/811_F2d_90.htm |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co'',&lt;ref&gt;''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co'', 695 F. Supp. 1493 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the aspect of whether the copied work has been previously published was considered crucial, assuming the right of the original author to control the circumstances of the publication of his work or preference not to publish at all. However, Judge Pierre N. Leval views this importation of certain aspects of France's ''droit moral d'artiste'' ([[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of the artist) into American copyright law as "bizarre and contradictory" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect.&lt;ref name="Leval" /&gt; This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than laws about copyright. The statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: "The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."

==== 3. Amount and substantiality ====
[[File:GoogleImageSearch.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Google Image Search results page|The Ninth Circuit has held that the use of thumbnails in image search engines is fair use.]]
The third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.

Using most or all of a work does not bar a finding of fair use. It simply makes the third factor less favorable to the defendant. For instance, in ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'' copying entire television programs for private viewing was upheld as fair use, at least when the copying is done for the purposes of [[time-shifting]]. In ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation,'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] held that copying an entire photo to use as a [[thumbnail]] in online search results did not even weigh against fair use, "if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use".

However, even the use of a small percentage of a work can make the third factor unfavorable to the defendant, because the "substantiality" of the portion used is considered in addition to the amount used. For instance, in ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]],'',&lt;ref name=Harper&amp;Row&gt;{{Ussc|name=Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court held that a news article's quotation of fewer than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s 200,000-word memoir was sufficient to make the third fair use factor weigh against the defendants, because the portion taken was the "heart of the work." This use was ultimately found not to be fair.&lt;ref name=Harper&amp;Row /&gt;

==== 4. Effect upon work's value ====
The fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.

For example, in ''Sony Corp v. Universal City Studios'',&lt;ref name=Sony&gt;{{ussc|name=Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|link=|volume=464|page=417|pin=451|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In ''Harper &amp; Row,'' the case regarding President Ford's memoirs, the Supreme Court labeled the fourth factor "the single most important element of fair use" and it has enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme Court's more recent announcement in ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc''&lt;ref name="510 US 569"&gt;{{ussc|name=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.|link=|volume=510|page=569|pin=|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.

In evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market for the original work.
* First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market [[substitute good|substitute]] for the original work. In ''Campbell'', the Supreme Court stated that "when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of the original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur". In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since his trailers acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers.&lt;ref name=VideoPipeline&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista |vol=342 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=191 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=2000-09-19 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11920632898766723981&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the [[licensing]] of course-pack copies.&lt;ref name=PrincetonUP&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services |vol=99 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1381 |pinpoint= |court=6th Cir. |date=1996 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/99_F3d_1381.htm |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not negate fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. Copyright considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.

==== Additional factors ====
As explained by Judge Leval, courts are permitted to include additional factors in their analysis.&lt;ref name=Leval /&gt;

One such factor is acknowledgement of the copyrighted source. Giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it does not automatically make a use fair. While [[plagiarism]] and copyright infringement are related matters, they are not identical. '''Plagiarism (using someone's words, ideas, images, etc. without acknowledgment) is a matter of professional ethics. Copyright is a matter of law, and protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas.''' One can plagiarize even a work that is not protected by copyright, for example by passing off a line from Shakespeare as one's own. Conversely, attribution prevents accusations of plagiarism, but it does not prevent infringement of copyright. For example, reprinting a copyrighted book without permission, while citing the original author, would be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.

=== U.S. fair use procedure and practice ===
The U.S. Supreme Court described fair use as an [[affirmative defense]] in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name="510 US 569"/&gt; This means that in [[litigation]] on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of raising and proving]] that the use was fair and not an infringement. Thus, fair use need not even be raised as a defense unless the plaintiff first shows (or the defendant concedes) a "[[prima facie]]" case of copyright infringement. If the work was not copyrightable, the term had expired, or the defendant's work [[de minimis|borrowed only a small amount]], for instance, then the plaintiff cannot make out a ''prima facie'' case of infringement, and the defendant need not even raise the fair use defense. In addition, fair use is only one of many limitations, exceptions, and defenses to copyright infringement. Thus, a ''prima facie'' case can be defeated without relying on fair use. For instance, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] establishes that it is legal, using certain technologies, to make copies of audio recordings for non-commercial personal use.&lt;ref&gt;See [[s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 10/Section 1008|USC October 17, 1008]], amended by the [[Audio Home Recording Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some copyright owners claim infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed, in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in their defense. [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP) cases such as these—alleging copyright infringement, patent infringement, defamation, or libel—often come into conflict with the defendant's right to [[freedom of speech]], and has prompted some jurisdictions to pass anti-SLAPP legislation which raises the plaintiff's burdens and risk.

Although fair use ostensibly permits certain uses without liability, many content creators and publishers try to avoid a potential court battle by seeking a legally unnecessary license from copyright owners for ''any'' use of non-public domain material, even in situations where a fair use defense would likely succeed. The simple reason is that the license terms negotiated with the copyright owner may be much less expensive than defending against a copyright suit, or having the mere possibility of a lawsuit threaten the publication of a work in which a publisher has invested significant resources.

Fair use rights take precedence over the author's interest. Thus the copyright holder cannot use a non-binding disclaimer, or notification, to revoke the right of fair use on works. However, binding agreements such as contracts or licence agreements may take precedence over fair use rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept'' (9th Cir. May 17, 2006) ([http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2006/05/16/0356559.pdf PDF] at Ninth Circuit).&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical effect of the fair use doctrine is that a number of conventional uses of copyrighted works are not considered infringing. For instance, quoting from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it or teach students about it, is considered a fair use. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though they may sell their review commercially; but a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.

Fair use is decided on a case by case basis, on the entirety of circumstances. The same act done by different means or for a different purpose can gain or lose fair use status. Even repeating an identical act at a different time can make a difference due to changing social, technological, or other surrounding circumstances.&lt;ref name=Unbundling /&gt;&lt;ref name="grand-upright"/&gt;

== Fair use in particular areas ==
=== Computer code ===
The case ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' revolves around the use of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) used to define functionality of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, created by [[Sun Microsystems]] and now owned by [[Oracle Corporation]]. [[Google]] used the APIs definition and their [[structure, sequence and organization]] (SSO) in creating the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] to support the mobile device market. Oracle had sued Google in 2010 over both patent and copyright violations, but after two cycles, the case matter was narrowed down to whether Google's use of the definition and SSO of Oracle's Java APIs (determined to be copyrightable) was within fair use. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against Google, stating that while Google could defend its use in the nature of the copyrighted work, its use was not transformative, and more significantly, it commercially harmed Oracle as they were also seeking entry to the mobile market. The case, should this ruling hold, could have a significant impact on developing products for [[interoperability]] using APIs, such as with many [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.

=== Documentary films ===
In April 2006, the filmmakers of the [[Loose Change]] series were served with a lawsuit by [[Jules and Gédéon Naudet]] over the film's use of their footage, specifically footage of the firefighters discussing the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].
With the help of an intellectual property lawyer, the creators of Loose Change successfully argued that a majority of the footage used was for historical purposes and was significantly transformed in the context of the film. They agreed to remove a few shots that were used as B-roll and served no purpose to the greater discussion. The case was settled and a potential multimillion-dollar lawsuit was avoided.

[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]] also relied on fair use to feature several clips from copyrighted Hollywood productions. The director had originally planned to license these clips from their studio owners but discovered that studio licensing agreements would have prohibited him from using this material to criticize the entertainment industry. This prompted him to invoke the fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material to provide analysis and criticism of published works.

=== File sharing ===
In 2009, fair use appeared as a defense in [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|lawsuits against filesharing]]. [[Charles Nesson]] argued that file-sharing qualifies as fair use in his defense of alleged filesharer [[Joel Tenenbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-prof-tells-judge-that-p2p-filesharing-is-fair-use.ars|title=Harvard prof tells judge that P2P filesharing is "fair use"|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiwi Camara]], defending alleged filesharer [[Jammie Thomas]], announced a similar defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-law-prof-helping-in-not-1-but-3-file-sharing-cases.ars|title=Lawyer: RIAA must pay back all "$100M+" it has allegedly collected|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-22|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Court in the case at bar rejected the idea that file-sharing is fair use.

=== Internet publication ===
A U.S. court case from 2003, ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]],'' provides and develops the relationship between [[thumbnails]], [[inline linking]] and fair use. In the lower District Court case on a motion for [[summary judgment]], Arriba Soft's use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba Soft's image [[Web search engine|search engine]] was found not to be fair use. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who argued that it was fair use.

On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found in favour of the defendant, Arriba Soft. In reaching its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. First, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting that they were not meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. Second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. Third, although normally making a "full" replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. Lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. To the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. In looking at all these factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on July 7, 2003. The remaining issues were resolved with a [[default judgment]] after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.

In August 2008, Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected "fair use" of the copyrighted material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who made a home video of her thirteen-month-old son dancing to Prince's song [[Let's Go Crazy]] and posted the video on [[YouTube]]. Four months later, [[Universal Music]], the owner of the copyright to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and she demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks, rather than the two weeks required by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz then sued Universal Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Egelko|title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Woman-can-sue-over-YouTube-clip-de-posting-3199389.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 21, 2008|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a copyright owner must affirmatively consider whether the complained of conduct constituted fair use before sending a takedown notice under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], rather than waiting for the alleged infringer to assert fair use. 801 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2015). "Even if, as Universal urges, fair use is classified as an 'affirmative defense,' we hold—for the purposes of the DMCA—fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. We conclude that because 17 U.S.C. § 107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is "authorized by the law" and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)."

In June 2011, Judge [[Philip Pro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada|District of Nevada]] ruled in ''[[Righthaven v. Hoehn]]'' that the posting of an entire editorial article from the [[Las Vegas Review Journal]] in a comment as part of an online discussion was unarguably fair use. Judge Pro noted that "Noncommercial, nonprofit use is presumptively fair. ... Hoehn posted the Work as part of an online discussion. ... This purpose is consistent with comment, for which 17 U.S.C. § 107 provides fair use protection. ... It is undisputed that Hoehn posted the entire work in his comment on the Website. ... wholesale copying does not preclude a finding of fair use. ... there is no genuine issue of material fact that Hoehn's use of the Work was fair and summary judgment is appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dmlp.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2011-06-20-Order%20Granting%20Mot%20to%20Dismiss%20in%20Righthave%20v%20Hoehn%20Order.pdf|title=Righthaven v. Hoehn (District Court of Nevada)|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that [[Righthaven]] did not even have the standing needed to sue Hoehn for copyright infringement in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/case/righthaven-llc-v-hoehn/|title=Righthaven v.

=== Professional communities ===
In addition to considering the four fair use factors, courts deciding fair use cases also look to the standards and practices of the professional community where the case comes from.&lt;ref name=Madison&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madison|first1=Michael J.|title=A Pattern-Oriented Approach to Fair Use|journal=William and Mary Law Review|date=2004|volume=45|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/6048/1/Madison_Pattern_Oriented_Approach_20032004.pdf|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the communities are documentarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/best-practices/documentary-filmmakers-statement-best-practices-fair-use |title=Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use |publisher=Center for Media &amp; Social Impact |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; librarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/fair-use/code-of-best-practices |title=Code of Best Practices in Fair Use |publisher=Association of Research Libraries |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; makers of Open Courseware, visual art educators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vraweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/VRA_FairUse_Statement_Pages_Links.pdf |title=Statement on the Fair Use of Images for Teaching, Research, and Study |publisher=Visual Resources Association |accessdate=2015-11-18 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communications professors.&lt;ref name=ICA&gt;{{cite web|last1=The International Communication Association|title=Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication|url=http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/best-practices/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication|website=Center for Media and Social Impact|accessdate=November 16, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116140807/http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/best-practices/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication|archivedate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such codes of best practices have permitted communities of practice to make more informed risk assessments in employing fair use in their daily practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforsocialmedia.org/libraries/articles/success-of-codes |title=Success of Fair Use Consensus Documents |publisher=Center for Social Media |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, broadcasters, cablecasters, and distributors typically require filmmakers to obtain [[Professional liability insurance|errors and omissions insurance]] before the distributor will take on the film. Such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the ''Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use'' was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, it was impossible to license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.&lt;ref name=Aufderheide&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226032283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music sampling ===
{{further|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}
Before 1991, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in certain genres of music was accepted practice and the copyright considerations were viewed as largely irrelevant. The strict decision against [[rapping|rapper]] [[Biz Markie]]'s appropriation of a [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] song in the case ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.]]''&lt;ref name="grand-upright"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc. |vol=780 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=182 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1991 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed practices and opinions overnight. Samples now had to be licensed, as long as they rose "to a level of legally cognizable appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films |vol=230 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion= |pinpoint=841 |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left the door open for the ''[[de minimis]]'' doctrine, for short or unrecognizable samples; such uses would not rise to the level of copyright infringement, because under the ''de minimis'' doctrine, "the law does not care about trifles." However, 3 years later, the Sixth Circuit effectively eliminated the ''de minimis'' doctrine in the ''[[Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films]]'' case, holding that artists must "get a license or do not sample".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films |vol=383 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=390 |pinpoint=398 |court=6th Cir. |date=2004 |url=http://fsnews.findlaw.com/cases/6th/04a0297p.html |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court later clarified that its opinion did not apply to fair use, but between ''Grand Upright'' and ''Bridgeport'', practice had effectively shifted to eliminate unlicensed sampling.

=== Parody ===
Producers or creators of [[parody|parodies]] of a copyrighted work have been sued for infringement by the targets of their ridicule, even though such use may be protected as fair use. These fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and [[satire]], or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.

For example, when [[Tom Forsythe]] appropriated [[Barbie]] dolls for his photography project "Food Chain Barbie" (depicting several copies of the doll naked and disheveled and about to be baked in an oven, blended in a food mixer, and the like), [[Mattel]] lost its copyright infringement lawsuit against him because his work effectively parodies Barbie and the values she represents.&lt;ref name="Mattel"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Mattel Inc v. Walking Mountain Productions|vol=353 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=792 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=Dec 29, 2003|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/353/353.F3d.792.01-57193.01-56695.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]'', [[Jeff Koons]] tried to justify his appropriation of Art Rogers' photograph "Puppies" in his sculpture "String of Puppies" with the same parody defense. Koons lost because his work was not presented as a parody of Rogers' photograph in particular, but as a satire of society at large. This was insufficient to render the use fair.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Rogers v. Koons |vol=960|reporter=F.2d|opinion=301|court=2d Cir.|date=Apr 2, 1992|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/960/960.F2d.301.91-7396.91-7540.91-7442.234.235.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]''&lt;ref name="510 US 569"/&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court recognized parody as a potential fair use, even when done for profit. [[Roy Orbison]]'s publisher, [[Acuff-Rose Music]], had sued [[2 Live Crew]] in 1989 for their use of Orbison's "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. The Supreme Court viewed 2 Live Crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than mere advertising, commercial nature did not bar the defense. The ''Campbell'' court also distinguished parodies from [[satire]], which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.

A number of appellate decisions have recognized that a parody may be a protected fair use, including the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]] (''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]''); the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] (''Mattel v. Walking Mountain Productions''); and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits (''[[Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.]]''). In the 2001 ''Suntrust Bank'' case, Suntrust Bank and the [[Margaret Mitchell]] estate unsuccessfully brought suit to halt the publication of ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which reused many of the characters and situations from ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' but told the events from the point of view of the enslaved people rather than the slaveholders. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]], applying ''Campbell'', found that ''The Wind Done Gone'' was fair use and vacated the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia|district court's]] injunction against its publication.

Cases in which a satirical use was found to be fair include ''Blanch v. Koons'' and ''Williams v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems''.&lt;ref name=Unbundling /&gt;

=== Text and data mining ===
The transformative nature of computer based analytical processes such as [[text mining]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]] has led many to form the view that such uses would be protected under fair use. This view was substantiated by the rulings of Judge [[Denny Chin]] in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'', a case involving mass digitisation of millions of books from research library collections. As part of the ruling that found the book digitisation project was fair use, the judge stated "Google Books is also transformative in the sense that it has transformed book text into data for purposes of substantive research, including data mining and text mining in new areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosati|first1=Eleonora|title=A Closer Look at the Google Books Library Project Decision|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/a-closer-look-at-google-books-library.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014|publisher=The IPKAT|date=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GoogleVictory&gt;{{cite web|title=Google's Fair Use Victory|url=http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|website=Law Down Under|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text and data mining was subject to further review in ''[[Authors Guild v. HathiTrust]]'', a case derived from the same digitization project mentioned above. Judge [[Harold Baer, Jr.|Harold Baer]], in finding that the defendant's uses were transformative, stated that 'the search capabilities of the [HathiTrust Digital Library] have already given rise to new methods of academic inquiry such as text mining."&lt;ref name=Hathi&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Authors Guild, Inc. v.

=== Reverse engineering ===
{{main article|Reverse engineering#Legality}}
There is a substantial body of fair use law regarding [[reverse engineering]] of [[computer software]], [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[network protocol]]s, [[cryptography|encryption]] and access control systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Reverse Engineering/Legal Aspects]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReverseEngineeringFAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Coders' Rights Project Reverse Engineering FAQ|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media ===
In May 2015, [[Richard Prince]] displayed his art gallery at the Frieze Art Fair. His gallery consisted of screenshots of Instagram users' pictures with Prince's commentary photoshopped below in the comments section. Not one Instagram user authorized Prince to use their pictures, but because Prince added his own commentary, the pictures were considered original artwork. One of the pieces sold for $90,000. Further, the [[Gagosian Gallery]], where the pictures were showcased stated that "All images are subject to copyright."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/richard-prince-instagram_n_7452634.html|title=Artist Richard Prince Sells Instagram Photos That Aren't His For $90K|last=Sola|first=Katie|date=May 27, 2015|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence internationally ==
While U.S. fair use law has been influential in some countries, some countries have fair use criteria drastically different from those in the U.S., and some countries do not have a fair use framework at all. Some countries have the concept of [[fair dealing]] instead of fair use, while others use different systems of [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]]. Many countries have some reference to an exemption for educational use, though the extent of this exemption varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teflpedia.com/index.php?title=Copyright_in_English_language_teaching|title=International exemptions for education with links to relevant laws|publisher=Teflpedia.com|date=2009-05-25|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources differ on whether fair use is fully recognized by countries other than the United States. [[American University]]'s ''infojustice.org'' published a compilation of portions of over 40 nations' laws that explicitly mention fair use or fair dealing, and asserts that some of the fair dealing laws, such as Canada's, have evolved (such as through judicial precedents) to be quite close to those of the United States. This compilation includes fair use provisions from Bangladesh, Israel, South Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Uganda, and the United States.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/band-and-gerafi-2013.pdf |title=The Fair Use/Fair Dealing Handbook |work=infojustice.org |publisher=American University Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property |first1=Jonathan |last1=Band |first2=Jonathan |last2=Gerafi}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Geller's 2009 ''International Copyright Law and Practice'' says that while some other countries recognize similar exceptions to copyright, only the United States and Israel fully recognize the concept of fair use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geller|first=Paul|title=International Copyright Law and Practice|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Co Inc|edition=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
In November 2007, the Israeli [[Knesset]] passed a new Copyright Law that included a U.S.-style fair use exception. The law, which took effect in May 2008, permits the fair use of copyrighted works for purposes such as private study, research, criticism, review, news reporting, quotation, or instruction or testing by an educational institution. The law sets up four factors, similar to the U.S. fair use factors (see above), for determining whether a use is fair.&lt;ref name=BandIsrael&gt;{{cite news|last1=Band|first1=Jonathan|title=Israel now has the right copyright law|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1206446110027&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|accessdate=November 16, 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=2008-03-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128161746/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1206446110027&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archivedate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2009, the Tel Aviv District court ruled in ''The Football Association Premier League Ltd. v. Ploni''&lt;ref name=FAPL&gt;{{cite web|title= The Football Association Premier League Ltd. v.

The court also ruled that streaming of live soccer games on the Internet is fair use. In doing so, the court analyzed the four fair use factors adopted in 2007 and cited U.S. case law, including ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]]'' and ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref name=Lichtenstein&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichtenstein|first1=Yoram|title=Israeli Judge Permits Unlicensed Sports Event Streaming—FAPL v.

=== Malaysia ===
An amendment in 2012 to the section 13(2)(a) of the Copyright Act 1987 created an exception called 'fair dealing' which is not restricted in its purpose. The four factors for fair use as in US law are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/my/my081en.pdf|title=Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=World Intellectual Property Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
Fair use exists in [[Polish law]] and is covered by the [[Polish copyright law]] articles 23 to 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prawo.pl/dz-u-akt/-/dokument/Dz.U.2016.666/16795787/2047977|title=Dz.U.2016.666 t.j. – prawo.pl|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the United States, Polish fair use distinguishes between private and public use. In Poland, when the use is public, its use risks fines. The defendant must also prove that his use was private when accused that it was not, or that other mitigating circumstances apply. Finally, Polish law treats all cases in which private material was made public as a potential copyright infringement, where fair use can apply, but has to be proven by reasonable circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techlaw.pl/prawo-cytatu/|title=Kiedy możemy korzystać z prawa cytatu?|date=December 1, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
Section 35 of the Singaporean Copyright Act 1987 has been amended in 2004 to allow a 'fair dealing' exception for any purpose. The four fair use factors similar to US law are included in the new section 35.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== South Korea ===
The [[Copyright law of South Korea|Korean Copyright Act]] was amended to include a fair use provision, Article 35-3, in 2012. The law now states that, "the copyrighted work may be used, among other things, for reporting, criticism, education, and research."&lt;ref name=SouthKorea /&gt; Then, the law outlines a four-factor test similar to that used under U.S. law:

{{quote|In determining whether art. 35-3(1) above applies to a use of copyrighted work, the following factors must be considered: the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is of a non profit nature; the type or purpose of the copyrighted work; the amount and importance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; the effect of the use of the copyrighted work upon the current market or the current value of the copyrighted work or on the potential market or the potential value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref name=SouthKorea&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben|title=How will South Korea Implement fair use?|url=http://the1709blog.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-will-south-korea-implement-fair-use.html|website=The 1709 Blog|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Fair dealing ==
{{Main article|Fair dealing}}

Fair dealing allows specific exceptions to copyright protections. The open-ended concept of fair use is generally not observed in jurisdictions where fair dealing is in place, although this does vary.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Fair dealing is established in legislation in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom, among others.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

While Australian copyright exceptions are based on the Fair Dealing system, since 1998 a series of Australian government inquiries have examined, and in most cases recommended, the introduction of a "flexible and open" Fair Use system into Australian copyright law. From 1998 to 2017 there have been eight Australian government inquiries which have considered the question of whether fair use should be adopted in Australia. Six reviews have recommended Australia adopt a "Fair Use" model of copyright exceptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|title=Our copyright laws are holding us back, and there's a way out|last=Martin|first=Peter|date=2016-12-15|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=2017-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214223301/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|archive-date=2016-12-14|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.org.au/content/productivity-commission-draft-ip-report-breakdown|title=Productivity Commission Draft IP Report – the breakdown|last=|first=|date=June 16, 2016|website=|publisher=[[Australian Digital Alliance]]|access-date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; two enquiries specifically into the Copyright Act (1998, 2014); and four broader reviews (both 2004, 2013, 2016). One review (2000) recommended against the introduction of fair use and another (2005) issued no final report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/4-case-fair-use-australia/reviews-have-considered-fair-use|title=Reviews that have considered fair use|last=|first=|date=2013-06-04|website=www.alrc.gov.au|publisher=[[Australian Law Reform Commission]]|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the recommendations were specifically in response to the stricter copyright rules introduced as part of the [[Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement]] (AUSFTA), while the most recent two, by the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] (ALRC) and the [[Productivity Commission]] (PC) were with reference to strengthening Australia's "digital economy".

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|Fair dealing in Canadian copyright law}}

The ''[[Copyright Act of Canada]]'' establishes fair dealing in Canada, which allows specific exceptions to copyright protection. In 1985, the Sub-Committee on the Revision of Copyright rejected replacing fair dealing with an open-ended system, and in 1986 the Canadian government agreed that "the present fair dealing provisions should not be replaced by the substantially wider 'fair use' concept".&lt;ref name=MagazinesCanada&gt;{{cite web|author1=Magazines Canada|title=Why Canada Should Not Adopt Fair Use:  A Joint Submission to the Copyright Consultations|url=https://www.magazinescanada.ca/uploads/File/files/JOINT_SUBMISSION_FAIR_USE_final.pdf|accessdate=November 16, 2015|date=2009-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403000037/https://www.magazinescanada.ca/uploads/File/files/JOINT_SUBMISSION_FAIR_USE_final.pdf|archivedate=April 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Canadian fair dealing exception has broadened. It is now similar in effect to U.S. fair use, even though the frameworks are different.&lt;ref name=PublishersUSTR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=Book Publishers Whine To USTR That It's Just Not Fair That Canada Recognizes Fair Dealing For Educational Purposes|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150527/19333231131/book-publishers-whine-to-ustr-that-just-not-fair-that-canada-recognizes-fair-dealing-educational-purposes.shtml|accessdate=November 16, 2015|work=Tech Dirt|date=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada]] [2004] 1 S.C.R. 339,{{Cite CanLII|source=scc|year=2004|num=13}} is a landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case that establishes the bounds of fair dealing in [[Canadian copyright law]]. The [[Law Society of Upper Canada]] was sued for [[copyright infringement]] for providing photocopy services to researchers. The Court unanimously held that the Law Society's practice fell within the bounds of fair dealing.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main article|Fair dealing in United Kingdom law}}
Within the United Kingdom, fair dealing is a legal doctrine that provides an exception to the nation's copyright law in cases where the copyright infringement is for the purposes of non-commercial research or study, criticism or review, or for the reporting of current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exceptions to copyright|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exceptions-to-copyright|website=Gov.UK|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy arguments about fair use ==
A balanced copyright law provides an economic benefit to many high-tech businesses such as search engines and software developers. Fair use is also crucial to non-technology industries such as insurance, legal services, and newspaper publishers.&lt;ref name=PCOLCcia/&gt;

On September 12, 2007, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA),&lt;ref name=PCOLCcia/&gt; a group representing companies including [[Google]] Inc., [[Microsoft]] Inc.,&lt;ref name=PCOLWallstreet&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118593806790484425|title=Google, Others Contest Copyright Warnings|first1=Sarah |last1=McBride |first2=Adam |last2=Thompson|work=Wall Street Journal|date=2007-08-01|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccianet.org/members.html|title=Computer and Communications Industry Association.

The study found that fair use dependent industries are directly responsible for more than eighteen percent of US economic growth and nearly eleven million American jobs.&lt;ref name=PCOLCcia/&gt; "As the United States economy becomes increasingly knowledge-based, the concept of fair use can no longer be discussed and legislated in the abstract. It is the very foundation of the digital age and a cornerstone of our economy," said Ed Black, President and CEO of CCIA.&lt;ref name=PCOLCcia/&gt; "Much of the unprecedented economic growth of the past ten years can actually be credited to the doctrine of fair use, as the Internet itself depends on the ability to use content in a limited and unlicensed manner."&lt;ref name=PCOLCcia/&gt;

== Fair Use Week ==
Fair Use Week is an international event that celebrates fair use and fair dealing.&lt;ref name="FUW"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://fairuseweek.org/about/|website=Fair Use Week|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Use Week was first proposed on a Fair Use Allies listserv, which was an outgrowth of the Library Code of Best Practices Capstone Event, celebrating the development and promulgation of [[Association of Research Libraries|ARL]]'s ''Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries''. While the idea was not taken up nationally,  Copyright Advisor at [[Harvard University]], launched the first ever Fair Use Week at [[Harvard University]] in February 2014, with a full week of activities celebrating fair use. The first Fair Use Week included blog posts from national and international fair use experts, live fair use panels, fair use workshops, and a Fair Use Stories Tumblr blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Use Week 2015|url=http://fairuseweek.tumblr.com/|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where people from the world of art, music, film, and academia shared stories about the importance of fair use to their community.&lt;ref name=HarvardFUW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Courtney|first1=Kyle K.|title=About Fair Use Week|url=https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/about-fair-use-week/|website=Copyright at Harvard Library|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Fair Use Week was so successful that in 2015 ARL teamed up with Courtney and helped organize the Second Annual Fair Use Week, with participation from many more institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clobridge |first1=Abby|title=Every Week Is Fair Use Week|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Every-Week-Is-Fair-Use-Week-102531.asp|website=Information Today|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARL also launched an official Fair Use Week website, which was transferred from [[Pia Hunter]], who attended the Library Code of Best Practices Capstone Event and had originally purchased the domain name fairuseweek.org.&lt;ref name=FUW /&gt;

'''Citizenship of [[Finland]]''' can be obtained on the basis of birth, [[marriage]] of parents, [[adoption]], or the place of birth. In addition, it may be acquired by application or by declaration to authorities. Finnish citizenship acquisition is based primarily on the legal principle of [[jus sanguinis]]. However, for many practical purposes, the concepts of municipal domicile and domicile in Finland are as important to the relation between the individual and the Finnish authorities as the individual's citizenship status.

==Birth==
A child acquires [[jus sanguinis]] Finnish citizenship at birth if&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2003/20030359#P9 Kansalaisuuslaki (359/2003)], §9. Retrieved 2014-05-01. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the child's mother is a Finnish citizen;
* the child's father is a Finnish citizen and the parents are married;
* the child's father is a Finnish citizen, the child is born in Finland out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], and paternity has been established;
* the child's father who died before the child was born was a Finnish citizen and who was married to the child's mother at the time of his death; or
* the child's father, who died before the birth of the child, was a Finnish citizen and the child was born in Finland out of wedlock and the father's paternity was established.

==Legitimation==
A child who is born abroad and whose father is a Finnish citizen will acquire Finnish citizenship when the parents get married. If paternity has been established, the child will acquire Finnish citizenship as of the date of the marriage contract. If paternity is established after this point, the child will acquire Finnish citizenship as of the date on which paternity is established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2003/20030359#L2P11 Kansalaisuuslaki (359/2003)], sectiin 11. Finlex database, the national database of Finnish laws. {{Fi}}. Retrieved 2015-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
A foreign adopted child under 12 years of age will automatically acquire Finnish citizenship if at least one of the adoptive parents is a Finnish citizen and if the adoption is recognised as valid in Finland. A local register office will enter the child's Finnish citizenship in the population register. 

If the adoption decision was made prior to June 1, 2003, an adopted child under 12 years of age may apply for Finnish citizenship by declaration.  Application must be made on or before 31 May 2008.

An adopted child who is over 12 years old may apply for Finnish citizenship by declaration.

==Naturalisation as a Finnish citizen==
[[File:Finnish passport 2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A specimen of the Finnish passport]]
Finnish citizenship can be acquired by ''application'' or ''declaration'':

===Citizenship by application===
A foreigner may be granted Finnish citizenship upon meeting certain requirements, including:

* five years continuous residence; or
* a total of seven years residence since age 15, with the last two years residence continuous; and
* knowledge of at least one of Finnish, Swedish or Finnish sign language.

For those married to or in a registered partnership with a Finnish citizen for more than three years, the residence requirement is reduced to :


* four years continuous residence, or
* six years total residence since age 15 (with the last two years continuous)
* knowledge of at least one of Finnish, Swedish or Finnish sign language


These reduced residence requirements also apply to recognised refugees and stateless persons.

Former Finnish citizens and citizens of other Nordic countries are only required to have two years continuous residence in Finland.

The authorities have the right to refuse an application for citizenship by application even if the requirements are met.

===Citizenship by declaration===
Declaration is a simpler method of acquiring Finnish citizenship.   If the legal requirements are met it must be granted.

Categories of persons eligible for citizenship by declaration include:

====Long-resident young persons====
Persons aged between 18-23 may acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration if:

* resident in Finland for a total of 10 years (6 years if born in Finland); and
* ''domiciled'' in Finland; and
* not sentenced to imprisonment

Residence in another Nordic country before the age of 16 counts as residence in Finland (up to a maximum of 5 years). For males in the age group 18–23 years, getting the citizenship means becoming liable for [[Military service#Finland|conscription]].

====Citizens of Nordic countries====
Citizens of other Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Iceland and Norway) who are former Finnish citizens and have held a Nordic country citizenship continuously since then may acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration if ''domiciled'' in Finland.  There is no minimum residence requirement.

Otherwise the requirements are:

* the person is not a ''naturalised'' citizen of that country; and
* six years residence in Finland

A citizen of a Nordic country not eligible for citizenship by declaration may still be eligible for citizenship by application.

== Ålandic provincial right of domicile ==
People from the autonomous Finnish province of [[Åland]], have provincial (Ålandic) right of domicile in addition to their national ([[Finland|Finnish]]) citizenship. The right of domicile is called ''hembygdsrätt'' (kotiseutuoikeus in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and it gives Ålanders the right to buy and own real estate, abstain from [[Conscription in Finland|national service]], vote for and be elected to the [[Parliament of Åland|''Lagting'']] and set up a business on Åland. Ordinary Finns without a right of domicile have none of these rights in Åland. 

Ordinary Finns can get Ålandic right of domicile after living on the islands for five years and proving their satisfactory knowledge of Swedish. Ålanders lose their right of domicile after living outside Åland for five years, or on forfeiting their Finnish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regeringen.ax/.composer/upload/modules/lagar/lagsamling-a-2.pdf ''Landskapslagen om hembygdsrätt''] (ÅFS 2/1993). Retrieved on 22 March 2007.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1991/19911144 Ahvenanmaan itsehallintolaki] (1144/1991). Retrieved 5/22/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lagtinget.aland.fi/eng/act.html#anchor263814] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027045222/http://www.lagtinget.aland.fi/eng/act.html |date=27 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-Finns can obtain Ålandic right of domicile when obtaining Finnish citizenship, if they fulfill the requirements for the right of domicile.

== Municipal domicile and registration ==
The Finnish law grants several rights, e.g. social services, municipal franchise and education on the basis of [[municipalities of Finland|municipal]] domicile ({{lang-fi|kotikunta}}). The concept of municipal domicile is based on residency and is tied to citizenship only weakly. However, the naturalization legislation refers several times to the municipal domicile as a requirement for naturalization.

===Registration of the municipal domicile ===
As the main rule, the person is domiciled in their place of residence. A new-born is domiciled in the municipality of its mother. If a person has several residences, the place which he has closest ties to is their domicile. The ties may be related to work, family or other similar arrangements. The register authorities will determine the domicile of the person whose opinion cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (2/01/1994)] 2 §. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who leaves the country to stay abroad for more than a year, loses municipal domicile immediately. However, exceptions are made for persons who retain close ties to Finland or work as [[diplomat]]s, [[missionary|missionaries]] or aid workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (201/1994)] 5 §]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnish and [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member state citizens are domiciled in their places of residence immediately if they move into the country from abroad. Aliens are domiciled if they have a permanent residence permission or if they are family members of a person domiciled in Finland. Other aliens are domiciled if they have a temporary residence permit for at least a year and the reasons for their stay point that they might remain in the country. Any family members of a person with a municipal domicile are also domiciled in the municipality if they live together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (201/1994)] 4 §]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; All foreigners with a municipal domicile are also required to register into the national population database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19930507 Väestötietolaki (507/1993) 9–10§]. Retrieved 11-2-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When moving, the person's domicile will not change if the move has been caused by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (201/1994)] 3 §]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*temporary work, study, illness or other similar reason that will not last for more than a year
*care in a hospital, sanatorium, nursing home, asylum etc.
*professional seafaring
*detention in a penitentiary
*membership of the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] or membership of the [[European Parliament]]
*service as a [[conscription in Finland|conscript]]

Any person who is domiciled in Finland is obliged to inform the registry office on moving permanently or temporarily within seven days from the move. Also persons who move from a residence without having any new address are required to report the change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (201/1994)] 7 §]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to report moves is punishable by 50 euro administrative fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940201 Kotikuntalaki (201/1994)] 14 §]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of municipal domicile===
The main political right tied to municipal domicile is the municipal suffrage. Finnish and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] citizens have the municipal voting right and eligibility in the municipality where they had domicile 51 days prior to election day. Other foreigners have the municipal suffrage if they have had Finnish municipal domicile for the last two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950365 Kuntalaki (365/1995) 26§.] Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administratively, the municipal domicile is one of the most important factors in determining the jurisdiction of different state authorities over the person.

The municipal and church tax are the most important duties based on the municipal domicile. During the calendar year, the person pays tax to the municipality where they were domiciled on 31 December of the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1992/19921535 Tuloverolaki (1535/1992) 130§] Retrieved 2-112009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person belongs to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] or to the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], they belong to the parish of their domicile and pay church tax to the domicile parish of the 31 December of the preceding year. Another duty tied to the municipal domicile is the duty to accept a position in municipal board, if the municipal council elects the person to a board.

Municipal domicile grants also other than political rights. Most social and health services are provided by the municipalities to their residents, while persons not domiciled in the municipality enjoy much less protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1982/19820710 Sosiaalipalvelulaki (710/1982)] Retrieved 11-2-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1972/19720066 Kansanterveyslaki (66/1972) 14§].

Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the social and health services, the municipal domicile may yield other, somewhat less important rights relating to natural resources. In state-owned lake water area (in major lakes) and on state-owned lake islands, all persons domiciled in municipalities by the lake are empowered to hunt. The same applies to state-owned land in Northern Finland, where persons domiciled there may hunt in the state-owned forests of their home municipality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19930615 Metsästyslaki (615/1993) 7–8 §§]. Retrieved 2-11-2009 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Northern peculiarity of municipal domicile is reindeer ownership, which is restricted to [[European Economic Area|EEA]] citizens domiciled in the municipalities of the [[reindeer]] herding region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 Poronhoitolaki 4§.] Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domicile in Finland===
With regard to the social protections provided by the Finnish state instead of municipalities, the basis for eligibility for benefits and grants is domicile in Finland ({{lang-fi|Suomessa asuminen}}). Among the social protections meant here are e.g. maternity and paternity leave pay, child grant, unemployment benefits and other forms of [[social insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1993/19931573 Laki asumiseen perustuvan sosiaaliturvalainsäädännön soveltamisesta (1573/1993) 1§]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although similarly worded, the definition used is not exactly the same as for the determination of municipal domicile. In particular, the municipal domicile alone does not make an alien or citizen domiciled in Finland. The domicile in Finland requires factual residence and home in Finland, as well as permanent and continued physical presence in the country. This applies to foreigners and citizens alike. Persons moving into Finland ''may'' be considered domiciled in Finland immediately if they actually intend to remain in the country. This means that not even a Finnish citizen moving into Finland is guaranteed the state social benefits immediately after entry, unless they can show that they intend to remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1993/19931573 Laki asumiseen perustuvan sosiaaliturvalainsäädännön soveltamisesta (1573/1993) 3§]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, the concept of "domicile in Finland" allows for more consideration than the mechanistic definition municipal domicile. Students, missionaries, scholars, scientists, aid workers, officials of international organizations and employees of Finnish companies, as well as their family members may retain their domicile in Finland indefinitely even if they lose their municipal domicile. However, the [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|Kela]], which determines the domicile status, has a wide leeway to judge the circumstances of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1993/19931573 Laki asumiseen perustuvan sosiaaliturvalainsäädännön soveltamisesta (1573/1993) 5–8§]. Retrieved 2-11-2009. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A foreigner with both municipal domicile and a domicile in Finland enjoys all social and health services provided to Finnish citizens.

==Loss of Finnish citizenship==
Although dual citizenship is permitted, a Finnish citizen who is a citizen of another country will lose Finnish citizenship at age 22 unless he or she has sufficiently close ties with Finland.

Persons with close ties include those:

* born in Finland and domiciled there on their 22nd birthday
* with a total of seven years residence in Finland or another Nordic country
* to whom a Finnish passport was issued between the ages of 18 and 21
* who have completed military or non-military service in Finland between the ages of 18 and 21
* who have submitted a declaration of retention of Finnish citizenship between the ages of 18 and 21 to the appropriate authorities in Finland or to a Finland diplomatic mission overseas. Renunciation of foreign citizenship is not required.

Finnish citizens may also lose citizenship if they formally petition for permission to renounce it. To prevent [[statelessness]], Finnish citizenship may be renounced only if the person proves that they are a citizen of another state. 

While losing Finnish citizenship is rare, the benefits of citizenship for persons residing abroad without close ties to Finland are few. A citizen without domicile in Finland and without municipal domicile has no rights to Finnish social security, to Finnish consular help in personal emergencies&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/show.asp?tunniste=HE+283/1998+Yksityiskohtaiset+perustelut&amp;base=erhe&amp;palvelin=www.eduskunta.fi&amp;f=WP Hallituksen esitys konsulipalvelulaiksi (HE 283/1998)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530064048/http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/show.asp?tunniste=HE+283%2F1998+Yksityiskohtaiset+perustelut&amp;base=erhe&amp;palvelin=www.eduskunta.fi&amp;f=WP |date=30 May 2011 }}.

The most important remaining rights are the absolute right to return to Finland, to vote in national elections, to have a Finnish passport, to work in the European Union without the working visa requirements faced by non-European Union citizens, and to enroll in Scandinavian universities as a European Union citizen (waiving university fees). In addition, all Finnish citizens have the right to receive consular protection from Finnish foreign missions in case of a major crisis in the host country or in case of arrest or incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/show.asp?tunniste=HE+283/1998+Yksityiskohtaiset+perustelut&amp;base=erhe&amp;palvelin=www.eduskunta.fi&amp;f=WP Hallituksen esitys konsulipalvelulaiksi (HE 283/1998)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530064048/http://217.71.145.20/TRIPviewer/show.asp?tunniste=HE+283%2F1998+Yksityiskohtaiset+perustelut&amp;base=erhe&amp;palvelin=www.eduskunta.fi&amp;f=WP |date=30 May 2011 }}.

==Dual citizenship==
With effect from 1 June 2003, a Finnish citizen acquiring a foreign citizenship does not lose Finnish citizenship.

Former Finnish citizens who lost Finnish citizenship prior to this date (upon naturalisation in another country) may re-acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration.  Children of former Finnish citizens may also acquire Finnish citizenship by declaration. The deadline for submission of applications was 31 May 2008.

As of July 2005, over 5000 people had acquired or resumed Finnish citizenship under this new provision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvi.fi/netcomm/content.asp?article=2672&amp;frontpage=true Maahanmuuttovirasto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030004637/http://www.uvi.fi/netcomm/content.asp?article=2672&amp;frontpage=true |date=30 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the law also mean that foreigners seeking naturalisation as a Finnish citizen do not need to renounce their former citizenship.   They may retain it if the law of the other country permits them to do so.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Finland forms part of the [[European Union]], Finnish citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Finland (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/finland/index_en.htm | title=Finland | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Finnish embassy, Finnish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

==Travel freedom of Finnish citizens==

{{Main|Visa requirements for Finnish citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Finnish citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Finnish citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Finnish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Finland]]. In 2015, Finnish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the Finnish passport 2nd in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

The Finnish nationality is ranked eighth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Innovation and Its Discontents: How Our Broken Patent System Is Endangering Innovation and Progress, and What To Do About It''''' is a [[book]] ({{ISBN|0-691-11725-X}}) by [[Adam B. Jaffe]] and [[Josh Lerner]]. [[Princeton University Press]] published the book in 2004.

The authors of the book outline changes made to the [[patent]] system in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s which they say has led to a situation in which patents have become extremely powerful economic weapons, and are being issued irresponsibly and at an unreasonable rate.

The end result, the authors claim, is that American innovation is being stifled unintentionally as a result of a few simple bureaucratic changes (centralizing the [[appellate court|appeal]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] and making patent application fees the primary source of revenue for the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]). The authors argue that the establishment of the CAFC has led to judicial "tunnel vision"; because the judges of the CAFC are only asked to rule on matters of intellectual property, they come to value the current patent system too highly, and tend to side disproportionately with patent-holders.

The authors frame the current debate about patents in historical terms, citing both times when patents were freely granted as royal favors, such as the [[Elizabethan era]] in England, as well as times when patents were impossible to obtain, or in the case of the Netherlands in the 1830s, completely abolished.

The '''International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles''' or '''Safe Harbour Privacy Principles''' were principles developed between 1998 and 2000 in order to prevent private organizations within the [[European Union]] or United States which store customer data from accidentally disclosing or losing [[personal information]]. They were overturned on October 6, 2015 by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ), which enabled some US companies to comply with [[privacy law]]s protecting [[European Union]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizens.&lt;ref name="inval" /&gt; US companies storing customer data could self-certify that they adhered to 7 principles, to comply with the EU [[Data Protection Directive]] and with Swiss requirements. The [[US Department of Commerce]] developed privacy frameworks in conjunction with both the European Union and the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]] of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/index.asp Welcome to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor] accessed 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a series of decisions on the adequacy of the protection of [[personal data]] transferred to other countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm Commission decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in third countries] accessed 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Commission]] made a decision in 2000 that the United States' principles did comply with the EU Directive&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm 2000/520/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce (notified under document number C(2000) 2441)], accessed 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; - the so-called '''"Safe Harbour decision"'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/press-material/press-release/art29_press_material/2016/20160726_wp29_wp_statement_eu_us_privacy_shield_en.pdf statement of the Data Protection Working Party on the EU US Privacy Shield], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a customer complained that his [[Facebook]] data were insufficiently protected, the ECJ declared in October 2015 that the Safe Harbour Decision was invalid, leading to further talks being held by the Commission with the US authorities towards "a renewed and sound framework for transatlantic data flows".&lt;ref&gt;Vera Jourova, "Commissioner Jourová's remarks on Safe Harbour EU Court of Justice judgement before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE)", 26 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission and the United States agreed to establish a new framework for transatlantic data flows on 2 February 2016, known as the "[[EU-US Privacy Shield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-2 The new transatlantic data “Privacy Shield”], accessed 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background history==
In 1980, the [[OECD]] issued recommendations for protection of [[personal data]] in the form of seven principles. These were non-binding and in 1995, the [[European Union]] (EU) enacted a more binding form of governance, i.e. legislation, to protect personal [[data privacy]] in the form of the [[Data Protection Directive]].&lt;ref name=eu95&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament] and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Data Protection Directive, companies operating in the European Union are not permitted to send personal data to "third countries" outside the [[European Economic Area]], unless they guarantee adequate levels of protection, "the data subject himself agrees to the transfer" or "if [[Binding corporate rules]] or Standard Contractual Clauses have been authorised."&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (15 June 2001)[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32001D0497 Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries under Directive 95/46/EC15 June 2001], Official Journal L 181 of 04.07.2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter means that privacy protection can be at an organizational level, where a multinational organization produces and documents its internal controls on personal data or they can be at the level of a country if its laws are considered to offer protection equal to the EU.

The Safe Harbour Privacy Principles were developed between 1998 and 2000. They were designed to prevent private organizations within the European Union or United States which store customer data from accidentally disclosing or losing personal information. US companies could opt into a program and be certified if they adhered to seven principles and 15 frequently asked questions and answers per the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework Documents |url=http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018493.asp |publisher=US government |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150405033356/http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018493.asp |archivedate=April 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2000, the [[European Commission]] (EC) decided that US companies complying with the principles and registering their certification that they met the EU requirements, the so-called "safe harbour scheme", were allowed to transfer data from the EU to the US. This is referred to as the '''Safe Harbour Decision'''.&lt;ref name=decision&gt;European Court of Justice [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML 2000/520/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce (notified under document number C(2000) 2441) (Text with EEA relevance.) 25 August 2000, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EC's Safe Harbour Decision, because "legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as '''compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life'''" (boldened in original text).&lt;ref name=inval&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=Judgment in Case C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner: The Court of Justice declares that the Commission’s US Safe Harbour Decision is invalid |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_180250/|agency=Court of Justice of the European Union|date=6 October 2015|pages=3|access-date=7 October 2015|format=press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

According to the European Commission, the [[EU–US Privacy Shield|EU-US Privacy Shield]] agreed on 2 February 2016 "reflects the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its ruling on 6 October 2015, which declared the old Safe Harbour framework invalid. The new arrangement will provide stronger obligations on companies in the U.S. to protect the personal data of Europeans and stronger monitoring and enforcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce and [[Federal Trade Commission]], including through increased cooperation with European Data Protection Authorities. The new arrangement includes commitments by the U.S. that possibilities under U.S. law for public authorities to access personal data transferred under the new arrangement will be subject to clear conditions, limitations and oversight, preventing generalised access. Europeans will have the possibility to raise any enquiry or complaint in this context with a dedicated new Ombudsperson".&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-216_en.htm EU Commission and United States agree on new framework for transatlantic data flows: EU-US Privacy Shield], issued 2 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
The seven principles from 2000 are:&lt;ref name=decision/&gt;
* '''Notice''' - Individuals must be informed that their data is being collected and how it will be used.The organization must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints.
* '''Choice''' - Individuals must have the option to opt out of the collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties.
* '''Onward Transfer''' - Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other organizations that follow adequate data protection principles.
* '''Security''' - Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information.
* '''Data Integrity''' - Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose it was collected.
* '''Access''' - Individuals must be able to access information held about them, and correct or delete it, if it is inaccurate.
* '''Enforcement''' - There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.

== Scope, certification and enforcement==
Only U.S. organizations regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] or the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] may participate in this voluntary program. This excludes many financial institutions (such as banks, investment houses, credit unions, and [[savings &amp; Loans Credit Union|savings &amp; loans institutions]]), telecommunication [[common carriers]], including [[internet service provider]]s, labor associations, non-profit organizations, [[agricultural co-operatives]], and [[meat processor]]s, journalists and most insurances.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ Welcome to the U.S.-EU &amp; U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks] 9 October 2015, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; although it may include investment banks.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018377.asp FAQ - Investment banking and audits] 29 January 2009, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After opting in, an organization must have appropriate employee training and an effective dispute mechanism in place, and self re-certify every 12 months in writing that it agrees to adhere to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework's principles, including notice, choice, access, and enforcement.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018476.asp U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Overview], 18 December 2013, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It can either perform a self-assessment to verify that it complies with the principles, or hire a third-party to perform the assessment. Companies pay an annual $100 fee for registration except for first time registration ($200).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eg_main_020436.asp Safe Harbor Fees] 9 April 2015, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government does not regulate Safe Harbor, which is self-regulated through its private sector members and the dispute resolution entities they pick. The Federal Trade Commission "manages" the system under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Whittaker [http://www.zdnet.com/article/safe-harbor-why-eu-data-needs-protecting-from-us-law/ Safe Harbor: Why EU data needs 'protecting' from US law Failure] Zdnet, 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; to comply with the commitments can be penalized under the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] by administrative orders and civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for violations. If an organization fails to comply with the framework it must promptly notify the Department of Commerce, or else it can be prosecuted under the 'False Statements Act'.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

In [[FTC v. Balls of Kryptonite|a 2011 case]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] obtained a [[consent decree]] from a California-based online retailer that had sold exclusively to customers in the [[United Kingdom]]. Among its many alleged deceptive practices was representing itself as having self-certified under Safe Harbour when in fact it had not. It was barred from doing so in the future.&lt;ref name="FTC v. Balls of Kryptonite"&gt;{{cite press release |author=Staff writer|title=FTC Settlement Bans Online U.S. Electronics Retailer from Deceiving Consumers with Foreign Website Names |url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/06/ftc-settlement-bans-online-us-electronics-retailer-deceiving |location=Washington|agency=Federal Trade Commission|date=June 9, 2011 |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and evaluation ==
===EU evaluations===
The EU-US Safe Harbour Principles 'self certification scheme' has been criticised in regard to their compliance and enforcement in three external EU evaluations:

* A 2002 review by the European Union found "a substantial number of organisations that have self-certified adherence to the Safe Harbour do not seem to be observing the expected degree of [[transparency (social)|transparency]] as regards their overall commitment or as regards the contents of their privacy policies" and that "not all [[dispute resolution]] mechanisms have indicated publicly their intention to enforce Safe Harbour rules and not all have in place privacy practices applicable to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2002) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060724174359/http://www.ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2002-196/sec-2002-196_en.pdf The application of Commission Decision on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles] 11 pages, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004 review by the European Union:&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060724173657/http://www.ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf The implementation of Commission Decision on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles] 11 pages, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, an Australian consulting company named Galexia issued a scathing review, finding "the ability of the US to protect privacy through [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]], backed by claimed regulator oversight was questionable'. They documented basic claims as incorrect where only 1109 out of 1597 recorded organisations listed by the [[US Department of Commerce]] (DOC) on 17 October 2008 remained in the database after doubles, triples and ‘not current’ organisations were removed. Only 348 organisations met even the most basic requirements for compliance. Of these, only 54 extended their Safe Harbor membership to all data categories (manual, offline, online, human resources). 206 organisations falsely claimed to be members for years, yet there was no indication that they were subject of any US enforcement. Reviewers criticized the DOC's 'Safe Harbor Certification Mark' offered to companies to use as a "visual manifestation of the organization when it self-certifies that it will comply" as misleading, because it does not carry the words "self certify" on it. Only 900 organizations provided a link to their [[privacy policy|privacy policies]], for 421 it was unavailable. Numerous policies were only 1-3 sentences long, containing "virtually no information". Many entries appeared to confuse privacy compliance with security compliance and showed a "lack of understanding about the Safe Harbor program". The companies' listing of their dispute resolution providers was confusing, and problems regarding independence and affordability were noted. Many organisations did not spell out that they would cooperate with or explain to their customers that they could choose the dispute resolution panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities.
:Galexia recommended the EU to re-negotiate the Safe Harbor arrangement, provide warnings to EU consumers and consider to comprehensively review all list entries. They recommended to the US to investigate the hundreds of organisations making [[false claim]]s, revising its statements about the number of participants, to abandon the use of the Safe Harbor Certification Mark, to investigate the unauthorised and misleading use of its Departmental logo and automatically suspend an organisation’s membership if they failed to renew their Safe Harbor certification.&lt;ref name=galexia&gt;Chris Connolly (Galexia) [http://www.galexia.com/public/research/assets/safe_harbor_fact_or_fiction_2008/ US Safe Harbor - Fact or Fiction?] ''Privacy Laws and Business International'', issue 96, December 2008, published on Galexia.com, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriot Act's reach===
In June 2011, [[Microsoft|Microsoft U.K.'s]] managing director [[Gordon Frazer]] said that "[[cloud database|cloud data]], regardless of where it is in the world, is not protected against the [[Patriot Act]]."&lt;ref&gt;Zack Whittaker, [http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/ Microsoft admits Patriot Act can access EU-based cloud data] Zdnet.com, June 28, 2011, retrieved 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands promptly ruled out U.S. cloud suppliers from Dutch government contracts, and even considered a ban on Microsoft- and Google- provided cloud contracts. A Dutch subsidiary of the U.S. based [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) runs the [[electronic health records]] of the Dutch national health service system and warned, that unless CSC could assure it was not subject to the Patriot Act, it would end the contract.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;

One year later in 2012, a legal research paper supported the notion that the Patriot Act allowed U.S. law enforcement to bypass European privacy laws.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;Zack Whittaker, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/patriot-act-can-obtain-data-in-europe-researchers-say/ Patriot Act can "obtain" data in Europe, researchers say] CBS News December 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizen complaint about Facebook data safety===
In October 2015, the ECJ responded to a referral from the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court of Ireland]] in relation to a complaint from [[Austria]]n citizen [[Max Schrems|Maximillian Schrems]] regarding [[Facebook|Facebook's]] processing of his personal data from its Irish subsidiary to servers in the US. Schrems complained that "in the light of the revelations made in 2013 by [[Edward Snowden]] concerning the activities of the [[United States Intelligence Community|United States intelligence services]] (in particular the [[National Security Agency]] (‘the NSA’)), the law and practice of the United States do not offer sufficient protection against surveillance by the public authorities." The ECJ held the Safe Harbour Principles to be invalid, as they did not require ''all'' organizations entitled to work with EU privacy-related data to comply with it, thus providing insufficient guarantees. US federal government agencies could use personal data under US law, but were not required to opt in. The court held that companies opting in were "bound to disregard, without limitation, the protective rules laid down by that scheme where they conflict with national security, public interest and law enforcement requirements."&lt;ref name=inval/&gt;

In accordance with the EU rules for referral to the ECJ for a '[[preliminary ruling]]', the Irish [[Data Protection Commissioner]] since then has had to "...examine Mr. Schrems' case 'with all due diligence' and [...] decide whether [...] the transfer of Facebook's European subscribers' personal data to the United States should be suspended."&lt;ref name=inval/&gt; EU regulators said that if the ECJ and United States did not negotiate a new system within three months, businesses might face action from European privacy regulators. On October 29, 2015, a new "Safe Harbour 2.0" agreement appeared close to being finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Georgina Prodhan|title=U.S. sees new EU data-sharing pact within reach|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/29/us-eu-privacy-usa-idUSKCN0SN1O620151029|accessdate=30 October 2015|work=Reuters|date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Commissioner Jourova expects the U.S. to act next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Peter Sayer |title= E.U. tells U.S. it must make next move on new Safe Harbor deal, Nov. 6, 2015|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3002477/data-privacy/eu-tells-us-it-must-make-next-move-on-new-safe-harbor-deal.html|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=Computerworld|date=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American NGOs were quick to expand on the significance of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=NGOs |title= Digital Privacy, in the U.S. and Europe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/opinion/digital-privacy-in-the-us-and-europe.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=New York Times|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement===
German [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Jan Philipp Albrecht]] and campaigner [[Max Schrems]] have criticized the new ruling, with the latter predicting that the Commission might be taking a "round-trip to Luxembourg" (where the European Court of Justice is located).&lt;ref&gt;Max Schrems: "EU US Privacy Shield" (Safe Harbor 1.1) "European Commission may be issuing a round-trip to Luxembourg" [http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf] 16:45 (2nd Feb. 2016), PDF retrieved 3rd Feb. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; EU Commissioner for Consumers, Vera Jourova, expressed confidence that a deal would be reached by the end of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jourová: The new EU-US bridge [INTERVIEW]|url = http://neurope.eu/article/jourova-sees-new-functioning-bridge-between-eu-and-us/|website = New Europe|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Europeans were demanding a mechanism for individual European citizens to lodge complaints over the use of their data, as well as a transparency scheme to assure that European citizens data did not fall into the hands of U.S intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EU-US Data Transfers Won’t Be Blocked While Privacy Shield Details Are Hammered Out, Says WP29|url = https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/eu-us-data-transfers-wont-be-blocked-while-privacy-shield-details-are-hammered-out-says-wp29/|website = TechCrunch|access-date = 2016-02-03|first = Natasha|last = Lomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Article 29 Working Party]] has taken up this demand, and stated it would hold back another month until March 2016 to decide on consequences of Commissioner Jourova's new proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Statement on the consequences of the Schrems judgement [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/press-material/press-release/art29_press_material/2016/20160203_statement_consequences_schrems_judgement_en.pdf] (2nd Feb. 2016), PDF retrieved 6th Feb. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission’s Director for Fundamental Rights Paul Nemitz stated at a conference in Brussels in January how the Commission would decide on the "adequacy" of data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =  New data transfer deal could come by Monday, 2015-01-28

The '''John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition''' (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition or EMC²) on WTO Law is a simulated hearing in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) dispute settlement system organized by the [[European Law Students' Association]] (ELSA) with the support of the WTO&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/emc2_maps_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Participating teams represent both the [[complainant]] and [[respondent]] parties to the case by presenting oral submissions in front of a panel.

The aim of the competition is to encourage further development on the subject matter in the curriculum of academic institutions and contribute to the ongoing discussion about globalisation in the context of the WTO agreements. 

The competition is named after American law professor [[John Jackson (law professor)|John Howard Jackson]], one of the chief architects of the WTO.

Rawls's theory of [[Justice as Fairness|"justice as fairness"]] recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the "[[original position]]", in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rawls was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the second of five sons of William Lee Rawls, "one of the most prominent attorneys in Baltimore",&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; and Anna Abell Stump Rawls.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix"&gt;Freeman, 2010:xix&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two of his brothers died in childhood because they had contracted fatal illnesses from him. ... In 1928, the seven-year-old Rawls contracted [[diphtheria]]. His brother Bobby, younger by 20 months, visited him in his room and was fatally infected. The next winter, Rawls contracted [[pneumonia]]. Another younger brother, Tommy, caught the illness from him and died.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rawls's biographer [[Thomas Pogge]] calls the loss of the brothers the "most important events in John's childhood".&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;

Rawls attended the [[Calvert School]] in Baltimore for six years, before transferring to the [[Kent School]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Connecticut]]. Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended [[Princeton University]] where he graduated ''summa cum laude'' and was accepted into [[The Ivy Club]] and the [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19400412-01.2.3&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN-rawls----# |title=Daily Princetonian 12 April 1940 — Princeton Periodicals |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date=1940-04-12 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his last two years at Princeton, he "became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines." He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthood&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen and Thomas Nagel, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5931573.ece "John Rawls: On My Religion"], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an "intensely religious senior thesis (''BI)''."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s student.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/rawls/|title=John Rawls|last=Wenar|first=Leif|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] in February of that year.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service, 1943–46===
During [[World War II]], Rawls served as an [[infantry]]man in the Pacific, where he toured [[New Guinea]] and was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]];&lt;ref&gt;"His first experience of combat was in New Guinea – a country which saw fighting for almost the whole duration of the Pacific campaign – where he won a Bronze Star."

Following the surrender of Japan, Rawls became part of [[General MacArthur]]'s occupying army&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt; and was promoted to sergeant.&lt;ref name="Thinker at War: Rawls"&gt;From article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  But he became disillusioned with the military when he saw the aftermath of the atomic blast in [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;"The total obliteration of physical infrastructure, and the even more horrific human toll, affected him deeply ... and the fact that the destruction had been deliberately inflicted by his own side, was profoundly unsettling.

===Academic career===
In early 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Date from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy.

He married Margaret Warfield Fox, a [[Brown University]] graduate, in 1949. They had four children, Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;

After earning his PhD from Princeton in 1950, Rawls taught there until 1952 when he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to [[Oxford University]] ([[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian [[Isaiah Berlin]] and the legal theorist [[H. L. A. Hart]]. After returning to the United States he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at [[Cornell University]]. In 1962 he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. That same year he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Allan Gibbard]], [[Onora O'Neill, Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve|Onora O'Neill]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Susan Neiman]], [[Claudia Card]], [[Thomas Pogge]], [[T. M. Scanlon]], [[Barbara Herman]], [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], [[Thomas E. Hill (academic)|Thomas E. Hill Jr.]], [[Gurcharan Das]], [[Andreas Teuber]], Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman.

===Later life===
Rawls seldom gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially born out of the deaths of two of his brothers via infections contracted from himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Ben |title=Obituary: John Rawls |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "bat-like horror of the limelight",&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;Rogers, 27.09.02&lt;/ref&gt; did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

In 1995 he suffered the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete a book titled ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'', the most complete statement of his views on international justice, and shortly before his death in November 2002 published ''Justice As Fairness: A Restatement'', a response to criticisms of ''A Theory of Justice''.

Rawls died on 24 November 2002 and is buried at the [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, their four children, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/12/john-rawls-influential-political-philosopher-dead-at-81-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical thought==
Rawls published three main books. The first, ''A Theory of Justice'', focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, ''Political Liberalism'', addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, ''The Law of Peoples'', focused on the issue of global justice.

===''A Theory of Justice''===
Rawls's ''magnum opus'' titled ''A Theory of Justice'', published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls's resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called ''justice as fairness''. By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory.

Rawls's ''A Theory of Justice'' (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the "[[original position]]". The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls's original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice.

The original position is Rawls' [[hypothetical]] scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a "[[veil of ignorance]]": each lacks knowledge, for example, of his or her gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society.

Rawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess.  First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan.  Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know.  It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which.  Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it.  Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage.  The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust – such as that blacks or women should not be allowed to hold public office – will not be proposed, in this, Rawls' original position, because it would be ''irrational'' to propose them.  The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person.  This position is expressed in the [[difference principle]], according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.

Rawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the "initial situations" of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. (Each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality s/he intends the thought experiment to generate.)&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha; Frontiers of Justice; Harvard U Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts; 2006; Kindle location 1789&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iain King]] has suggested the original position draws on Rawls' experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while "imagining away all that had gone before."&lt;ref&gt;"Deciding what this new (Japanese) society should look like was the task of the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers, and Rawls took this question – what should the rules of a society be – back to the US. But only in 1971 did he come up with a comprehensive answer. His theory starts by imagining away all that had gone before, just as the past had been erased in Hiroshima." Taken from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Magazine, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore.  Rawls's aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice.

In  setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of "[[reflective equilibrium]]", a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one's general principles and one's considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another.

====Principles of justice====
Rawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a ''personal property'' right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect,&lt;ref name=Rawls_114&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|2001|pp=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the [[classical liberalism]] of John Locke and the [[libertarianism]] of Robert Nozick).

Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the "fair worth" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nozick|first1=Robert|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Justice as Fairness#Difference Principle|difference principle]]. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.

Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the "basic structure" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of [[Gerald Cohen]]).

Rawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.

Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a "well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice".&lt;ref name=Rawls_397&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to "ideal theory", the determination of "principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances".&lt;ref name=Rawls_216&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of "partial compliance" under "nonideal theory".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===''Political Liberalism''===
In ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable – the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in ''A Theory of Justice'' can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate.

The intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of ''A Theory of Justice'', namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency.

The core of Political Liberalism, accordingly, is its insistence that, in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the "ideal of [[public reason]]". This roughly means  that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status ''as'' reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of "public reasons". For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child's development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non-public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons – their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing.

Rawls held that the duty of civility – the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons – applies within what he called the "public political forum". This forum extends from the upper reaches of government – for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society – all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.

The ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values – freedom, equality, and fairness – that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the "reasonable comprehensive doctrines" and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls's idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls's account of stability presented in ''A Theory of Justice'' is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one – Kantian – comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls's famous notion of an "[[overlapping consensus]]".

Such a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are "unreasonable", and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard – freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is – nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would – as has been noted – proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed – or at least open – to them. Rawls's concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place.

Rawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half):

# Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.
# Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

These principles are subtly modified from the principles in ''Theory''. The first principle now reads "equal claim" instead of "equal right", and he also replaces the phrase "system of basic liberties" with "a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties". The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three.

===''The Law of Peoples''===
{{Main|The Law of Peoples}}
Although there were passing comments on international affairs in ''A Theory of Justice'', it wasn't until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of ''The Law of Peoples''.  He claimed there that "well-ordered" peoples could be either "liberal" or "decent".  Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating ''decent peoples'', which differ from ''liberal peoples'', among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of [[minority group|minority]] [[faith]]s the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of "liberal" or "decent" peoples are referred to as "outlaw states", "societies burdened by unfavourable conditions" or "benevolent absolutisms" depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples.

Rawls's views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, [[Charles Beitz]] had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls's Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that states, unlike citizens, were self-sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies.  Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions.  He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a [[moral hazard]] problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.

Rawls's discussion of "non-ideal" theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in [[World War II]], as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.

==Reception and influence==
John Rawls is the subject of ''[[A Theory of Justice: The Musical!]]'', an award-nominated musical billed as an "all-singing, all-dancing romp through 2,500 years of political philosophy". The musical premiered at Oxford in 2013 and was revived for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherwell.org/news/college/2012/10/02/ppe-finalists-create-revision-musical |title=Oxford / News / Colleges / PPE finalists create revision musical |publisher=Cherwell.org |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of John Rawls have had wide-ranging influence. In the field of religious and moral education, Rawls's concepts of overlapping consensus, reasonable pluralism and hypothetical contract have been applied to consider problems of fairness and representation in public education, yielding conclusions that differ substantially from his own position on these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|last2=Robson|first2=James|date=2012|title=Doing God in a liberal democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=539–550|doi=10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|issn=0305-4985|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Dan|date=2009|title=A too liberal religious education?

'''''Kirchberg v. Feenstra''''', 450 U.S. 455 (1981), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held a Louisiana [[Head and Master law]], which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Schenken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schenken|first1=Suzanne O'Dea|last2=O'Dea|first2=Suzanne|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;pg=PA380|accessdate=28 April 2015|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874369601|pages=380–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuersten2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuersten|first=Ashlyn K.|title=Women and the Law: Leaders, Cases, and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnKGWlZG_ncC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=28 April 2015|date=2003-01-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874368789|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1974, Joan Feenstra charged her husband Harold had [[child molestation|molested]] their daughter. Harold hired an attorney, Karl Kirchberg, to defend himself against the charges, and mortgaged the Feenstras' home toward paying the cost of that attorney. Joan was not informed of this mortgage because [[Head and Master laws|Head and Master]] provisions of Louisiana law allowed him to do so without her consent or knowledge. She dropped the charges, and the couple separated. Joan did not learn about the mortgage until 1976, when Harold's attorney returned to demand payment and threatened [[foreclosure]].&lt;ref name=Schenken/&gt; She then filed a lawsuit arguing that Louisiana's laws giving sole control of marital property to the husband were unconstitutional.

The district court upheld Louisiana's law. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit overturned the district court, finding the law unconstitutionally violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]], but limited the application of their ruling to future decisions. Feenstra appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=justia&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/455/ Opinion of the Court at Justia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==

Applying [[intermediate scrutiny]] as they had in ''[[Craig v. Boren]],'' the court held that Louisiana's law lacked an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for its sex-based classification, and therefore was in violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name=Kuersten2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaman2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaman|first=Jeffrey M.|title=Constitutional Interpretation: Illusion and Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKYAKSRBQvsC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313314735|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further developments ==
In 1980, during the appeals process, Louisiana changed their laws to eliminate the Head and Master provisions.&lt;ref name=Kuersten2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Rowland L.|journal=[[ABA Journal]]|volume=67|number=5|year=1981|pages=630-|jstor=20747149|title=Supreme Court Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' ==
In 2015, during oral arguments in the [[same-sex marriage]] case ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] used the example of the Supreme Court's striking down of Louisiana's Head and Master rule in ''Kirchberg v. Feenstra'' to illustrate how "traditional" concepts of marriage had been revised over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/28/ruth-bader-ginsburg-gay-marriage-arguments-supreme-court|title=Ruth Bader Ginsburg eviscerates same-sex marriage opponents in court|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 April 2015|author= Dan Roberts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Justice Ginsburg: "We have changed our idea about marriage is the point that I made earlier. Marriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition, under the civil law tradition. Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female. That ended as a result of this Court’s decision in 1982 when Louisiana’s Head and Master Rule was struck down. And no State was allowed to have such a—such a marriage anymore. Would that be a choice that a State should be allowed to have?"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q1_7l48.pdf|title=Oral Arguments Obergefell v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31120">The following is a '''list of individuals executed by the United States military'''.

==Executions by the Army during World War II and postwar ==
The [[United States Army]] carried out 141&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/investigations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; executions over a three-year period from 1942–45 and a further six executions were conducted during the postwar period, for a known total of 147.

Of these 141 wartime executions, 70 were carried out in the [[European Theatre]], 27 in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]], 21 in the [[Southwest Pacific Area]], 19 in the continental [[United States]], two in [[Hawaii]], one in [[Guadalcanal]] and one in [[India]]; of the six postwar executions, one took place in Hawaii, one in [[Japan]], two in [[France]] and two in the [[Philippines]]. An execution was also carried out by the [[United States Air Force]] in Japan in 1950.

All executions carried out by the Army from 1942-48 were performed under the authority of the [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RAW-vol2.pdf#page=39 Articles of War of June 4, 1920], an [[Act of Congress]] which governed military justice between 1920-48.

This list includes members of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which was a part of the Army until September 18, 1947 when it became independent. Executions by the USAF after 1947 are listed separately.

With the exception of [[Eddie Slovik]], who was shot for desertion, all of these soldiers were executed for murder and/or rape. It should be noted that several of the soldiers listed as convicted and executed for murder and/or rape had also been convicted on other charges, including those of a military nature such as desertion and mutiny, plus lesser crimes that would not have been considered capital unless combined with more serious offenses which carried the death penalty.

=== Plot E ===
{{main|Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E}}
The US Army executed 98 servicemen following General Courts Martial (GCM) for murder and/or rape in the European Theatre of Operations during the [[Second World War]]. The remains of these servicemen were originally buried near the site of their executions, which took place in countries as far apart as England, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Algeria. In 1949 the remains of these men and a few others were re-interred in Plot E, a private section specifically built to hold what the Graves Registration referred to as "the dishonorable dead", since (per standard practice) all had been [[Dishonorably discharged#Dishonorable|dishonorably discharged]] from the US Army just prior to their executions.

Plot "E" is detached from the main four cemetery plots for the honored dead of World War I at the [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial]].&lt;ref name="oasource"&gt;[http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/oise-aisne-american-cemetery American Battle Monuments Commission: Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Official Website], As of June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is located across the road, and deliberately hidden from view, inside a 100' x 50' oval-shaped clearing surrounded by hedges and hidden in thick forest. Officially, Plot E does not exist: it is not mentioned on the [[American Battle Monuments Commission|ABMC]] website or in any guide pamphlets or maps. The plot is accessible only through the back door of the superintendent's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://binged.it/KmEdbX |title=Bing Maps – Driving Directions, Traffic and Road Conditions |publisher=Binged.it |date=2015-03-04 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access is difficult and visitors are not encouraged, though the section is maintained by cemetery caretakers who periodically mow the lawn area and trim the hedges. One cemetery employee described Plot E as "a house of shame" and "a perfect anti-memorial".&lt;ref name=interpreter&gt;Kaplan, Alice. ''The Interpreter''. Free Press: New York, 2005. 172–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Plot E contains nothing but 96 flat stone markers (arranged in four rows) and a single small granite cross. The white grave markers are the size of [[index card]]s and have nothing on them except sequential grave numbers engraved in black. Two bodies were later disinterred and allowed to be returned to United States for reburial.

No US flag is permitted to fly over the section, and the numbered graves literally lie with their backs turned to the main cemetery on the other side of the road.&lt;ref name=slovik&gt;Huie, William Bradford.''The Execution of Private Slovik.'' Westholme: Yardley, 1954. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the individuals buried in Plot E were not executed: Willie Hall, Joseph J. Mahoney and William N. Lucas, who all died while in military custody. 

The only person interred who was not convicted of rape and/or murder was [[Eddie Slovik]], who was executed for desertion on 31 January 1945. In 1987, President [[Ronald Reagan]] gave permission for Slovik's remains to be exhumed and returned to the United States for reburial.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|3134|Pvt Eddie Slovik – Original name: Edward Donald Slovik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huie, William Bradford.  "The Execution of Private Slovik".  Westholme Publishing, 2004.  {{ISBN|1-59416-003-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of Alex F. Miranda were exhumed and returned to the United States in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Miranda&amp;GSfn=Alex&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=9578901&amp;df=all&amp; |title=Alex F.

==Executions of German POWs during World War II==
In 1945,  the [[United States Army]] executed fourteen German [[prisoners of war]] by hanging at the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|United States Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]].  

These POWs, members of the German Armed services, had been convicted by general court-martial for the murders of fellow Germans believed by their fellow inmates to be collaborating as confidential informants with the United States military authorities. 

While the murders had been committed in 1943 and 1944, the executions were delayed until after the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of hostilities in Europe]] due to fears of German retaliation against Allied POW's.

The hangings were carried out in a warehouse elevator shaft which had been converted into a temporary gallows, and the fourteen Germans were subsequently buried in the [[Fort Leavenworth Military Prison Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interment.net/data/us/ks/leavenworth/ftleav_prison/index.htm Fort Leavenworth Military Prison cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of ten military executions have been carried out by the [[United States Army]] under the provisions of the original [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] of 5 May 1950. The first four of these executions,  those of Bernard J. O'Brien,  Chastine Beverly,  Louis M. Suttles and James L. Riggins, were carried out by military officials at the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]] near [[Lansing, Kansas]]. The remaining six executions took place in the boiler room of the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]].  Hanging and not shooting was the method employed in these ten executions.

==Executions by the United States Navy==
{{Main|USS Somers (1842)}}

The [[United States Navy]] has executed seventeen sailors and Marines for various offenses; the most famous of these were three crew members of the [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']] who were hanged for conspiracy to [[mutiny]]. 

As of 2018, no member of the Navy has been executed since October 23, 1849, when brothers John and Peter Black were simultaneously hanged at yardarm for leading a mutiny onboard the schooner ''Ewing''. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ewingmutiny.html Details of the mutiny] &lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Navy executed fourteen Japanese military personnel by hanging for [[war crimes]] on [[Guam]] after the [[Second World War]].

Information on listed military executions between 1942–1961 has been primarily derived from the following sources.  Research on these executions continues.

'''''Locke v. Davey''''', 540 U.S. 712 (2004), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision upholding the [[constitutionality]] of a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] publicly funded [[scholarship]] program which excluded students pursuing a "degree in devotional [[theology]]."  This case examined the "room.. between the two Religion Clauses", the [[Free Exercise Clause]] and the [[Establishment Clause]].

[[Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] wrote the opinion of the court, with [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] dissenting.

==Background==
Davey enrolled in [[Northwest University (United States)|Northwest College]] and received a Promise Scholarship. But when he declared a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration, his scholarship was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=586491n|title=Scholarship - God Dispute|accessdate=2010-12-02|work=CBS News|date=June 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davey was given the opportunity to continue under the scholarship but without the pastoral ministries major, but he refused.

===The scholarship===
In 1999, the state of Washington [[legislature]] created a scholarship, the Promise Scholarship.  The scholarships were for $1,125 per year and were funded through the State's general fund. They were available for qualified students who enrolled for "at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington", but excluded study in theology.  This was because the Washington State Constitution's [[Blaine Amendment]] specifically states that "No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise or instruction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.wa.gov/education/constitution/index.cfm?fa=education_constitution.display&amp;displayid=Article-01 Article I, Section 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarship was available to any graduate of a Washington public or private [[high school]]. The student must be in the top 15%, receive a score of 1,200 or higher on the [[SAT]], or score higher than a 27 on the [[ACT (examination)|American College Test]]. In addition, the student's family's income must be less than 135% of the median.

==Holding==
The [[statute]] was upheld.  The Court held that there was nothing "inherently constitutionally suspect" in the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction.  Even if there were, Washington had a "substantial state interest" in not funding "devotional degrees."

The '''Montana Stream Access Law''' says that [[angling|angler]]s, [[Canoeing|floaters]] and other recreationists in [[Montana]] have full use of most natural waterways between the high-water marks  for [[fishing]] and floating, along with [[human swimming|swimming]] and other river or stream-related activities. In 1984, the [[Montana Supreme Court]] held that the streambed of any river or stream that has the capability to be used for [[recreation]] can be accessed by the public regardless of whether the river is navigable or who owns the streambed property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg.mt.gov/bills/MCA_toc/23_2_3.htm Montana Code Annotated 2013; Title 23, Parks, Recreation, Sports and Gambling; Chapter 2, Recreation; Part 3.

The core law creating the Montana Stream Access law began with  Article IX, section 3 of the 1972 Montana Constitution, which addressed state ownership of Montana waters.  In 1984 in ''Montana Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Curran,'' the Montana Supreme Court held that "under the public trust doctrine and the 1972 Montana Constitution, any surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to streambed ownership or navigability for nonrecreational purposes."&lt;ref&gt;''Montana Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Curran,''  210 Mont. 38, 53, 682 P.2d 163, 171 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision was expanded upon in the same year by ''Mont. Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Hildreth''.&lt;ref&gt;211 Mont. 29, 35, 684 P.2d 1088, 1091 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases noted that streambed access did not imply that the public had a right to cross private lands to access streams.&lt;ref name=BRPAII&gt;''see Bitterroot Protective Ass'n v. Bitterroot Conservation Dist. (BRPA II),'' 2008 MT 377, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Following ''Curran'' and ''Hildreth'', the Montana Legislature enacted the Stream Access Law in 1985.&lt;ref name=BRPAII/&gt;  An Attorney General's opinion added [[Animal trapping|trapping]] to the list of permissible recreational uses.&lt;ref&gt;41 A.G. Op. 36 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/30/trout-rustling-gone-mad/ |title=Trout Rustling Gone Mad |publisher=Counterpunch.org |author=Holt, John |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of waters==
The law creates two classifications of waters capable of recreational use: Class I and Class II. Class I are waters which are capable of recreational use and have been declared navigable or which are capable of specific kinds of commercial activity including commercial outfitting with multi-person watercraft.  Class II waters are all other rivers and streams capbable of recreational use that are not Class I waters.&lt;ref name=StreamAccess/&gt;

'''''Murdock v. Pennsylvania''''', 319 U.S. 105 (1943), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that an ordinance requiring [[door-to-door]] salespersons ("solicitors") to purchase a license was an unconstitutional tax on religious exercise.

== Facts of the case ==
The borough of [[Jeannette, Pennsylvania]], had an ordinance that required solicitors to purchase a license from the borough. Murdock was a [[Jehovah's Witness]] who asked for contributions in exchange for books and pamphlets. The city claimed that it meant that he was selling them, and a license was required. At question was whether the licensing requirement constituted a tax on Murdock's religious exercise.

==Decision==
Justice [[William O. Douglas]] delivered the opinion of the Court. The court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional tax on the Jehovah's Witnesses' right to freely exercise their religion.

The petitioners used the distribution of pamphlets and brochures as a form of missionary activity with an evangelical purpose. Not all behavior could be allowed by claiming that it was a religious activity. The only hold that spreading one's religious beliefs or preaching the Gospel by distribution of religious literature and personal visitations is an age-old type of evangelism, with as high a claim to constitutional protection as the more orthodox types. If the activity were done to raise money, it would be commercial and could be taxed. However, in this case, although donations were sought, the activity served a religious function.

Religions are not entirely free from facing financial burdens from the government. It is one thing to impose a tax on the income or property of a preacher. It is quite another thing to exact a tax from him for the privilege of delivering a sermon. If the exercise can be taxed, the government is capable of making it prohibitively expensive and could be done only by the wealthy.

The state claimed that argument was unimportant because the tax was not expensive in practice. It is a license tax, a flat tax imposed on the exercise of a privilege recognized by the Bill of Rights. A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right protected by the federal constitution. The fact that the ordinance was imposed indiscriminately does not save it from being unconstitutional.

The case also established the preferred position doctrine, which states that {{nowrap|"[f]reedom}} of press, freedom of speech, [and] freedom of religion are in a preferred position", indicating that certain fundamental human rights have prerogative.

== Effects ==
"The privilege in question exists apart from state authority. It is guaranteed the people by the federal constitution." The state does not have the power to license or tax a right guaranteed to the people.

Although it is not technically correct to say that this decision reversed ''[[Jones v. Opelika]]'' (1942) because the Court vacated Jones in a ''per curiam'' decision handed down the same day, that was nevertheless its effect.

Murdock is a landmark decision that had the effect of allowing Jehovah's Witnesses and other religious groups that sold or gave away literature door-to-door to avoid paying licensing taxes to distribute their literature. The neutral imposition of the tax on solicitation performed by a religious group did not make it constitutionally acceptable. In addition, the Court drew a distinction between commercial activity and religious activity that involves the selling of religious literature.

== Subsequent history ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Subsequent cases such as ''[[Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock]]'', {{ussc|489|1|1989}} have emphasized that Murdock stands for the proposition that a license or occupation tax designed for commercial salesmen cannot be constitutionally imposed on religious missionaries whose principal work is preaching but also sell religious items for small sums if the tax is far from a negligible burden, and the activity is central the practice of religious faith. However, Murdock does not extend to stand for the broad proposition that a tax can never be imposed upon a missionary and that it necessarily restrains the free exercise of religion.

The '''Nationality Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (DPRK, commonly known as [[North Korea]]) governs who is a [[Citizenship in North Korea|citizen of the DPRK]], and how one may gain or lose such [[citizenship]].

==History==
Until 1963, the DPRK had no formal nationality law. This led to situations which were quite unusual from the perspective of international law, most notably the [[Soviet Union]]'s unilateral declaration that the [[Sakhalin Koreans]] were DPRK citizens&amp;mdash;in effect, one sovereign state granting its residents the citizenship of another sovereign state, presumably without any consultation.&lt;ref name="Ginsburghs1983-19"&gt;{{harvnb|Ginsburgs|1983|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DPRK's first nationality law, passed on 9 October 1963, provided quite a broad definition of DPRK citizenship.&lt;ref name="Ginsburghs1983-19"/&gt; Specifically, it stated that anyone who had citizenship of undivided [[Korea]] and had retained it up to the promulgation of the new citizenship law, as well as descendants of such persons, was thenceforth a citizen of the DPRK.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|1972|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raised the possibility that every member of the [[Korean diaspora]] would be considered a DPRK citizen, as there had previously been no clear procedure for renunciation of Korean citizenship, and few had taken such an official step. The new law also established that foreigners could gain DPRK nationality by [[naturalization|naturalisation]].&lt;ref name="Ginsburghs1983-19"/&gt; The law was amended on 23 March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://nk.joins.com/news/view.asp?aid=2691193&amp;cont=law_genera|periodical=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|title=조선민주주의인민공화국 국적법|date=2006-06-28|accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law permits [[multiple citizenship]], and specifies that nationality treaties with other countries take precedence over the text of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|1972|pp=325&amp;ndash;326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of normal [[Japan–North Korea relations|diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan]], [[Koreans in Japan]] with dual citizenship of the DPRK and Japan have had their requests to renounce [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese citizenship]] in favour of solely retaining DPRK citizenship refused by Japan's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Justice Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=[[Choson Sinbo]]|date=1999-03-25|accessdate=2011-01-17|url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/087th_issue/99032507.htm|title=Korean-Japanese Here Seek Way to Make Tokyo Gov.

However, such certificates have become more difficult to obtain {{asof|2011|lc=on}}, according to South Korean media reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/01/07/2011010700252.html|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|date=2011-01-07|accessdate=2011-01-17|title=More N.Koreans Apply for Chinese Citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">'''Nutrition analysis''' refers to the process of determining the [[nutrition]]al content of [[food]]s and food products.  The process can be performed through a variety of certified methods.

==Methods==
===Laboratory analysis===
Traditionally, food companies would send food samples to laboratories for physical testing. 
Typical analysis includes:
Moisture (water) by loss of mass at 102 °C,
Protein by analysis of total nitrogen, either by Dumas or Kjeldahl methods,
Total fat, traditionally by a solvent extraction, but often now by secondary methods such as NMR,
[[Crude ash]] (total inorganic matter) by combustion at 550C,
Estimated dietary fibre by various AOAC methods such as 985.29,
Sodium (and thereby Salt) either by flame photometry, AA or ICP-OES,
Total sugars, normally by a liquid chromatography technique, such as IC-HPAED or HPLC-RI,
Fatty acids by GC-FID,
Carbohydrates and energy values are normally calculated from these analytical values.

===Software===
Software is available as an alternative to laboratory nutrition analysis.  This software typically utilizes a database of ingredients that have previously been laboratory tested.  The user can input ingredient data by matching their ingredients to ingredients found in the database; the analysis can then be calculated.

===Online nutrition analysis===
In recent years, web-based nutrition analysis software services have become more popular. Online nutrition analysis allows users to access online databases and draw from certified ingredients to produce instant nutrition information.

===Turnkey nutrition analysis services===
Another emerging trend is the use of nutritional analysis services that do a complete analysis of any recipe by using their proprietary database.  Users provide recipes, cooking methods and serving sizes.  In turn, the service provides a complete nutritional analysis.

==Applications==
In the United States, nutrition information is required on packaged retail foods in the form of nutrition facts panels as a result of [[food labeling regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/default.htm Food Labeling and Nutrition Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many restaurants have begun posting nutrition information as a result of both customer demand and menu-labeling laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/business/mcdonalds-to-start-posting-calorie-counts.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition facts label===
{{main|Nutrition facts label}}

===Menu-labeling===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law March 23, 2010, includes a provision that creates a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for food service establishments.

The nutrition-disclosure provision requires chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations to provide specific nutrition labeling information. Those establishments must post calories on menus, menu boards and drive-thru boards. Buffets, salad bars and other self-service items are also included and will be required to provide caloric information adjacent to the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/NutritionPolicy/Pages/MenuLabeling.aspx Issue Update:Menu Labeling ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently many state and local menu-labeling laws have been passed requiring restaurants to post nutrition information on menus and menu boards, or have it readily available upon customer request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/menulabeling/ Center for Science in the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants have had to perform nutrition analysis in order to generate nutrition information and conform to these laws. More recently national legislation has been introduced that would set a national standard for menu labeling, the most popular of which is the [[LEAN act]].

'''The Parliamentary Elections (Returns) Act 1695''' (7 &amp; 8 Will 3 c 7) was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]].

The provisions as to procuring returns in sections 3 and 4 ceased to have effect by virtue of section 74(5) of, and Schedule 11 to, the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].

The whole Act except section 5 was, and in section 5 the words "and for the more easy and better proof of any such false or double return" and the words from "and that the party" to the end of the section were, repealed by section 80(7) of, and Schedule 13 to, the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].

The whole Act was repealed by section 175(1) of, and Schedule 9 to, the [[Representation of the People Act 1949]].

The whole Act was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/act/pub/0019/sec0003.html section 3] of, and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/act/pub/0019/sched1.html Schedule 1] to, the [[Electoral Act 1963]].

[[Quiet title]] is used to refer to the new [[owner]]'s peaceable possession.  [[Property title]], or [[ownership]], also includes [[Possession (law)|possession]], but is a greater [[property]] [[Rights|right]] than the latter.  Therefore, peaceable possession may also refer to a [[leasehold estate|tenant]]'s, or [[lessee]]'s, warranty of [[Quiet enjoyment]], or require such for a quiet title action. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/peaceable-possession?cat=biz-fin Answers.com web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phase change material''' ('''PCM''') is a substance with a high [[heat of fusion]] which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as [[latent heat]] storage (LHS) units.

==Characteristics and classification==
Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid→solid, solid→liquid, solid→gas and liquid→gas phase changes. However, only solid→liquid and liquid→solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid→gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.

Initially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like [[sensible heat]] storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat.

** Change of volume is very high
** Super cooling is major problem in solid–liquid transition
** Nucleating agents are needed and they often become inoperative after repeated cycling[[File:InfiniteR Energy Sheet.png|alt=Infinite R Energy Sheet|thumb|Example eutectic salt hydrate PCM with nucleation &amp; gelling agents for long term thermal stability and thermoplastic foil macro-encapsulation physical durability.

=== Inorganic Eutectics ===
c-inorganic, inorganic-inorganic compounds
* Advantages
** Some inorganic eutectics have sharp melting point similar to pure substance.
** Volumetric storage density is slightly above organic compounds.
** Extra water principle can be used to avoid phase change degradation, involving dissolving the anhydrous salt during melting to result in a thickening of the liquid material so that it melts to a gel form; however, this can cause huge reduction in latent heat.
* Disadvantages
** They still have the same disadvantages as inorganic PCMs, such as reduced thermal performance upon cycling, corrosivity, high volume change, and high supercooling.
** Sharp crystals may form when the salt hydrate PCM solidifies, potentially causing leaks in cases of macro-encapsulation.
** Limited data is available on thermo-physical properties as the use of these materials is limited compared to organic PCMs.

=== Hygroscopic materials ===

Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:
*Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH&lt;0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat.
*Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH&gt;0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools).

Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2&amp;nbsp;°C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation, earth/clay render finishes,.

=== Solid-solid PCM materials ===

A specialised group of PCMs that undergo a solid/solid phase transition with the associated absorption and release of large amounts of heat. These materials change their crystalline structure from one lattice configuration to another at a fixed and well-defined temperature, and the transformation can involve latent heats comparable to the most effective solid/liquid PCMs. Such materials are useful because, unlike solid/liquid PCMs, they do not require nucleation to prevent supercooling. Additionally, because it is a solid/solid phase change, there is no visible change in the appearance of the PCM, and there are no problems associated with handling liquids, e.g. containment, potential leakage, etc. Currently the temperature range of solid-solid PCM solutions spans from -50&amp;nbsp;°C (-58&amp;nbsp;°F) up to +175&amp;nbsp;°C (347&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phasechange.com/products/phasestor/|title=Phase Change Energy Solutions PhaseStor|last=|first=|date=|website=Phase Change Energy Solutions|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==

Thermodynamic properties. The phase change material should possess:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.05.010|title=Phase change material-based building architecture for thermal management in residential and commercial establishments|year=2008|last1=Pasupathy|first1=A|last2=Velraj|first2=R|last3=Seeniraj|first3=R|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=12|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melting temperature in the desired [[operating temperature]] range
* High latent heat of fusion per unit volume
* High specific heat, high density and high thermal conductivity
* Small volume changes on phase transformation and small vapor pressure at operating temperatures to reduce the containment problem
* Congruent melting
* Kinetic properties
* High nucleation rate to avoid supercooling of the liquid phase
* High rate of crystal growth, so that the system can meet demands of heat recovery from the storage system
* Chemical properties
* Chemical stability
* Complete reversible freeze/melt cycle
* No degradation after a large number of freeze/melt cycle
* Non-corrosiveness, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive materials

==Technology, development and encapsulation==

The most commonly used PCMs are salt [[hydrate]]s&lt;!-- Only for housing applications? --&gt;, [[fatty acid]]s and [[ester]]s, and various [[Alkane|paraffin]]s (such as [[octadecane]]). Recently also [[ionic liquid]]s were investigated as novel PCMs.

As most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.

They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the [[thermal storage]] applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3650.html Frederik Tudor the Ice King] on ice transport during the 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; for rail&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Trevithick]]'s steam locomotive ran in 1804&lt;/ref&gt; and road applications&lt;ref&gt;[[Amédée Bollée]] created [[steam car]]s beginning at 1873&lt;/ref&gt; and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.

Unlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water [[chiller]] both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a [[cooling tower]] or dry cooler for charging the TES system.

The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide-ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection, i.e. cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.

Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2005.10.002|title=PCM thermal storage in buildings: A state of art|year=2007|last1=Tyagi|first1=Vineet Veer|last2=Buddhi|first2=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1146–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; naturally become the obvious storage choice.

*Encapsulation of PCMs
**Macro-encapsulation: Early development of macro-encapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor [[thermal conductivity]] of most PCMs. PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer.
**Micro-encapsulation: [[Micro-encapsulation]] on the other hand showed no such problem. It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials, such as [[concrete]], easily and economically. Micro-encapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system. By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating, the particles can be [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] within a continuous phase such as water. This system can be considered a '''phase change [[slurry]]''' ('''PCS''').
**Molecular-encapsulation is another technology, developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. It allows storage capacity up to 515&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/[[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] for a 5&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] board (103&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Molecular-encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.

As phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is [[hygroscopic]]). Packaging must also resist leakage and [[corrosion]]. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include [[stainless steel]], [[polypropylene]] and [[polyolefin]].

==Thermal composites==

Thermal-composites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper-mesh immersed in a paraffin-wax. The copper-mesh within parraffin-wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal-composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.

Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites. In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper-mesh) into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.

Solid composites such as fibre-glass or kevlar-pre-preg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined, but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions.
They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.

* [[Thermal energy storage]]
* Solar cooking
* [[Cold Energy Battery]]
* [[HVAC|Conditioning of buildings]], such as 'ice-storage'
* Cooling of heat and electrical engines
* Cooling: food, beverages, coffee, wine, milk products, green houses
* Medical applications: transportation of blood, operating tables, hot-cold therapies, treatment of [[birth asphyxia]]&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; 
* Human body cooling under bulky clothing or costumes.
* [[Waste heat]] recovery
* [[Off-peak]] power utilization: Heating hot water and Cooling
* [[Heat pump]] systems
* Passive storage in [[bioclimatic building]]/architecture ([[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]], paraffin)
* Smoothing [[exothermic]] temperature peaks in chemical reactions
* [[Solar power]] plants
* [[Spacecraft]] thermal systems
* [[Thermal comfort]] in vehicles
* [[Thermal protection]] of electronic devices
* Thermal protection of food: transport, hotel trade, ice-cream, etc.
* Textiles used in clothing
* [[Computer cooling]]
* Turbine Inlet Chilling with thermal energy storage
* Telecom shelters in tropical regions. They protect the high-value equipment in the shelter by keeping the indoor air temperature below the maximum permissible by absorbing heat generated by power-hungry equipment such as a [[Base Station Subsystem]]. In case of a power failure to conventional cooling systems, PCMs minimize use of [[diesel generator]]s, and this can translate into enormous savings across thousands of telecom sites in tropics.

==Fire and safety issues==
Some phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5369">The '''Plurinational Electoral Organ''' is the independent [[electoral branch]] of the government of Bolivia. It replaced the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] in 2010. The branch consists of the 7-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral | work = La Jornada | accessdate = 2011-04-28 | date = 2010-08-16 | url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as three operative branches. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026). The seat of the Organ and of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal are in La Paz; while the ruling [[MAS-IPSP]] party offered the headquarters to Sucre during the controversy over capital status during the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly of 2006–2007|2006–07 Constituent Assembly]], negotiations were inconclusive. In June 2010, the Bolivian Senate rejected calls from [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]] parliamentarians to place the headquarters in Sucre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Senado: La Paz será sede del Órgano Electoral Plurinacional | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2011-05-08 | date = 2010-06-01 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/version.php?ArticleId=2776&amp;EditionId=93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Organ's operative branches are the Civil Register Service ({{lang-es|Servicio de Registro Cívico}}, Sereci), the Intercultural Service for Strengthening Democracy ({{lang-es|Servicio Intercultural de Fortalecimiento Democrático}}, Sifde), and the Technical Unit for Oversight ({{lang-es|Unidad Técnica de Fiscalización}}, UTF). The Civil Register Service is charged with continually maintaining the electoral rolls and consolidates the functions of registering birth, marriage, death, biometric identification, and residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | pages = E9 | title = Una apuesta decisiva: el Servicio de Registro Cívico | work = La Razón | date = 2010-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UTF audits and ensures the transparency of parties and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | pages = E10 | last = Bustillos Zamorano | first = Iván | title = La hora de la democracia intercultural | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2011-05-09 | date = 2011-04-24 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/version_temp.php?ArticleId=1494&amp;EditionId=2517&amp;idp=42&amp;ids=279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first election to be supervised by the new Organ was the [[Bolivian judicial election, 2011|judicial elections of late 2011]], followed by special municipal elections.

==Supreme Electoral Tribunal==
The '''Supreme Electoral Tribunal''' oversees elections nationwide. It consists of seven members, six of whom are chosen by the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] and one designated by the President. There are also six alternate members chosen by the Assembly. The members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral| work = La Jornada| accessdate = 2011-04-28| date = 2010-08-16| url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Mealla| first = Luis| title = El TSE consolida su Sala Plena después de 6 meses de espera| work = Página Siete| accessdate = 2011-04-28| date = 2011-01-14| url = http://www.paginasiete.bo/2011-01-15/Nacional/Destacados/4Nac001151.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10988">[[Political culture]] is a part of a society for which shared attitudes and beliefs establish a unique identity with regard to public and private [[governance]]. In the [[United States]], at least three political cultures took root during the colonial period. They were formed in [[New England]] by religious refugees from England, in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic region]] by Dutch settlers, in Virginia by English adventurers seeking fortune in the [[New World]], and in Carolina by English investors who envisioned a model constitutional society. In Virginia and Carolina, and later elsewhere in the South, [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] settlers influenced the cultural hearth that created the [[American South]]. Each began with established cultures of the [[British Isles]] and the [[Netherlands]], evolving into unique cultures that remain in existence today in the United States.

==Research on the political culture of the US==
The political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] identified three primary political cultures, generally consistent with those{{examples needed}} of Tocqueville. ''Moralistic'' political culture evolved out of New England and is characterized by an emphasis of community and civic virtue over individualism. ''Individualistic'' political culture arose from [[New Netherland|Dutch influence in the Mid-Atlantic region]]; it regards multiculturalism as a practicality and government as a utilitarian necessity. ''Traditionalistic'' political culture arose in the South, which elevates social order and family structure to a prominent role. It accepts a natural hierarchy in society and where necessary to protect society, authoritarian leadership in the political and religious realms.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, ''American Federalism'', pp. 93–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of traditionalistic political culture is often thought to have arisen principally out of Virginia, the first and most populous southern colony. Virginia was also the most politically powerful state after the Revolution: pursuant to the first census of the United States in 1790 it held a greater percentage of congressional representatives than any other state has ever enjoyed up to the present day. Nevertheless, others argue that South Carolina had the greater influence as a result of its [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina|Grand Model]] enabling slaveholders from Barbados to establish a durable aristocracy. That unique convergence produced a slave society with a majority black population rigidly controlled by the plantation elite. Maintaining such a society required intense political resolve and the development of a mythology of white racial supremacy. The South Carolina hybrid model ultimately spread across the [[Deep South]] and was unwavering in its promotion of southern culture, whereas Virginia and other Upper South states were less comfortable with the region’s “[[peculiar institution]]” of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Ashley Cooper Plan'', pp. 142–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientist Richard Ellis identified egalitarianism, individualism, and hierarchy as defining cultures in American political culture. These principal categories correspond closely with Elazar’s classification. According to Ellis, each of these cultures lays claim to the ideals of equality and liberty articulated by [[John Locke]], but what they are claiming is an only a piece of Locke, and one that is not necessarily consistent with the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''American Political Cultures'', pp. 1–3, 28–29, 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular authors have found similar divisions within American political culture. Colin Woodard identified eleven “rival regional cultures,” while Joel Garreau identified nine.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, ''American nations''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garreau, ''Nine Nations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social psychologist Peter J. Rentfrow led a research effort that generally supports Elazar's theory of political culture, while finding that psychological variables allow for a more fine-grained geographical analysis. His research on “psychological topography” was based on multiple samples of more than a million respondents. The researchers found “overwhelming evidence for regional variation across the United States on a range of key political, economic, social, and health indicators.”&lt;ref&gt;Rentfrow, et al., “Divided We Stand,” pp. 996–1009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appalachian and frontier political culture==

Many settlers who populated the South took to the backcountry, eventually crossing the Appalachians. Of these, the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] originating from northern Ireland and the border region between England and Scotland were among the largest and most influential. They were militantly Christian and inured to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion’s Seed'', pp. 605–39&lt;/ref&gt; While they might be considered a distinct political culture in colonial times, they eventually developed a symbiotic relationship with the southern plantation elite. As W. J. Cash wrote in ''The Mind of the South'', “the tradition of aristocracy met and married with the tradition of the backwoods.”&lt;ref&gt;Cash, ''The Mind of the South'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frontier Thesis]] advanced by the historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in 1893 argued that American culture, including political culture, was forged as Americans moved west. It was violent and individualistic and yet contained a primitive form of egalitarianism. In Elazar’s view, however, it was the South that acquired these traits most and carried them west to Missouri, Texas, and eventually as far as Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt'', pp. xv–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lockean liberalism and political culture==

In another unifying thesis about political culture that, like the [[Frontier Thesis]], some have argued that Lockean [[liberalism]] is a central underlying explanation of American political culture. Notably, the political scientist [[Louis Hartz]] argued that the nation’s founding principles, which were largely drawn from Locke, created a new political culture that was unique to the United States.  The nation “begins with Locke,” he wrote, and it “stays with Locke.” He found that [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was first to recognize this when he saw that the nation was the first to create its own democratic future without having to endure revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hartz, ''The Liberal Tradition in America'', pp. 6, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban-rural divide==

Political culture can be seen as bifurcated by urban and rural geography. The United States was largely a rural nation until 1920. When the census that year revealed that urban Congressional Districts would exceed those of rural areas, rural congressmen refused to approve [[United States Congressional Apportionment|reapportionment]], the only time that has happened.&lt;ref&gt;Martis and Elmes, ''Historical Atlas of State Power''.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural divide remains to the present with rural areas often associating with traditionalistic political culture, while urban areas are more often aligned with moralistic and individualistic political culture.

==Re-aggregation of political cultures in metropolitan areas==
Researchers Dante Chinni and James Gimpel identified twelve cultural communities found throughout the United States, with varying degrees of geographic concentration. The categories are derived from analysis of statistical data, and they offer a more realistic portrayal of the geographically discontinuous cultural fabric of the nation than blanket state and regional categories.&lt;ref&gt;Chinni and Gimpel, ''Our Patchwork Nation''.&lt;/ref&gt; In physical space, as in [[cyberspace]], people increasingly sort themselves into communities of choice. That is, people chose where they will live and who they will communicate with. The opportunity to make such choices appears to reinforce political culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, ''The Big Sort''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rail Safety Act 2006''' is a law enacted by the Parliament of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]] and is the prime [[statute]] regulating the [[safety]] of [[Rail transport in Victoria|rail operations in Victoria]]. The Act was developed as part of the [[Transport Legislation Review]] conducted by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] between 2004 and 2010 and is aimed at preventing deaths and injuries arising from [[rail transport|rail]] operations.

The Act was the State's first dedicated [[statute]] on the subject and replaced provisions in the former ''[[Transport Act 1983]]''.&lt;ref&gt;This Act is now known under the title [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Act forms part of the [[transport]] [[policy]] and [[legislation]] framework in Victoria set by the ''[[Transport Integration Act 2010]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010 - see paragraph (m) in the definition of "transport legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and its provisions are subject to the overarching transport system vision, transport system objectives and decision making principles set out in the ''Transport Integration Act''. The Act was passed in early 2006 and commenced on 1 August of that year. The Act also established Victoria's first independent transport safety regulator, the [[Director, Public Transport Safety]]. In 2010 the statutory office of Director, Public Transport Safety was replaced by the [[Director, Transport Safety]]. Though functionally independent, the Director is part of the Department of Transport and reports to the relevant Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the Act is the Minister for Public Transport, currently [[Jacinta Allan]].

== Outline ==
The stated purpose of the Act is "...to provide for safe rail operations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The objects of the Act center on the [[safety]] of rail operations, management of safety risks, continuous improvement in rail safety management, public confidence in the safety of [[rail transport]] and appropriate [[Stakeholder engagement|stakeholder involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 11(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also contains a number of overarching policy principles relating to shared responsibility, accountability for managing safety risks, integrated [[risk management]], [[enforcement]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]], consistency and stakeholder involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes a regulatory scheme with the following key elements:

* a number of performance based '''safety duties''' applying to a broad range of parties who can affect rail safety outcomes&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* an '''accreditation scheme''' concentrating on key rail industry operational parties&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a requirement that rail operators have a '''[[Safety Management Systems|safety management system]]''' in place&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Division 4 of Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a broad range of '''[[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] and [[wikt:penalty|penalties]]'''&lt;ref&gt;The Rail Safety Act 2006 amended the then Transport Act 1983 in respect of these matters.  The Transport Act has since been renamed the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983.  See Part 7 of that Act.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]]''' protections against excessive action by the regulator against industry participants&lt;ref&gt;Cost benefit protections were positioned as a key balancing element in the Rail Safety Act scheme and a guard against a "feral" regulator or a "gold plated" safety approach to [[safety]] requirements. The Rail Safety Act initially amended the Transport Act 1983 to include the protections. The protections have since been transferred to the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see section 175.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''alcohol and drug controls''' on rail safety workers&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act, Part 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* provision for the making of '''codes of practice''' to give guidance to regulated rail industry  parties.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Part 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also established the State's first dedicated public transport safety [[Regulatory agency|regulator]] - the [[Director, Public Transport Safety]] - which was created as an independent [[statutory]] office.&lt;ref&gt;Note, this office has since been abolished. The office was subsumed within a broader [[transport]] safety office - the [[Director, Transport Safety]] - on 1 July 2010 by operation of provisions in the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].  See, for example, section 171. The former office had jurisdiction over rail and [[bus]] [[safety]] matters only. The new independent transport safety office combines those functions with [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[safety]] responsibilities previously regulated by the Director of Marine Safety under the Marine Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parts ==

# Rail Safety Duties and Other Safety Requirements
# Protection and Control of Rail Operations
# Accreditation of Rail Infrastructure and Rolling Stock Operations
# Alcohol and Other Drug Controls for Rail Safety Workers
# Review of Decisions

== Coverage ==
The Act regulates the [[safety]] [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] of most [[rail transport in Victoria]] including heavy and light rail systems, public and private sidings, tramways and tourist and heritage rail operations.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, see the definition of "railway" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[railways]] regulated by the Act include the [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne heavy rail system]], the [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne tram and light rail network]], Victoria's regional standard and broad gauge rail networks and regional tourist and heritage [[railways]]. Railways excluded from coverage under the Act include railways in mines, amusement and theme park railways and [[slipway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duties ==
[[File:Colac railway station, Victoria.jpg|thumb|Safety regulation of railways involves requirements affecting a wide range of rail operations including the design and operation of stations.  [[Colac railway station, Victoria|Colac]] is a railway station in the town of [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]] in regional [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  The station is serviced by [[V/Line]] passenger trains on the [[Warrnambool railway line]]. [[V/Line]] has responsibilities under the Rail Safety Act for the safety of its rail operations on this line and the other lines which form parts of its operation.]]

Part 3 of the Act sets out a number of performance based safety duties which are required to be observed by designated rail industry participants including:

* rail infrastructure managers&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 20.&lt;/ref&gt; (including persons in charge of rail tracks)
* [[rolling stock]] operators&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* rail [[Independent contractor|contractors]]&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Labour hire|labour-hire entities]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* rail safety workers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

"Rail contractor" is defined broadly by the Act to include a range of persons including those involved in design, construction, manufacture, supply, installation, maintenance, repair and modification who knows or ought reasonably to know that things were to be used as rail infrastructure or [[rolling stock]].&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The typical formulation of a safety duty specifies that persons in this category must ensure the safety of things for which they are responsible "so far as is reasonably practicable"&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006 - see, for example, section 22(2) which specifies the duty of [[rolling stock]] operators&lt;/ref&gt; although the formulation varies according to the party. Rail infrastructure managers and rolling stock operators, for example, are also required to provide or maintain systems of rail safety work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006 - see, for example, section 22(1) in relation to rolling stock operators.&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties for breach of the safety duties are substantial and vary among [[natural person]] and [[Corporation|body corporate]] offenders.

The framework of safety duties in the Act seeks to give practical effect to the so-called "chain of responsibility" concept in the [[rail transport|rail]] safety sector.&lt;ref&gt;The chain of responsibility concept emanated from the heavy vehicle sector in [[Australia]]. The concept has since spread in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the rail safety, [[bus]] safety, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] safety, taxi and accident [[towing]] sectors.&lt;/ref&gt; That concept seeks to identify the parties who are in a sufficient position of control over risks, in this case to safety, and to allocate responsibility by [[law]] accordingly.

== Accreditation scheme ==
Two key parties responsible for the direct operation of [[railways]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], rail infrastructure managers and [[rolling stock]] operators, are not permitted to operate under the Act unless they are granted [[accreditation]] by the regulator.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006 - see sections 36 and 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of accreditation is to attest to an operator's competence and capacity to manage the risks to safety associated with their rail operations.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Matters applicants are required to demonstrate under the scheme are that their [[safety Management Systems|safety management system]] complies with the Act, that they have sufficient financial capacity or [[insurance]] to meet potential accident liabilities, and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety management systems ==
[[File:Melbourne-signalling-stanchions.jpg|thumb|Safety regulation of railways includes oversight of the condition and operation of rails and signals.  The picture shows a section of quadruple track near [[Caulfield railway station, Melbourne|Caulfield station]] in Melbourne, showing [[railway signalling|signalling]] and [[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|overhead wiring]].]]

Certain rail operators, that is infrastructure managers and [[rolling stock]] operators,&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 3, definition of "rail operator".&lt;/ref&gt; are required to have a [[Safety Management Systems|safety management system]] (SMS) to ensure the safe management of their rail operations.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Division 4 of Part 3. See in particular, section 27.&lt;/ref&gt; A safety management system must be documented and "...provide a comprehensive and integrated management system..." setting out all [[risks]] and control measures.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, section 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the SMS is the key safety plan for those parties who have ground level operational responsibilities in the rail sector.

== Compliance ==
[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]]-related provisions to support the Rail Safety Act scheme were not included in that Act and instead were included in the then [[Transport Act 1983]] (since renamed, the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The compliance support scheme centres on provisions enabling the appointment of authorised officers, conferral of coercive powers and a range of administrative and court-based sanctions.  The key elements are:

* appointment of officers transport safety officers&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], subdivision 2 of Division 4B of Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powers relating to entry to [[railway]] premises, [[inspection]], securing sites, [[use of force]] and [[seizure]] of things&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], subdivisions 4, 7 and 8 of Division 4B of Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powers to [[Search and seizure|search]], enter and require production of documents and information and to require name and address details&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], subdivision 5 of Division 4B of Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] and [[wikt:penalty|penalties]] such as improvement notices, prohibition notices and infringement notices&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], subdivisions 9 to 11A of Division 4B of Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powers to initiate [[Prosecutor|prosecutions]], receive safety undertakings and impose commercial benefits penalty orders, supervisory intervention orders, exclusion orders and adverse publicity orders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], Division 6 of Part 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsible regulator ==
The [[Director, Transport Safety]], who operates as Transport Safety Victoria, is the responsible [[regulatory agency|regulator]] for the application and enforcement of the Act, and the regulation of [[safety]] performance of the rail sector in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The office was created by the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 171.&lt;/ref&gt; It commenced on 1 July 2010 and subsumed the former office of the [[Director, Public Transport Safety]] within a broader [[transport]] safety office. The Director is part of  the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]], but is functionally independent of the Department and responsible Ministers,&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194.&lt;/ref&gt; except in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 191 (the Minister may compel the Director to investigate a particular matter) and 193(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The Director reports to the relevant Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Breathalyzer.jpg|thumb|The Rail Safety Act requires certain rail industry workers to have a zero [[blood alcohol content]] and to be unimpaired by particular drugs when they undertake rail safety-sensitive tasks such as driving trains or trams, operating signals, etc. Workers are subject to testing for these substances including by breath analysis equipment.  Severe penalties apply if workers breach the requirements of the Act.]]

=== Regulatory scheme ===
The development of the proposal for the Act was managed by the former Department of Infrastructure in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;The successor to the Department of Infrastructure in rail [[safety]] and other areas is the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]].&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its [[Transport Legislation Review]] project. The Department released an issues paper outlining the broad policy outline for rail safety scheme [[legislation]] in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;The paper was titled "''Improving Rail Safety in Victoria:  issues paper for a review of the rail safety regulatory framework''" and was released on 24 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper outlined a series of concerns about the former rail safety [[regulation]] framework in Victoria including concerns about safety trends and outcomes&lt;ref&gt;''Improving Rail Safety in Victoria'', Department of Infrastructure, May 2004, Parts B.&lt;/ref&gt; and comparisons with schemes in overseas jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;''Improving Rail Safety in Victoria'', Department of Infrastructure, May 2004, Parts C, D and E.&lt;/ref&gt; Comments on the issues paper were requested from [[industry]] parties and other interested stakeholders. Comments received from industry, [[government]] and other stakeholders resulted in the refinement of the proposal and changes to its design.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Department's initial proposal for a "[[safety case]]" proposal was not pursued in the [[legislation]] presented to the [[Victorian Parliament]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governance scheme ===
The proposal for a new [[public transport]] regulator was developed separately but concurrently with the development of the rail safety regulatory scheme. The Department commissioned a further review which led to a detailed report on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria'', TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The review examined [[governance]] arrangements for safety [[regulation]] in the public transport sector drawing on [[Australian]] and overseas models. Recommendations were made aimed at improving the [[governance]], [[accountability]] and [[methodology]] of the then public transport regulator which at that time obtained its powers to regulate safety through delegation from the [[Secretary]] of the Department of Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Act 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular concerns were expressed about the lack of [[independence]] of the regulator function and the perceived lack of clarity about its [[charter]] and accountabilities as well as conflict of interest concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria'', TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004 - see findings relating to [[terms of reference]] 3 for the review, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the review recommended the creation of an independent [[statutory]] office with a clearer [[charter]] and [[accountability]] arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Role and Accountability Arrangements for Public Transport and Marine Safety Regulation in Victoria'', TFG International Pty Ltd, November 2004 - see findings relating to [[terms of reference]] 4 for the review, pages 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governance review also examined the case for merging the public transport regulator with the then Victorian [[marine (ocean)|marine]] safety regulator, the Director of Marine Safety.&lt;ref&gt;This office was established under the Marine Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; While not recommended at that time, the review found that integration of the functions could be examined in two to three years time once the public transport regulatory schemes had been settled and further examination of marine [[safety]] [[regulation]] had occurred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The [[Victorian Government]] ultimately pursued the full integration of its public transport and marine safety regulators five years later as part of its [[Transport Integration Act]] proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], section 171 and related amendments to the Marine Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the proposals for both a new rail safety [[regulation]] scheme and new public transport safety governance arrangements were presented to the [[Victorian Parliament]] as proposed [[legislation]] in early October 2005.

== Parliamentary approval ==
[[File:FederationSquare-tramstop.jpg|thumb|The tram Stop outside [[Federation Square]] in [[Melbourne]].  The regulatory scheme in the Rail Safety Act applies to the activities of rail operators and other parties in relation to these facilities as well as to the safety of rails, rolling stock, signals etc.]]

=== Introduction ===
The Rail Safety Act was introduced into the [[lower house]] of the [[Victorian Parliament]], the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]], as the Rail Safety Bill. The Bill was introduced at the same time as the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/bill/tlib2005514/ Transport Legislation (Safety Investigations) Bill], a proposal to establish an independent public transport and marine safety investigator in Victoria, and the Bills were debated together.&lt;ref&gt;This process is available under Victorian Parliamentary procedure and the Bills become known as cognate Bills.&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for both Bill proposals was the then Minister for Transport, [[Peter Batchelor]]. The Minister moved the [[second reading]] of the Rail Safety Bill on 6 October 2005 and set the context for the Bill in his speech in support as follows:

::"This Bill heralds a new era in rail [[safety]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. While Victoria has a proud rail safety record over the 150 years of rail operations in the State, new enhanced rail [[safety]] [[regulation]] and [[public transport]] [[governance]] is essential in order to maintain our current high [[safety]] levels and to generate continuous [[safety]] improvements in the future.

::Government and [[transport]] operators must remain vigilant about rail [[safety]] performance. Together, we need to seek further safety improvements in an industry where, as international and interstate experiences show, incidents have the potential for serious consequences for life and limb. This is a particular issue for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] where the responsibility for the delivery and operation of [[passenger]] and [[freight]] rail services has been largely devolved to private operators and away from direct Government control.

::Victoria's challenge, and more broadly the challenge for the nation, is to learn from the [[safety]] [[regulation]] improvements in other jurisdictions and industries and to adopt [[best practice]] [[regulation]] that facilitates better [[hazard identification]] and [[risk management]] -- activities aimed at preventing incidents, and at mitigating their consequences if ever they do occur. With these considerations in mind, it has been a key objective of the Government to develop a contemporary [[best practice]] rail [[safety]] regime for the State."&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Assembly]], 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate, criticism and amendments ===
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|The Bill which became the Rail Safety Act was considered by the [[Victorian Parliament]] between early October 2005 and late March 2006. The Rail Safety Act policy framework was later adopted nationally and has now been replicated in laws passed by the legislatures in all Australian States and the Northern Territory.]]

The Rail Safety Bill was the subject of a reasoned amendment moved by the then Opposition shadow Transport Minister [[Terry Mulder]] on 1 March 2006 in the Legislative Assembly. The amendment sought to defer the Parliament's consideration of the Bill pending the approval of a national model Rail Safety Bill which had adopted the Victorian policy framework but which was being developed on a later timetable by the National Transport Commission.&lt;ref&gt;See National Context below.  The text of the reasoned amendment moved by [[Terry Mulder|Mr Mulder]] was 'this house refuses to read this Bill a second time until a final resolution has been reached by all States in relation to the National Transport Commission's draft Rail Safety Bill and that further discussion has been entered into via invitation from the Federal Government to simplify [[regulation]] for rail operators in all States'. [[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulder stated:

::"The National Transport Commission has developed a model Bill for rail safety throughout [[Australia]] and is still in the process of consulting with industry groups and State Governments. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] has jumped the gun and decided to go it alone. As indicated in the second-reading speeches, the Government proposes to tidy up the [[legislation]] as it moves forward."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Assembly]], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

::"In reality the rail industry is looking for and wants a single regulator. It wants simplification and [[regulations]] which are uniform across all States. As I have said, the Minister was not prepared to do that. I understand that the [[Victorian Government]] has agreed to follow several provisions of the model Bill. But there are other parts of the model Bill that the minister has not seen fit to follow. This has all the hallmarks of the [[Victorian Government]] trying to take the agenda away from the National Transport Commission, putting in place a process and trying to drive the agenda from that point forward."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

In response, the Minister observed that:

::(Members) have spoken on a landmark piece of [[legislation]] which sees [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] leading and not following. We are leading the way in national rail [[safety]] [[reform]]. We are achieving objectives that many State Transport Ministers have been attempting to achieve along with their national colleagues. .... This is an important piece of [[legislation]] because the Rail Safety Bill will become the model [[legislation]] for all other [[Australian]] jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Victoria, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government moved a series of amendments to the Bill during the latter stages of its passage in the Legislative Assembly largely to give effect to national alignment matters agreed between the Department of Infrastructure and the National Transport Commission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Passage, assent and commencement ===
The Rail Safety Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 1 March 2006&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and was introduced into the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] on 2 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Council]], 2 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Second reading was moved in the Council on 28 March and the Bill was ultimately passed without further amendment on 29 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Council]], 28 and 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rail Safety Bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 4 April 2006 to become the Rail Safety Act 2006.&lt;ref&gt;See www.legislation.vic.gov.au, Parliamentary Documents, archive for 2006 Bills of the [[Victorian Parliament]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act was ultimately proclaimed to [[Coming into force|commence]] on 1 August 2006. The Rail Safety Regulations 2006 which were required to support the operation of the Act also operated from the same date thereby formally commencing the new rail safety regulation scheme.

== Amendments to the Act ==
The Act has been subject to some significant amendments since it was passed in 2006. These include requirements on rail infrastructure managers and road managers since 1 July 2010 to enter into "safety interface agreements".&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Act 2006, Division 2 of Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme pursues the identification and management of [[risks]] to [[safety]] at road/rail crossings, particularly [[level crossing#Australia|level crossing]]s, as one means of improving safety outcomes at those locations.

== National impact ==
[[File:Pacific national cement train at geelong.jpg|thumb| This [[Pacific National]] cement train operating at [[Geelong]] in regional [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] provides an example of a rail activity conducted by a national operator in Victoria which is regulated by the Rail Safety Act.]]

=== 2006 Model Bill ===
The development and passage of the Rail Safety Act in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in March 2006 was followed by policy and legislation developments at the national level. In June 2006, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100203155424/http://www.atcouncil.gov.au/ Australian Transport Council] approved a model Rail Safety Bill for adoption in law by the States and the [[Northern Territory]]. The [[regulatory]] framework in the national model Bill adopted the scheme set out in the Victorian Act.  Accordingly, the Victorian [[legislation]] satisfied the core national scheme requirements and required small changes only to be compatible with the national draft.

Adoption of the model national Bill was gradual. The national proposal was subsequently adopted by [[legislation]] in [[South Australia]] (in 2007), [[New South Wales]] (2008) and [[Tasmania]] (2009) and eventually in [[Western Australia]] (2010), the Northern Territory (2010) and [[Queensland]] (2010).

Once it was clear that a majority of other jurisdictions had implemented the new framework, the Victorian Rail Safety Act was amended to acknowledge that the Victorian [[statute]] forms part of the nationally consistent rail [[safety]] scheme&lt;ref&gt;Section 11A of the Rail Safety Act 2006 provides that "(I) it is the intention of [[Victorian Parliament|Parliament]] that this Act form part of a nationally consistent scheme that regulates and promotes the maintenance of, and continuous improvement in, rail [[safety]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 centralisation proposal ===
A further national proposal emerged in 2008 at the instigation of the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]]. This followed soon after the approval of the national model Rail Safety Bill and before most States and the Northern Territory were able to embed the model Bill into their local laws.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100203155424/http://www.atcouncil.gov.au/ Australian Transport Council] and the [[Council of Australian Governments]] are pursuing a centralisation proposal (sometimes called the "single national rail safety regulator") to establish a safety regulator for all rail operations in [[Australia]] including [[interstate]] railways and domestic state and territory urban systems (heavy rail, light rail and tram) and shortlines.&lt;ref&gt;see www.coag.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal forms part of a "seamless national economy" proposal being pursued by the Commonwealth Government&lt;ref&gt;Sww www.coag.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[COAG]].

The proposal envisages the establishment of an applied laws scheme and a central rail safety regulation bureaucracy for [[Australia]] located in [[Adelaide]] in [[South Australia]] and the abolition of the current rail safety regulators in the States and the Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;See COAG and ATC communiques since 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations are currently underway between the [[Commonwealth]] and [[States and territories of Australia|States and Territories]] on this centralisation proposal. Final approval and adoption of legislation and other arrangements is still to occur. There has been both support for and opposition to the full centralised regulatory proposal since it was first raised.

[[The Overland]] is a passenger train between [[Melbourne]], Victoria and [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Operated by private company, [[Great Southern Rail (Australia)|Great Southern Rail]], the train operates between the Melbourne terminal of [[Southern Cross railway station|Southern Cross]], and [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal]] in Adelaide, and covers 828 kilometres between capitals.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gsr.com.au/our-trains/the-overland/the-journey.php# |title=Great Southern Railways - The Overland |access-date=12 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210234651/http://www.gsr.com.au/our-trains/the-overland/the-journey.php# |archive-date=10 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]. When in Victoria, the train operates under the Victorian Rail Safety Act and in South Australia under the companion South Australian Act of the same name. Coordinated regulatory activity is ensured by the regulators of each State and by the Rail Safety Regulators' Panel.

The original centralisation concept has been supported by interstate rail interests and jurisdictions such as [[Tasmania]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[Northern Territory]].  Those parties have argued that having separate rail [[safety]] regulators in each jurisdiction is inefficient and costly for the rail industry, particularly cross border operators, and also for Governments.&lt;ref&gt;See the submissions by these jurisdictions in response to the regulatory impact statement released in late 2008 in respect of the centralisation proposal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the proposal have also asserted that Australia’s regulatory system for rail needs to be modernised to reflect a national approach to transport policy planning and to support the safe, efficient and sustainable growth of the railway industry.  It has also been suggested that the establishment of a national rail safety administration will "...deliver better rail safety outcomes for Australia, as it will draw on a national pool of knowledge and resources".&lt;ref&gt;See National Transport Commission website as of July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the project have also suggested that the cost savings that might accrue as a result of more centralised rail safety laws and bureaucracy will result in better safety results because rail operators will use any monetary savings to improve their safety systems.&lt;ref&gt;Statements made by National Transport Commission staff and industry advocates during National Rail Safety Regulator Public Information Forums throughout Australia during July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, smaller jurisdictions generally see the rail safety regulation function as expensive and wish to shift costs to the Commonwealth Government.  Concerns have also been expressed about the progress of harmonisation across [[Australia]], including since the approval of the national model Rail Safety Bill.

==== Criticism ====
[[File:Puffing billy in action 2003.jpg|thumb| Tourist and heritage railway operations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are also regulated by the Rail Safety Act.  This picture shows locomotive 12A on the Monbulk Creek trestle bridge near [[Belgrave, Victoria|Belgrave]] just outside [[Melbourne]].  The train is operating as part of the famous [[Puffing Billy Railway|Puffing Billy tourist railway]].]]
The centralised regulator proposal has been opposed at times by [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Western Australian]] rail safety regulator who have pointed to a lack of quantitative or qualitative evidence of impacts of the current jurisdiction-based national system on operator costs, particularly in light of the predominance of intrastate [[Urban area|urban]] rail movements in [[Australia]] over [[interstate]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;See submissions made by jurisdictions into the centralised regulator concept.&lt;/ref&gt; These jurisdictions have also pointed to the good performance of rail safety regulation in Australia in recent years which has seen long-term trends point to reductions in deaths and injuries from rail operations. Agreement has already been reached to excise the Melbourne tram system from the national proposal; however Victoria and New South Wales in particular have indicated ongoing difficulties with ceding safety control over the large Melbourne and Sydney suburban rail systems to an entity located in Adelaide.

Some [[jurisdictions]] and [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s have contrasted the more decentralised regulatory position in other large rail [[federations]], particularly the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]], where countries and provinces retain strong local control of rail safety regulation and administration, especially in relation to urban and metro systems.  Some concerns raised in this context have reflected on the lack of [[subsidiarity]] consideration evident in the national proposal.

Concerns have also been expressed about the single mode aspect of the national centralisational proposal which would remove rail safety regulation from the [[New South Wales]] and Victorian regulators. Critics argue that the national proposal militates against the contemporary integrated transport directions evident in these larger jurisdictions in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria, for example, enacted a Transport Integration Act in 2010 which pursues a policy and organisational direction which contrasts sharply with the national rail safety regulation centralisation proposal.  New South Wales too passed legislation in 2010 which conferred additional safety responsibilities on its multi-modal safety transport safety regulator.&lt;/ref&gt; These directions have seen transport safety regulators becoming increasingly multi modal and covering modes such as rail, tram, bus and maritime in the one agency as a way of sharing safety expertise, reducing duplication and minimising opportunities for [[regulatory capture]].  The national proposal would reverse this modern trend and create a single rail safety regulator.

Some stakeholders have criticised the safety credibility of the centralisation proposal, observing that the proposal is more directed at [[economic]] benefits rather than [[safety]] improvements and that, as a result, it has the potential to increase rail safety risks.
Several stakeholders have also raised the prospect of any new regulator becoming subject to [[regulatory capture]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the submission by Public Transport Victoria in response to the regulatory impact statement released in late 2008 in respect of the centralisation proposal.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current directions ===
The centralisation proposal remains unresolved although the current proposal suggests a start up date of 1 January 2013 for a new system&lt;ref&gt;See communiques at www.coag.gov.au and outcomes from the Australian Transport Council.&lt;/ref&gt; which is still in evolution.  Recent developments suggest that a centralised regulator will be established to take over the rail safety regulation functions of a majority of jurisdictions but that the most populous jurisdictions such as [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and potentially other large rail States such as [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] may retain a local regulatory presence under service level agreements.  Jurisdictions which choose to operate under service level agreements may do so through their existing regulators operating in conjunction with the Adelaide-based national regulation bureaucracy and under centrally determined [[policy]] and operational directions.

'''''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto''''' is a 2008 [[open-source film|open-source]] documentary film about "the changing concept of [[copyright]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner, Scott. [http://cinematech.blogspot.com/2007/10/cinematech-filmmaker-q-brett-gaylor-of.html "CinemaTech Filmmaker Q&amp;A: Brett Gaylor of Open Source Cinema".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott, Shane. "[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html The Load-Down] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630225243/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/032907/load.html |date=30 June 2007 }}", ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', 2007-03-29. Accessed 2008-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Brett Gaylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto/ brett-gaylor-talks-rip-remix-manifesto] on [[wired.com]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Created over a period of six years, the documentary film features the collaborative remix work of hundreds of people who have contributed to the [[Open Source Cinema]] website, helping to create the "world's first [[open source]] documentary" as Gaylor put it. The project's [[working title]] was ''Basement Tapes'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 CinemaTech interview with Brett Gaylor about Open Source Cinema project] at [[Google Videos]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205075005/https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-429453083182656636 |date=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to [[The Basement Tapes|the album of the same name]]) but it was renamed ''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto'' prior to theatrical release. Gaylor encourages more people to create their own remixes from this movie,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160826014720/http://www.documentary.org/content/copyright-or-copywrong-rip-challenges-intellectual-property-rights Copyright or Copywrong?: 'RiP' Challenges Intellectual Property Rights] By Marc Glassman on documentary.org (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; using media available from the Open Source Cinema website, or other websites like [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]], [[Hulu]], or [[MySpace]].

==Background==
Gaylor traveled the world to find like-minded people who would help him draft the "Remixer's Manifesto" that makes up the structure of his open source documentary. The manifesto reads as follows:
{{quote|
#Culture always builds on the past.
#The past always tries to control the future.
#Our future is becoming less free.
#To build free societies you must limit the control of the past|Brett Gaylor in Rip! A Remix Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy |first=Steve |url=http://creativegeneralist.com/2009/03/rip-a-remix-manifesto/ |title=Rip! A Remix Manifesto |website=Creative Generalist |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To further his point, Gaylor separates the corporations from the [[public domain]], defining the former using so-called "[[Copy right|CopyRIGHT]]," and the latter, which represents the free exchange of ideas, as "[[Copyleft|CopyLEFT]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelevan |first=Douglas |url=http://dgelevan.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/getting-ripped-brett-gaylors-rip-a-remix-manifesto-a-case-study/ |title=Getting 'RiP'ped – Brett Gaylor's RiP: A Remix Manifesto |website=Douglas Gelevan Reports |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaylor and Gillis are clearly on the side of the Copyleft, promoting the free flow and growth of creativity and ideas. To enable a free [[Remix culture|remixing culture]] also with his film, he released RiP! under the [[CC BY-NC-SA]] 3.0&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Studies/RIP:_A_Remix_Manifesto IP:_A_Remix_Manifesto] on creativecommons.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons license]].

==Participants==
The documentary is particularly interested in the [[non liquet|legal]] [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] of remixing existing works. The film features appearances by:

* Gregg Gillis (better known as [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]) an American musician specializing in [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]-style remixes, which often use a dozen or more unauthorized samples from different songs to create an entirely new track. Gillis' 2006 album Night Ripper had potentially 300 copyright infringements and carried a maximum financial liability penalty of around $45 million. To some he is considered a creative rebel of a mash-up artist, while others deem his work pure copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |title=RiP: A Remix Manifesto: review |website=Canada.com |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926143114/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=e88e2492-f6cb-4059-ba2a-17e79ed736b7 |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lawrence Lessig]], an American [[Academia|academic]] and political activist, and a professor of law at [[Harvard Law School]] and founder of the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]]. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], trademark, and [[radio frequency|radio frequency spectrum]], particularly in technology applications. He was previously a professor of law at Stanford Law School. Gaylor discusses the legal protection of fair use with Lessig to determine the ability to produce the film.
* [[Cory Doctorow]], a Canadian blogger, journalist and science fiction author. Doctorow is co-editor of the blog [[Boing Boing]] and is an activist in favor of reforming [[copyright]] laws. He is a proponent of the [[Creative Commons]] organization, using some of their licenses for his books. Common themes in his work include [[digital rights management]] and [[file sharing]]. In the film, Doctorow states, "Technology giveth, technology taketh away.”
* [[Gilberto Gil]], the Brazilian musician and former Minister of Cultural Affairs who initiated pioneering programs in [[Brazil]] through a partnership with [[Creative Commons]]. As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives [[Grant (money)|grants]] to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |authorlink=Larry Rohter |title=Gilberto Gil and the politics of music |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/12/news/gil.php |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=[[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brazil]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dan O'Neill]], an underground cartoonist and founder of the [[Air Pirates]], a group which was famously sued by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for copyright infringement.
* [[Jammie Thomas]], the single mom successfully sued by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) at the [[Capitol v. Thomas]] case for Thomas' illegal downloading. The single mother, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,220 in damages for making 24 songs available for download on the [[Kazaa]] [[file sharing network]].

==Other topics==
The 1710 [[Statute of Anne]] gave authors the exclusive rights to their works. The documentary was able to be made and distributed due to the part of [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright law]] deemed [[fair use]], the ability to use copyrighted works to prove a point. Fair use allows for [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. Due to the fact that Gaylor tries to prove a point about copyright law and the rights of artists in his film, he is legally allowed to use examples to get his point across. He uses remixed music in the film to give examples of what would be considered illegal. The film also discusses the consequences of illegal downloading and [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset]]t case was the first file-sharing copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States to be brought in front of a jury by [[major record labels]].

==Festivals and awards==
''RiP!: A Remix Manifesto'' made its international debut at the IDFA ([[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]]) in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081207072305/http://www.idfa.nl/en/news/latestnews/winners-idfa-2008-announced.aspx "winners at the IDFA festival 2008"].

'''Robert King "Bob" Wittman''' was a highly decorated [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Special Agent who was assigned to the [[Philadelphia]] Field Division from 1988 to 2008. As a result of specialized training in art, antiques, jewelry and gem identification, Wittman served as the FBI's "top investigator and coordinator in cases involving art theft and art fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ignacio Villarreal |url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=27842 |title=FBI's Top Investigator Involving Art Theft and Art Fraud, Robert Wittman, Retires |publisher=Artdaily.com |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 20 years with the FBI, Wittman helped recover more than $300 million worth of stolen art and cultural property, resulting in the prosecution and conviction of numerous individuals. In 2005, he was instrumental in the creation of the FBI's rapid deployment Art Crime Team (ACT). He was named the ACT's Senior Investigator and was responsible for instructing the newly formed team. He also was instrumental in the recovery of colonial North Carolina's copy of the original [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 2005, after it was stolen by a Union soldier in 1865. Wittman represented the [[United States]] around the world, conducting investigations and instructing international police and museums in recovery and security techniques. After his 20 years with the FBI working against [[art theft]], he continues to use his expertise as an art security [[consultant]] for the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwittmaninc.com/|title=Robert Wittman Inc. ~ Art Recovery, Art Security, Art Protection|work=robertwittmaninc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Wittman published his memoir ''Priceless'' which recounts his career and activities while working for the FBI as an undercover agent.

==Early life and career==
Robert Wittman was born in [[Tokyo, Japan]] in 1955. Wittman's mother is Japanese and his father American; they met while his father was stationed with the US Air Force in Tokyo during the [[Korean War]]. He came to the [[United States]] in 1957 and lived in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where his mother and father owned and ran an antique store. It was in this antique store that Wittman learned the business of art. He graduated from [[Calvert Hall College High School]] in 1973. Following [[high school]], he attended [[Towson University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]] in 1980. Wittman initially found employment with a Maryland agricultural magazine where he learned how to be an effective salesman, a skill to which he attributes his success later in undercover stings. He married Donna Goodhand Wittman in 1982 and has 3 children. He joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1988 and was assigned to the Philadelphia Field Division where he went into the field of tracking down stolen art. His reputation within the FBI for solving art theft cases grew during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2005 Wittman was instrumental in the formation of the FBI's Art Crime Team, the first of its type.  He worked closely with federal prosecutors Robert Goldman and [[David Locke Hall]].

'''Royal instructions'''&lt;ref&gt;Note that this term is always used in the plural.&lt;/ref&gt; are formal instructions issued to governors of the United Kingdom's [[British Overseas Territories|colonial dependencies]], and past instructions can be of continuing constitutional significance in a former colonial dependency or [[Dominion]].

==Content==
Traditionally the royal instructions were issued to a Governor to:
* tell him how the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] and legislative council were to be constituted, how their procedure was to be regulated, and how he was to work with them
* set out the how legislation was to be framed
* instruct him as to which classes of legislation he must refuse his [[Royal Assent|assent]]
* regulate precedence
* set out how copies of certain formal documents and records were to be communicated to the British government

==Legal status==
Royal instructions were a commonly used [[legal instrument]] of British imperial law used in the governing of the empire's colonies. Royal instructions delegated to colonial governors the legal capacity to exercise [[the Crown]]'s [[royal prerogative]] and set out the limits and conditions within which that prerogative was to be exercised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |publication-date= 1894-03-13 |title= The Attorney General (Canada) v. The Attorney General of the Province of Ontario, 23 SCR 458 (at pg. 469) |publication-place= Ottawa |publisher= Queen's Printer for Canada |url= http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1894/1894canlii12/1894canlii12.html |accessdate= 2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal instructions given to a colonial governor were one of three documents normally used for constituting the government of a colony,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Martin. p.142 "The Development of the Legislative Council 1606-1945", in the series "Studies in Colonial Legislatures" edited by [[Margery Perham]] of the Institute of Colonial Studies, Oxford, England (Faber &amp; Faber, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt; the others being the [[letters patent]] or [[order in council]] constituting the office of governor and commander-in-chief, and the governor's commission obliging him to follow the instructions he received from the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council in London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Shortt |first1= Adam |last2= Doughty |first2= Arthur G. |title= Documents Relating to the Constitutional History of Canada, 1759–1791 |url= http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14005119M/Documents_relating_to_the_constitutional_history_of_Canada_1759-1791 |edition= 2 |year= 1918 |publisher= Historical Documents Publication Board |location= Ottawa |pages= 171–172 |chapter= Commission to the Captain General and Governor in Chief of the Province of Quebec, 4 November 1763}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained in the book, ''Royal Government in America'', it is "The British authorities clearly looked upon the instructions as constitutional documents of the greatest importance which all members of the colonial government were expected to obey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Woods Labaree |first= Leonard |title= Royal Government in America: A study of the British Colonial System before 1783 |year= 1964 |publisher= Fredrick Ungar |location= New York |page= 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when, in the late 1750s, the [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]] approved three Acts in contravention of regulations incorporated into his royal instructions, the Privy Council struck down the Acts and admonished the Governor, reminding him that his instructions in this regard were “coeval with the Constitution of the British Colonies” and formed "an Essential part of that Constitution and cannot be sett aside a without subverting Fundimental Principle of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others= W L Grant, James Munro, Almeric W Fitzroy |title= Acts of the Privy Council of England, Colonial Series, 1745–1766 |year= 1908 |publisher= Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location= Hereford |pages= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at 1945 there were eight [[legislative council]]s which had been constituted by royal instructions: the [[Falkland Islands]], the [[the Gambia|Gambia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kenya]], [[Nyasaland]], [[Seychelles]], the [[Straits Settlements]] and [[Uganda]]; while others had been constituted by order in council, letters patent, local ordinance or by act of the imperial parliament at Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;Wright,  Martin. "The Development of the Legislative Council 1606-1945", in the series "Studies in Colonial Legislatures" edited by [[Margery Perham]] of the Institute of Colonial Studies, Oxford, England (Faber &amp; Faber, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing importance in Canada==
With Confederation, Canada inherited a Constitution "similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Victoria |author-link= Victoria of the United Kingdom |publication-date= 1867-03-29 |title= Constitution Act, 1867 |publication-place= Westminster |publisher= Queen's Printer |url= http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/const/const1867.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those elements of the constitution of the Provinces of Canada that were not displaced by the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] or subsequent legislation continue in force in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Constitutional Law of Canada |last= Hogg |first= Peter W. |authorlink1= Peter Hogg |year= 2007 |publisher= Carswell |location= [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] |isbn=978-0-7798-1337-7 |edition= 5th |pages= 1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of Confederation and still to this day, certain subjects matters remain within the scope of the Crown’s prerogative powers, such as international treaty making and the creation of Indian reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publication-date= 2002-06-20 |title= Ross River Dena Council Band v. Canada, [2002] SCC 54 |publisher= Queen's Printer of Canada |publication-place= Ottawa |at= paragraph 62 |url= http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc54/2002scc54.html |accessdate= 2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the limits on those powers and the guidelines for their use that were set out in the instructions to the governors of Canada’s constituent colonies were incorporated into Canada’s constitution and, unless displaced, bind the Crown in Right of Canada’s actions.

The continued importance of Royal Instructions can has been noted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in ''[[St. Catherines Milling v. The Queen|St. Catherines Milling]]'', in which it was stated that the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] must be read "together with the Royal instructions given to the Governors as to its strict enforcement" and that, when taken together, these constitute "the Indian Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publication-date= 1887-06-20 |title= St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Co. v.

==Canada after Confederation==
Initially the form of royal instructions remained essentially unchanged after the development of [[responsible government]]. Detailed criticism in 1876 by [[Edward Blake]] (Canada's federal Minister of Justice) of the wording of both the [[letters patent]] appointing the [[Governor General of Canada]] and the royal instructions issued to him led to changes to both sets of instruments for each of the [[dominion]]s, to better reflect how they were actually governed.

{{Politics of China |expanded = Legislative }}

The '''Standing Committee of the National People's Congress''' ('''NPCSC'''; {{zh|全国人民代表大会常务委员会}}) is a committee of about 150 members of the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which is convened between plenary sessions of the NPC.  It has the constitutional authority to modify legislation within limits set by the NPC, and thus acts as a ''de facto'' legislative body.  It is led by a [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Chairman]], Mainland China's top legislator, who is conventionally ranked third in [[political position ranking of the People's Republic of China|Mainland China's political ranking system]], after the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]]. The current Chairman is [[Li Zhanshu]].

The NPCSC also has the power to interpret the laws of the PRC, including its constitution. In contrast to other countries in which [[stare decisis]] gives the power of both final interpretation and adjudication to a [[supreme court]], within Mainland China constitutional and legal interpretation is considered to be a legislative activity rather than a judicial one, and the functions are split so that the NPCSC provides legal interpretations while the [[Supreme People's Court]] actually decides cases.  Because an interpretation of the NPCSC is legislative in nature and not judicial, it does not affect cases which have already been decided.

A notable use of the constitutional interpretation power occurred in 1999 over the [[Right of abode issue, Hong Kong|Right of Abode issue]] in the [[Hong Kong]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] in ''[[Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_frame.jsp?DIS=18930&amp;QS=%2B&amp;TP=JU |title = FACV Nos 10 and 11 of 1999 |publisher = Judiciary of Hong Kong |date=3 December 1999 |access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NPCSC interpreted the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law of Hong Kong]] in accordance with the position taken by the Hong Kong government with respect to the eligibility of permanent residency in Hong Kong.

The '''1810 Riksdag Act''' was passed by [[Riksdag|Parliament]] on 10 February 1810 during the [[reign]] of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]]. It replaced the order of the estates meetings in 1617 reintroduced by [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] via the [[Union and Security Act]] instead of the Riksdag Act 1723. The 1810 [[parliament]]ary regime was adopted after [[Sweden]] lost [[Finland]] and [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] was pushed aside in a [[coup]]. Charles XIII was subsequently appointed [[regent]] and then [[king]], and after that a new form of government, the Government of 1809, was adopted. A notice of parliament which adopted the parliamentary order was issued in March 1809.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">'''Systemically important financial market utilities''' ('''SIFMUs''') are entities whose failure or disruption could threaten the stability of the [[United States]] [[Banking in the United States|financial system]]. To date eight entities in the U.S. have been officially designated SIFMUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= DTCC Nabs Three Out of Eight Spots as Systematically Important Market Utilities| work = International Securities Services Magazine |url= http://www.iss-mag.com/clearance-and-settlement/dtcc-nabs-three-out-of-eight-spots-as-systemati |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative background==

Section 804 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (DFA) provides the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) the authority to designate a financial market utility (FMU) that it determines is or is likely to become systemically important because the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant [[liquidity]] or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the United States financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{USFR|2011|18948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Financial Stability Oversight Council| title=Authority To Designate Financial Market Utilities as Systemically Important|journal=[[Federal Register]]| date=December 21, 2010 |volume=75|issue=244| url=http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/VIII%20-%20ANPR%20on%20FMU%20Designations%20111910.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

SIFMU status places an entity under enhanced regulatory oversight by the three agencies charged with regulating SIFMUs—the [[Federal Reserve Board]], [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], (SEC) and the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/financial-market-utilities.pdf |title =  Financial Market Utilities: Is the System Safer? | publisher = PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice | date=  February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further brings it under the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]'s (FDIC) resolution authority where it can be placed into [[receivership]] by the FDIC rather than reorganizing or liquidating under the supervision of a [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]].

On October 28, 2014, the [[Federal Reserve Board]] finalized its revisions to the SIFMU [[risk management]] standards. The final rule expands the implications for SIFMUs and includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sifmu-risk-management-standards.pdf |title= First Take: Ten Key Points from the FRB’s Revised SIFMY Risk Management Standards | publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice | date = November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heightened standards for [[boards of directors]];
* Comprehensive risk management framework expectations;
* Expanded recovery and resolution plan requirements;
* Rules and procedures requirements for liquidity shortfalls;
* Broader risk management requirements; and
* Enhanced disclosure requirements for financial market infrastructures.

== List of SIFMUs==

As of January 2015, the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] has designated eight companies as SIFMUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix&amp;nbsp;A (Financial Stability  Oversight Council)|date=2012|publisher=U.S. Department of Treasury|location=Washington, D.C.| url= http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/2012%20Appendix%20A%20Designation%20of%20Systemically%20Important%20Market%20Utilities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, the next two by the CFTC, and the remaining four by the SEC; the last three are all subsidiaries of the [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC), a U.S. [[Trade (financial instrument)|post-trade]] [[financial services]] company providing [[clearing (financial)|clearing]] and [[settlement (finance)|settlement]] services.&lt;ref name=sifmu&gt;{{cite web|title=Designated Financial Market Utilities (Last update: January 29, 2015)|url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/designated_fmu_about.htm | website =[[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]| accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979''' (formerly '''Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979''', commonly referred as the TIA Act) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]] which prohibits the unauthorised interception of communications or access to stored communications, with certain exceptions.&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunications interception and surveillance |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/NationalSecurity/TelecommunicationsSurveillance/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia (Attorney-General's Department)|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended by the [[Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015]].

== Access to telecommunications data under the Act ==
Under the 1979 Act, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organization (ASIO)  and ‘enforcement agencies’ can access telecommunications data by issuing an internal, or intra-organization, authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee|title=Comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Comprehensive_revision_of_TIA_Act/Report |website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=2015-05-10|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
During the 2012- 2013 inquiry into Australia’s national security legislation conducted by the [[Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security]] (PJCIS), the Attorney General’s Department issued a document detailing what it considered to be telecommunications data. This included "information that allowed a communication to occur", such as the date, time and duration of the communication, the devices involved in the communication and the location of those devices such as mobile phone tower and "information about the parties to the communication", such as their names and addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Appendix G Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS)|title=Report of the Inquiry into Potential Reform of Australia's National Security Legislation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=pjcis/nsl2012/report.htm|website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=2015-05-01|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 of the Act defines an enforcement agency to include the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the police force of a State or Territory, the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]], crime commissions, anti-corruption bodies and the [[CrimTrac Agency]]. The definition also includes an allowance enabling organizations whose remit either involves the administration of law involving a financial penalty or the administration of a law to protect taxation revenue to access telecommunications data.

The head of an enforcement agency, the deputy head of an agency or a management level officer or employee of an agency, given permission in writing by the head of the agency, have the power to authorize access to telecommunications data. For ASIO, authorizations for access to telecommunications data can only be made when individual making that authorization is "satisfied that the disclosure would be in connection with the performance by the Organization of its functions. ASIO must also comply with guidelines issued under Section 8A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. These guidelines demand that the initiation and continuation of investigations shall only be authorized by the Director General, or an officer at or above Executive Level 2 authorised by the Director-General for that purpose; and that any means used for obtaining information must be proportionate to the gravity of the threat posed and the probability of its occurrence.

In 2012-13, more than 80 Commonwealth, State and Territory enforcement agencies accessed telecommunications data under the 1979 Act. In that same time period, more than 330,640 authorizations were dispensed allowing access to data. These authorizations resulted in 546,500 disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security|title=Advisory report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/Data_Retention/Report |website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=2015-05-16|date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013-2014 comprehensive revision==
On 12 December 2013, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee began a ''Comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the Act), with regard to the recommendations of the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice report, dated May 2008, particularly recommendation 71.2; and recommendations relating to the Act from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Inquiry into the potential reforms of Australia’s National Security Legislation report, dated May 2013.''&lt;ref name="crot"/&gt;

Their report was supposed to be tabled 10 June 2014, but on 14 May 2014, the Senate granted an extension of time for reporting until 27 August 2014.&lt;ref name="crot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Comprehensive_revision_of_TIA_Act|title=Comprehensive revision of Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Right to Read''''' is a [[short story]] by [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]], which was first published in 1997 in [[Communications of the ACM]]. It is a [[cautionary tale]] set in the year 2047, when [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]-like technologies are employed to restrict the readership of books: when the sharing of books and written material is a crime punishable by imprisonment.

In particular, it touches on the impact of such a system on the requirements of university students, one (Dan Halbert) of whom is forced into a dilemma in which he must decide whether to loan his computer to a fellow student (Lissa Lenz), who may or may not illegally access his purchased documents.

It is notable for being written before the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology was widespread (although [[DVD]] video discs which used DRM had appeared the year before, and various proprietary software since the 1970s had made use of some form of [[copy protection]]), and for predicting later hardware-based attempts to restrict how users could use content, such as [[Trusted Computing]].
