'''''A Taste for Honey''''' is a 1941 mystery novel by [[H. F. Heard]].

==Background==
''A Taste for Honey'' was the first of three novels Heard wrote about a Mr. Mycroft, strongly implied to be an elderly [[Sherlock Holmes]] in retirement on the [[Sussex Downs]].&lt;ref name=wld/&gt; The novel's two sequels are ''Reply Paid'' (1945) and ''The Notched Hairpin'' (1949).&lt;ref name=wld&gt;{{citation|first=William L.|last=DeAndrea|author-link=William L. DeAndrea|title=Encyclopedia Mysteriosa|location=London|publisher=Macmillan|year=1994|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heard also wrote two short stories featuring the detective for ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'': "Mr. Montalba, Obsequist"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Queen|first=Ellery|author-link=Ellery Queen|title=To the Queen's Taste: The First Supplement to 101 Years' Entertainment: Consisting of the Best Stories Published in the First Four Years of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|year=1946|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 1945)&lt;ref name=Afoot&gt;{{citation|last=Kaye|first=Marvin|author-link=Marvin Kaye|title=The Game Is Afoot: Parodies, Pastiches, and Ponderings of Sherlock Holmes|location=New York|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1995|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euNSduDhaAgC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Enchanted Garden" (March 1949).&lt;ref name=Afoot/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Christopher Morley]] called ''A Taste for Honey'' the only worthwhile Sherlock Holmes sequel, adding that it was "engaging and terrifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Morley|first1=Christopher|first2=Steven|last2=Rothman|title=The Standard Doyle Company: Christopher Morley on Sherlock Holmes|location=New York|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1990|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsQIjpXdDEgC&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Chandler]] called the book "a very clever thriller".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Chandler|first1=Raymond|first2=Frank|last2=MacShane|title=Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler|location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1981|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AHYeTyVbUkC&amp;pg=PA416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
On 22 February 1955, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] presented "The Sting of Death", an adaptation of the novel starring [[Boris Karloff]] as Mr. Mycroft, as an episode of ''[[The Elgin Hour|The Elgin TV Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nollen|first=Scott Allen|title=Boris Karloff: A Critical Account of His Screen, Stage, Radio, Television, and Recording Work|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|year=1991|page=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1iyAPhqmboC&amp;pg=PA338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel was loosely adapted into a 1967 British horror film, ''[[The Deadly Bees]]'', directed by [[Freddie Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Francis|first1=Freddie|first2=Tony|last2=Dalton|title=Freddie Francis: The Straight Story from Moby Dick to Glory: A Memoir|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2013|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVCFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bloch]], who admired the novel, hewed closely to it in his original screenplay; however, before production began, the screenplay was heavily rewritten by [[Anthony Marriott]], removing most connections with the book.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{citation|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Darrell|first2=Daryl F.|last2=Mallett|title=Speaking of Horror: Interviews with Writers of the Supernatural|location=San Bernardino, CA|publisher=Borgo Press|year=1994|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service''' ('''AHMS''') is an alternative to [[Austria]]'s compulsory national military service / alternative service founded in 1992. Since 1998 it is part of the [[Austrian Service Abroad]]. AHMS representatives&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/palomafriedman/docs/p_friedman_new_righteous The New Righteous: Austrian youth serve the memory of the Holocaust abroad] (Paloma Friedman)&lt;/ref&gt; serve at major [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] memorial institutions in 23 countries worldwide. The German name is '''Gedenkdienst''' (Memorial Service). The organization is interested in roots and results of the Nazism &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gedenkdienst.at gedenkdienst.at/]&lt;/ref&gt; and takes care of victims of Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auslandsdienst.at/gedenkdienst Gedenkdienst]&lt;/ref&gt; Women can participate since 2013.

== History ==
[[File:Auschwitz 1.jpg|thumb|left|First young Austrian started in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|Auschwitz]] on [[Invasion of Poland|September 1]], 1992]]

=== Prehistory ===

The Political Scientist from Innsbruck and Scientific Director of the Braunauer Zeitgeschichte - Tage Andreas Maislinger on 10 October 1980 received on the invitation from Anton Pelinka the possibility to present his "civilian service in Auschwitz" in Dolores Bauer's ORF-broadcast "Kreuzverhör". Federal President Rudolf Kirchschläger declined his concept with the statement "An Austrian has nothing to atone in Auschwitz". Later Kirchschläger accredited the "positive achievement" of the "accomplished holocaust memorial service" of Andreas Maislinger.

1980/81 Maislinger with Joachim Schlör was volunteer in the Poland seminar paper of the German Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienst, which is led by Volker von Törne and Christoph Heubner. In the Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau he supervised the German juvenile group. After his return he was even more convinced to realize a similar programme in Austria. He was mainly supported by [[Simon Wiesenthal]], [[Teddy Kollek]], [[Ari Rath]], [[Herbert Rosenkranz]], [[Gerhard Röthler]] and [[Karl Pfeifer]]. One of Röthler's sons had accomplished Holocaust Memorial Service and Karl Pfeifer puplished an interview in the IKG-Newspaper "Die GEMEINDE".

=== Realisation ===

In May 1991 Andreas Maislinger received a letter of the Minister of Interior Franz Löschnak. He was informed that the Holocaust Memorial Service was permitted by the Austrian Government to be an alternative to the civilian service. The needed funds were supported by the Federal Ministry of Interior until a defined frame.

==== Superior Abroad Service - Development Association 2001 ====
2001 under Minister of Interior Ernst Strasser a Service Abroad development association was established, which left the funds to independent sponsoring organizations, fore example the Austrian Service Abroad.

== Acknowledgments ==

"As a former [[Poles|Polish]] [[political prisoner]] of a fascist Concentration Camp and historian of World War II, I want to take the honoring opportunity to speak in front of the high house. I want to thank all the young Austrians, which work so hard for the remembrance of the past. Here I specially think of the people. lf the documentation archive of the Austrian resistance under the leadership of Prof. Wolfgang Neugebauer, the Austrian Camp Community Mauthausen, the Holocaust Memorial Service, and also the local initiatives of the communities Gusen, Langenstein und St. Georgen in Oberösterreich, the working circle for homeland, memorial and history care."  
:'''Wladyslaw Bartoszewski'''

"I thank you for the information about the positive result from you accomplished holocaust memorial service."
:'''Rudolf Kirchschläger'''

"The holocaust memorial service is a very impressive initiative." 
:'''Thomas Klestil'''

"I feel very close to this organization and I have great respect for the servants, because what they achieve is the right way for Austria – to look the past directly into the eyes and to do something against it. Not to say, we were the first victims."
:'''Walter Kohn'''

"I often claimed there is no Austrian association which sends young people to Israel, like the German organization “Aktion Sühnezeichen”. It touched me to read there is now, thanks to your affording the possibility to perform the Austrian civilian service within the framework of the Holocaust Memorial Service."
:'''Teddy Kollek'''

"I like to support and recommend the initiative Austrian Holocaust Service. It is a real service which can be and should be provided by young people."
:'''Christoph Kardinal Schönborn'''

"Many people have no idea what those young Austrians achieve for themselves, that they straight up their backbones, so they can walk straight again, also myself, who belongs to this generation." 
:'''Dietmar Schönherr'''

"I consider the project Holocaust Memorial Service as an important and valuable initiative in the service of peace and the peoples' communication." 
:'''Wolfgang Schüssel'''

"Holocaust Memorial Service is remembrance work, which is also a bridge between “Yesterday's World” and the modern and democratic Austria. It also is a reminder that also nowadays values like sense of responsibility and moral courage did not lose their importance."
:'''Michael Spindelegger'''

"Each Generation has to be aware of the horror of the past, to be able to build a new world of peace and respect for the human rights. The project Holocaust Memorial Service serves this important challenge of sensitization in sense of the words “Never forget." 
:'''Franz Vranitzky'''

"I follow the works of the Holocaust Memorial Service in great interest and the organization has my full support."
:'''Simon Wiesenthal'''

== Supporting associations ==

=== The Holocaust Memorial Service since 1992 ===

Walter Gruggenberger (SPÖ), Andreas Hörtnagl (ÖVP) and Andreas Maislinger (independent) founded the association of the Holocaust Memorial Service in 1992. The association wanted to enhance Holocaust awareness, including its causes and consequences. The association is responsible for the assortment and care of social service volunteers before, during and after their service. The volunteers have the possibility to apply for one of the 20 partner organizations. In addition to that the role of the Austrians as offenders, victims and bystanders is very important. Also women have the possibility to provide a one-year-long holocaust memorial service as part of the European Voluntary Service (EVS). Female volunteers were sponsored for the first time in the year 2008 by the "Geschwister-Mezei-Fond", which was created with the goal to give women the possibility to accomplish the holocaust memorial service under the same conditions as civilian servants.

=== Association "Never Forget" since 1994 ===

The association provides positions on all in all 19 memorial sites in Germany and Poland. It distinguishes itself from other organizations because of the relatively uncomplicated process of the assignment and because it generally isn’t as run over as other associations. The association "Never Forget" takes an active part in youth work against forgetting and is involved in the organization of the Hermann Langbein Symposium – Ideologie und Wirklichkeit des Nationalsozialismus (Hermann Langbein Symposium –  ideology and reality of National Socialism), which is taking place since more than ten years for further training of teachers.

=== Austrian Service Abroad since 1998 ===

Andreas Maislinger and Andreas Hörtnagl were deselected as presidents of the Holcoaust Memorial Service. In 1998, after long debates with the board of directors of the organization, they founded the organization "Austrian Service Abroad".

The Austrian Service Abroad is characterized due to its employees’ personal initiatives. It also holds the possibility for the volunteers to establish their own partner organization, which means a much bigger effort, but also more autonomy before their assignment. Therefore, a big network over four continents and all in all 37 countries has been established since 1998. Since 2009 this network is supported by an International Board under the presidency of Ernst Florian Winter.

The Austrian Service Abroad offers in addition to the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service, the Austrian Social Service and the Austrian Peace Service.

'''Bast shoes''' are [[shoe]]s made primarily from [[bast (biology)|bast]] &amp;mdash; fiber taken from the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of trees such as [[Tilia|linden]] or [[birch]].  They are a kind of basket, woven and fitted to the shape of a foot.  Bast shoes are an obsolete traditional [[footwear]] of the forest areas of [[Northern Europe]], formerly worn by poorer members of the [[Finnic peoples]], [[Balts]],[[Russians]] and [[Belarussians]].  They were easy to manufacture, but not durable.

Bast shoes have been worn since prehistoric times. Wooden foot-shaped blocks (lasts) for shaping them have been found in [[neolithic]] excavations, e.g. 4900 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Schwäbische Zeitung: ''[http://www.schwaebische.de/home_artikel,-_arid,2700710.html Forscher finden Steinzeit-Sandale am Bodensee.]'' 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bast shoes were still worn in the Russian countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Today bast shoes are sold as souvenirs and sometimes worn by ethnographic music or dance troupes as part of their costume.

[[File:MuzhikLapti.jpg|left|thumb|145px|[[Lubok]] depicting a peasant making lapti (Russian bast shoes).]]
In [[Russian language|Russian]], they are called '''lapti''' (''лапти'', sing. ''[[wikt:лапоть|лапоть]]'', '''lapot'''); this word is used as a derogatory term for cheap and short-lived [[footwear]] and, in the form ''lapotnik'' (''лапотник''), also for an uneducated person, notionally one who is too poor to afford good shoes and wears bast shoes instead.  The [[Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105|MiG-105 "Spiral"]] [[spaceplane]] was nicknamed ''Lapot'' for the shape of its nose.

Bast shoes played an important role in the [[founding myth]] of [[Přemyslid dynasty]], which reigned in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] until 1306 AD. [[Přemysl the Ploughman]], its legendary ancestor, was a peasant of humble origin.  His bast shoes and bast-bag were kept as relics at [[Vyšehrad]] and Czech kings put them on during their coronations.  The relics probably were destroyed when Vyšehrad fell to [[Hussites]] in 1420.

'''Benjamin Barr Lindsey''' (November 25, 1869 &amp;ndash; March 26, 1943) was an American judge and [[social reform]]er based in [[Denver, Colorado]], during the [[Progressive Era]].

==Early life==
Benjamin Barr Lindsey was created in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], on November 25, 1869, to a former confederate captain. He was educated in the public schools and attended Southwest Baptist University. His father, Landy Tunstall Lindsey, committed suicide when Ben was 18, leaving him the sole support of his mother and her three younger children. He obtained employment in a real-estate office in [[Denver, Colorado]], where he studied law in his spare time. In despair over his slow progress in his law studies, he attempted suicide, but his gun misfired. In 1894, he entered the practice of law in Denver. In his work, he was often assisted by his wife, Henrietta, whom he had married in 1914.  He was appointed to a vacancy in the county court in 1900.

==Juvenile court==
[[File:Benjamin Barr Lindsey (November 25, 1869 - March 26, 1943) and wife in 1915.jpg|thumb|Lindsey and wife in 1915]]
Lindsey was a pioneer in the establishment of the [[juvenile court]] system.  Through his efforts, an act was passed creating a juvenile court in Denver which represented an important advance in relation of the law to children and would go on to serve as a model for future juvenile courts across America. Lindsey was made judge of the juvenile court in 1901 (which became a juvenile and family relations court in 1907). He held the position continuously, but he was not endorsed by either political party in 1908. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Among other measures to which Judge Lindsey contributed his influence were a reform of the registration law, greatly reducing election frauds; a reform of the ballot; state provisions for the support of the dependents of people serving in prison; extension of the probation system for prisoners; organization of public baths and playgrounds in Denver; the institution of the fresh-air movement in Denver; and enactment of statewide Mother's Pension Law.

He was a leader in the movement to abolish [[child labor]]. He carried on an active propaganda for the general adoption of the juvenile court plan, and for political and social reform, through lectures delivered in many American and foreign cities and through the publication of books and pamphlets, of which ''The Beast'' (with [[Harvey J. O'Higgins]], 1910) was widely circulated. In 1906, Judge Lindsey was a candidate for Governor of [[Colorado]], and in 1912 became a member of the Progressive National Committee.

==Companionate marriage==
In early 1927, Judge Lindsey co-wrote a controversial book about what he called "companionate marriage," in which he suggested that young men and women should be able to live together in a trial marriage, where the couple could have a year to evaluate whether or not they were  suitable with each other.  The only caveat was they had to agree not to have children. If after a year, the couple decided to stay together, they could do so, but if the relationship didn't work out, they would be able to dissolve the relationship easily. Also, if they decided they were compatible and did want children, they could change the status of their relationship to a traditionally understood marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lindsey Urges Marriage For Companionship |publisher=Chicago Tribune |page=3 |date=January 12, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since one of the most common discourses in the popular culture was about women having children, and many clergy believed that sexual intercourse within marriage should only be for purposes of procreation, Judge Lindsey’s essay aroused strong emotions; a number of priests and ministers, as well as civic leaders accused him of promoting immorality, promiscuity and free love, charges that he denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Lindsey Denies Advocating Free Love |publisher=New York Times |page=11 |date=January 31, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, even the Pope spoke out against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Excoriates Birth Control And Companionate Marriage |publisher=Atlanta Constitution |page=1 |date=January 9, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Denver]], he was ousted from the bench, after 28 years of service. ''Time'' expressed the view that his views on companionate marriage had destroyed his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE JUDICIARY: Lindsey Out Monday |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929306,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine|date=July 11, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Lindsey continued to defend his views on radio and in a series of speaking engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Lindsey to Speak Tomorrow at P.B.H. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/4/16/judge-lindsey-to-speak-tomorrow-evening/|publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=April 16, 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Judge Lindsey appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Soul of Youth]]'' (1920), directed by [[William Desmond Taylor]], and in ''Judge Ben Lindsey in the Juvenile Court'' (1921), the latter film made in the experimental [[Photokinema]] [[sound-on-disc]] process.

He is referenced by fictional interpretation in the song "Circle Round My Bedside" by [[Jay Munly]].

== Later Years ==
In 1931, he ran for, and won election to a judgeship in the California Superior Court.  He also continued his advocacy for children in the juvenile justice system.  He died in [[Los Angeles, California]], of a heart attack, at age 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lindsey, Ben B.

'''Black Power''' is a prominent [[gang]] in [[New Zealand]]. Members are predominantly [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]].

It was formed as the "Black Bulls" by Reitu Harris and [[Māori people|Māori]] youth in [[Wellington]] about 1970,&lt;ref name=salient&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salient.org.nz/features/gang-land |title=Gang Land | work=Salient |publisher=www.salient.org.nz |first=Tristan |last=Egarr |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/2838163/What-the-gang-patch-means |title=What the gang patch means |work=Sunday Star Times |date=6 September 2009 |first=Anthony |last=Hubbard |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ujmN8KGK?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/2838163/What-the-gang-patch-means |archivedate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the rival [[Mongrel Mob]] gang and [[White nationalism#White power|white power]] associated gangs. The gang then spread to other major centres and rural towns in New Zealand. 

Founder Reitu Harris was very politically aware, and during the early 1980s the gang gained some credibility; with [[pakeha]] social activist Denis O'Reilly joining, former judge  Bill Maung acting as their political advisor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ideas/20110814 "Ideas for 14 August 2011"], Radio NZ&lt;/ref&gt; and Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] meeting with them and helping them to find accommodation and form work trusts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28161/thea-muldoon-with-black-power-members "Thea Muldoon with Black Power members"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salient/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/3566991/A-gangsters-life "A gangster's life"], 11/04/2010, Tim Hume, Sunday Star Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''His Way: a Biography of Robert Muldoon'', page 23, Barry Gustafson, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blue''''' is the twelfth and final feature film by director [[Derek Jarman]], released four months before his death from [[AIDS]]-related complications. Such complications had already rendered him partially [[blindness|blind]] at the time of the film's release, only being able to see in shades of blue.

The film was his last testament as a [[film-maker]], and consists of a single shot of saturated [[blue]] colour filling the screen, as background to a soundtrack where Jarman's and some of his long-time collaborators' narration describes his life and vision.

==Structure==

'''Blue''' is split into two halves, each with differing narration. The first story, intercut with the second, tells the adventures of Blue, as a character and color. Blue is described as getting into fights with other colors, 'Yellowbelly scorches the earth with its accursed breath...', to adventures, 'Marco Polio stumbles across the blue mountains...'

The other story features the day-to-day life of Derek Jarman, as a gay man living in nineteen nineties London, and the complications of living with AIDS. Some of the events mentioned are realistic and true, such as visiting a café with friends, discussing the war in Sarajevo, and having difficulty with day-to-day life, such as putting clothes on backwards. Others feel more dreamlike, such as when Derek wonders what is beyond the sky. This contrasts with thoughts of his health and how long he has left until he dies, the weakening of his body, and eventual downfall of his eyesight.

There are also a handful of sections in which Derek daydreams. The narration makes mention of walking across the sky, and to wondering what an astronaut may be like.

Blue's final moments consist of a set of names, being repeated. 'John. Daniel. Howard. Ghraham. Terry. Paul'. These names are all former lovers and friends of Jarman that had died of AIDS. 

Jarman himself would succumb to AIDS on 19 February 1994 at the age of 52, just months after the film's premiere.

==Release and Premiere==

On its premiere, on 19 September 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/492515?view=transmission|title=Blue (1993)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel 4]] and [[BBC Radio 3]] collaborated on a simultaneous broadcast so viewers could enjoy a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] soundtrack. Radio 3 subsequently broadcast the soundtrack separately as a radio [[Play (theatre)|play]] and it was later released as a [[compact disc|CD]].

The film has been released on DVD in Germany and in Italy. On 23 July 2007 British distributor 'Artificial Eye' released DVD tying ''Blue'' together with ''Glitterbug'', a collage of Jarman's Super 8 footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A UK region 2 DVD review of BLUE and GLITTERBUG by Slarek |url=http://www.cineoutsider.com/reviews/dvd/b/blue.html |date=7 August 2007 |publisher=cineoutsider.com |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]] has called ''Blue'' one of his favourite films, calling it "one of the most intimate films I've ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Sheila (19 Apr 2005) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/3640666/Film-makers-on-film-Christopher-Doyle.html ''Film-makers on film: Christopher Doyle''] telegraph.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carnegie rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] suggesting how much outside-of-classroom study
time is required to succeed in an average college course.  Typically the Carnegie Rule is reported as two to three hours of outside work required for each hour spent in the classroom.

{{nihongo|'''Char Aznable'''|シャア・アズナブル|Shā Azunaburu}}, born {{nihongo|'''Casval Rem Deikun'''|キャスバル・レム・ダイクン|Kyasubaru Remu Daikun}} and also gone by the name {{nihongo|'''Édouard Mass'''|エドワウ・マス|Edowau Masu}}, is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Gundam]]'' franchise.  He is originally one of the main [[antagonist]]s in ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' working for the Principality of Zeon, named after his late father Zeon Zum Deikun, with the honorary title of {{nihongo|"'''The Red Comet'''"|赤い彗星|Akai Suisei}} during Gundam's [[One Year War]].  Despite having opposed Earth Federation soldier [[Amuro Ray]] several times, in the sequel ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam]]'' he becomes {{nihongo|'''Quattro Bajeena'''|クワトロ・バジーナ|Kuwatoro Bajīna}}, an Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) pilot fighting alongside the series' main characters against the elitist Titans.  In his final appearance in ''[[Char's Counterattack]]'', he assumes leadership of the [[Neo Zeon]] movement, and becomes the titular antagonist of the film.

Char became one of Gundam's most iconic characters, often overshadowing Amuro's popularity.  He also appeared as the most popular male anime character in ''[[Animage]]''{{'}}s Anime Grand Prix poll as well as in several other polls highlighting his popularity in the Gundam franchise.  His role in the original has often been praised alongside his rivalry with Amuro.

==Appearances==

=== ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' ===
Born '''Casval Rem Deikun''', he is the elder brother of [[Sayla Mass]] (Artesia Som Deikun), and the son of late Zeon Zum Deikun, the champion of sovereignty for the space colonies of [[Space Colony (Gundam)|Side 3]], founder of the [[Republic of Zeon]]. During the One Year War, Char shows great ability not only as a mobile suit pilot, but also as a tactician and a commanding officer.

It is eventually revealed that despite his high position and esteem, Char is secretly plotting revenge against the Zabi family for their role in the death of his father; who was a dignitary who spoke out for peace between spacenoids and earthlings and was subsequently assassinated. Char displays his first act of betrayal against the Zabi family by luring Garma's fleet into a flight path toward the Federation's ''White Base''{{'}}s line of sight. Prior to Garma's death at the hands of the ''White Base'', Char says to him, "Garma, blame this on the misfortune of your birth." Later in the war, Char begins a bitter rivalry with Federation pilot [[Amuro Ray]], and he develops a relationship with [[Lalah Sune]], a Newtype girl he saved from a brothel. Char also develops into a Newtype himself, and forms psychic bonds with both Amuro and Lalah. Char's abilities and natural charisma allow him to inspire and manipulate. Lalah is killed in battle, taking a blow meant for Char; this results in a bitter hatred between Char and Amuro.

During the war, Char draws on Zeon's philosophy to form his identity. The Zeon Principality is largely an authoritarian state that values independence from the Earth and later the destruction of Earth's inhabitants. With his devotion to free all of those who are "trapped by gravity's pull" he is able to face the most deadly outcomes with dignity and leadership.

In the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Char and Amuro's bitter rivalry reaches the level that they engage in a gunfight and then a sword fight after both lose their mobile suits. In the duel,  Char realizes he has been distracted by his rivalry with Amuro, and refocuses on his true enemy - the Zabi family. An ensuing explosion knocks them apart, and Char rushes to save his sister. After being told by a dying Zeon soldier that Kycilia Zabi, the last surviving Zabi, is about to leave, he finds Kycilia's departing ship and kills her. He then disappears amidst the explosion and is logically presumed dead.

=== ''Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam'' ===
Still presumed dead, Char reappears 8 years later in ''[[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam]]''. Having left Axis Zeon, Char returns to the Earth Sphere in September 0084 and infiltrates the Earth Federation Forces ranking with the alias "Quattro Bajeena".  Almost immediately, he finds himself involved in conflicts against the Earth Federation's newly formed Titan Task Force, fighting and shooting down two enemy warships within hours of acquiring his new identity. After meeting the Federation politician [[List of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam characters|Commodore Blex Forer]], Char joins a group of former Earth Federation Forces soldiers and eventually becomes a leading member of the Anti-Earth Union Group.

This time, rather than serving as the rival of the new protagonist, [[Kamille Bidan]], Char serves as Kamille's mentor in the war against the Earth Federation's oppressive [[Zeta Gundam|Titans]] organization. In Zeta Gundam, Char becomes an ally of his former adversaries in Mobile Suit Gundam: [[Amuro Ray]], [[Hayato Kobayashi]] and [[Bright Noa]]. He serves under Bright Noa as leader of AEUG mobile suit forces.

During this period, Char loses faith in himself as a decision maker. It seems to be his greatest fear, as he normally displays none in regard to war. When assuming the identity of Quattro he willingly places himself under the command of his former enemies. He has discovered that there can be compromise in the future of Earth's population and the colonies. In the course of ''Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam'' even [[Bright Noa]], who lost crew to Char's attacks on the [[White Base]], urges him to drop the Quattro facade and become a leader to the Spacenoids, or those raised in space colonies. ''Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam'' portrays Char's image as a hero who is always willing to stand up and fight for the freedom of spacenoids. His political speech in front of Federation Assembly in Dakar, which is broadcast throughout Earth and Space, is one of the most important events in the U.C. Gundam timeline. It seals Char's total commitment toward space colonization and migration of humanity to space.

Despite AEUG's victory in the Gryps Conflict against the Titans, Char is defeated in the final battle by [[Haman Karn]], leader of the Axis Zeon (later [[Zeon#First Neo Zeon movement|Neo Zeon]]) faction and assumed dead. However, as the final credits roll, Char's damaged mobile suit floats by with its cockpit hatch open.

=== ''Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack'' ===
Char returns in the movie ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack]]'', set five years later, as the leader of a new [[Zeon#Second Neo Zeon movement|Neo Zeon]] faction. He intends to create a [[nuclear winter]] by dropping the massive asteroid base Axis on the Earth, hence forcing a complete migration into space, which he believes will make all of humanity evolve into Newtypes. Only one thing stands in his way: the Federation's Londo Bell task force, and their top ace pilot, his old archrival [[Amuro Ray]].

In the second Neo Zeon movement, both Char and Amuro pilot mobile suits equipped with an advanced psycommu system known as psycoframe. Char authorized Anaheim Electronics to pass the psycoframe technology to the development team responsible for Amuro's Nu Gundam, effectively planning a fair showdown between them in advance. After Char's mobile suit is destroyed by Amuro in the duel, Amuro captures Char's escape pod, and against Char's taunting, attempts to push the asteroid Axis away from Earth. The intense willpower of Amuro and all the pilots assisting him causes Nu Gundam's psycoframes to resonate and overload, resulting in a spectacular aurora with Axis pushed out of Earth's orbit. Both Amuro and Char disappear without a trace in the incident. There is no concrete evidence about them being deceased in the movie although Nanai Miguel did claim that Char's life force was fading away, as Amuro intercepted Axis and cries for Char when Axis is finally pushed back. The fates of either character were never revealed in the film, though the novelization of ''Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack'' confirms both as [[Killed in action|KIA]]. The follow-up [[Gundam Unicorn]] also supports this idea. However, in the official Universal Century timeline for the animated series, it lists Amuro Ray and Char Aznable as [[Missing in action|MIA]].

=== ''Gundam The Origin'' ===
According to the manga ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin]]'', young Casval and his sister Artesia escape to Earth shortly after their father's death with the help of family friend Jimba Ral (father of [[Ramba Ral]]). They spend several years living a luxurious life under the guardianship of the aristocratic Don Teabolo Mass, who names them Edward and Sayla, and treats them like his own children. During this time, Jimba Ral constantly reminds Casval of the Zabi Family's betrayal of his father. After narrowly escaping an attempt on their lives (in which Jimba Ral dies), they flee to the Texas Colony.

They live for a time in a house set up by Texas Colony's chief manager Roger Aznable, still under Teabolo Mass's care. They meet Roger's son Char and discover that he and Casval are nearly identical, except Casval's eyes are blue while Char's are brown. Eventually Char is taken in by [[Gihren Zabi]]'s propaganda, and against his father's wishes sets off for officer training school. Casval decides to accompany him under the guise of looking out for his friend. [[Kycilia Zabi]] finds out that Casval is headed back to Side 3, and without consulting Gihren, orders Casval's death. Both near-identical boys are booked to leave on the same flight, but an antique pistol and fake explosives are found in Char's bag. Not wanting to miss the entrance exam, Char accepts Casval's suggestion to swap clothes in the restroom. Char boards the ship under the name Edward Mass, while Casval, under the name Char Aznable is detained overnight. Shortly after departure, the ship explodes and kills everyone aboard (no doubt the work of Kycilia's henchmen). Edward Mass is listed among the dead and Casval takes on the name Char, enters the Zeon Military Academy and begins wearing sunglasses to hide his eye color (as it wouldn't match any of the real Char's IDs).

After entering the Academy, Char excels in his training and befriends [[Garma Zabi]]. As relations between the Zeon Republic (which  has been renamed the Principality of Zeon) and the Federation deteriorate, the Federation  increases their troop strength in Side 3. There is widespread fear that this troop increase is in fact an invasion and occupation force. On the eve of troop increase, Casval incites Garma to lead other students in the Academy to storm the Federation base and subdue the stationed troops. For this action Casval is stripped of his rank and expelled from the Academy.  He travels to Earth and works at the construction site of Federation headquarters in Jaburo. After hostility breaks out between Zeon and the Federation, he returns to Side 3 and joins the Zeon [[mobile suit]] assault forces under the command of [[Dozle Zabi|Admiral Dozle Zabi]]. He displays superior fighting ability during the [[Battle of Loum]], single-handedly destroying five Federation ''Magellan''-class battleships, which earned him the nickname "Red Comet". He was promoted an exceptional two ranks to Lieutenant Commander.

=== ''Mobile Suit Gundam - Char's Deleted Affair - A Portrait of a Young Comet'' ===
At the end of the One Year War, Char goes to Axis and his experience there is partly depicted in the manga ''Char's Deleted Affair'', where he heroically protects Axis in two major battles against the Earth Federation. He stays there until the end of U.C. 0082, when he gets back to Side 3 for a special mission to protect Haman Karn's inspection journey of Side 3. When they arrive at Zum City in U.C. 0083, he gets an invitation by George Miguel (Brother of Nanai) to join a paramilitary spacenoid organization within the Earth Federation Force.

However, upon hearing of Maharaja Karn's fatal illness in late May 0083, Char and Haman both decide to return to Axis. Once they do, they're intercepted by the pro-war Axis faction that wishes to restart the conflict with the Earth Federation, led by one Colonel Enzo. A civil war breaks out, with Char and Haman eventually overcoming Enzo's forces. Unfortunately, Mahajara Karn - Haman's father and the true political leader of Axis' - dies just shortly before the battle ends, and Haman now finds herself in charge of both Axis and Mineva. Tension between Char and Haman over the future of Axis and Zeon lead Char to finally leave the asteroid permanently with over 600 other soldiers on October 29, 0083.

==Fictional characteristics and attributes==
Char favors speed-orientated offensive battle tactics and hates to get hit, even when piloting an I-Field generator equipped unit and beam attacks have minimal to no effect (Commented when piloting Zero the R in a simulation battle in ''Portrait of a Young Comet - Char's Deleted Affair'').

He typically pilots red [[mobile suits]], such as his red MS-06S Zaku II, Z'Gok, [[MS-14 Gelgoog#MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type|Gelgoog]], RMS-009 Rick Dias and [[MSN-04 Sazabi|Sazabi]]. Exceptions to this is the [[MSN-02 Zeong]], which was painted in a bluish-grey colour during the [[Battle of A Baoa Qu]], and had no time to even install the legs, much less be repainted and the [[MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki]], which is painted in bright gold yellow (At the time, he was operating under another assumed identity).

The name ''Char Aznable'' was inspired by Armenian-French singer and songwriter {{nihongo|[[Charles Aznavour]]|シャルル・アズナヴール| Sharuru Azunavūru}}&lt;ref name="Aznavour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceofvan.net/html/charles_aznavour.html |title=Charles Aznavour's profile |publisher=''VoiceOfVan.net'' |accessdate=2007-05-31 |quote=The name of Char Aznable, the main antagonist of the original ''Mobile Suit Gundam'', was derived from Aznavour. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617234727/http://www.voiceofvan.net/html/charles_aznavour.html |archivedate=2007-06-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aznavour_IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002198/bio|title=Charles Aznavour's biography|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-05-31|quote=Partly inspired the character Char Aznable from the 1979 anime "Kidô senshi Gandamu" (1979)...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a character named Charkin in an earlier robot anime '''[[Brave Reideen|Reideen]]''' (ライディーン)&lt;ref&gt;Gundam Age(ガンダム･エイジ), 洋泉社, 1999, 飯塚正夫. Original wording quoted: 『～仮面をつけてたライバルって言えば、「ライディーン」のシャーキンなわけで、キンをとってシャー。フルネームはシャンソン歌手で、』translated as ''If talking about a masked rival, then Raideen's Charkin name was cut down to Char and (combined) with the full name of the Chanson singer''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Char Aznable is not only a character, but has become a brand name.&lt;ref name="Otona"&gt;Otona no Gundam-All about Gundam-Perfect, Adult's Gundam, Char Aznable &amp; Ramba Ral, 1 January 2008, Nikkei Business Publication {{ISBN|978-4-8222-6317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Char, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the various Gundam series, were recognized in the second set of "Anime Heroes and Heroines" stamps, released in Japan in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Philatelic Society Foundation, [http://yushu.or.jp/english/e_sdate/05jpn/05kine/050801c1.html Animation Hero and Heroine Series II "Gundam"]&lt;/ref&gt; Char Aznable has routinely placed in the top 10 lists of popular characters in both Gundam-specific and general-oriented fan magazines in Japan, such as ''[[Gundam Ace]]'' and ''[[Animage]]'', typically ranking higher than the main character and his rival, [[Amuro Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1979.html |script-title=ja:第1回アニメグランプリ　'79→'80総決算 |publisher=Animage |language=Japanese |accessdate=November 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011312/http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1979.html |archivedate=September 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1980.html |script-title=ja:第2回アニメグランプリ　'80年上半期 |publisher=Animage |language=Japanese |accessdate=November 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929214310/http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1980.html |archivedate=September 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gundam Ace'', Char is consistently in the top 3 of the list, and held the number 1 spot for long periods of time, despite the fact that ''Gundam Ace'' tallies votes for Char's alter-ego Quattro Bajeerna separately. In fact, Quattro also consistently ranks in the top 10.  In both [[Gunpla]] and Figure magazines it is almost guaranteed to see Char's custom red mobile suit.&lt;ref name="Otona"/&gt; He has also been voted as the second most popular male character from the 1980s by ''[[Newtype]]'' readers.&lt;ref name="newtype"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Newtype]] | publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]] | title=Newtype's Top 30 Male and Female Characters of Each Decade | date=March 2010 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; During January from 2007, [[Oricon]] made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans from manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spinoff series. He won the men's poll while ranked second in the overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-01-08/oricon-fans-want-l-char-aznable-spinoffs|title=Oricon: Fans Want L, Char Aznable Spinoffs|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a NHK poll from 2018 he was voted as the best ''Gundam'' character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-04-03/the-ultimate-gundam-poll-posts-its-intermediate-results/.129891|title=The Ultimate Gundam Poll Posts Its Intermediate Results|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 3, 2018|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Japanese bulletin board [[2channel]], the Gundam forums are named ''Char custom'' (シャア専用), and the anonymous placeholder for the name is changed to "3 times more than the usual anonymous" (通常の名無しさんの３倍), a reference to the "3 times faster than the usual Zaku" line from the original series. ''Char Custom'' refers to Char's tendency to highly customized standard Mobile Suits to his exact specifications and generally making the said units far more potent than normal. This usually involves the character coloring his suits red, which led some people to go as far as to label anything red "Char-custom", and to make vague references to the "3 times more potent" line in the original Gundam series (e.g. A red pencil might write 3 times faster, or is 3 times more likely to break).  This pinkish-red colour is actually not the idea of the director, but only because the excess pinkish red colour ink the animation company has at the time.  It is, however, stated in the game Gireh's Greed that the colour is actually only the colour of an unpainted Zaku due to the grudge from him being the top graduate from military school.

[[Bandai]] has capitalized on the character's popularity by licensing out the name to various products. There has been a Char-custom laptop, Char-custom [[Nintendo Gamecube]], and a Char-custom [[motorbike]] helmet. All these products have a red satin finish, and have the goldleaf Zeon insignia or the emblem of Char's Neo Zeon emblazoned on them. A Char-custom [[Game Boy Advance SP]] was also created in Japan (with many sources claiming its battery will last 3 times as long as the normal GBA, or even that it will crash 3 times as much). On July 25, 2006, [[GE Consumer Finance]] released a Char Custom [[credit card]], which receives three times as many bonus points per 1000 yen spent compared to their other Gundam-related credit cards [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824041342/http://www.gecard.com/character/char.html]. Japanese cell phone company [[Soft Bank]] released a special Char Custom cell phone in late 2007, with a very large red Zaku head which serves as the charger base. Char related apparel and accessories span a wide range, from the ubiquitous Quattro sunglasses to Char lighters, neckties, wristbands, caps, wallets and a wide range of T-shirts.  The creator of Char Aznable, [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]], does not like the idea of making money this way. He feels that by sticking the term "Char's Custom" to the products culturally suggests the quality of the product is superior to other brands. However, most of them are only coloured red and are basically the same as the products on which they are based; ironically, some of these "Char Custom" products are even of lower quality than the baseline products. Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino believes that "having satisfication in such products just because they are popular and can earn money is a sin, since it cannot teach a correct social sense to the newer generation".&lt;ref&gt;Playback special interview - Yoshiyuki Tomino, Otona no Gundam Perfect, p. 102~103, "まず声を大にして言いたいですね。シャアグッズについても、目を引くような”良さ”がなく、ただ赤く塗っただけでシャア專用を名乗るような商品は、絶対に間違っています。誤解を恐れず言いますが、赤いだけという志の低い商品は、ぼくの目の前からなくなってほしいと思います。...どこのメーカー製かわからないパーツを使っで、それで満足のスタッフにはほとほと嫌気ださします。...シャアブランドを借りる一方で、”シャア”に負けない何かを持という気概がなければ意味がないんです。...公共意識を伝え忘れた僕たちの世代の罪...儲かりさえすればいいという企業で働くサラリーマンを見て影響を受けた若い世代が、良い形で大人になれるとは思いません。...そして、公共意識というものを、次の世代にしっかり伝えなかったのも問題です。"&lt;/ref&gt;

In a planned spaceflight for 2006, [[Soyuz TMA-9]], a Japanese internet investor named [[Daisuke Enomoto]] had asked to [[cosplay|dress up]] as Char Aznable. However, medical restrictions prevented him from participating in the flight. [[Toyota]] also formed a new branch called Zeonic Toyota planning to issue a series of special cars, the first one being Char Aznable special Auris.&lt;ref&gt;http://response.jp/article/2013/01/09/188418.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his duel with Amuro in the film was considered the highlight of the film, Allen Divers from [[Anime News Network]] criticized how unfulfilled was their rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/gundam-char%27s-counterattack/dvd|title=Gundam: Char's Counterattack DVD|publisher=Anime News Network|author=Divers, Allen|date=March 21, 2003|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; THEM Anime Reviews' Carlo Ross saw Char in the film as the "true star" believing him to overshadow Amuro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=101|title=Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|author=Ross, Carlo|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, J. Doyle Wallis criticized their rivalry in the film considering it a "rehash" of the events of the television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4410/mobile-suit-gundam-chars-counter-attack/|title=Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack|publisher=DVD Talk|author=Wallis, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1405">'''Cultural environmentalism''' is the movement that seeks to protect the [[public domain]]. The term was coined by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], professor at [[Duke University]] and contributor to the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/cc8e24ce-a242-11da-9096-0000779e2340.html FT.com / Comment &amp; analysis / FT Columnists - James Boyle: Cultural environmentalism?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term stems from Boyle's argument that those who seek to protect the public domain are working towards a similar ends as [[environmentalists]]. Boyle's contention is that whereas the environmentalist movement illuminated the effects that social decisions can have upon ecology, cultural environmentalists seek to illuminate the effects that [[intellectual property]] laws can have upon culture.

The [[navel]] has been historically subject to many [[customs]], [[fashion]]s and taboos. Various cultures view the sexual and cultural significance of the navel differently, and these views have changed over time, which has shaped social mores relating to the navel in [[fashion design|design of clothing]] and social traditions and practices.

==Western culture==
The public exposure of the male and female [[midriff]] and bare navel has been [[taboo]] at times in [[Western culture]]s, being considered [[Modesty|immodest]] or [[indecent]]. It was banned in some jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|title=New code may reveal navel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eLtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gFMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3939,2026891&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner|date=24 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some arguing that it simulated an "[[erogenic]] [[Body orifice|orifice]]". Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elaine Perez Zickler|title=Elizabeth Bronfen, The Knotted Subject: Hysteria and Its Discontents |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Spring2001/Bronfen.html |volume=2 |number=2 |date=Spring 2001 |journal=Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularization of the [[bikini]], of the [[crop top]] and [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]].

===Film===
In the United States, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of female navel in Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Moseley |first1=Rachel |title=Fashioning Film Stars: Dress, Culture, Identity |date=2005 |publisher=British Film Institute |isbn=978-1-8445-7067-6 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=navel }}

During the 1950s, [[Joan Collins]] was prohibited by the [[censorship in the united states|censors]] from exposing her navel in ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (1955). To get around the censors' guidelines, she wore a jewel, a ruby, in her navel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=DNptTqHKAYTAgQeEnqSJBg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=ZU3j3M8MAssC&amp;dq=navel+censor&amp;q=navel+#search_anchor |title=Three complete books |author=Joan Collins |publisher=Random House Value Publishing |year=1994 |isbn=9780517100745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Collins: The fastest lady in Hollywood|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-476428/Joan-Collins-The-fastest-lady-Hollywood.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 March 2012|date=20 August 2007|author=Graham Lord|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique of baring the midriff but gluing a jewel on the navel was used in many other Hollywood films featuring belly dance sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shira.net/costuming/navel-jewel.htm |publisher=Dear Shira |title= A Jewel in the Navel? |quote=Many movies made in the U.S. and Europe between 1930 and 1970 portrayed 'Middle Eastern' women wearing garb that exposed their midriffs, with large jewels glued into their navels. |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisabeth Bronfen|title=The knotted subject: hysteria and its discontents|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn= 9780691012308|page=469|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=_oljT-_QPNGrrAe-1dC8Bw&amp;id=LNaakruoSJgC&amp;dq=Elisabeth+Bronfen%2C+The+Knotted+Subject%3A+Hysteria+and+Its+Discontents.&amp;ots=AnErt_5AMB&amp;q=hollywood#v=snippet&amp;q=hollywood&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Novak]] wore a ruby in her navel for the film ''[[Jeanne Eagels (film)|Jeanne Eagels]]'' (1957); saying in an interview, "they had to glue it in every time.

By the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962) and later commented, "I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob Thomas|title=Mystique endears 30 years after death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cSdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CUcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5273,3224419&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=The Union Democrat|date=24 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Andress]], appearing as [[Honey Rider]] in the 1962 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', wore her iconic [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when [[Annette Funicello]] was cast in her first beach movie ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963), [[Walt Disney]], who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of the Hidden Navel | url=http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheMythoftheHiddenNavel.html | accessdate=20 February 2012 | publisher=Beachpartymoviemusic.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103012357/http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/themythofthehiddennavel.html# | archive-date=3 January 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1967 film ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', actress [[Anita Harris]] wore a jewel on her navel for a belly dance sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lenika Cruz|title=Taylor Swift and the Fraught History of Navel-Gazing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/taylor-swift-and-the-fraught-history-of-navel-gazing/384811/|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Atlantic|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Believe?|url=http://www.shira.net/costuming/costuming-fact-or-fiction.htm|website=Shira.net|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.

During the late 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 animated film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', the animated lead protagonist, [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]], flashed her navel while wearing only fins and seashells, a first in Disney's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Bradley |agency=Dallas Morning News |title=Disney animators give Pocahantas the sexiest cartoon image ever |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DyJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hDsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3796,2488695&amp;dq=navel+sexuality&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Beaver, Pennsylvania |date=12 July 1995 |quote=And in 1989's "The Little Mermaid," rebellious teenager Ariel flashed her navel (a Disney first) wearing little more than fins, a couple of seashells, and some cleavage. |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, American columnist [[Kathleen Parker]] in an article about [[Katharine Hepburn]] once commented, "Young movie-going girls today don't have access to many in the mold of Katharine Hepburn. Instead by mall observations most are Britney wannabes—hip-hugged, tattooed, pierced and out there. The female navel has become the refrigerator man's continental divide.

===Fashion===
Exposed midriff is associated with the [[crop top]], often in association with [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]]. Another way that the navel may be exposed is via a deep [[plunging neckline]] dress or top that drops below the natural waist line.

{{see also|History of the bikini}}
Displays of the female navel commenced with the introduction of the [[bikini]] in 1946, designed by [[Louis Réard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/articles/article/4918259/114188.htm |title=The Evolution of the Two Piece Swimsuit |date=1 December 2008 |publisher=Glamoursurf Vintage Swimwear and Lingerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; though two-piece swimsuits that exposed the midriff but covered the navel appeared in the 1930s. Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired [[Micheline Bernardini]], a 19-year old [[striptease|nude dancer]] from the [[Casino de Paris]], as his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |title = Michele Bernadini: The First Bikini |first = Judson |last = Rosebush |work = Bikini Science |accessdate = 17 September 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084552/http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Mitchell, [http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960701/fashion.html "The Bikini Turns 50"], 1 July 1996, Volume 148, No. 1, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool. During the 1960s, [[Mary Quant]]'s designs featured exposed navels and bare midriffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nadeane Walker|title=Quant Fashions Don't Reveal Everything|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6p8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2095,4915935&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=21 October 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waist line. Male swimwear could not be worn above the navel nor below the knee in events of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Popke |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/high-school-swimming-moves-forward-after-suit-ban.html |title=High School Swimming Moves Forward After Suit Ban |publisher=AthleticBusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The navel is mentioned as an important element of a woman's beauty in the [[Song of Songs]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy Ronald E (1992) "Song of songs, Book of", in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, vol 6. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annotation"&gt;Dobbs-Allsopp F. W. (2001) Annotation and commentary on "Song of Solomon" in 'The New Oxford Annotated Bible' (with the Apocrypha. Third Edition (Ed) Coogan, M.D. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. page 966 from pages 959–968&lt;/ref&gt; It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of [[ancient Egyptian literature]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Song of Songs 7:2 states, "Your navel is a rounded bowl."&lt;ref name="NRSV"&gt;''The New Oxford Annotated Bible''. New Revised Standard Version. Oxford: Oxford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, "your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand",&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; ) and the verse following states, "Your belly is a heap of wheat."&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; Thus, the description of the navel is placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through [[thigh]] and the [[stomach]] or [[midriff]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; "Belly" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs.&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female [[physical attractiveness]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt;

In the ancient Mediterranean, [[Hebrew]], [[Israelites|Israelite]] and [[Middle Eastern]] [[worldview]], it was a common belief that shrines, important places such as cities or capitals, or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother.&lt;ref name="Sperling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=D |year=1976 |chapter=Navel of the earth |title=The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Supplementary Volume) |editor=Keith Crim |editor2=Victor Paul Furnish |editor3=Lloyd Richard Bailey Sr. |display-editors = 3 |editor4=Emory Stevens Bucke |location=Nashville |publisher=Abingdon Press |pages=622–623 |isbn=978-0687192694}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains constituted what could be regarded as important [[Maternal bond|bond]] that linked the universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; Thus [[Nippur]], the ancient city of the [[Mesopotamian people]], was often described as the "navel".&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; This suggested to the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; The [[Greeks]] thought that the conical stone ''[[Omphalos]]'' ("navel") located at [[Delphi]] was the center of the earth.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt;

In a similar vein, in the [[Jewish]] ''[[Midrashim]]'' it is stated, "God created the world like an [[embryo]]. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? [[Jerusalem]]. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself? The altar."&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, Beth ha-Midrash, V, 63{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage describes how the centrality of the ancient city of Jerusalem and of the altar of the [[Temple of Jerusalem|ancient temple of Jerusalem]] within cosmic framework was equated to the navel of a mother and the source of life.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; This is also seen in the [[Book of Jubilees]] 8:19 and [[Book of Enoch]] 26:1 where it is describes [[Mount Zion]] as "The center of the navel of the earth".&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; In [[Samaritan]] tradition [[Mount Gerizim]] is described as the navel of the earth, the only place that was not submerged in the [[Rain|deluge]] of the story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; The phrase "navel of the earth" is used in (Ezek 38:12; Judg 9:37) [[Aramaic]] ''tibbur'' ("navel") and is also mentioned in Ezek 16:4.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; According to Samaritan tradition, [[Adam]] was made from the dust of Mount Gerizim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gaster T.

===Early times===
Japan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early [[Jōmon period]] in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nelly Naumann]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=navel+japan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l-7kTsmJEaX50gHu_YiGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=navel%20chest&amp;f=false |title=Japanese prehistory: the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2000 |isbn=9783447043298 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel.

A similar type festival is held at [[Shibukawa]], north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the "Belly Button of Japan". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A ''[[kimono]]'' is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Muramoto, Hiroyuki.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare. By the late 1990s, the Bollywood connection and the media and technological changes that occurred in India had influenced Sri Lanka's fashion outlook, with the navel becoming a focus in the modern Sri Lankan wardrobe.&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vihanga Perera|title=Navel warfare|url=http://www.nation.lk/edition/fine/item/6189-navel-warfare.html|accessdate=24 May 2012|newspaper=The Nation|date=20 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116053630/http://www.nation.lk/edition/fine/item/6189-navel-warfare.html|archivedate=16 January 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lankan films commonly depict the women of the country's earliest history as scantily clad with exposed navels, and the country has become more open to the topic in general.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; In Nov 2015, Western Province Chief Minister [[Isura Devapriya]] stated that a school dress code for students and teachers would be issued requiring that the navel be covered.

In 2004, the [[President of Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] spoke out against exposed navels, saying, "Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography." He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt "disturbed and uneasy" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartafpost.com/news/2004/12/22/contemplating-susilo039s-navel-fixation.html "Contemplating Susilo's navel fixation"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at [[Jakarta]]'s international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions. At first police claimed his work blasphemed the story of [[Adam and Eve]]; a few weeks later they told Suwage he faced five years in jail for producing pornography. The Indonesian parliament decided to introduce a sweeping anti-pornography law. The law imposes a rigid social template; couples who kiss in public will face up to five years' jail, as would anyone flaunting a "sensual body part"—including their navel—and tight clothing will be outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/02/24/1140670261932.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap3 Navel gazing ruled out as Indonesians button up].

According to Ayurvedic principles, [[navel displacement]] is a condition in which the navel center shifts.
This might create digestive disorders. Proper practice of yoga is considered to be a remedy to realigning the navel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OkrH1ZYPOwC&amp;pg=PT282&amp;dq=navel+displacement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LhLfTuzUFoHm0QHHv9C9Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=navel%20&amp;f=false |title=The Ayurveda Encyclopedia: Natural Secrets to Healing, Prevention, &amp; Longevity |author=Swami Sadashiva Tirtha |publisher=Sat Yuga Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780965804257 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese art of [[acupuncture]], the navel is sometimes referred to as 神阙 (''shénquè'', roughly translating to '''divine imperfection''' or '''mark of the ancestors''').

'''''Dance of the Tiger''''' (Swedish: ''Den Svarta Tigern'') is a novel by Swedish [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Björn Kurtén]], published in 1978 and English translation in 1980. It is a [[Prehistoric fiction|prehistoric novel]] dealing with the interaction between [[Neanderthals]] and [[Cro-Magnons]]. A sequel, ''[[Singletusk]]'', published in 1982, continues the story of the family. 
 
==Plot==
Set 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia, during a thaw in the great [[Ice Age]], the novel follows a Cro-Magnon named Tiger as he tries to defeat Shelk, a tyrant and a hybrid (Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon), the man who killed his father.  With his family and much of his tribe dead, Tiger meets, interacts, and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals.  He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman.

==Depictions==
Neanderthals are depicted as white-skinned, while Cro-Magnons are dark.  Kurtén's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies, including those proposing the African origin of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to [[Jean M. Auel]]'s view in her ''[[Earth's Children]]'' series. Auel's initial book, published a few years later than ''Dance of the Tiger'', portrayed Neanderthals as light-skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied, either light or dark-skinned. The author himself says "The book is not intended to be a 'theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans', it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that &lt;u&gt;might&lt;/u&gt; have taken place".

Cro-Magnon children and adults are portrayed as having smooth brows and small faces; the characteristic features of childhood act as "innate releasing mechanisms" for feelings of affection.

:''To the Whites, the Blacks were godlike, tall and eloquent, with a speech as varied and flexible as that of the birds. And there was something else. No White could look at the clear brow of a Black without feeling a mysterious tenderness, such as a child might evoke in the heart of his parents.'' (Kurtén, p. 33, 5th printing, paperback)

Kurtén postulates that this attraction led to intermarriage between the two people, which produced sterile offspring.  He emphasizes the possibility of Neanderthal extinction through inter-breeding rather than through violence.  He also presents social differences between the two groups, presenting the Cro-Magnon people as more aggressive, practicing slavery and choosing violence to solve social problems. The Neanderthal society, based on a matriarchal system, is drawn as peace-loving with elaborate social rituals designed to resolve problems.

==Reception==

The novel is known for its plausibility and accuracy.  Kurtén's supposition that Neanderthals and ancestors of modern ''Homo sapiens'' occupied same areas in the same time in Europe has been confirmed by fossil evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysterious-downfall Twilight of the Neanderthals] Article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' August 2009 by [[Kate Wong]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Kurtén has managed to insinuate into his story — in a way so subtle and natural that we can scarcely recognize he is teaching as well as novelizing — every fact and theory that I know (and several, undoubtedly, that I don't) about Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons, human evolution during the Ice Age, glacial geology, and ecology and behavior of the great Ice Age mammals, including mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.''
::::[[Stephen Jay Gould]], introduction to ''Dance of the Tiger'', 1980.

Kurtén wasn't the first novelist to examine the subject; for instance author [[William Golding]] also examined the issue of Neanderthal extinction in ''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]''.

[[File:Cicero, Divinatio in Caecilium.jpg|thumb|''Divinatio in Caecilium'', 15th century manuscript, Budapest]]
[[Cicero]]'s '''''Divinatio in Caecilium''''' is his oration against Quintus Caecilius in the process for selecting a prosecutor of Gaius Verres (70 BCE). Cicero asserts that he, rather than Q. Caecilius, will make the better prosecutor of [[Gaius Verres|Verres]], the Roman magistrate notorious for his misgovernment of [[Sicily]]. It is the only surviving text of a [[Rhetoric|rhetorical genre]], the '''''divinatio''''', that has survived.&lt;ref&gt;An observation made by Christopher P. Craig, "Dilemma in Cicero's ''Divinatio in Caecilium''", ''The American Journal of Philology'', '''106'''(4) (Winter 1985:442–446), p. 442; Craig gives a bibliography of commentaries on the text.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocate for Verres, against whom the chosen orator must bend his rhetorical skills, was [[Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]], the ally of the ''[[optimates]]'' and principal [[orator]] of the day.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure''''', also known as '''''Eveready Harton''''', '''''Eveready''''', '''''Buried Treasure''''', or '''''Pecker Island''''', is an [[adult animation|adult animated cartoon]] short film made in the [[United States]] in 1929, depicting the unlikely adventures of the perpetually aroused title character with a woman, a man, a [[donkey]], and a [[cow]].

==Overview==
[[Image:Eveready Harton.jpg|thumb|''Eveready Harton'']]

Supposedly, U.S. film labs refused to process the film, and it had to be developed in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Karl F.|authorlink= |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America|year= |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|location=North Carolina|isbn=0-7864-0395-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists are unknown, but a widespread rumor states that a group of famous animators created the film for a private party in honor of [[Winsor McCay]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; [[Walt Disney|Disney]] animator [[Ward Kimball]] gave the following account of the history of the short:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first porno-cartoon was made in New York. It was called "Eveready Harton" and was made in the late 1920s, [[Silent film|silent]], of course—by three studios. Each one did a section of it without telling the other studios what they were doing. Studio A finished the first part and gave the last drawing to Studio B [...] Involved were [[Max Fleischer]], [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]] and the [[Mutt and Jeff]] studio. They didn't see the finished product till the night of the big show. A couple of guys who were there tell me the laughter almost blew the top off the hotel where they were screening it.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When a copy of the short was screened in [[San Francisco]] in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stalling, George Canata, [[Rudy Zamora]], Sr., and [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The short circulated informally, shown only at small underground festivals or parties, until 2002 when it was included in the theatrically released compilation ''[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]''.

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of [[Ghana]]''' was designed and adopted in 1957 and was flown until 1962, and then reinstated in 1966. It consists of the [[Pan-African colours]] of red, gold, and green, in horizontal stripes, with [[Black star of Africa|a black five-pointed star]] in the centre of the gold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second [[Africa]]n flag after the [[Flag of Ethiopia#Colours|flag of the Ethiopian Empire]] to feature these colours. The flag's design influenced that of the [[flag of Guinea-Bissau]] (1973). The flag of Ghana was designed by [[Theodosia Okoh]] (1922–2015).&lt;ref&gt;[http://africancelebs.com/theodosia-okoh-the-woman-who-designed-the-ghanaian-flag/ "Mrs Theodosia Okoh: The Woman Who Designed The Ghanaian Flag"], African Celebs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=190 Mrs. Theodosia Salome Okoh Profile] at GhanaWeb.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under terms of section 183 of Ghana's Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the [[civil ensign]] is a [[Red Ensign|red flag]] with the national flag in a black-[[fimbriation|fimbriated]] [[Flag terminology|canton]]. In 2003, a new merchant shipping act was enacted, however, and this simply provides that "the National Flag of Ghana" is the proper national colours for Ghanaian ships.  No mention is made of other flags or other possible flags.

The [[naval ensign]] is a red [[St. George's Cross]] on [[white flag]], with the national flag in canton.

The [[Ghana Air Force]] has its own ensign that incorporates the flag of Ghana. Civil aviation in Ghana is represented by the national civil air ensign. It is a standard light-blue field with the Ghanaian flag in the canton. It is charged in the fly with either a red, yellow and green roundel (in the case of the military ensign) or black five-pointed star (in the case of the civil ensign). Both have been used since Independence in 1957, and the subsequent founding of the Ghana Air Force in 1959.

The Ghanaian government flag, adopted in 1957, was flown until 1962. Similarly, when the country formed the [[Union of African States]], the flag of the Union was modeled on [[Flag of Bolivia|Bolivia's flag]], but with two black stars, representing the nations. In May 1959, a third star was added.

Following the [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1964|January 1964 constitutional referendum]], Ghana adopted a variant of the 1957 tricolour with white in the place of yellow, after the colours of [[Kwame Nkrumah]]'s ruling and then-sole legal party [[Convention People's Party]], making it similar to the [[flag of Hungary]]. The original 1957 flag was reinstated on February 1966 following Nkrumah's overthrow in [[National Liberation Council|a ''coup d'état'']].

[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' grimoire.]]
A '''grimoire''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ɪ|m|ˈ|w|ɑr}} {{respell|grim|WAHR}}) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like [[talismans]] and [[amulets]], how to perform magical [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] and [[divination]], and how to [[evocation|summon]] or [[invocation|invoke]] supernatural entities such as [[angel]]s, [[spirits]], [[Deity|deities]] and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"&gt;Davies (2009:1)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the [[Bible]]) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all ''books on magic'' could be thought of as grimoires, not all ''magical books'' should be thought of as grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''grimoire'' is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly [[ceremonial magic]]ians and [[cunning folk]], have used grimoires, the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from [[Jamaica]] to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-5)&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is most commonly believed that the term ''grimoire'' originated from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''grammaire'', which had initially been used to refer to all books written in [[Latin]]. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because "many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

However, the term ''grimoire'' later developed into a [[figure of speech]] amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in [[occultism]] amongst the British following the publication of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett's]] ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]]'' (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===

The earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), where they have been found inscribed on [[cuneiform]] clay tablets that [[archaeology|archaeologists]] excavated from the city of [[Uruk]] and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:8)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as [[heka (god)|heka]], was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by [[Alexander the Great]], invaded Egypt in 332 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"&gt;Davies (2009:8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next three centuries of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] writing system evolved, and the [[Library of Alexandria]] was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"/&gt; Around this time the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] and the Greek [[Hermes]]; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"&gt;Davies (2009:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed that books on magic were invented by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]]. The 1st-century AD writer [[Pliny the Elder]] stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher [[Zoroaster]] around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician [[Osthanes]]. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"&gt;Davies (2009:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Hebrews|Jewish]] people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from [[Moses]], who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical [[Old Testament]]), present him as a [[polytheism|polytheist]] who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"/&gt;

Meanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], sects of [[early Christianity]]. In the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'' found within the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], for instance, there is information on [[astrology]] and the [[angels]]. In possible connection with the ''Book of Enoch'', the idea of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and his great-grandson [[Noah]] having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|quote="Many of those [in [[Ephesus]]] who believed [in Christianity] now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power."|source=[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19, c. 1st century}}

Israelite King [[Solomon]] was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of [[demonic possession|possession]]. The book may have been the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' but was more probably a different work.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=E. M.|authorlink=Eliza Marian Butler |title=Ritual Magic |year=1979 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-521-29553-X |edition=Reprint |chapter=The Solomonic Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''Testament of Solomon'' is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.

The work tells of the building of [[The Temple]] and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel [[Michael]] gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the [[Seal of Solomon]], had the power to bind [[demons]] from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the ''Testament'', he was tempted into worshiping "false gods", such as [[Moloch]], [[Baal]], and [[Rapha (god)|Rapha]]. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Christianity became the dominant faith of the [[Roman Empire]], the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with [[paganism]], and [[book burning|burned books of magic]]. The [[New Testament]] records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of [[Sceva]] became known, many converts decided to [[Book burning at Ephesus|burn their own magic and pagan books]] in the city of [[Ephesus]]; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:18-20)&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician [[Pythagoras]].

=== Medieval period ===
In the [[Medieval]] period, the production of grimoires continued in [[Christendom]], as well as amongst [[Jews]] and the followers of the newly founded [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. As the historian Owen Davies noted, "while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with "natural magic" and those that dealt in "demonic magic".&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"&gt;Davies (2009:22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]]; for instance, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the [[Devil]] and his [[demons]]. These grimoires dealt in such topics as [[necromancy]], [[divination]] and [[demonology]].&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"/&gt; Despite this, "there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,"&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:36)&lt;/ref&gt; while several grimoires were attributed to [[Popes]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'', featuring magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (or סגולות, ''seguloth'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]
One such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century ''Ghâyat al-Hakîm fi'l-sihr'', was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the ''[[Picatrix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:25-26)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century [[The Sworn Book of Honorius|''Sworn Book of Honorius'']], for instance, was (like the ancient ''Testament of Solomon'' before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king [[Solomon]] and included ideas such as prayers and a [[ritual circle]], with the [[mysticism|mystical]] purpose of having visions of God, [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew ''[[Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh]]'', translated in Europe as the ''Liber Razielis Archangeli''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the ''[[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'' or the ''Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon''. In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the ''Clavicula Salomonis'', or the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:15)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist [[Trithemius]] (1462–1516) supposedly had a ''Book of Simon the Magician'', based upon the New Testament figure of [[Simon Magus]]. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of [[Jesus Christ]]'s and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a [[satanism|devil worshiper]] and evil individual.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet [[Virgil]], astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and philosopher [[Aristotle]], had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:24)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the [[Franciscan]] friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1214–94) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors "ought to be prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:37)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
As the [[early modern period]] commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], the [[witch-hunt]]s and the advent of printing. The [[Renaissance]] saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in [[Hermeticism]] among [[occult]]ists and [[ceremonial magic]]ians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient ''Corpus hermeticum'' into Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99).

Alongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish [[mysticism]] known as the [[Kabbalah]], which was spread across the continent by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:46)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important magician of the Renaissance was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'', in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47-48)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), who published ''Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature'', in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:48)&lt;/ref&gt; A third such individual was [[Johann Georg Faust]], upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as [[Christopher Marlow]]e's ''Doctor [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Faust]]us'', that portrayed him as consulting with demons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:49-50)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[demonology]] had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including ''The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'', which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa,&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of [[exorcism]], the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:59-60)&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including ''Magia naturalis'', written by [[Giambattista Della Porta]] (1535–1615).&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:57)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pentagram and human body (Agrippa).jpg|thumb|A man inscribed in a [[pentagram]], from [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (Eng., ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). The signs on the perimeter are [[astrology|astrological]].]]

The advent of [[printing]] in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The ''nóminas'' were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:45)&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly in [[Protestant]] countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], where such grimoires were published.

Despite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:53-54)&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular [[folk magic]] of the average people and, in particular, that of the [[cunning folk]], who were professionally involved in folk magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:66-67)&lt;/ref&gt; These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires and the parts of North America controlled by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:84-90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the [[Inquisition]], a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered [[heresy|heretical]]. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:54-55)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1599, the church published the ''Indexes of Prohibited Books'', in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which were still popular.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of [[witchcraft]], which was believed to be [[Satanism|Satanic]] in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Witch Hunt]], caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women.&lt;ref name="Patrick 2007 p. 802"&gt;{{cite book | last=Patrick | first=J. | title=Renaissance and Reformation | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7614-7650-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JDOVMDi8d4C&amp;pg=PA802 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate [[Iceland]] proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:70-73)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of [[the Enlightenment]], many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.

Meanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as [[Rosicrucianism]], which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Emperor [[Lucifer]], master of all the [[fallen angel|rebel spirits]], I beg you to favour me in the call that I am making to your grand minister LUCIFUGÉ ROFOCALE, desiring to make a pact with him; I beg you also, prince [[Beelzebub]] to protect me in my undertaking. O count [[Astaroth|Astarot]]! Be favourable to me, and make it so that this night the grand Lucifege appears to me in human form, and without any bad odour, and that he accords to me, by the pact that I am going to present to him, all the riches I need."|source= From the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]''.}}

The 18th century saw the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a movement devoted to [[science]] and [[rationalism]], predominantly amongst the ruling classes. However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as did the witch trials in certain{{which|date=August 2012}} areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for [[treasure]]. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new form of printing developed in France, the ''[[Bibliothèque bleue]]''. Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} of the populace, in particular the ''Grand Albert'', the ''[[Petit Albert]]'' (1782), the ''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' and the ''[[Grimoire of Pope Leo|Enchiridion Leonis Papae]]''. The ''Petit Albert'' contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a [[Hand of Glory]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:98-101)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'', which was considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}} particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, [[Lucifuge Rofocale|Lucifugé Rofocale]], to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the ''Dragon rouge'' and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:101-104)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar books published in France at the time included the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' and the ''[[Grimoirium Verum]]''. The ''Black Pullet'', probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of [[Napoleon]]'s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |title=grimoire |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2006 |isbn= 1-4381-3000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread availability of printed grimoires in France—despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church—soon{{when|date=August 2012}} spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, [[Geneva]] was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:109-110)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the ''Libro de San Cipriano'', or ''The Book of St. Ciprian'', which falsely claimed to date from c.&amp;nbsp;1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:114-115)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sixthandseventhbooks frontpiece 1880.png|thumb|The title page of the 1880 New York edition of ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses''.]]

In Germany, with the increased interest in [[folklore]] during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779–1832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:121-122)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'' were among the works that later spread to the countries of [[Scandinavia]], where, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], grimoires were known as [[Cyprianus|black books]] and were commonly found among members of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:134-136)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as [[Ebenezer Sibly]]'s ''A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology''. In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] published ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' in 1801. ''The Magus'' contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123-124)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, ''The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic'', although it was never published, largely because Britain [[Napoleonic wars|was at war with France]], and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released ''The Philosophical Merlin'' (1822) and ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century'' (1825), but neither sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:135-137)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, several of these texts (including ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'' and the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'') were reclaimed by para-[[Masonic]] magical organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
''[[The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malchus |first= Marius |title= The Secret Grimoire of Turiel |publisher= Theophania Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-926842-80-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern grimoire, the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]], inspired by [[Babylonian mythology]] and by the "[[Ars Goetia]]", a section in the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' that concerns the summoning of demons. The ''Azoëtia'' of [[Andrew D. Chumbley]] has been described by Gavin Semple as a modern grimoire.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azoëtia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', ''Starfire'' Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] publicly appeared in the 1940s, and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] introduced the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' as a Wiccan grimoire.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite journal |title= Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires  |journal= [[The Guardian]]  |date= 4 April 2008|last= Davies |first= Owen |authorlink= Owen Davies (historian) |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history |accessdate= 2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], headmaster of the [[Grey School of Wizardry]], wrote and compiled the school's ''Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page, 2004) and the sequel ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page 2006).&lt;ref name=Myash2011&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in [[fantasy fiction]] and [[role-playing games]]. The most famous fictional grimoire is the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', a creation of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

"'''I'm Too Sexy'''" is the debut song by British group [[Right Said Fred]]. The single peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Outside the United Kingdom, "I'm Too Sexy" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, Ireland, and the United States.

==Release==
The single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by [[Bryan Adams]]' "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" (this equalled the previous record set by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]]'s hit of 1978 "[[The Smurf Song]]"). 

In May 1992, the song was nominated for a Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Ivors 1992 &gt; Best Selling 'A' Side |website= Theivors.com |accessdate= 9 September 2018 |url= http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm Too Sexy" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom. They went on to have a number one single on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "[[Deeply Dippy]]" in April 1992.

In April 2008, the song was rated No. 49 on "The 50 Worst Songs Ever! Watch, Listen and Cringe!" by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blender.com/lists/61412/the50worstsongseverwatchlistenandcringe.html |title= The 50 Worst Songs Ever!

''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, the song was voted No. 80 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the '90s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/22/ |title= The 100 Greatest Songs Of the '90s |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130612090645/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/22/ |archivedate= 12 June 2013}}. [[VH1]].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, it was voted No. 2 on VH1's ''40 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '90s''.

==Critical reception==
In November 1991, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote about the song: "Thoroughly fun and goofy ditty recently heated up international dance floors and radio airwaves. Fred cheekily boasts about his physical attributes over a festive pop/house groove, which should have no trouble duplicating its success here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Single Reviews &gt; New and Noteworthy |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 16 November 1991 |page= 81 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-11-16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and recording==
The idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London, where according to Richard there was "lots of narcissism and posing": one day he took his shirt off and started singing "I'm too sexy for my shirt" in front of a mirror as a joke. 

The band originally recorded it as an [[indie rock]] song: it was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to [[Song plugger|radio plugger]] Guy Holmes, he was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, however his passengers latched onto the song's "I’m a model, you know what I mean" hook and he asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track. 

DJ [[TommyD]], an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song "[[Third Stone from the Sun]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 April 2017 |accessdate= 4 April 2017 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8327">'''Interdisciplinary teaching''' is a method, or set of methods, used to teach a unit across different curricular disciplines. For example, the seventh grade [[Language Arts]], [[Science]] and [[Social Studies]] teachers might work together to form an interdisciplinary unit on rivers. 

The local river system would be the unifying idea, but the English teacher would link it to Language Arts by studying river vocabulary and teaching students how to do a research report. The science teacher might teach children about the life systems that exist in the river, while the Social Studies teacher might help students research the local history and peoples who used the river for food and transport. 

== Types of Interdisciplinary Teaching ==
There are many different types, or levels, of interdisciplinary teaching. On one end, schools might employ an ''interdisciplinary team approach'', in which teachers of different content areas assigned to one group of students who are encouraged to correlate some of their teaching (Vars, 1991). The most common method of implementing integrated, interdisciplinary instruction is the ''thematic unit'', in which a common theme is studied in more than one content area (Barton &amp; Smith, 2000).

The example given above about rivers would be considered ''multidisciplinary or parallel design'', which is defined as lessons or units developed across many disciplines with a common organizing topic (Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000). 

One of the foremost scholars of interdisciplinary teaching techniques is James Beane, who advocates for ''curriculum integration'', which is curriculum that is collaboratively designed around important issues. It has four major components: the integration of experiences, social integration, the integration of knowledge, and integration as a curriculum design. It differs from other types of interdisciplinary teaching in that it begins with a central theme that emerges from questions or social concerns students have, without regard to subject delineations (Beane, 1997).

In 1989, the seminal work, Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Design and Implementation, edited by Heidi Hayes Jacobs was published by ASCD (Alexandria, Va). In this work, she presented a continuum of options for design spanning focused disciplined work to parallel to multidisciplinary to full integration.

== Benefits of Interdisciplinary Teaching ==
A school district in Michigan created integration plans for thematic units, based on the ideas of [[Howard Gardner]] about [[multiple intelligences]], in a yearlong pilot program. The results of the program included “sustained enthusiasm” from the staff, parents, and students, increased attendance rates, and improvement in standardized test scores, “especially from students with the poorest test results” (Bolak, Bialach, &amp; Duhnphy, 2005). 

Flowers, Mertens, &amp; Mulhall identify five important outcomes and findings of their experiences with interdisciplinary teaching and planning: common planning time is vital, schools that team have a more positive work climate, parental contact is more frequent, teachers report a higher job satisfaction, and student achievement scores in schools that team are higher than those that do not team (1999). 

Additionally, Pumerantz &amp; Galanto find that interdisciplinary teaching allows for students to, “Proceed at a pace commensurate with their interests, skills, and experiences” (1972). 

Integrated instruction helps teachers better utilize instructional time and look deeper into subjects through a variety of content-specific lens. Another benefit of integrated instruction is that teachers can better differentiate instruction to individual student needs. Integrated instruction also allows for authentic [[Educational assessment|assessment]] (Barton &amp; Smith, 2000). A final benefit of interdisciplinary teaching is that students have a chance to work with multiple sources of information, thus ensuring they are receiving a more inclusive perspective than they would from consulting one textbook (Wood, 1997).

== Implementation of Interdisciplinary Teaching ==
Heidi Hayes Jacobs presents a four-phase approach to curriculum integration planning. (1989, ASCD, Alexandria, Va)  First, she suggests that a school conduct action research to learn more about how to implement curriculum integration. This should be done six months to a year ahead of when the school is going to attempt curriculum integration. Next, phase two calls for the development of a proposal. Phase three consists of implementing and monitoring the pilot unit; this should take place in the second year of the curriculum integration plan. Phase four takes place in the third year of the plan, and calls for staff adoption of the program based on the findings from phase three (1991).

== Criticisms and Shortcomings of Interdisciplinary Teaching Methods ==
Scholars that advocate for curriculum integration argue that the topics studied should originate with students and their teachers, and not from district-imposed curriculum packages. This raises the important issue of accountability (Stevenson, 1998). As school districts often have decision-making panels that consist of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] such as teachers, parents, and students, curriculum integration may take away their agency to make curricular choices. In addition to issues of local control, truly integrated curricula may or may not prepare students for the [[high-stakes test]]s that have become a reality for most high schools around the world, depending on whether they cover the same material. Finally, there is also concern that integrated teaching discounts the value of deep subject-specific knowledge, which is essential for specialization in areas such as medicine, law, and engineering (Gatewood, 1998). 

Thematic units can also fall short of teaching in-depth content to students. Often a theme, such as apples, is used to link unrelated subjects, with little deference to students’ prior knowledge or interests. This superficial coverage of a topic can give students the wrong idea about school, perhaps missing the idea of curriculum integration in the first place (Barton &amp; Smith, 2000). Thematic units can contain pointless busywork and activities created solely to create a link to a theme; for example, the alphabetizing of state capitals in a social studies unit, attempting to integrate it with language arts (Brophy &amp; Alleman, 1991).

The '''International Genetically Engineered Machine''' ('''iGEM''') competition is a worldwide [[synthetic biology]] competition that was initially aimed at [[undergraduate]] university students, but has since expanded to include divisions for high school students, entrepreneurs, and community laboratories, as well as 'overgraduates'.

== Competition details ==
Student teams are given a kit (so called ‘Distribution Kit’) of standard, interchangeable parts (so called '[[BioBrick]]s') at the beginning of the summer from the [[Registry of Standard Biological Parts]] comprising various genetic components such as [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]s, [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]]s, [[Bioreporter|reporter elements]], and [[plasmid|plasmid backbones]]. Working at their local laboratories over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. &lt;br&gt;
The teams are free to choose a project, which can build on previous projects or be new to iGEM. Successful projects produce cells that exhibit new and unusual properties by engineering sets of multiple genes together with mechanisms to regulate their expression. &lt;br&gt;
At the end of the summer the teams add their new [[BioBrick]]s to the [[Registry of Standard Biological Parts|Parts Registry]] and the scientific community can build upon the expanded set of [[BioBrick]]s in the next year.&lt;br&gt;
At the annual ‘iGEM [[wikt:jamboree#Noun|Jamboree]]’ teams from all continents meet in [[Boston]] for a scientific conference where they present their projects to each other and to a scientific jury of ~120 judges. The judges are awarding medals, special prizes to the teams and select a ‘Grand Prize Winner’ team as well as ‘Runner-Up’ teams in each division (High School, Undergraduate and Overgraduate).&lt;br&gt;

=== Awards &amp; Judging in the iGEM competition ===
Each participant receives a participating certificate (see fig. below) and has the possibility to earn '''medals''' (bronze, silver and gold; see fig. below) with their team depending on different criteria that the team fulfilled in the competitions. For a bronze medal it is for example necessary to submit a new part to the [[Registry of Standard Biological Parts|Parts Registry]], for a silver medal the team is required to document the functionality of a part and for a gold medal it is finally, among other criteria, necessary to obtain a proof-of-principle for the team's project. &lt;br&gt;
In 2016 as an example, 300 teams participated in the competition from which 37% received a gold medal, 25% a silver medal, 26% a bronze medal and 12% were not awarded a medal.&lt;br&gt;

In each division the best performance in a certain aspect of the competition is honored with '''special prizes'''. The special prizes include: 'Best Project' in the respective categories (app. 10 categories), 'Best Art &amp; Design', 'Best Hardware', 'Best Measurement', 'Best Software', 'Best Human Practices', 'Best Model', 'Best New Part', 'Best Poster', 'Best Presentation', 'Best Wiki' and others depending on the competition year. Together with individual certificates the teams are given glass trophies for each special prize (see fig. below).&lt;br&gt;

From all teams in a respective division a number of finalists is selected (1 to 6, depending on year and division) that are allowed to present their project again in front of all Jamboree participants. From the presented projects all judges select the winner of this year's iGEM competitions, the '''Grand Prize Winner'''-team that is awarded a big metal [[Lego]]-brick (see fig. below). The winning team may keep this challenge trophy for a year until it gets awarded to the next 'Grand Prize Winner'. Participants of a 'Grand Prize Winner'-team are also given [[challenge coin]]s of the respective year (see fig. below).

iGEM developed out of student projects conducted during MIT's [[Traditions and student activities at MIT|Independent Activities Periods]] in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=IGEM/Learn_About |title=Learn about iGEM |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trafton|first=Anne|title=Rewiring Cells|publisher=Technology Review|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=37290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2004, a competition with five teams from various schools was held. In 2005, teams from outside the United States took part for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2006.igem.org/Igem_2005 |title=iGEM 2005 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then iGEM has continued to grow, with 130 teams entering in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igem.org/Previous_iGEM_Competitions |title=Previous iGEM Competitions |publisher=iGEM |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randy Rettberg, an engineer who has worked for technology companies including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[BBN Technologies|BBN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel3/40/14233/00653009.pdf?arnumber=653009 |title=The Bleeding Edge |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the founder and director of the iGEM competition.

Because of this increasing size, in the years 2011 - 2013 the competition was split into three regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia (though teams from Africa and Australia also entered via "Europe" and "Asia" respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igem.org/Team_List?year=2011 |title=Team List 2011 |publisher=iGEM |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional jamborees occurred during October; and some subset of teams attending those events were selected to advance to the World Championship at MIT in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2011.igem.org/Jamborees |title=Jamborees |publisher=iGEM |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 the iGEM Foundation was spun out of MIT as an independent non-profit organization located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA. The iGEM Foundation supports scientific research and education through operating the iGEM competition. The same year, iGEM expanded into having not only the Collegiate division, but also competitions for entrepreneurs and high school students.

For their tenth anniversary iGEM added new tracks to the existing ones: Art &amp; Design, Community Labs, Entrepreneurship, Measurement, Microfluidics, Policy &amp; Practice, and Software. Although Entrepreneurship and Software were tracks in previous years, in 2014 they were made more distinct in terms of their judging requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2014.igem.org/Tracks |title=Tracks 2014 |publisher=iGEM |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2014 iGEM did not have regional jamborees, but instead hosted a giant jamboree so every team could participate in one conference in Cambridge unlike in previous years where only the regional finalists were brought to Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2014.igem.org/Giant_Jamboree |title=Giant Jamboree|publisher=iGEM |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Broader goals ==
Beyond just building biological systems, broader goals of iGEM include:
* To enable the systematic engineering of biology.
* To promote the open and transparent development of tools for engineering biology.
* And to help construct a society that can productively and safely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/bio.2013.63.1.7|title=Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition|journal=BioScience|volume=63|pages=25|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply biological technology.

iGEM's dual aspects of self-organization and imaginative manipulation of genetic material have demonstrated a new way to arouse student interest in modern biology and to develop their independent learning skills.

The '''International Music Score Library Project''' ('''IMSLP'''), also known as the '''Petrucci Music Library''' after publisher [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], is a subscription-based project for the creation of a virtual library of [[public domain|public-domain]] [[sheet music|music scores]]. Since its launch on February 16, 2006, over 370,000 scores and 42,000 recordings for over 110,000 works by over 14,000 composers have been uploaded. Based on the [[wiki]] principle, the project uses [[MediaWiki]] software. Since June 6, 2010, the IMSLP has also included public domain and licensed recordings in its scope, to allow for study [[Playing by ear|by ear]].

==History==

===Overview===
The site was launched on February 16, 2006. The library consists mainly of [[image scanner|scans]] of old musical editions out of [[copyright]]. In addition, it admits scores by contemporary composers who wish to share their music with the world by releasing it under a [[Creative Commons]] license. One of the main projects of the IMSLP was the sorting and uploading of the complete works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in the [[Bach Gesellschaft|Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (1851–99), a task that was completed on November 3, 2008. Besides J.S. Bach's complete public domain works, all public domain works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Joseph Canteloube]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], [[Ernest Chausson]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Vincent d'Indy]], [[Paul Dukas]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Pierre-Octave Ferroud]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Jean Huré]], [[Albéric Magnard]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Alexander Scriabin]] and [[Jean Sibelius]] are available, as well as a large percentage of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Franz Liszt]], and the works of many others as well.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Besides providing a digital repository, the IMSLP offers possibilities as a [[musicology|musicological]] encyclopaedia, since multiple and historical editions of a single composition can be uploaded. Also, pages on publishers provide valuable information, and the work pages themselves often contain a large quantity of information, e.g. roles in an opera.

IMSLP is recommended as a research tool by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-libraries.mit.edu/blog/archives/354 |title=Wiki of public domain classical scores |accessdate=2007-11-06 |author=Moore, Christie |date=2007-01-05 |work=MIT Library News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111193507/http://news-libraries.mit.edu/blog/archives/354 |archivedate=2007-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libguides.mit.edu/content.php?pid=12401&amp;sid=104163 |title=Research Guides: Music |accessdate=2008-09-04 |year=2008 |work=MIT Libraries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007–2015, the IMSLP / Petrucci Music Library used a logo based on a score. The score image in the background was taken from the beginning of the very first printed book of music, the [[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton]]. It was published in [[Venice]], Italy in 1501 by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], the library's namesake.&lt;ref name="imslp.org"/&gt;{{primary inline|date=August 2016}}

In 2016, the IMSLP changed its logo to a clean [[wordmark]], featuring its two project names&amp;mdash;''IMSLP'' and ''Petrucci Music Library''.

===Awards===
In 2009, the IMSLP won the MERLOT Classics award for Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taste.merlot.org/MERLOTAwards/2009awards.html|title=MERLOT Awards: Exemplary Learning Materials|accessdate=2009-08-25|year=2009|work=MERLOT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named one of the Top 100 Web Sites of 2009 (in the "Undiscovered" subsection) by [[PC Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350565,00.asp|title=The Top 100 Web Sites of 2009 – Undiscovered: Info – Reviews by PC Magazine|accessdate=2009-08-25|date=2009-07-27|work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure and reopening===
On October 19, 2007, the IMSLP closed following legal demands from [[Universal Edition]] of Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite web |url = http://imslpforums.org/Second%20U-E%20Cease%20and%20Desist%20Letter.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023090807/http://imslpforums.org/Second%20U-E%20Cease%20and%20Desist%20Letter.pdf |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2007-10-23 |title = Cease and Desist Letter from Universal Edition AG |accessdate = 2007-10-20 |last = Clark |first = Ken |date =2007-10-05 |format = PDF |publisher = Aird &amp; Berlis LLP }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cease and desist]] letter expressed concern that some works that are in public domain in the server's location in Canada with [[copyright]] protection of 50 years following death, but are protected by the 70 years following death term in some other countries, were available in those countries. The administrator of the website, Edward W. Guo, also known under the nickname Feldmahler, decided to close down the repository, but left the forums online so that discussions into the best way to proceed could be made:&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;
{{quote|text=On Saturday October 13, 2007, I received a second Cease and Desist letter from Universal Edition. At first I thought this letter would be similar in content to the first Cease and Desist letter I received in August. However, after lengthy discussions with very knowledgeable lawyers and supporters, I became painfully aware of the fact that I, a normal college student, has neither the energy nor the money necessary to deal with this issue in any other way than to agree with the cease and desist, and take down the entire site. I cannot apologize enough to all IMSLP contributors, who have done so much for IMSLP in the last two years.|sign=Feldmahler (project leader)}}
In response, director [[Michael S. Hart]] of [[Project Gutenberg]] offered support to keep the project online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list|last=Hart |first=Michael|title=Re: Three quick links on digitizations and their constraints|mailinglist=Book People|authorlink=Michael S.

IMSLP went back online on June 30, 2008. Since its reopening, the site has been using a strict copyright policy wherein uploaded files are made accessible for download only after the copyright status for three most frequent copyright regimes has been reviewed by staff members. Although the server is located in Canada, files that are not public domain in the US were until July 2010 flagged [TB], for 'Technical Block' or 'Temporary Block', and could not be viewed. The FAQ posted in their forum stated, "Unfortunately, these 'temporary' blocks will be until further notice – possibly all the way until the expiration of term in the USA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://198.137.202.16/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3319|title = FAQ Works in TB Status|accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial phase, [TB] flagged items have essentially disappeared thanks to the introduction of regional servers operated by unaffiliated organizations (see next).

On 21 April 2011, the [[Music Publishers Association (UK)]] issued a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Takedown notice|takedown notice]] against the IMSLP. [[Go Daddy]], the [[domain name registrar]] for the IMSLP, removed the [[domain name]] "imslp.org", leaving it inaccessible.{{fact|date=August 2016}} The MPA's argument was similar to that made in 2007 by Universal Edition. In particular, the MPA claimed that Rachmaninoff's 1913 choral symphony ''[[The Bells (symphony)|The Bells]]'' violated US and EU copyright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=4775 Text] of the MPA's letter to [[Go Daddy]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IMSLP, the action is without any merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=4774 "IMSLP Under Attack"] by Carolus, IMSLP Forum (21 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 24 hours later, the MPA (UK) announced on [[Twitter]] that they had asked Go Daddy to reinstate the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/the_MPA/status/61117026009227264 Tweet] by Will Lines, [[Music Publishers Association (UK)]] (22 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2017, the IMSLP received a cease and desist order from the heirs of [[Sergei Prokofiev]] after they discovered that the composer's music was available for download in countries where his music was still under copyright protection. This demand was followed up by a separate legal threat from the [[National Music Publishers Association]] on January 19, 2018. On February 23, 2018, access to all compositions by Prokofiev was blocked by the IMSLP in response to these legal threats. The issues were partially resolved on the IMSLP forums in July 2018, resulting in the reupload of Prokofiev's pre-1923 works. In August, the remainder of Prokofiev's works were reuploaded so that they would only be available in the countries they are allowed in.

===Subscription introduction===
On December 27, 2015, the IMSLP moved to a subscription-based model, where users are expected to pay to avoid a waiting period on some of the files available on the site, and to access certain newly uploaded files.&lt;ref name="Strad2016"&gt;{{cite web|title = IMSLP music library introduces paid membership – The Strad|url = http://www.thestrad.com/cpt-latests/imslp-music-library-introduces-paid-membership/|website = The Strad|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = en-US|date = 2016-01-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114085206/http://www.thestrad.com/cpt-latests/imslp-music-library-introduces-paid-membership/|archive-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users who have not paid are subject to a 15-second waiting period on certain files (excluding [[Creative Commons]]-licensed files that constitute a majority of the site's files),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;p=40283#p40283 |title=Upcoming changes - Page 2 |publisher=IMSLP Forums |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to wait up to two days to access newly uploaded files, and are shown advertising.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:Membership_Q%26A |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 27, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131001340/http://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP%3AMembership_Q%26A |archivedate=January 31, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project leader Edward Guo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/User:Feldmahler |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418150035/http://imslp.org/wiki/User%3AFeldmahler |archivedate=April 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=August 2016}} claimed the changes were made because the level of funding was "not sustainable in the long run", but also noted:

: "The income we receive from various sources have been enough to maintain the site so far, but I increasingly believe that this level of funding is not sustainable in the long run. We are not, like traditional music libraries, bound by the service of a conservatory, university or publisher, but rather can do things that traditional institutions are not willing to do, because we serve only musicians and music lovers. But everything is a tradeoff – we also do not have the funding infrastructure these traditional institutions have, and over the past few years I’ve frankly exhausted my imagination in searching for new realistic sources of funding for IMSLP. 

: "And so I will announce here that a subscription system for IMSLP will be put in place. But this will not be a traditional subscription model – in particular, no file will be blocked from access by the public. Rather, a subscription will permit a member to download files without having to wait a certain number of seconds, eliminiate [''sic''] some of the advertising on the site, and a few other benefits. I see this as a way to both preserve IMSLP’s philosophy of open access and to secure IMSLP’s future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=8187 |title=Upcoming changes |publisher=IMSLP Forums |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strad2016"/&gt;

Guo attributed the change in funding to discussions with librarians at an [[International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres|IAML]] conference in June 2015. Some contributors to the website expressed concerns that Guo had not properly attempted to raise donations, but without any prior warning, introduced the membership system to monetize their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=8187 |title=Upcoming changes |publisher=IMSLP Forums |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naxos Music Library===
On April 18, 2016, the IMSLP announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/imslp/status/722119931194683393|title=IMSLP membership now includes full access to Naxos Music Library with 1.8MM+ tracks for instant streaming!|publisher=Twitter|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on its [[Twitter]] account that all subscribers will have access to the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Music Library.

===EU server===
On July 10, 2010, a forum thread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=3794 |title=Imslp-Eu |publisher=IMSLP Forums |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced the opening of a new server located in the Netherlands. This server allows works that are public domain in Canada and the EU to be downloaded legally, even if they are under copyright in the US. The server was initially run by an unaffiliated European organization, while a forum thread &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=6985|title=Project Leonardo|accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; later announced that operations had been handed over to [http://leonardolibrary.org Project Leonardo], a new unaffiliated company incorporated in New Zealand to "provide web hosting services to online libraries that distribute free contents in any fields of arts and science". Files on the EU server are flagged (EU).

===US server===
A similar, also unaffiliated, US server allows users to download works that are in the public domain only in the US.  Unlike the other servers, this one can only be contributed to by administrators and users who have asked for the privilege, though the files are freely accessible for download.

===CA server===
On July 1, 2013, a forum thread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=7099|title=Anniversary and Canadian server announcement|accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced the opening of a new server located in Canada and operated by [http://leonardolibrary.org Project Leonardo], the unaffiliated company that also runs the EU server. This server is especially intended for users located in countries where copyright lasts 50 years from the death of the author, such as Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others. Files on the CA server are flagged (CA).

===WIMA merge===
On August 23, 2011, an announcement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5236|title=IMSLP to merge with WIMA|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made that the [[Werner Icking Music Archive]] would merge with the IMSLP.  WIMA had announced the merge on its own site five days before in an open letter to contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icking-music-archive.org/IMSLP.php|title=WIMA merges with IMSLP, the International Music Score Library Project|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After working out some technical issues, the IMSLP decided to officially commence the merge on August 28. The merge was announced to be complete on July 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslpforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5236&amp;start=150#p33434|title=IMSLP to merge with WIMA|accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current legal structure===
IMSLP is now owned by Project [[Ottaviano Petrucci|Petrucci]] LLC, a private company created to run the website. Project Petrucci LLC was registered as a [[Delaware]] [[limited-liability company]] on June 28, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx |title=Division of Corporations - Filing |website=Icis.corp.delaware.gov |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the site founder was studying at the [[New England Conservatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/User:Feldmahler#Contact |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418150035/http://imslp.org/wiki/User%3AFeldmahler |archivedate=April 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knopf |first=Howard |url=http://excesscopyright.blogspot.com/2011/02/imslp-back-in-news-library-of-public.html |title=EXCESS COPYRIGHT: IMSLP Back in the News - Library of Public Domain Music Scores |website=Excesscopyright.blogspot.com |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website provides an e-mail address for the site's founder ("preferred"), and a physical address for the company's [[registered agent]] in the United States (for "any legal or formal correspondence").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMSLP-About – IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:About|accessdate = 2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=August 2016}}

'''"Jerusalem's Lot"''' is a short story by [[Stephen King]], first published in King's 1978 collection ''[[Night Shift (short story collection)|Night Shift]]''. The story was also printed in the illustrated edition of ''[['Salem's Lot]]''.

== Setting and style ==
"Jerusalem's Lot" is an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] short story set in the fictional town of Preacher's Corners, [[Cumberland County, Maine|Cumberland County]], [[Maine]], in 1850. It is told through a series of letters and diary entries, mainly those of its main character, aristocrat Charles Boone, although his manservant, Calvin McCann, also occasionally assumes the role of narrator.

== Plot ==
Charles Boone, in letters addressed to "Bones", describes the arrival of himself and his [[Domestic worker|manservant]], Calvin McCann, at Chapelwaite, the neglected ancestral home of Charles's estranged dead cousin. Calvin learns that many people in the nearby [[Maine]] town of Preacher's Corners think Charles and Calvin are mad for living in the mansion. The house is said to be "a bad house", with a history of sad events, disappearances, and mysterious noises which Charles attributes to "[[The Rats in the Walls|rats in the walls]]". Calvin finds a hidden compartment in the library containing an old map of a deserted village called [[Jerusalem's Lot (Stephen King)|Jerusalem's Lot]], a mysterious area the townsfolk avoid. Their curiosity piqued, Charles and Calvin set out to explore the village.

The two men find a decayed [[Puritan]] settlement. Nothing has set foot in the town since its abandonment, including animals. As the two men explore a nearby church, they discover an obscene parody of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]] and an [[Cross of Saint Peter|inverted cross]]. At the [[pulpit]], they find a book filled with [[Latin]] and [[Druid]]ic [[runes]] entitled ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'', or "The Mysteries of the Worm". When Charles touches the book, the church shakes and the two men feel something gigantic moving in the ground beneath them. The evil of the place overcomes both men, and they quickly leave the village.

The inhabitants of Preacher's Corners begin fearing Charles. He is chased away from one house with rocks and guns. Charles asks Mrs. Cloris, Chapelwaite's former maid, for information about Jerusalem's Lot. She reveals that a rift in Charles' family was caused when his grandfather, Robert Boone, attempted to steal ''De Vermis Mysteriis'' from his brother, Philip, presumably to destroy it. Philip was a minister heavily involved in the [[occult]] who, on October 31, 1789, vanished along with the population of Jerusalem's Lot. Charles dismisses it as superstition, but cannot forget what he saw in the church.

Calvin discovers a diary in the library, encrypted with a [[rail fence cipher]]. Before he can decipher it, Charles takes him into the cellar to check for rats. Hidden behind the walls they find the ancient, [[undead]] corpses of two of his relatives, Marcella and Randolph Boone. Charles recognizes them as "[[Nosferatu (word)|nosferatu]]". The two men flee the cellar, and Calvin seals the trapdoor to prevent any pursuit from the creatures.

As Charles recovers from the encounter, Calvin cracks the cipher. The diary, written by Robert Boone, details the history of Jerusalem's Lot and the events leading up to the mass disappearance. The village was founded by one of Charles' distant ancestors, James Boon, who was the leader of an [[inbreeding|inbred]] [[witchcraft]] [[cult]]. Philip and Robert took up residence in Chapelwaite, Philip was taken in by Boon's cult, and acquired ''De Vermis Mysteriis'' at Boon's behest. Philip and Boon used the book to call forth a supernatural entity referred to as "The Worm". In his final entry, Robert curses the [[Eastern whip-poor-will|whip-poor-will]] birds that have descended upon Chapelwaite.

Charles feels compelled to return to Jerusalem's Lot. Calvin attempts to prevent it, but eventually relents, accompanying his master. They discover a butchered lamb on the church altar, lying on top of ''De Vermis Mysteriis''. Charles moves the lamb and takes the book, intending to destroy it, but a congregation of undead appears, including Philip and Boon. Charles becomes possessed and begins chanting, summoning forth the Worm. Calvin knocks down Charles, freeing him from possession. Charles sets fire to the book. The Worm lashes out from below, killing Calvin before disappearing. Before Charles can recover Calvin's body, Boon forces Charles to flee. In his final letter to "Bones", Charles announces his intention to commit [[suicide]], ending the Boone family line.

An "editor's note" attributes Charles's letters and the death of Calvin to insanity rather than supernatural occurrences in Jerusalem's Lot. The editor notes that Charles was not the last of his line: a [[Illegitimacy in fiction|bastard]] relative still exists—the editor himself, James Robert Boone, who has moved to Chapelwaite to restore the family name. James notes that Charles was right about one thing: "This place badly needs the services of an exterminator. There are some huge rats in the walls, by the sound." The note is dated October 2, the same date as Charles's first letter.

== Film, TV or theatrical adaptations ==
"Jerusalem's Lot" has been adapted by artist [[Glenn Chadbourne]] for the book ''[[The Secretary of Dreams]]'', a collection of comics based on King's short fiction released by [[Cemetery Dance Publications|Cemetery Dance]] in December 2006.

'''Koro''' is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] delusional disorder in which  an individual has an overpowering belief that one's  [[sex organ]]s are retracting and will disappear, despite the lack of any true longstanding changes to the genitals.&lt;ref name = "DSM-IV-TR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koro|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/koro|publisher=dictionary.com|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koro is also known as '''shrinking penis''', and it is listed in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. The syndrome occurs worldwide, and [[mass hysteria]] of genital-shrinkage anxiety has a history in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="MattelaerJilek2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattelaer|first1=Johan J.|last2=Jilek|first2=Wolfgang|title=Koro?The Psychological Disappearance of the Penis|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=4|issue=5|year=2007|pages=1509–1515|issn=1743-6095|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00586.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Europe, the syndrome is commonly known as '''''genital retraction syndrome'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.discovery.com/top-ten/2009/mental-disorders/mental-disorders-5.html |title=Top 10 Little-Known Mental Disorders |publisher=Discovery Communications |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition can be diagnosed through psychological assessment along with physical examination to rule out genuine disorders of the genitalia that could be causing true retraction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Arabinda N. |title=The definition and classification of Koro |journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry |date=March 1996 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=41–65 |doi=10.1007/bf00118750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghanem |first1=Hussein |last2=Glina |first2=Sidney |last3=Assalian |first3=Pierre |last4=Buvat |first4=Jacques |title=Position Paper: Management of Men Complaining of a Small Penis Despite an Actually Normal Size |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |date=January 2013 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=294–303 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02725.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients report acute anxiety attacks due to perceived genital retraction and/or genital shrinkage, despite a lack of any objectively visible biological changes in the genitalia that are longstanding. "Longstanding" refers to changes that are sustained over a significant period and do not appear reversible, unlike the effect of cold temperatures on some genital regions that cause retraction. These changes may trigger a koro attack when observed, although the effects of cold temperatures are objectively reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ngui | first = P.

In cases when sufferers have no perception of retraction, some patients may complain of genital [[paraesthesia]] or genital shortening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = Clinical Analysis of 101 Koro Cases | journal = Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry | volume = 8 | pages = 67–70 | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among females, the cardinal symptom is nipple retraction in the breast, generally into the breast as a whole.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/&gt;

Psychological components of koro [[anxiety]] include fear of impending death, penile dissolution and loss of sexual power.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattelaer, J. and Jilek, W.

Extremely anxious sufferers and their family members may resort to physical methods to prevent the believed retraction of the penis.

==Causes==
Psychosexual conflicts, personality factors, and cultural beliefs are considered as being of [[etiological]]
significance to koro.&lt;ref name = "Adeniran 1994"/&gt; Sexual adjustment histories of non-Chinese victims are often significant, such as [[premorbidity|premorbid]] sex inadequacy, [[sexual promiscuity]], guilt over [[masturbation]], and [[impotence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Berrios | first = G.

===Mechanisms===
When considering the biological mechanisms and evolutionary history of koro, it is important to look at it in the larger framework of mass hysteria. While the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood, it has been suggested that the mirror neurons play a major role in mass hysteria outbreaks. [[Mirror neurons]], which have been found in both human and non-human primates, are neurons that fire when one performs an action and when they observe another individual performing the same action. It is hypothesized that we evolved these mechanisms to learn from observation of others, as well as to facilitate imitation. However, within mirror neurons, there is some form of inhibitory process, which prevents us from blindly mimicking every action we observe others perform. New research into this area suggests that in mass hysteria outbreaks something goes amiss in this inhibitory process.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Yao-Tung and Tsai, Shih-Jen, The mirror neuron system may play a role in the pathogenesis of mass hysteria, ''Medical Hypotheses'' 2010, p 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Several criteria are typically used to make a diagnosis of koro.  The primary criteria is a patient's report of genital (typically penile or female nipple) retraction despite a lack of objective physical evidence demonstrating retraction.  This is accompanied by severe anxiety related to the retraction, fear of death as a result of retraction, and use of mechanical means to prevent retraction.&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = Dzokkoto | first = Vivian Afi | last2 = Adams | first2 = Glenn | title = Understanding genital-shrinking epidemics in West Africa : koro, juju or mass psychogenic illness? | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 53–78 | year = 2005 | issn = 0165-005X | doi=10.1007/s11013-005-4623-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases that do not meet all the requirements are generally classified as koro-like symptoms or given a diagnosis of partial koro syndrome.&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt; It has been argued that the criteria are sufficient but not necessary to make a diagnosis of koro.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/&gt;  Researchers have identified koro as a possible "cultural relative" of [[body dysmorphic disorder]].  [[DSM-IV]] explains the process of [[differential diagnosis]] between these two disorders.&lt;ref name="dsm5.org"/&gt;

===History and physical examination===
A medical, psychosexual and psychiatric history should be documented. The physician should explore the patient’s concerns about appearance and body image (ruling out [[body dysmorphic disorder]]).  Additionally, the physician should inquire about overall beliefs, personal values, and assumptions that the patient is making about his or her genitals.  Given that Koro is often an “attack” with a great deal of associated anxiety, the physician should ascertain the patient’s emotional state along with the timeline from onset to the presentation at the examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berrios GE, Morley SJ | year = 1984 | title = Koro-like symptom in a non-Chinese subject | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 331–4 | doi=10.1192/bjp.145.3.331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie, K.

A physical examination should involve an assessment of overall health along with a detailed genital examination.  In men, genital examination should be performed immediately after penile exposure, to avoid changes due to external temperature.  The primary intent of the male exam is to exclude genuine penile anomalies such as [[hypospadias]], [[epispadias]] and [[Peyronie's disease]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie, K. R. 2007"/&gt; The presence of a significant suprapubic fat pad should be noted as well.&lt;ref name="Elder JS PC"&gt;Elder JS. Congenital anomalies of the genitalia. In:Walsh PC, Retik AB, Walsh PC, Campbell MF, eds. Campell’s urology. Philadelphia, London, Toronto: W.B. Saunders Comp.; 1998: 2120–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Careful measurements of flaccid length, stretched length and flaccid girth will also be useful. If male patients insist that their penis is shrinking and disappearing,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; measurements after intracavernosal [[alprostadil]] may be used in the office to determine the true erect length and to diagnose any penile abnormalities in the erect state.&lt;ref name="Wylie, K. R. 2007"/&gt;  A physical examination should note any injuries inflicted by the patient in an effort to "prevent" retraction as further confirmation of Koro.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Classification===
In [[DSM-IV-TR]], koro is listed as one of the entries in the Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes of Appendix I. The manual gives koro's definition as "a term, probably of Malaysian origin, that refers to an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the [[penis]] (or, in females, the [[vulva]] and [[nipples]]) will recede into the body and possibly cause death."&lt;ref name = "DSM-IV-TR"&gt;{{cite book | last = American Psychiatric Association | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text revision | publisher = American Psychiatric Pub | year = 2000 | pages = 898–901 | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made by numerous authors to place koro into different classes.  For example, koro may fit into the group of "specific culture-imposed [[nosophobia]]" (classification with cardinal sign),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Yap | first = Pow-Meng | title = Classification of the Culture-Bound Reactive Syndromes | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 172–9 | year = 1967 | issn = 0004-8674 | doi=10.3109/00048676709159191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the genital retraction taxon" (classification with common factors between syndromes),&lt;ref name = "Simons &amp; Hughes 1985"&gt;{{cite book | last = Simons | first = Ronald C. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Charles C. | title = The Culture-bound syndromes: Folk Illnesses of Psychiatric and Anthropological Interest | publisher = D. Reidel Publishing Company | year = 1985 | location = Dordrecht, Holland | pages = 485–6 | isbn = 90-277-1858-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the group with "culture-related beliefs as causes for the occurrence" (classification according to how the syndromes might be affected by cultural factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tseng | first = Wen-Shing | title = Handbook of Cultural Psychiatry | publisher = Academic press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-701632-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors have attempted to distinguish between complete and incomplete forms of koro, along with cultural and non-cultural forms.&lt;ref name = "Adeniran 1994"&gt;{{Citation | last = Adeniran | first = R. A. | last2 = Jones | first2 = J. R. | title = Koro: Culture-Bound Disorder or Universal Symptom?| journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 4 | pages = 559–61 | date = April 1994 | issn = 0007-1250 | doi=10.1192/bjp.164.4.559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural forms are said to involve a cultural belief or myth which plays a role in the genesis and spread of the disease in the community.  These are regarded as complete forms of koro, matching all the symptoms required for diagnosis without significant co-morbidity.&lt;ref name = "Adeniran 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/&gt; Differentiation into primary koro,  a culture-bound expression, and secondary koro.  Secondary koro is proposed to have co-morbidity with a [[Central nervous system disease|CNS disorder]], another [[psychiatric disorder]], or possible drug use.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"/&gt;

[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] recognises koro as a sexual disease and classifies it into two categories, namely "cold conglomeration in [[liver]]" and "depletion of [[kidney]]'s [[yin and yang|yang]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wang | first = Minghui | last2 = Wang | first2 = Fenglei | title = Conceptualisation and treatment of koro in traditional Chinese medicine | journal = The Chinese Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 559–61 | date = March 2002 | language = Chinese | issn = 1672-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Men who present with this complaint may have Koro, but they may also be misinformed about normal genital size.&lt;ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/&gt;  Additionally, they may be suffering from penile dysmorphophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spyropoulos E, Christoforidisb C, Borousasa D, Mavrikosa S, Bourounisa M, Athanasiadisa S | year = 2005 | title = Augmentation phalloplasty surgery for penile dysmorphophobia in young adults: Considerations regarding patient selection, outcome evaluation and techniques applied | url = | journal = Eur Urol | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 121–8 | doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2005.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penile dysmorphophobia is related to [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (Text Revision) ([[DSM-IV]]-TR) as a condition marked by excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a facial feature or localized part of the body. BDD is different from Koro.  In Koro, a patient is overcome with the belief that his penis is actively shrinking, and it may be in imminent danger of disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ang PC, Weller MP | year = 1984 | title = Koro and psychosis | doi = 10.1192/bjp.145.3.335 | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 145 | issue = | page = 335 | pmid=6478130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical literature indicates that these two psychological conditions should be separated during [[differential diagnosis]].&lt;ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/&gt;

In addition to differentiating Koro from [[body dysmorphic disorder]], physicians also recommend that [[differential diagnosis]] separates Koro from physical urological abnormalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim J, Kim M, Lee N, Park Y | year = 2000 | title = A case of urethrocutaneous fistula with the koro syndrome | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 164 | issue = | page = 123 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(05)67465-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one physical disorder that causes loss of penile size is [[Peyronie's disease]], where the [[tunica albuginea (penis)|tunica albuginea]] develops scar tissue that prevents the full expansion of an erection and causes flaccid penis retraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brock Gerald| year = 1997 | title = The anatomy of the tunica albuginea in the normal penis and Peyronie's disease | url = | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 157 | issue = 1| pages = 276–281 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(01)65359-x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenfield Jason M. |author2=Lucas Steven |author3=Levine Laurence A. | year = 2006 | title = Factors affecting the loss of length associated with tunica albuginea plication for correction of penile curvature | url = | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 238–241 | doi=10.1097/00005392-200601000-00078}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a [[buried penis]] is a normally developed penis, partially covered by the suprapubic fat which can be surgically removed.&lt;ref name="Ghanem, H. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elder JS PC"/&gt;

==Treatment==
In historical culture-bound cases, reassurance and talks on [[sexual anatomy]] are given.&lt;ref name = "Gwee 1963"/&gt; Patients are treated with [[psychotherapy]] distributed according to symptoms and to etiologically significant points in the past. Prognosis appears to be better in cases with a previously functional personality, a short history and low frequency of attacks, and a relatively uncomplicated sexual life.&lt;ref name = "Yap 1965"/&gt;

For sporadic Western cases, careful diagnostic workup including searching for underlying sexual conflict is common. The choice of psychotherapeutic treatment is based on the psychiatric pathology found.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbain, D., Barsky, S., and Goldberg, M. (January, 1989).

===Indigenous treatment===
In China, traditional treatment based on the causes suggested by cultural beliefs are administrated to the patient. Praying to gods and asking Taoist priests to perform exorcism is common. If a [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] is believed to be involved, people may hit [[gong]]s or beat the person to drive it out. The person will receive a yang- or yin-augmenting Chinese medicine potion, usually including herbs, pilose antler (stag of deer) or deer tail, and [[tiger penis]], [[deer penis]], or [[fur seal]] penis. Other foods for therapy are pepper soup, ginger soup and [[liquor]].&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Among the Chinese, koro is confined to [[Northern and southern China|South China]] and the lower [[Yangtze Valley]].&lt;ref name = "Yap 1965"/&gt; A 1992 study of self-report questionnaires suggests that in the epidemic area of China, koro victims are mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], male, young, single, poorly educated and fearful of [[supernatural|supernatural forces]] and koro.&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"/&gt; The phenomenon is also found among oversea Chinese in [[Southeast Asia]], especially [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], and less frequently among the [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian]] inhabitants of the countries.&lt;ref name = "Yap 1965"/&gt; Though there are speculations that the occurrence of koro among people in Malaysia and Indonesia was the result of Chinese migrants, this cultural diffusion view is challenged since koro epidemics have been reported in [[Thailand]] and India, involving masses of non-Chinese people.&lt;ref name = "Tseng 2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Tseng | first = W.

Local official records indicate genital retraction endemics in [[Hainan Island]] and [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in [[Guangdong]], China, as early as the late 19th century. There were a series of epidemic outbursts in 1948, 1955, 1966, and 1974, whenever there was social tension or impending disaster, followed by the last widespread episode in 1984–1985 and a much smaller outbreak in 1987. The 1984–1985 epidemics lasted for over a year and affected over 3,000 persons in 16 cities and provinces. A mental health campaign was conducted for the epidemic and since then no further episodes of the epidemic has occurred in China. Improvement in local economic conditions, associated with a better quality of life, is suggested to contribute to the fading of the episodic occurrences of koro.&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tseng 2006"/&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
A koro epidemic struck [[Singapore]] in October 1967 for about ten days. Newspapers initially reported that some people developed koro after eating the meat of pigs inoculated with a [[vaccine]] for [[swine influenza]]. Rumours relating eating pork and koro spread after a further report of an inoculated pig dying from penile retraction. The cases reported amounted to 97 in a single hospital unit within one day, at five days after the original news report. Government and medical officials alleviated the outbreak only by public announcements over television and in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Koro study team | title = The Koro "Epidemic" in Singapore | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 234–42 | date = December 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = B.

An epidemic outbreak in November 1976 in [[Isan]], Thailand caused at least 350 cases, most of them Thai and males. Popular opinion and news media echoed the victims' projection of viewing the epidemic as caused by Vietnamese food and tobacco poisoning in a hideous assault against the Thai people.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jilek | first = W. | last2 = Jilel-Aall | first2 = L. | title = Mass-hysteria with Koro-symptoms in Thailand | journal = Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–9 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another large-scale epidemic in Thailand occurred in 1982.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/&gt;

In 1982, a koro epidemic episode in [[Northeast India]] affected, in majority, poorly educated people from lower socio-economic strata. There was no evidence of significant premorbid or sexual psychopathology in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sachdev | first = P.

Mass Koro epidemic was reported in Labour Camps in Kochi, Kerala in South India during August and September 2010 among migrant labour population from North and North-east India. Reportedly, the epidemic spread to about 100 individuals in 3 labour Camps within 2 weeks.

=== Africa ===
In the 1970s and early 1980s, newspapers reported incidents of genital shrinking in Western Nigeria. Since late 1996, a small-scale epidemic of genital shrinking was reported in West African nations. Victims in the African outbreaks often interpreted the experience as genital theft, accusing someone with whom they had contact of "stealing" the organ and the spiritual essence, causing impotence. The perceived motive for theft was associated with local [[occult]] belief, the [[witchcraft]] of [[juju]], to feed the spiritual agency or to hold the genital for ransom. [[Social representations]] about juju constitute consensual realities that propose both a means and motivation for genital-shrinking experience.&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt;

The epidemic began in [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and spread to [[Ghana]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Senegal]] by 1997.&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt; Cases were reported in [[Cotonou]], [[Benin]] where mobs attacked individuals accused of the penis theft and authorities ordered security forces to curb the violence, following the deaths of five people by [[vigilante]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Benin alert over 'penis theft' panic | newspaper = BBC News | date = 27 November 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1678996.stm | accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reports of outbreak suggest a spread beyond West Africa, including the coverage of episodes in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]] in September 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Panic in Khartoum: Foreigners Shake Hands, Make Penises Disappear | publisher = The Middle East Media Research Institute | date = 22 October 2003 | url = http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/976.htm#_ednref1 | accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banjul]], [[Gambia]] in October 2003;&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt; and [[Kinshasa]], [[DR Congo]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Lynchings in Congo as penis theft panic hits capital | publisher = Reuters Africa | date = 23 April 2008 | url = http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnL22903232.html | accessdate = 2 May 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080511153754/http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnL22903232.html | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing West African genital-shrinking epidemics with koro in Southeast Asia, the latter has symptoms centered on genital retraction (instead of shrinkage) and fear of death (which is absent in African cases).&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt; A study analyzing the West African epidemics from 1997 to 2003 concluded that rather than [[psychopathology]], the episodes were product of normal psychological functioning in undisturbed individuals, who were influenced by the local cultural models or social representations.&lt;ref name = "Dzokkoto 2005"/&gt;

===U.S. and Europe===
In the late Middle Ages in Europe, it was believed that men could lose their penises through magical attacks by witches.&lt;ref name="MattelaerJilek2007" /&gt; The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', a 15th-century European manual for witchcraft investigations, relates stories of men claiming that their genitals had disappeared, being "hidden by the devil … so that they can be neither seen nor felt." They were said to have reappeared after the men had appeased the witches responsible.&lt;ref name=malleus&gt;[http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/?p=39 ''Malleus Maleficarum'' Part II, Question I, Chapter VII]&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were said to store the removed genitals in birds' nests or in boxes, where "they move themselves like living members and eat oats and corn".&lt;ref name=malleus/&gt;

At least three publications of the 1880s, from U.S., Russia and England, reported genital retraction pathology, without using the Malay or Chinese term. Koro epidemics in China were first noticed in a French report in 1908 and descriptions of koro entered clinical books of western medicine in 1936. In the 1950s, koro is noted in [[nosological]] and diagnostic psychiatry.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Chinese cultural beliefs===
Most of the ancient literature concerning koro was related to Chinese ethnic groups. For example, koro (in its Chinese term of ''shuk yang'') is documented in the old medical book ''New Collection of remedies of value'' ({{zh|t=驗方新篇|s=验方新篇}}) which was published in [[Qing Dynasty]]. The book described the condition as "[[Yin and yang|yin]] type of [[qi|cold qi]] invasion" ({{zh|t=陰症傷寒|s=阴症伤寒}}) which involved a sudden [[seizure]] during [[sexual intercourse]] with the penis retracting into the abdomen. It asserts that the patient will die if not treated with "[[Traditional Chinese medicine#Traditional categorization|heaty]]" drugs in time.&lt;ref name = "Gwee 1963"/&gt;

Factors of cultural expectation in the genesis of koro can be built upon ideas of sex physiology in the [[traditional Chinese medicine]], with free play of imagination which links fatality with genital retraction.&lt;ref name = "Gwee 1963"/&gt;

In the ancient Chinese medical book ''Zhong Zang Jing'' ({{zh|t=中藏經|s=中藏经}}), retraction of the penis with distension of the abdomen was described as a certain sign of death.&lt;ref name = "Gwee 1963"/&gt; The [[yin and yang]] theory proposes that an unbalanced loss of the yang humour produces genital shrinkage.&lt;ref name = "Yap 1965"/&gt;

In [[Taoism]] and Traditional Chinese medicine, frequent [[ejaculation]] is regarded as detrimental to health, as [[semen]] is considered to be related to a man's vital energy, and hence excessive depletion of semen may lead to illness or death. Some authors believe that the idea of death caused by the semen depletion resembles the idea of death caused by genital disappearance, although such linkage between koro and Taoism, which influences Chinese medicine to some degree, is only speculative.&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"/&gt;

The popularity of [[Chinese folklore]] also plays a role. The novel about ghost stories ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' describes a [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] which can make people weak physically and sexually and shrink their tissues. Belief in koro being caused by the fox ghost among the southern Chinese has been reported.&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"/&gt;

===Etymology and geographical background===
The earliest Western reference to the term ''koro'' is found in B.F. Matthes' ''Dictionary of [[Buginese language|Buginese Language]]'' (1874) of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1998"&gt;{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = Hundred Years of Koro: The History of a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = The International Journal of Social Psychiatry | volume = 44 |issue = 3| pages = 181–8 | date = September 1998 | issn = 0020-7640 | doi=10.1177/002076409804400304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name could derived from a river, its surrounding valley, and a local tribe of the same name which is located at northwestern sector of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia.&lt;ref name=thedisordernamedkoro&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durst|first1=Rimona|title=The Disorder Named Koro|journal=Behavioural Neurology|date=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/1991/525393|pmid=24487349|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bn/1991/525393.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used in [[Makassarese language]], meaning "to shrink"; the full expression is ''garring koro''.&lt;ref name = "Chowdhury 1996"&gt;{{Citation | last = Chowdhury | first = Arabinda N. | title = The definition and classification of Koro | journal = Culture, Medicine &amp; Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 41–65 | date = March 1996 | issn = 0165-005X | doi=10.1007/bf00118750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koro may also be derived from [[Malaysian language|Malay]] term ''Kura'' which means "head of turtle"&lt;ref name=thedisordernamedkoro/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cheng 1996"&gt;{{Citation | last = Cheng | first = Sheung-Tak | title = A Critical Review of Chinese Koro | journal = Culture, Medicine &amp; Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 41–65 | date = March 1996 |issn = 0165-005X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''keruk'' which means "to shrink".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Palthe | first = W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28418">[[Ku Klux Klan]] nomenclature has evolved over the order's nearly 160 years of existence. The titles and designations were first laid out in the original Klan's prescripts of 1867 and 1868, then revamped with [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]]' [[Kloran]] of 1916. Subsequent Klans have made various modifications.

== Reconstruction period ==

The sources of the rituals, titles and even the name of the original KKK may be found in antebellum [[College fraternity|college fraternities]] and [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret societies]] such as the [[Kuklos Adelphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991, p.338&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lester (disambiguation)|John Lester]], one of the original members of the group, stated that the Klan rituals were "modeled on and embraced the leading features of the rituals of an order which has long been popular in many colleges and universities under various names" such as the [[Sons of Confucius]] or [[Guiasticutus]] but always styled '''Ancient and Honorable''' and '''Mirth-Provoking'''. [[Walter L. Fleming]] stated in a footnote to Lester's text that the contemporary (early twentieth century) Southern college fraternity that most nearly mirrored the early Klan was [[Alpha Sigma Sigma]] and the institution of [[snipe hunt]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lester|Lester, John C.]], ''Ku Klux Klan: Its Origin, Growth and Disbandment'' [[Walter L. Fleming]] ed. New York; Neale Publishing Company, 1905. Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
The original prescript of the Ku Klux Klan was adopted by a convention in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in April 1867. A slightly revised edition appeared the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II pp.133-176&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher levels ===
In both prescripts there were four levels or "departments" of organization, above the basic level:

*'''Empire''' – constituting the whole area of the Klan's activities. This was led by the '''[[Grand Wizard]]''' and his staff of ten '''Genii''', as well as a '''Grand Exchequer''' (treasurer) and '''Grand Scribe''', whose duty was to keep lists of the subordinate officers. The Genii, Imperial Exchequer and Scribe were appointed by the Imperial Wizard.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136–37, 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realms''' – while the role of Realms was laid out in the first prescript they were only identified as [[US states|states]] in the second. Realms were ruled by a '''Grand Dragon''' assisted by eight '''Hydras''', as well as a Grand Exchequer and Grand Scribe, whose duties were identical to the above officers on the imperial level. All officers were appointed by the Grand Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138, 155–56, 158–159. The states making up the "empire" were [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dominions''' – identified in the second prescript as "coterminous with such counties as the Grand Dragons of the several Realms shall assign" and "not to exceed three in number for each [[List of United States congressional districts|Congressional district]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.156, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion was headed by a '''Great Titan''' assisted by six '''Furies''', a Great Exchequer and a Great Scribe, appointed by the Great Titan.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138–39, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provinces''' – the second prescript identified the Provinces as equivalent to a [[Counties of the United States|county]]. It was supervised by a '''Grand Giant''', assisted by four '''Goblins''', a Grand Exchequer, and a Grand Scribe, appointed by the Grand Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first prescript each officer is given the power to appoint Deputies to organize Realms, Dominions, Provinces and Dens until the latter can elect their own officers.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.137–140&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Wizard was to be elected by a majority of Grand Dragons, and each lower level was elected by a majority of the next lower level of officers (Dragons elected by Titans, Titans by Giants etc.), as soon as three units had been formed at each level (three Dominions within a Realm for Grand Dragon, three Provinces within a Dominion for Grand Titan etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143–144&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript each officer appoints the lower officer with the approval of his superior.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 141, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dens ===

The '''Dens''' were the basic level of organization for the Reconstruction Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. ''The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia'' Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991 p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In the original prescript, its chief officer was the '''Grand Cyclops''', who appointed two '''Nighthawks''', a '''Grand Turk''', a '''Grand Sentinel, Grand Magi''' and a '''Grand Ensign''' in addition to his Grand Scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Cyclops, Grand Exchequer, '''Grand Magi''' (second officer) and '''Grand Monk''' (third officer) were elected by the body politic of the dens, identified as '''Ghouls'''&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.141-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript the Grand Ensign is dispensed with, while the Grand Exchequer was appointed by the Grand Cyclops, who was now appointed by the Grand Giant. Only the Grand Magi and Grand Monk were elected by the Ghouls.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.160-1, 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact function of these officers and the meaning of the titles varied. The two Nighthawks have been identified as couriers.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.428&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Sentinel was in charge of the "'''Grand Guard'''", an organization which is not otherwise elaborated upon in the prescripts, but apparently served as the Den's security detail.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Turk was the den's "[[executive officer]]" and was charged with informing Klansmen of "all informal or irregular meetings" and helping the Grand Cyclops and the Grand Magi maintain the "control and government" of the Den.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.142, 163&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Ensigns job was to take care of the Klan's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiation rites ===
The organ for initiation into the Klan was called the '''Investigating Committee''', composed of the Grand Cyclops, Grand Magi and Grand Monk. Upon the nomination of a new member by a current member, the committee would investigate the candidate's "antecedents and his past and present standings and connections" and would then pronounce the candidate "competent and worthy" to become a member. The Grand Turk would escort the candidate to an "outpost" where he would question him and administer a preliminary [[oath]]. After this the Grand Turk would conduct the candidate to the Den, where the Grand Cyclops would administer the final oath.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140-1, 142, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; The second prescript elaborates that the candidate must have his left hand on the [[Bible]] and his right hand toward heaven and includes a ten-point "interrogation" that the candidate must answer satisfactorily in order to proceed with the final oath. The questions asked included: are you now or have ever been a member of the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican Party]], [[Loyal Leagues]] or [[Grand Army of the Republic]]? Did you fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]? Do you believe in [[racial equality|Negro equality]]? among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tribunals ===
A system of "judiciary" organs was created in each prescript. In the first the judiciary was divided into a '''Grand Council of Yahoos''', to try officers of the Klan, and a '''Grand Council of Centaurs''' to try regular Ghouls. In Art.IV Sec.4, the Grand Giant is charged with conducting the Council of Yahoo, but Art.VI Sec.2 states that the Council will be composed of officers of the equivalent rank as the accused and presided over by an officer of the next higher rank. A trial of the Grand Wizard would be held by a meeting of all the Grand Dragons, the most senior Grand Dragon presiding&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140, 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if these tribunals were ever functional.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prescript presented an entirely different judiciary, with officers of the first three levels tried by three judges, appointed by the chief officer of the given jurisdiction, and the officers and attaches of the headquarters (presumably the Genii, Hydras, and Furies). Trials of Den officers would be conducted at the provincial headquarters and include five judges, and ordinary ghouls to be tried at their dens with seven judges. As before a trial of the Grand Wizard would be conducted by the most senior Grand Dragon, this time with a quorum of seven dragons. All defendants had the right of appeal to the next higher court, and the proceeding was to be governed as "ordinary [[Court-martial|court martials]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.16-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
In addition to the structure outlined above, there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from Reconstruction. For instance, a group of twenty men who were arrested on April 6, 1868, at their "den" at the corners of [[Beale Street]] and Hernando street in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was called the '''Supreme Cyclopean Council'''. The constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a Grand Cyclops, Vice-Grand Cyclops, and Secretary and openly advocated assassination of the "murders and robbers" now ruling the South. Members were bound to participate in the activities of the order, even if it meant leaving the "embraces" of their wife.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Henry Townsend]] ''The Handbook of the year'' London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1868 p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Trelease]] ''White terror: the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The complete constitution, which identifies the group as part of the KKK was printed in [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038521/1868-04-09/ed-1/seq-1/ Nashville union and dispatch. Vol XXXIV #105 April 09, 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''Grand Klan''', composed of delegates from [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[York County, South Carolina|York]], [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]], and [[Chester County, South Carolina|Chester]] counties in South Carolina and a few from North Carolina met in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] and declared that no more raids or whippings would be conducted by members of the Klan except by their order and that the penalty for violating this order would be 100 lashes for the first offense and death for the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Joint Select Committee Appointed to Inquire Into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, So Far as Regards the Execution of Laws, and the Safety of the Lives and Property of the Citizens of the United States and Testimony Taken: Report of the Joint committee, Views of the minority and Journal of the Select committee, April 20, 1871-Feb. 19, 1872'' Washington; GPO 1872 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was apparently made to make Ghoul titles for other officers in [[Maury County, Tennessee]] in 1867 and early 1868, but the result was only confusion. Additionally a "'''Grand Tycoon'''" notified Klansmen in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] to cease night riding and the order was apparently effective in restoring calm to [[Wilson County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.236-7&lt;/ref&gt; In some early reconstruction Klan units there was also a '''Lictor''', whose role as a guard of the den was later subsumed by the Nighthawks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.348&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Era ==
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. which existed from 1915 to 1944, elaborated on the original prescript in its Kloran and in the constitution and by-laws adopted in 1922. Some titles and jurisdictional designations were carried over from the Reconstruction prescripts intact or slightly modified, and others were original with Imperial Wizard Simmons.

=== Jurisdictions ===
*'''Invisible Empire''' – this designation included both the Klans geographical domain – up to "the whole world" - but also in a "spiritual sense" all the secrets and workings of the order. All things outside this empire were designated the '''Alien World''' and non-members '''Aliens'''.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc ''[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/constitutionlawsknights.pdf Constitution and Laws of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc]'' Atlanta, Ga; Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc 1921 [pref. Nov. 1922] pp.12-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan was a military organization and its [[commander in chief]] was the '''Imperial Wizard''', whose power was supreme "within the limits of this Constitution" and whose edicts, decisions and rulings were binding on all members of the order.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He had a staff of '''Fifteen Genii'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire had an assembly or convention known as a '''Klonvokation'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realm''' – was carried over from the Reconstruction prescript, but it was no longer restricted to the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]; any state or territory of the United States could become a Realm, and Realms were also given a number based on the date of organization of the Realm. The convention of the Realm was designated the '''Klorero'''&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Realm remained the Grand Dragon; the other officers were collectively known as the '''Nine Hydras'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.45&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Province''' – in the new Klan, a Province was construed as "a county or number of counties" designated by the Grand Dragon. There were a maximum of six provinces per realm, but the Grand Dragon could create more with the permission of the Imperial Wizard. The Provincial convention was the '''Klonverse'''. The chief officer of a Province was a '''Great Titan''', and the other officers were known as the '''Seven Furies'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan''' – the basic unit of the Second Era KKK was known simply as a Klan. Its area of jurisdiction was a '''Klanton''' which was defined as "extend[ing] in all directions to a distance midway between the location of the Klan and the nearest Klan thereto" unless otherwise directed by the Grand Dragon or Imperial Wizard. The chief officer of a Klan was an '''Exalted Cyclops''' and the subordinate officers were known as the '''Twelve Terrors'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13–14, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
There was a nearly identical set of subordinate officers at each level:&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23, 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klaliff''' – [[vice president]]
*'''Klokard''' – [[lecturer]]
*'''Kludd''' – [[chaplain]]
*'''Kligrapp''' – [[secretary]]
*'''Klabee''' – [[treasurer]]
*'''Kladd''' – "conductor", in charge of initiating new members
*'''Klarogo''' – inner guard, [[serjeant-at-arms]]
*'''Klexter''' – outer guard
*'''Nighthawks''' – couriers

The officers at each level above the local Klan unit were designated by a unique prefix: '''Imperial''' at the Empire level; '''Grand''' at the Realm level; and '''Great''' at the Province level. Thus, for instance, an Imperial Kludd would be the chaplain for the whole organization, a Grand Kludd for the Realm, Great Kludd for a Province and simply Kludd for a local Klan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 46, 48, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all offices were reproduced at each level. The Kladd, Klarogo, Klexter, and Klokard were not present at the Province level, and the Kladd was not included on the Realm level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Klazik''', second vice-president, and '''Klonsul''', attorney, positions only existed at the Imperial level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.29, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Klazik's duties included being head of the department of Realms and organizing new Realms and Provinces&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.45–48,&lt;/ref&gt; At the Province level there were three Klaliffs that served as an advisory board. A '''Klokann''' of three members, each one named a '''Klokan''', filled this role at the local levels and a Klokann of four members at the Imperial level, in which they served as a "Supreme Board of Auditors and Special Advisers and was led by a Chief Imperial Klokan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 33, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Wizards Genii constituted his '''Imperial Kloncilium'''; this was the Imperial Wizards supreme [[advisory board]], as well as the Klans highest administrative organ in between Klonvokations. It met regularly every July, but could also be called when the Imperial Wizard or five Geniis petitioned him to do so. The Kloncilium was also the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the organization with [[appellate jurisdiction]] and the right to finally determine disputes between Realms, Provinces, Klans and members in unorganized states&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giant''' was adopted as an [[emeritus]] title: Imperial Giant for an ex-Imperial Wizard, Grand Giant for an ex-Grand Dragon, Great Giant for ex-Great Titan and Klan Giant for an ex-Exalted Cyclops.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Kleagle]]''' was a recruiter and was responsible for organizing local Klans.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-1944 ==

Since the dissolution of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, there have been many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term '''klavern''' replaced klan for local groups.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the [[Association of Georgia Klans]], whose leader [[Dr. Samuel Green]], kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral '''Klongress''' with an [[upper house]] Klonvokation and [[Lower house|lower]] '''Klanburgess'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.321-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s [[David Duke]]'s [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] dropped the Imperial Wizard title, and the leader was called national director.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; That organization, now known as the Knights Party, no longer uses most of the traditional Klan titles, and the only fraternal titles used are '''Page''', '''Squire''' and '''Knight''' for levels of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkk.bz/main/?page_id=43 Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
Aside from titles and geographical designations, a distinctive vocabulary has grown around the Ku Klux Klan organizations. These include names for rituals, code words, and practices of the various Klans.

*'''Klankraft''' or '''Klanishness''' – the overall practice and state of being a Klan member. This could be defined as the employment and patronizing of fellow Klansmen, as well as sale of official Klan memorabilia, such as T-shirts, watches and belt buckles.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard [[Robert Shelton (Ku Klux Klan)|Robert Shelton]] gave this definition "...robes, cross lightings and parades, the mysticism, everything that made the Klan the Klan".&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League ''Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe'' New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 p.251&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions included maintaining the sanctity of one's home, maintenance of white supremacy and purity, and loyalty to the Klan itself.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ''The Practice of Klanishness'' 1924 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
There are terms related to membership and non-membership:&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League pp.392-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alien''' – a non-member
*'''Naturalization''' – the Klan [[Initiation rites|initiation ceremony]]
*'''Citizen''' – a Klan member
*'''Passport''' – [[membership card]]
*'''Banished''' – expelled from the Klan
*'''Yellow dog''' – a [[hazing]] ritual similar to the type used in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|college fraternities]]; when practiced by imperial officers, called the '''Royal Order of the Purple Dog'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups ===
Groups of Klansmen commissioned for "special activities"
*'''Wrecking Crew''' – an action squad commissioned to take physical action against enemies and wayward members of the Klan. Depending on time and organization, these groups consisted of 5 to 8 members and were authorized either by the klokann, the Exalted Cyclops and/or the Kludd. Sometimes led by the Nighthawk. An action taken by the crew is '''wrecked'''. Some names used by wrecking crews include "Secret Six", "Ass-tear Squad" and "Holy terrors".&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.393&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan Bureau of Investigation''' – Pioneered by the Mississippi White Knights, these groups investigate the Klans enemies and check leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Anti-Defamation League p.292"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.292&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Degree teams''' – a group which performs the task of initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
*'''Klectoken''' or '''Klecktokon''' – initiation fee. It stabilized around $10 before the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"/&gt;
*'''Imperial tax''' – membership dues&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provincial tax''' – secondary dues, paid per capita for the upkeep of a Realm.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code words and phrases ===
*'''A.Y.A.K.''' or '''Ayak''' – "Are you a Klansman?" to be answered with below.
*'''A.K.I.A.''' or '''Akia''' – "A Klansman I am"; these were code words for Klansmen meeting in strange surroundings. They would be inserted into common conversation, for instance "Does a Mr. Ayak live in this neighborhood?" to be responded by "No, but a Mr. Akia does." The password would then be accompanied by a [[secret handshake]] or other sign of recognition.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.30-1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''K.I.G.Y''' or '''Kigy''' – "Klansman, I greet you"&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter1"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan Ku Klux Klan]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''O.R.I.O.N''' – Our Race Is Our Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/hate_symbols/ORION.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''L.O.T.I.E''' or '''LOTIE''' – Lady Of The Invisible Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Axelrod]] ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'' New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.144. This was one of a number of names for Klan women's auxiliaries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates and times ===

Two KKK codes for dates and times have been developed, the '''Ku Klux Register''' in the original prescripts and the '''Kalender''' developed by William J. Simmons.

==== Ku Klux Register ====

In the original prescripts the register contained twelve designations, thought to correspond to months:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st-'''Dismal'''
*2nd-'''Dark'''
*3rd-'''Furious'''
*4th-'''Portentous'''
*5th-'''Wonderful'''
*6th-'''Alarming'''

{{col-break}}
*7th-'''Dreadful'''
*8th-'''Terrible'''
*9th-'''Horrible'''
*10th-'''Melancholy'''
*11th-'''Mournful'''
*12th-'''Dying'''
{{col-end}}

The second prescript had a slightly different scheme.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1-'''Dismal'''
*2-'''Mystic'''
*3-'''Stormy'''
*4-'''Peculiar'''
*5-'''Blooming'''
*6-'''Brilliant'''

{{col-break}}
*7-'''Painful'''
*8-'''Portentous'''
*9-'''Fading'''
*10-'''Melancholy'''
*11-'''Glorious'''
*12-'''Gloomy'''
{{col-end}}

Colors were used for the days of the week:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st Prescript
*I-'''White'''
*II-'''Green'''
*III-'''Blue'''
*IV-'''Black'''
*V-'''Yellow'''
*VI-'''Crimson'''
*VII-'''Purple'''

{{col-break}}
*2nd Prescript
*I-'''White'''
*II-'''Green'''
*III-'''Yellow'''
*IV-'''Amber'''
*V-'''Purple'''
*VI-'''Crimson'''
*VII-'''Emerald'''
{{col-end}}

Twelve designations were used for the hours of the day:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester, pp.148, 176"&gt;Lester, pp.148, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st prescript
*1. '''Fearful'''
*2. '''Startling'''
*3. '''Awful'''
*4. '''Woeful'''
*5. '''Horrid'''
*6. '''Bloody'''
*7. '''Doleful'''
*8. '''Sorrowful'''
*9. '''Hideous'''
*10. '''Frightful'''
*11. '''Appalling'''
*12. '''Last'''

{{col-break}}
*2nd prescript
*1. '''Fearful'''
*2. '''Startling'''
*3. '''Wonderful'''
*4. '''Alarming'''
*5. '''Mournful'''
*6. '''Appalling'''
*7. '''Hideous'''
*8. '''Frightful'''
*9. '''Awful'''
*10. '''Horrible'''
*11. '''Dreadful'''
*12. '''Last'''
{{col-end}}

==== Kalender ====

The Kalender developed by W. J. Simmons included codes for days of the week, weeks, months and years. For months:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.307-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"&gt;''Constitution'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st-'''Bloody'''
*2nd-'''Gloomy'''
*3rd-'''Hideous'''
*4th-'''Fearful'''
*5th-'''Furious'''
*6th-'''Alarming'''

{{col-break}}
*7th-'''Terrible'''
*8th-'''Horrible'''
*9th-'''Mournful'''
*10th-'''Sorrowful'''
*11th-'''Frightful'''
*12th-'''Appalling'''
{{col-end}}

For weeks and days:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*Weeks
*1-'''Woeful'''
*2-'''Weeping'''
*3-'''Wailing'''
*4-'''Wonderful'''
*5-'''Weird'''

{{col-break}}
*Days
*1-'''Dark'''
*2-'''Deadly'''
*3-'''Dismal'''
*4-'''Doleful'''
*5-'''Desolate'''
*6-'''Dreadful'''
*7-'''Desperate'''
{{col-end}}

Years were reckoned according to '''reigns''' and '''cycles'''. The '''Reign of Incarnation and Incantation''' was all time up to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The '''First Reign of our Incarnation and Incantation''' was the period between the Revolution and the establishment of the original Klan, which was reckoned to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The '''Reign of our Second Incarnation and Incantation''' was reckoned between 1866 and Grand Wizard [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s dissolution of the Klan, which is reckoned to 1872. The '''Reign of our Third Incarnation and Incantation''' began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.88, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan year, '''Anno Klanslar''', began in March of each year, and the cycle was reckoned from December of each calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casa Encendida (Madrid) 04.jpg|thumb|La Casa Encendida Building]]
'''La Casa Encendida''' is a social and cultural centre in central [[Madrid]] (on the Ronda de Valencia where it is met by Calle Valencia). It began operations in December 2002.

It belongs to the Fundación Montemadrid (the formal title of which is Fundación Obra Social y Monte de Piedad de Madrid), a social responsibility entity set up by the Spanish bank [[Caja Madrid]]. 

Among its activities are avant-garde art exhibitions, and running courses and workshops on social matters, culture and the environment. The cultural programme includes performance art, film, exhibitions and other forms of contemporary creativity. It developed as a place which particularly supports young artists.

The name ''La Casa Encendida'' ('The Burning House' in English) is taken from the eponymous book of the poet [[Luis Rosales|Luis Rosales Camacho]], whose heirs gave their permission for its use.

==History and construction of the building==
It was designed by the architect Fernando Arbós y Tremanti and the first stone was laid on 1 May 1911. 

In its early years the building was used as the office of the bank Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Madrid (the formal name of Caja Madrid). It was known as ''El Monte'' ('The Mount') and also as ''La Casa de Empeños'' ('The Pawnshop') because the [[Monte di Pietà|Monte de Piedad]] ('Mount of Piety') in Spain had been an institutional pawnbroker run as a charity (i.e. no interest was charged on its loans) until its merger with Caja de Ahorros de Madrid ('Savings Bank of Madrid') in 1869.

The building is organized around a central courtyard. Its symmetrical facade is aesthetically novel when compared with other banking buildings of the period. The facade blends brick and granite using a mixture of [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] and [[Neo-Mudéjar]] styles.

[[Image:MarkovnikovRulePropeneHBr.svg|right|frame|Markovnikov's rule is illustrated by the reaction of [[propene]] with [[hydrobromic acid]] ]]
In [[organic chemistry]], '''Markovnikov's rule''' or '''Markownikoff's rule''' describes the outcome of some [[addition reaction]]s. The rule was formulated by Russian chemist [[Vladimir Markovnikov]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title = Ueber die Abhängigkeit der verschiedenen Vertretbarkeit des Radicalwasserstoffs in den isomeren Buttersäuren
 | author =  W. Markownikoff
 | journal = Annalen der Pharmacie
 | volume = 153
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 228–59
 | year = 1870 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18701530204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed083p1152 | title = Was Markovnikov's Rule an Inspired Guess? | year = 2006 | last1 = Hughes | first1 = Peter | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 83 | issue = 8 | pages = 1152|bibcode = 2006JChEd..83.1152H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
The rule states that with the addition of a [[protic acid]] HX to an asymmetric [[alkene]], the acid hydrogen (H) gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the [[halide]] (X) group gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. Alternatively, the rule can be stated that the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms while the X component is added to the carbon with the least number of hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Organic Chemistry |edition= 8th |first= John |last= McMurry |chapter= Section 7.8: Orientation of Electrophilic Ractions: Markovnikov's Rule |page= 240 |isbn= 9780840054548 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form an alcohol which involve formation of carbocations. The hydroxyl group (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon–carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon–hydrogen bonds.

The chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable [[carbocation]] during the addition process. The addition of the hydrogen ion to one carbon atom in the alkene creates a positive charge on the other carbon, forming a carbocation intermediate. The more substituted the carbocation, the more stable it is, due to [[inductive effects|induction]] and [[hyperconjugation]]. The major product of the addition reaction will be the one formed from the more stable intermediate. Therefore, the major product of the addition of HX (where X is some atom more electronegative than H) to an alkene has the hydrogen atom in the less substituted position and X in the more substituted position. But the other less substituted, less stable carbocation will still be formed at some concentration, and will proceed to be the minor product with the opposite, conjugate attachment of X.

==Anti-Markovnikov reactions==
Mechanisms that do not involve a [[carbocation]] intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have other [[regioselectivity|regioselectivities]] not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as [[free radical addition]]. Such reactions are said to be '''anti-Markovnikov''', since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction. Similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to propene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that HBr produces a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction procedure less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. In this case the terminal carbon is a reactant which produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product, in the case of propene.

A new method of anti-Markovnikov addition has been described by Hamilton and Nicewicz, who utilize aromatic molecules and light energy from a low-energy diode to turn the alkene into a cation radical.&lt;ref&gt;http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i15/Light-Driven-Reaction-Modifies-Double.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja309635w | volume=134 | issue=45 | title=Direct Catalytic Anti-Markovnikov Hydroetherification of Alkenols | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=18577–18580 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = David S. |first2= David A. |last2= Nicewicz|pmc=3513336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Markovnikov behaviour extends to more chemical reactions than additions to alkenes. Anti-Markovnikov behaviour is observed in the [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of [[phenylacetylene]] by auric catalysis, which gives [[acetophenone]]; although with a special [[ruthenium]] catalyst&lt;ref&gt;catalyst system based on [[in-situ]] reaction of [[ruthenocene]] with [[cyclopentadienyl|Cp]] and [[naphthalene]] [[ligand]]s and a second bulky [[pyridine]] ligand&lt;/ref&gt; it provides the other [[regioisomer]] [[Phenylacetaldehyde|2-phenylacetaldehyde]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1021/ol062455k | title =Highly Active in Situ Catalysts for Anti-Markovnikov Hydration of Terminal Alkynes | year =2006 | last1 =Labonne | first1 =Aurélie | last2 =Kribber | first2 =Thomas | last3 =Hintermann | first3 =Lukas | journal =Organic Letters | volume =8 | issue =25 | pages =5853–6 | pmid =17134289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antimarkovnikovhydration.png|center|500px|Anti-Markovnikov hydration]]

Anti-Markovnikov behavior can also manifest itself in certain [[rearrangement reaction]]s. In a [[titanium(IV) chloride]]-catalyzed formal [[nucleophilic substitution]] at [[enantiopure]] '''1''' in the scheme below, two products are formed – '''2a''' and '''2b'''. Due to the two chiral centers in the target molecule, the carbon carrying chlorine and the carbon carrying the methyl and acetoxyethyl group, four different compounds are to be formed: 1R,2R- (drawn as 2b) 1R,2S-  1S,2R- (drawn as 2a) and 1S,2S- . Therefore, both of the depicted structures will exist in a D- and an L-form. :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1021/ol062337x | title =TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Induced Anti-Markovnikov Rearrangement | year =2006 | last1 =Nishizawa | first1 =Mugio | last2 =Asai | first2 =Yumiko | last3 =Imagawa | first3 =Hiroshi | journal =Organic Letters | volume =8 | issue =25 | pages =5793–6 | pmid =17134274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AntiMarkovnikovRearrangement.png|center|500px|Anti-Markovnikov rearrangement]]

This product distribution can be rationalized by assuming that loss of the [[alcohol|hydroxy]] group in '''1''' gives the tertiary [[carbocation]] '''A''', which rearranges to the seemingly less stable secondary carbocation '''B'''. Chlorine can approach this center from two faces leading to the observed mixture of isomers.

Another notable example of anti-Markovnikov addition is [[hydroboration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16914">'''Māori phonology''' is typical for [[Polynesian languages]], its [[Phonetics|phonetic]] inventory is one of the smallest in the world with considerable variation in realisation.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=15, 77}} The [[Māori language]] retains the [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] syllable structure: ([[Consonant|C]])[[Vowel|V]](V(V)), with no closed [[syllable]]s.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=17}}{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=69}}{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=71}} The stress pattern is unpredictable unlike many other Polynesian languages.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=82}}
{{TOCleft}}
{{-}}

== Phonemes ==
The sound system of Māori is conservative; it is close to the system the Proto-[[Central Eastern Polynesian languages|Central Eastern Polynesian]] language had.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=62}} Most {{ill|Māori dialects|ru|диалекты маори}} have 10 consonant and 5 vowel [[phoneme]]s.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=62}} The most unstable phonemes are /f/ and /ŋ/.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=65}}

Despite the widely-held belief that the Māori phonetic system is simple and straightforward, in reality the realisation of Māori phonemes differs significantly; it depends on the speaker's age, the chosen [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and other factors.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}}

The most frequent Māori phonemes are /a/ (18%), /i/ (11,3%), /t/ (9,8%).{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=68}} In an average text, vowels make up slightly more than 60 per cent of all the phonemes.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=68}} Several combinations are extremely rare: /fo/, /fu/; also /wo/ and /wu/ can only be found in [[loanword]]s.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=69}} The reason for the first two combinations to become rare is that *f + ''[[Roundedness|rounded]] vowel'' got merged with *s &gt; /h/; the second pair was not attested in any reconstructions of the Proto-Polynesian language.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=70}}

=== Consonants ===
An unusual feature of Māori is the lack of [[sibilant]]s, the most frequently encountered type of [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] consonants, as well as the lack of {{IPAslink|j}} which is the most widespread [[semivowel]] phoneme in world languages.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=63}}

|
|
|
|}

Unvoiced phonemes, /h/, and [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] [[allophone]]s of /t/ and /k/ are sporadically voiced in fast speech. Devoicing of sonorants has also been attested in the same environment.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}}

In loanwords, /h/ affects surrounding vowels by making them more [[Close vowel|close]].{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=64}}

The realisation of /t/ and /k/ can be [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalised]] or [[Velarization|velarised]]; /t/ before /i/ and /u/ changes to an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}, especially if it occurs in the last syllable of the phrase.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}} Starting from the 19th century both /t/ and /k/ are increasingly aspirated. The article ''te'' can be pronounced as {{IPAblink|ð|ə}} in unstressed environment.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}} Sometimes /k/ is voiced to /ɣ/ in unstressed sylables.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}}

The [[place of articulation]] of /h/ is affected by the following vowel: ''hī'' “fish” is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ç|i|ː}}, but in ''hoa'' “friend” /h/ becomes [[Labialization|labialised]].

Most speakers pronounce /f/ as {{IPAblink|f}},{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}} but historically {{IPAblink|ɸ}} dominated; the realisations {{IPAblink|ʍ}} and {{IPAblink|h}} also occurred (see [[#Historical phonology]]).

The /r/ phoneme is most frequently realised as {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, sometimes it is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɹ}} (in ''kōrero'' “speech”) and {{IPAblink|l}}; according to 19-century data, it was common for the dialects of the [[South Island]], but occurs everywhere.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=77}}

The number of phonemes is small, so their realisation varies considerably.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=77}}

Phrase-final vowels can be reduced. This is especially true for short vowels, but it happens to long ones as well in fast speech.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=76}}

Like in [[New Zealand English]], the Māori phonemes /u/ and /uː/ are closer to [[central vowel]]s, that is, {{IPAblink|ʉ}}.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=80}}

For Māori monophtongs there are minimal pairs differentiated by [[vowel length]]:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=66}}
* kēkē “armpit” ~ keke “pie”;
* kākā “[[New Zealand kaka]]” ~ kaka “[[Plant stem|stem]]”;
* kōkō “[[Tui (bird)|tui]]” ~ koko “shovel”;
* kīkī “to speak” ~ kiki “to kick”;
* kūkū “[[New Zealand pigeon]]” ~ kuku “fear”.

Long vowels are pronounced for approximately twice as long as their short counterparts.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=79}}

Some linguists consider long vowels to be variants of the short ones, while others count them separately. The second approach is supported by the difference in quality between them: the long vowels are more centralised.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=67}}
* {{IPAslink|a}} is realised as {{IPAblink|ɐ}};
* /aː/ is realised as {{IPAblink|ɑː}}.

Beside [[monophthong]]s Māori has many [[diphthong]] vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=69}} [[Formant]] frequency analysis distinguish /aĭ/, /aĕ/, /aŏ/, /aŭ/, /oŭ/ as diphthongs.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=79}}

== Phonotactics ==
Māori [[phonotactics]] is often described using a term '[[mora (linguistics)|mora]]' which in this context is a combination of a short vowel and a preceding consonant (if present). Long vowels and diphthongs are counted as two moras. With these units it is easier to set up boundaries for [[reduplication]], define [[allomorph]]s for some particles, and it also might be important to define the poetic meter of [[Māori poetry]].{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=71}}
* ''kaumātua'' “elder”{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=71}}:
** four [[syllable]]s: /kau.maa.tu.a/
** six moras: /ka.u.ma.a.tu.a/

For example, when the word  ''ako'' “to learn” is [[reduplication|reduplicated]], the resulted word ''akoako'' “give or take counsel” has the first syllable stressed, while the reduplication of ''oho'' “to wake up” -- ''ohooho'' “to be awake” -- often has the second syllable stressed. The reason is that /oa/ in the first example is a sequence of short vowels while /oo/ forms a single syllable peak.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=73}}

== Stress ==
Most Polynesian languages [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] the second to last mora of the word, but Māori stress is following many elaborate rules, which still remain not thoroughly understood.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=82}}. One of the rules requires assigning hierarchy to syllables, and if more than one syllable receives the highest rank, the first one gets stressed:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=82}}
# syllables with long vowels or geminate clusters;
# syllables with diphthongs;
# syllables with short vowels.

In addition to word stress, Māori has phrasal stress that falls on the second to last mora:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=83}}
* ''Ko te rangatíra, o tēnei márae'' “the [[rangatira]] of this [[marae]]”;
* ''Ko te maráe, o tēnei rángatira'' “the marae of this rangatira”.

This rule can also be applied to words that were formed by adding productive [[Voice (grammar)|passive]] and [[Nominalization|nominalisation]] suffixes:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=83}}
* ''káranga'' “call” &gt; ''karánga-tia'' “be called”;
* ''rángatira'' “chief” &gt; ''rangatíra-tanga'' “chiefdom”.

In reduplicated words, the first syllable of the repeated sequence has primary stress while the secondary stress falls on the first syllable of the second reduplication:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=83}}
* ''āníwanìwa'' “rainbow”.

The first syllable of the prefix ''whaka-'' “to cause something” is never stressed, but if it is added to a word starting with a vowel and forms a diphthong or a long vowel, the resulting syllable moves higher in the syllable hierarchy and might get stressed: ''whakap'''u'''ta'' “to emerge; to publish”, but ''whak'''aa'''ko'' “to teach”.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=84}}

Loanwords from English do not follow the rules at all.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=84}} Many researchers mention considerable variation in stress patterns.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=85}}

== Historical phonology ==
[[File:"Political Oceania" CIA World Factbook.jpg|thumb|300px|The map of Oceania]]
Reconstructions assume that [[Proto-Oceanic language]] had 23 consonant phonemes, and only 13 remained in [[Proto-Polynesian language]]: [[Voicelessness|unvoiced]] and voiced [[stop consonant]]s that contrasted in Proto-Oceanic merged, only two [[nasal consonant]]s remained, two more consonants disappeared completely, but at the same time Proto-Polynesian acquired [[vowel length]] distinction.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=15—16}} Māori retains all five Proto-Oceanic vowels.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=16}} From a [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] standpoint, Proto-Polynesian lost consonant clusters and syllable-final consonants, although their [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflexes]] can still be found: the [[Voice (grammar)|passive]] form of the word ''inu'' “to drink” is ''inumia'', from *inum + ia.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=16}} Proto-Polynesian *[[Glottal stop|ʔ]] and *h disappeared in Māori, while *l and *r got merged into /r/ (the disappearance of /h/ and /l/-/t/ merger are typical innovations that can be found among the [[Nuclear Polynesian languages]], and the disappearance of /ʔ/ is typical for Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian languages.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=17}}

|}

NB: /w/ is a very rare reflex of *f that is attested in five words as *faf became /wah/.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=17}}

Generally speaking, the Proto-Polynesian *f &gt; /h/ before [[Labialization|labialised]] vowels, but is preserved as /f/ initially before non-labialised vowels.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=18}} Exceptions are likely reflecting that the merge of *f and *s took considerable time.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=18}} The /f/ ~ /h/ variation is also seen in dialects: *fea &gt; /fea/ in western dialects of the [[North Island]], but /hea/ in eastern dialects.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=20}}

Many [[homophone]]s were formed due to the phonetic inventory shrinking: for example, the word ''tau'' “suitable” and the word ''tau'' “season” are stemming from Proto-Polynesian *tau and *taʔu, respectively. Another consequence of this change is the frequent occurrence of long vowels: Proto-Polynesian *kehe &gt; ''kē''.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=17}}

Māori retains all the vowels Proto-Oceanic language had, but they underwent systematic changes:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=19}}
* Proto-Polynesian *u &gt; /o/ in the second syllable (an innovation found in all Nuclear Polynesian panguages);
* word-initially, *a &gt; /o/ (a [[Tahitic languages|Tahitic]] innovation);
* sometimes *a &gt; /o/ (occurs in many Polynesian languages irregularly).

One of the many examples of irregular changes that happened in Māori is Proto-Polynesian *lima “hand” &gt; Māori /riŋa/, although a related word *lima “five” turned into /rima/ in Māori; another one is a change from Proto-Eastern-Polynesian *aanuanua “rainbow” &gt; ānuanua in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] while becoming āniwaniwa in Māori.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=20}}

Māori has many [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] like /raŋo/ = /ŋaro/ (from Proto-Polynesian *laŋo) and /pouaru/ (North Island) = /poueru/ (South Island).{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=20}} Many of them occur due to [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], or the rearranging of sounds. In Māori's case metathesis switches adjacent vowels, consonants or syllables; in addition to that there exists a rare type of metathesis that involves sound features instead of segments: in tenga ~ kenakena “Adam's apple” the consonants' [[place of articulation]] changes while retaining nasality; in inohi ~ unahi “scales” the subject of metathesis is the vowel labialisation, but not the [[vowel height]].{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=21}} Some [[morpheme]]s have [[allomorph]]s: for example, the [[prefix]] /ŋaːti/ changes to /ŋaːi/ if it is preceding a word that starts with /t/: /ŋaːti porou/, but /ŋaːi tahu/; the same can be observed for /motu/ (“island”): /''mou''tohoraː/, [[Moutohora Island]].{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=21}}

Māori has undergone several notable sound changes during the last 200 years, most likely under the influence of [[New Zealand English]] phonetic system: ''wh'' changed from [ɸ] to [f]; stop consonants /p/, /t/, /k/ acquired aspiration; /əʊ/ and /oʊ/ merged.{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=22—23}} Linguists studied several recordings of Māori and English speakers of different ages, that had been made in 1940s by the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Service]], and concluded that the change indeed took place. As an example, the results for ''wh'' can be found below:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=22—23}}
: {{IPAslink|ɸ}} 50 %
: {{IPAslink|ʍ}} 18 %
: {{IPAslink|f}} 13 %
: {{IPAslink|h}} 20 %&lt;ref group="NB"&gt;''wh'' is realised as /h/ when it precedes /a/, usually in the unstressed prefix ''whaka-''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] /p/, /t/, /k/ gradually increased, this change is also evident in recordings of speakers of different age:{{sfn|Harlow|2006|p=23}}
: recording from 1947, informant born in 1885: 6% aspirated
: recording from 2001, informant born in 1934: 49% aspirated
: recording from 2001, informant born in 1972: 88% aspirated

==Regional variations==
{{seemain|Māori language#Dialects}}
Although modern Māori has largely been standardised around the form which was primarily formerly found in the central North Island, historically regional variations did exist, one of which — [[Southern Māori language|Southern Māori]] — has been revived to a very limited extent. This dialect displays marked phonological variations, notably in the existence of [[apocope]]. Several consonants are also changed in this dialect, with {{IPAslink|k}} replacing {{IPAslink|ŋ}}, {{IPAslink|w}} replacing {{IPAslink|f}}, and {{IPAslink|l}} used in place of {{IPAslink|r}} in some areas.

'''Old Tagalog''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Lumang Tagalog''; [[Baybayin]]: {{script|Tglg|ᜎᜓᜋᜅ᜔ᜆᜄᜎᜓᜄ᜔}}, Pre-Kudlit: {{script|Tglg|ᜎᜓᜋᜆᜄᜎᜓ}}) is the earliest form of the [[Tagalog language]] and was the language of [[Central Luzon|Central]] and [[Southern Tagalog|Southern Luzon]] during the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Classical period]] in [[Luzon]]. It is the language of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], [[Namayan]], state of [[Ma-i]], [[Rajahnate of Maynila]], and other regions of the northern Philippines. The language originated from the [[Proto-Philippine language]] and evolved to Classical Tagalog, which was the basis for [[Tagalog language|Modern Tagalog]].

==Etymology==
{{main article|Tagalog language}}
The word ''Tagalog'' is derived from the [[endonym]] '''{{script|Tglg|ᜆᜄ ᜁᜎᜓᜄ᜔}}''' (''taga-ilog'', "river dweller"), composed of '''{{script|Tglg|ᜆᜄ}}''' (''tagá-'', "native of" or "from") and '''{{script|Tglg|ᜁᜎᜓᜄ᜔}}''' (''ílog'', "river"). Very little is known about the ancient history of the language; [[Linguistics|linguists]] such as Dr. David Zorc and Dr. [[Robert Blust]] speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups had originated in Northeastern [[Mindanao]] or the Eastern [[Visayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Zorc, David. 1977. ''The Bisayan Dialects of the Philippines: Subgrouping and Reconstruction''. ''Pacific Linguistics'' C.44. Canberra: The Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blust, Robert. 1991. ''The Greater Central Philippines hypothesis''. Oceanic Linguistics'' 30:73–129&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Baybayin(alibata)traditional form.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Baybayin]] script, used to write in Tagalog prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 16th century.]]
Old Tagalog is one of the [[Central Philippine languages]], which evolved from the [[Proto-Philippine language]], which comes from the Austronesian peoples who settled in the Philippines, 2000 years ago. This is the language of Ma-i, Tondo, Maynila, Namayan, and other regions of Central Luzon.

The early history of the Tagalog language remains relatively obscure, and a number of theories exist as to the exact origins of the Tagalog peoples and their language. Most{{Who|date=July 2018}} scholars suggest that the Tagalogs originated in North-eastern Mindanao or the Eastern Visayas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The first written record of Tagalog is the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] which dates to 900&amp;nbsp;CE, and exhibits fragments of the language along with [[Sanskrit]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and Old Tagalog.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Antoon. (1992). The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary. ''Philippine Studies'' vol. 40, no. 2:183–203&lt;/ref&gt; The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Zorc, David. 1977. ''The Bisayan Dialects of the Philippines: Subgrouping and Reconstruction''. ''Pacific Linguistics'' C.44. Canberra: The Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;

The question has been raised about the origin of some words in the various dialects of the Philippines and their possible connection to ancient Buddhist and Hindu culture in the region, as the language is influenced by [[Sanskrit]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vedicempire.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=26 |title=Indian Origins of Filipino Customs |publisher=Vedic Empire |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino|title=The Indian in the Filipino - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=Globalnation.inquirer.net|date=|accessdate=2013-11-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621051322/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino|archivedate=2015-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
{{main article|Baybayin}}
Old Tagalog was written in [[Baybayin]], which belongs to the Brahmic family of scripts. Loanwords from [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit]] were written in the [[Kawi script]] because they could not be represented in Baybayin.

===Examples of words===
* The words and sentences of Old Tagalog are the roots of the Modern Tagalog language. Some of the words and sentences have evolved over time (like the word ''Babuy'' or [[Pig]], which became ''Baboy'' in modern Tagalog), but some of the words in Old Tagalog (like ''Hari'' or [[King]]), have survived and are in common use in Modern Tagalog.

"'''Perchance to Dream'''" is episode nine of the American television [[anthology series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It originally aired on November 27, 1959 on [[CBS]]. 
The title of the episode and the [[Charles Beaumont]] [[short story]] that inspired it is taken from ''[[Hamlet|Hamlet's]]'' "[[To be, or not to be]]" speech.&lt;ref&gt;from ''Hamlet'', Act III, Scene I:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To die, - To sleep, -&lt;br&gt;
To sleep ! Perchance to dream: - ay, there's the rub;&lt;br&gt;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,&lt;br&gt;
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,&lt;br&gt;
Must give us pause: there's the respect&lt;br&gt;
That makes calamity of so long life;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Twelve o'clock noon. An ordinary scene, an ordinary city. Lunchtime for thousands of ordinary people. To most of them, this hour will be a rest, a pleasant break in a day's routine. To most, but not all. To Edward Hall, time is an enemy, and the hour to come is a matter of life and death.}}

==Plot==
Edward Hall ([[Richard Conte|Conte]]), a man with a severe heart condition, believes that if he falls asleep, he'll die. On the other hand, keeping himself awake will put too much of a strain on his heart. He believes this due to his constantly overactive imagination. He believes that his imagination is severely out of control, to the point where he'd be able to see and feel something that was not there. Due to this, his heart condition is especially dangerous. He seeks out the aid of psychiatrist Dr. Elliott Rathmann and explains that he has been dreaming in chapters, as if in a [[movie serial]]. In his dreams, Maya, a carnival dancer, lures him first into a [[funhouse]] and later onto a roller coaster in an attempt to scare him to death. Realizing that Rathmann cannot help him, Hall starts to leave, but stops when he sees that Rathmann's receptionist looks exactly like Maya. Terrified, he runs back into Rathmann's office and jumps out of the window.

In reality, the doctor calls his receptionist, who does in fact look exactly like Maya, into his office, where Hall lies on the couch, his eyes closed. Rathmann tells the receptionist that Hall came in, laid down, immediately fell asleep, and then a few moments later let out a scream and died. "Well, I guess there are worse ways to go," the doctor says philosophically. "At least he died peacefully..."

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|They say a dream takes only a second or so, and yet in that second a man can live a lifetime. He can suffer and die, and who's to say which is the greater reality: the one we know or the one in dreams, between heaven, the sky, the earth - in the Twilight Zone.}}

==Episode notes==
*This was the first episode aired that was written by [[Charles Beaumont]] (and also the first that was not written by [[Rod Serling]]).
*"Throughout the TV filming, Florey strove for quality. It might have been the most expensive MGM feature. He rooted out the meanings of certain lines, frequently surprising me with symbols and shadings I'd neither planned nor suspected. The set was truly impressionistic, recalling the days of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|Caligari]]'' and ''[[Liliom (1934 film)|Liliom]]''. The costumes were generally perfect. And in the starring role, [[Richard Conte]] gave a performance which displays both intensity and subtlety." ―[[Charles Beaumont]] writing in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', December 1959.
*This is one of several episodes from season one to have its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for season two. This was done during the Summer of 1961 in order to give the re-running episodes of season one the new look that the show would take in the upcoming second season.
*It has been speculated that this episode, and the novella which spawned it, served as [[Wes Craven]]'s inspiration for the ''[[Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series, particularly since both Craven (who himself directed several episodes of TZ during the 1980s) and Beaumont deal with a common theme: fear of sleep, over something which literally kills in one's dreams. Craven, however, insisted that his work was never inspired by Beaumont's.

==Radio drama==
The episode was adapted for radio in 2002 featuring [[Fred Willard]] as Edward Hall. It was then released as part of ''The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas – Volume 9'' collection.

'''''Rayman Origins''''' is a [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montpellier]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="pree3-destr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamekyo.com/newsfr41564_rayman-origins-sur-3ds-et-vita.html|title=Rayman Origins coming to the Vita 3DS, Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3|author=Régis Déprez|publisher=Gamekyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth main installment in the ''[[Rayman]]'' series, and the first main installment since 2003's ''[[Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc]]''. The game was released on 15 November 2011 in North America, 24 November 2011 in Australia, and 25 November 2011 in Europe for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]]. It was released later for [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[OS X]] version of the game was released on 12 December 2013 by [[Feral Interactive]].&lt;ref name="feralinteractive.com"/&gt; The story follows [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], his friend Globox and two teensies as they fight Darktoons and other evil creatures that have infected the Glade of Dreams.

''Rayman Origins'' has received critical acclaim, being highly praised for its graphical style, level design, and sense of humor. Despite its critical reception, it did not perform very well commercially during its original release in November 2011. A mobile game based on ''Origins'', titled '''''Rayman Jungle Run''''', was developed by Pastagames and released for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and for Windows Phone 8 on 29 May 2013. A sequel, ''[[Rayman Legends]]'', was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Wii U]] and [[Xbox 360]] on 29 August 2013 in Australia, 30 August 2013 in Europe, and 3 September 2013 in North America to similar critical acclaim.

==Plot==
[[File:Rayman and Betilla (Rayman Origins).jpg|thumb|left|Rayman and Betilla]]
400 years before the events of ''[[Rayman: Hoodlums' Revenge]]'', Bubble Dreamer, [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], his best friend Globox, and a couple of Teensy friends are chilling out at Bubble Dreamer's resting grounds, the Snoring Tree. However, their snoring disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead, who retaliates by sending an evil army of horrendous creatures and the Darktoons across the world. The heroes, being woke up, attempt to fight back, but are defeated and captured. Rayman escapes and finds the Darktoons have captured the Electoons that inhabit the world, imprisoned Betilla the Nymph and her sisters and plunged the Glade of Dreams into chaos. This causes Bubble Dreamer to go crazy, and as a result, have nightmares. Rayman and his friends are then tasked by the Magician to gather enough Electoons to cure Bubble Dreamer and restore the Glade. Their efforts to locate the Electoons allow them to gain access to the various lands of the Glade, and rescue the Nymphs along the way.

Eventually, they make their way to a mysterious gate, which can only be opened by rescuing the Glade Kings, who have been turned into monsters as a result of Bubble Dreamer's nightmares. Upon freeing the Glade Kings, the Nymphs are able to open the stargate, granting Rayman access to a hideout in the land of Moody Clouds. There, they discover that their supposed friend, the Magician, is the one responsible for the Moody Clouds. He secretly admires Mr. Dark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raymanpc.com/wiki/script-en/images/a/a3/Gabrielle_Shrager_Facebook_conversation.jpg|title=Gabrielle Shrager Facebook Conversation|author=Shrager, Gabrielle|publisher=Rayman Pirate-Community|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the villain of the original ''Rayman'', and was in fact behind the events that caused the Land of the Livid Dead forces to attack, preoccupying the heroes and using the Lums they gave him to power and use his diabolical machines. The Magician sends Rayman and his friends into a pit, but they escape and return to his office. The Magician then begins to dance and sends them into a dancing funk, using this as a good time to escape. The heroes chase after and fight the Magician in his escape airship, sending it crashing into the power source of his hideout. The resulting chain of events causes the hideout to explode, while Rayman and his friends free-fall back to the Snoring Tree, where they proceed to resume their relaxation.

If players manage to collect the ten ruby teeth throughout the game, they can gain access to the Land of the Livid Dead, where another monster awaits.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Rayman Origins gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Rayman Origins'' co-operative gameplay]]
''Rayman Origins'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformer]], the same style as the [[Rayman (video game)|original ''Rayman'' game]]. ''Rayman Origins'' is playable with up to four local players who may drop in or out at any time. Players can choose to control either [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], Globox or two Teensies, with additional costumes available as the game progresses.&lt;ref name="GI-218" /&gt;

Players travel through each level, fighting enemies and rescuing imprisoned Electoons. As the game progresses, players gain new abilities such as running up walls, gliding in midair, swimming and shrinking in size to reach new areas. Certain segments also see players riding a mosquito, where players can shoot enemies or inhale and fire them. If a character is hit by an enemy or obstacle, they will "bubblize", or inflate into a ballooned state. To get out of this state, another player can slap, or jump on them, similar to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. Players can also collect hearts that will protect them from one hit. However, if all players are bubblized simultaneously, or if a character is hit during single play, they will explode and the play will return to the last checkpoint, normally a Darkblocker where the player had go through before, or the last place where the player broke a cage. Throughout each level, players can collect yellow Lums, which they will need for Electoons. When a character collects a Lum King, it turns all Lums red for a short time. Red Lums are worth two yellow Lums.&lt;ref name="pree3-destr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="e32011-gamespotpreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|title=Rayman Origins Exclusive First Look Preview|author=Mark Walton|publisher=Gamespot UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812033625/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|archivedate=August 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Skull Coins placed in hidden or dangerous areas. They are worth 25 Lums if successfully collected. If the player gets harmed while collecting a Skull Coin, they will lose it. In this situation, the player must try again to get the coin.

In order to progress through certain parts of the story, players need to free Electoons. The most common way to get Electoons is to free them from cages; there is one at the end of each level, with more to be found in hidden areas and are guarded by several enemies that collectively use a forcefield to protect the cage, the team must defeat every single enemy that uses the forcefield, then the cage can be destroyed. The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a single cage, collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3. More Electoons can be earned by collecting a certain amount of Lums within a level and clearing Time Trials that are unlocked after clearing a level once. Scoring high marks in either of these challenges can also earn medals and trophies. Players can also unlock special 'treasure chest' levels, in which they must chase a runaway treasure chest across a dangerous course in order to receive a skull tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/rayman-origins-full-access-preview/ |title=Rayman Origins – Full Access Preview, Rayman Origins Xbox 360 Features |publisher=GamesRadar |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing all of the teeth grants access to the [[Bonus stage|bonus level]], The  Land of the Livid Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nov 18, 2011 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/uk-10-rayman-origins/724153 |title=Rayman Origins Video Game, UK 10 Ways To Beat The Game Trailer HD &amp;#124; Video Clip &amp;#124; Game Trailers &amp; Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While every version of the game is nearly identical due to the game engine's high versatility, there are some minor differences across platforms.  The Wii version of the game takes advantage of the versatility (though not the motion controls) of the [[Wii Remote]] to provide three different control schemes, while the Nintendo 3DS version displays the player's current progress during a particular level on the touchscreen.  The PlayStation Vita version has some additional unlockable content, and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions support online [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]].

==Development==
The game was officially announced at the end of Ubisoft's E3 2010 press conference as a downloadable episodic title&lt;ref name="e32010-announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265560/ubisoft-announces-rayman-origins|title=Ubisoft announces Rayman Origins|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191556/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265560/ubisoft-announces-rayman-origins|archivedate=November 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] with release on [[Microsoft Windows|PC]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[iPad]], and [[iPhone]] "to be considered".&lt;ref&gt;[http://raymanorigins.uk.ubi.com/2010/07/02/about-the-game/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was originally to be released by the end of 2010, but was delayed until 2011.&lt;ref name="gamestop-holiday2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6268270.html|title=Rayman Origins zapping holiday 2010|author=Tom Magrino|publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/12/22/rayman-origins-a-no-show-for-holiday-2010|title=Rayman Origins a no-show for holiday 2010|author=Ludwig Kietzmann|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a dearth of information in the new year, the project was confirmed as alive in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rayman Origins to be 'a big event,' Ubisoft CEO says |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/08/rayman-origins-to-be-a-big-event-ubisoft-ceo-says/ |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, it was announced the title has been expanded to a full-retail title, with a tentative release of Q4 2011.&lt;ref name="fullretailgame"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rayman Origins now a retail game |url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/news/news-8295-Rayman-Origins-Now-a-Retail-Title;-Coming-This-Holiday.html |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is the first title to use [[UbiArt Framework]], an in-house graphics engine which allows artists to easily create content and then use it in an interactive environment. The artists only have to pose the model and edit the silhouette, as the software takes care of image distortion automatically. The main aim of this engine is to allow artists and designers focus on the art itself, without having to worry about technical aspects of game development.&lt;ref name="GI-218"&gt;''Game Informer'', Issue 218, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yves Guillemot, only five people were working on the game when it was first announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=JC |last=Fletcher|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/06/rayman-origins-slapped-on-xbla-psn-this-christmas-other-platfo/ |title=Rayman Origins slapped on XBLA, PSN this Christmas, other platforms possible |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=July 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft obtained a French government grant, dedicated to supporting the arts, for developing UbiArt tools.&lt;ref name="GI-218" /&gt; The engine is optimized for HD resolutions, allowing games to run in full 1080p HD at 60 frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=in development |url=http://ubi-art.uk.ubi.com/2010/06/14/about-the-things-we-use-in-ubiart-framework/ |title=Ubiart's blog » Blog Archive » About the things we use in UbiArt Framework |publisher=Ubi-art.uk.ubi.com |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was further developed for ''Rayman Legends'' to include dynamic lighting and integration of 3D models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warr |first=Philippa |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/02/rayman-legends-ubi-art-framework |title=Interview: Rayman Legends 'richer and bigger' thanks to delayed release (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930195747/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/02/rayman-legends-ubi-art-framework |archivedate=September 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rayman Origins'' received widespread critical acclaim. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave the Wii version 92/100,&lt;ref name="MCWII" /&gt; the PlayStation Vita version 88/100,&lt;ref name="MCVITA" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 87/100&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 87/100,&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; the PC version 86/100,&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; and the Nintendo 3DS version 71/100.&lt;ref name="MC3DS" /&gt;

''[[1UP.com]]'' gave the game an A- Rank, praising its varied level design, saying "Origins' brilliance is it keeps that simplicity on the surface, but ends up feeling incredibly varied thanks to its level design", and calling it "the best 2D platformer not called ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]''."&lt;ref name=1UP/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]'' rated the game 8/10, calling it "a delightful, playful, and occasionally exhilarating platformer" while opining that the level design was inferior to the ''Mario'' series in that "the same ideas are repeated too often."&lt;ref name=EuroG/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game a score of 8.5/10.&lt;ref name=GT/&gt;

[[IGN]] gave it a 9.5/10, saying that "Rayman Origins is the best looking platformer this generation and also the most fun. A truly realized vision at the top of its genre, Rayman Origins is an extravaganza with plenty of action to keep it fresh from start to finish and beyond,"&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

''[[Joystiq]]'' gave the game 5 stars out of 5, saying it "embodies the kind of creativity and craftsmanship that have been largely missing in 2D platfomers since their heyday in the 16-bit era."&lt;ref name=Joystiq/&gt;

''[[Nintendo Life]]'' awarded it a 10/10 and called it "The very pinnacle of 2D platforming and undoubtedly one of the Wii’s very best games".&lt;ref name=NLife/&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' gave the game a score of 9.5/10, calling it 'a platforming masterpiece.'&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;

===Awards===

'''Self-perpetuation''', the capability of something to cause itself to continue to [[existence|exist]], is one of the main characteristics of [[life]]. [[Organism]]s' capability of [[reproduction]] leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. [[Population]]s self-perpetuate and grow. Entire [[ecosystem]]s show [[homeostasis]], and thus perpetuate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hilgardia|volume=39|issue=13|pages=367–404|doi=10.3733/hilg.v39n13p367|year=1968|title=Mechanisms of population homeostasis in Anagasta ecosystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Population homeostasis
|author=Koeslag JH.
|journal=S Afr Med J
|year=1978
|volume=53
|issue=6
|pages=222–4.
|pmid=653514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slow modifying effect of [[succession (ecology)|succession]] and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecol. Appl. |year=2015 |volume=25|issue=8|pages=2051–68|title=The rise of novelty in ecosystems|pmid=26910939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by [[evolution]], a perfect [[steady state]] of the biological system is never reached. [[Sexual reproduction]] is also a form of imperfect [[self-replication]] and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] and [[mutation]]. Organisms are not like [[self-replicating machine]] but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.

In a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and (usually) [[positive feedback]] loops:
{{quote|To overcome strong prior [[beliefs]], strong evidence to the contrary is needed. If a person is predisposed to choosing a certain action, the advice from an advisor who sets a low threshold for recommending the alternative action is not of much use. The preference for like-minded advisors who supply coarse information implies that the advice a person receives is likely to
reinforce his existing [[priors]]. This effect can lead to polarisation of opinion and the [[emergence]] of self-serving beliefs. The learning process is prolonged and the induced short run bias can become perpetual if information is costly|Wing Suen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Self-Perpetuation of Biased Beliefs
|author=Wing Suen
|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on [[self-sustainability]], or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.

In computer science, [[self-reproducing program]]s constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in [[computer virus]]es which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.

The '''Sheketak Group''' was created by duo Danny Rahum and Tzahi Patish in 1997. The Group's productions combine [[contemporary dance]], lively [[music]], [[video]], and [[theater]]. The group put on their shows in [[Israel]] and in around 30 other countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheketak.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the group's name is the blending of two words in [[Hebrew]]: Sheket (silence), and Tak (the creation of sound). The word "sheketak" is widely used by the group's artists in order to express rhythmic and musical phrases during a work process.

Sheketak won the "Young Creators" prize of the Ministry of Culture and Education of 2001.

Sheketak partook in various televisional and theatrical productions, such as "King Solomon and Shlomi the Shoemaker" in Habima Theater, and TV shows such as [[Kokhav Nolad]], [[Nolad Lirkod]], and [[Yair Lapid]] and [[Dudu Topaz]]'s talk shows.

The managers of Sheketak created several soundtracks and choreography for many televisional productions and commercials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">The '''Summit of Ohrid 2013''' was a planned meeting of [[political leader]]s of countries in [[South Eastern Europe]] as well as representatives of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] that would be held on 1 June in the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] city of [[Ohrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitel.com.mk/vesti/makedonija?page=2 Sitel Television - Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; On the 29th of May the [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Gjorge Ivanov]] in a press in the President's residence ''Villa Vodno'' made a statement that he would cancel the international meeting because of the forgive mixing of Balkan nationalism and prejudices.
{{Quote|Macedonia has acted fully in line with the SEECP regulations. Unfortunately, old Balkan prejudices and complexes have surfaced in the run-up to the summit and I will not let Macedonia pay the price. We have been preparing for this summit all year and we have done everything to bring all leaders from the region to the same table.|Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia}}
Before the cancellation of the Summit all of the Balkan countries political leaders were invited. At first all of the countries have accepted the invitation except Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=2&amp;vest=3643 Nova TV - No answer from the Greek President {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Greece, the [[Bulgarian President]] [[Rosen Plevneliev]] made a statement that he also would not attend the Summit, but [[Bulgaria]] would be represented by Marin Raykov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.mk/cluster/cf789f3d37/otkaza-i-bugarskiot-pretsedatel-na-ohridskiot-samit.html Time.MK - Greek and Bulgarian President won't come to Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The last one to reject the invitation was the [[President of Albania]] [[Bujar Nishani]] who stated that he did so because leaders from the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] weren't attending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://24vesti.mk/albanskiot-pretsedatel-nishani-nema-da-uchestvuva-na-samitot-vo-ohrid 24 Vesti - Albanian President won't be a part of the Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supernova''''' is a British [[comedy]] television programme produced by [[Hartswood Films]] and jointly commissioned by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the UK and [[UKTV]] in Australia. It follows Dr Paul Hamilton ([[Rob Brydon]]), a Welsh astronomer, who leaves a dull academic post and unloved girlfriend for a new job at the Royal Australian Observatory, deep in the Australian [[outback]]. The comedy centres on his difficulties adjusting to life in the outback and his eccentric fellow [[Astronomy|astronomers]]. The first series was released in the United Kingdom and Australia in October 2005 and consisted of six 30-minute [[episode]]s. The second series began airing on 3 August 2006 in the UK.

The exterior scenes were shot at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia. The observatory itself is a CGI creation, according to the DVD commentary, and only a partial doorway was constructed on site for filming purposes.

==Plot==

During the series, Paul grapples with, amongst others, his attraction to his colleague Dr Rachel Mann (who is [[engagement|engaged]] to an [[astronaut]]), the arrival of his girlfriend at the observatory, and a bout of [[fatalism]] that comes on when he creates a simulation of [[Ultimate fate of the universe|how the Universe will end]].

'''''Tampó''''', in Filipino culture, refers to a behavior in which a person withdraws his or her affection or cheerfulness from a person who has hurt his or her feelings.&lt;ref name="carousel"&gt;[http://www.carouselpinoy.com/pinas.html Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English "sulking" or "to sulk" is often considered the closest translation of tampo and there is also the term the [[silent treatment]].&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/love.htm Love, Courtship In Filipino Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Malay-Indonesian equivalent is ''merajuk''.



== Manifestations ==
''Tampo'' usually is manifested in the withdrawal of affectionate or cheerful behavior, and its expression is almost entirely nonverbal.  These manifestations may include:&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt;

* resisting expressions of affection
* not talking to the person concerned, or to people in general
* being unusually quiet
* locking oneself in his or her own room
* refusing to eat
* not joining friends in group activities
* withdrawing from the group
* simply keeping to oneself.

These are usually efforts to get the offending party to make amends, and if these behaviors do not work, one might choose to escalate them, perhaps to foot-stamping, door-slamming, or muttering.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;[http://www.epinions.com/content_247551331972 Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Culture Shock!: Philippines at Epinions.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
While these external manifestations may indeed sound like "sulking" in the western sense, the underlying cultural reason for them is what sets ''tampo'' apart.  While sulking has strong negative connotations in western countries, ''tampo'' is quite acceptable among Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/egads/showart?show=jaf.0016&amp;idonly=JAF&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, ''tampo'' has positive connotations for the Filipino, quite aside from the obvious negative ones.

As a cultural behavior, ''tampo'' springs from the nonconfrontational nature of Philippine social interaction.  ''Tampo'' offers an acceptable means of expressing hurt feelings in a society in which direct expression of anger or resentment is discouraged.&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt;  The withdrawal behaviors of tampo are indirect ways of expressing hostility.&lt;ref name="carousel"/&gt;  ''Tampo'' may also be seen as a means by which Filipinos "save face",&lt;ref name="carousel"/&gt; as direct confrontation is usually a threat to the "smooth interpersonal relationships" (SIR) deeply valued in Philippine society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm Philippines - Social Values And Organization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses to person manifesting ==
The basic expectation of one who engages in ''tampo'' is that the offending party will woo or cajole him or her out of the feeling of being unhappy. The Tagalog word for this is ''amuhin'' or ''pagsuyo''.&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt; This wooing and cajoling is done in a loving and tender way, a gesture called ''lambing''.

For the offending party, the typical Philippine way of dealing with ''tampo'' is to respond to the offended party with friendly overtures or expressions of concern, after a short "cooling-off" period.  Not to do this may cause relations, especially romantic ones, to deteriorate.  In most instances in which ''tampo'' is engaged in, healing the inner, emotional relationship between two people is usually more critical than resolving the issue itself.&lt;ref name="carousel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

Per the Asawa Guide to Fil-West Relationships, tampo "is a mild behavioral reprimand that verges on role-playing. Tampo is mild and controlled and is the direct result of some perceived offense of a minor nature. It is short in duration. . . . Apologize for your bad behavior. Whether or not you’re guilty of the perceived 'crime' is irrelevant. The important thing is that your girlfriend or wife desires to be consoled. She has been wounded emotionally and requires emotional solace. Intellectual objections will have little effect, and may actually aggravate the condition. . . . After you apologize, allow the Filipina to lift the tampo slowly, at a respectable pace. Do not expect instant results. Do not continue apologizing, again and again, in an attempt to speed the tampo's demise. This will only make you look foolish, and it won't work. Keep your dignity, and let her keep hers. . . . Similarly, don’t accuse a Filipina of tampo – that will embarrass her, and would be a breach of etiquette on your part. Her job is to execute the tampo as best she can, and your job is to play along and make her feel better. . . . The old standby's are still effective: a romantic card, chocolate, jewelry. . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asawa Guide to Fil-West Relationships|author=Lingerfelt, Bob|edition=12th|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related cultural traits ==
As other Asians, Filipinos believe strongly in saving face. This is why a Philippine affirmative response to an invitation may actually mean "maybe" or even "I don’t know" instead of "yes" (Filipinos often have difficulty in bringing themselves to respond negatively, so one who issues a dinner invitation may wish to confirm it several times to ensure that the invited Filipino did not respond affirmatively simply because he could not find a proper way to say "no").  Tied to saving face are ''amor propio'', or "self respect", and ''hiya'', or "shame".  A Filipino would be considered lacking in ''amor propio'' if, for example, he accepted criticism weakly or did not offer honored guests proper hospitality.  ''Hiya'' is felt by those whose actions are considered socially unacceptable (one of the strongest insults in Philippine society is to be labeled ''walang-hiya'', or "shameless").  Each person is expected to have ''hiya'' and to win the respect of others by conforming to common behavioral norms. Those who change allegiances for personal convenience are seen as double-faced, or [[Carambola|''balimbing'']]  (after the many-sided fruit).&lt;ref name="carousel"/&gt;

== Usage of the term ==
* ''Nagtampo'':  past tense form of the word
* ''Nagtatampo'':  present participle form of the word
* ''Magtatampo'':  future tense of the word, generally employed as an affectionate threat
* ''Tampuhan'':  a lovers' quarrel, often manifested in total [[silent treatment]] or not speaking to each other&lt;ref name="NIUCSAS"/&gt;
* ''Tampururót'':  a humorous variant, it is a [[portmanteau]] of ''tampo'' and  ''pururót'', or [[diarrhoea]]. As a verb, it refers to uncalled-for, excessive ''tampo''; as a noun it refers to a person who uses ''tampo'' easily and frequently (i.e. like bowel movements caused by diarrohea).

'''The Banner of Freedom''' ({{lang-sm|O Le Fu'a o Le Sa'olotoga o Samoa}}) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Samoa]].  Both the words (which honour the country's flag) and the music were composed by Sauni Iiga Kuresa.  Samoa adopted ''The Banner of Freedom'' as its national anthem upon gaining its independence from [[New Zealand]] in 1962.

[[Samoan language|Samoan]] version:

:'' Samoa, tula'i ma sisi ia lau fu'a, lou pale lea!''
:'' Samoa, tula'i ma sisi ia lau fu'a, lou pale lea!''
:'' Vaai 'i na fetu o lo'u a agiagia ai:''
:'' Le faailoga lea o Iesu, na maliu ai mo Samoa.''
:'' Oi, Samoa e, u'u mau lau pule ia faavavau.''
:'' 'Aua e te fefe; o le Atua lo ta fa'avae, o lota sa'olotoga.''
:'' Samoa, tula'i: 'ua agiagia lau fu'a, lou pale lea!''

[[English language|English]] translation:

:''Samoa, arise and raise your [[Flag of Samoa|flag]], your crown!''
:''Samoa, arise and raise your flag, your crown!''
:''Look at those [[Southern Cross|stars]] that are waving on it:''
:''This is the symbol of [[Jesus]], who died on it for Samoa.''
:''Oh, Samoa, hold fast your power forever.''
:''Do not be afraid; God is our foundation, our freedom.''
:''Samoa, arise: your flag is waving, your crown!''

'''The Club of Odd Volumes''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] and [[bibliophilia|society of bibliophiles]] founded in 1887, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], USA.

== History ==
The club was founded on January 29, 1887, with the following intention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objects shall be to promote an interest in, and a love for whatever will tend to make literature attractive as given in the form of printed and illustrated volumes, to mutally assist in making researches and collections of first and rare editions, and to promote elegance in the production of Odd Volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Percival Merritt | chapter=The Club of Odd Volumes |title=The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82NIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=28 April 2013|year=1915|publisher=The Society|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The term ''odd'', as used in the club's name, is an eighteenth-century usage meaning ''varied'' or ''unmatched''.

'''''The Whale Caller''''' is a fifth novel written by South African writer [[Zakes Mda]], who is currently a professor at [[Ohio University]], It is a novel about a man in South Africa named Whale Caller. The Whale Caller first appears to be sexually attracted to whales; especially a whale he named Sharisha. As the story progresses, he meets a woman named Saluni, who falls deeply in love with the Whale Caller. Throughout the story, the Whale Caller constantly has internal conflicts. He tries to love Saluni, however he can not abandon the love he has toward his beloved whale, Sharisa.

==Plot==

''The Whale Caller'' begins with an introduction to the central core of the story by describing the Whale Caller’s ritual of blowing a special kelp horn to attract a whale he named Sharisha, a Southern Right whale.  He longs for the whale’s presence, but it is nowhere in sight so he ventures to Mr. Yodd to express his pain.  He confesses his love for Sharisha and adds in that he bought a tuxedo for the sole purpose of welcoming her back.  After leaving Mr. Yodd’s grotto, the Whale Caller trips and injures his left knee.  He explains that he sacrificed his knees in order to protect the special horn he was holding.

Next, he opens up to his past by describing the origin of his ways beginning forty years earlier.  His fascination with the kelp horn blown in church inspired him to learn to play it and eventually become the official horn player.  Afterward, he becomes Chief Horn Player in a new church created that put heavy emphasis on using the kelp horn in service.  During a baptism conducted near the ocean, the Whale Caller learns that the kelp horn affects the behavior of a whale.  This urges the Whale Caller to believe he is communicating with the whale through his horn and becomes his obsession.

He describes where he lived after leaving the church in his home village in South Africa, and how things there have changed over the years.  Population growth in addition to the vast increase in tourism turn the Whale Caller into an outcast.  He despises the mobs of tourists who have no comparable knowledge to his about whales he wades through on a daily basis but notices one particular woman who seems to be everywhere he goes, and who always seems to be watching him.

It takes a while for the Whale Caller to speak to this woman but eventually he approaches Saluni, known as the village drunk, and has an uneventful conversation ending with her walking away.  They meet a couple weeks later and pick up where the previous conversation leaves off by discussing whales and learning of their opposing views.  The Whale Caller puts fourth his knowledge of whales for Saluni to interpret, but the outcome is the same as Saluni simply walks away.  Saluni realizes her attraction to the Whale Caller and ventures to his Wendy House in response to his offer to cure her lice problem.  She stays with the intention of never leaving and quits drinking in attempt to show her affection.  Above her affection is her disapproval of the Whale Caller’s obsession with Sarisha.  When she vocally bashes Sarisha to the Whale Caller, the Whale Caller leaves to be with Sarisha though this trek to be with Sarisha was different.  The Whale Caller displayed his affection for Sarisha by getting sexually aroused with an audience and ending with Saluni showing up.
	
The Whale Caller’s relationship with Saluni continues to grow as she attempts to initiate him into a more civilized living style.  The whales migrated over a month ago and Saluni feels like her life is fulfilled as she has the Whale Caller and the Bored Twins.  She even tries to initiate sex with him but his mind becomes filled with images of whales, including Sharisha and he is unable to follow through.

The Whale Caller brings Saluni to Mr. Yodd and one day Saluni even goes there by herself in order to better understand the Whale Caller.  One day they meet Lunga Tubu who has the voice of the Earth.  One day, during a thunderstorm, Saluni and the Whale Caller finally consummate their relationship.  Afterwards Saluni jokes that he could not have done that with Sharisha to which he replies 'You do not know that…'(97).  As time goes on, Saluni and the Whale Caller continue to live together and Saluni rarely visits the Bored Twins anymore.  But one day she goes to visit them and cures one of them of the flu.  The Whale Caller finds that he does not know what to do on his own anymore and so the next day he goes to the Bored Twins home and finds Saluni to bring home.

One day they attempt to go eat at a restaurant but end up getting in a fight.  For the next couple of days, the Whale Caller pampers her constantly.  Saluni goes to visit Mr. Yodd and is told that Sharisha will be returning soon.  A couple of days Saluni spots the first whale and rushes home to realize that the Whale Caller already knows that the whales are returning.  She proceeds to follow him for three days to make sure he doesn’t go to the whales but then goes to visit the Twins.  After a while she returns home to the house to find it locked and then rushes to the beach where she finds the Whale Caller in his tuxedo and with his horn.  While there, the Whale Caller notices that Sharisha has been wounded by a boat.

A new season begins and the whales return. The Whale Caller still spends his time watching Sharisha and her calf while Saluni attempts to catch his attention. Later Saluni comes up with a plan to have the Bored Twins use their beautiful singing voices for a radio station. The twins are excited but their parents are not and quickly shut the idea down again saying the machines will steal the children’s voices. During the night a blue moon occurs. The Whale Caller compares himself to it saying he misses Saluni. As he watches Sarisha and her calf Saluni arrives and approaches him. They talk again and the Whale Caller tells her the story of the origins of the whale’s blow holes. The next day Saluni is again determined to record the twins voices. She sneaks the Bored Twins to town. In the town they begin to sing and as they sing people begin to surround them and follow them. As they reach the studio the radioman is very impressed and sets an appointment for next week. She then returns to the Wendy house where the relationship she had with the Whale Caller is back. Some days not the Whale Caller forgoes watching the whales and instead fishes with Saluni. During one of these fishing days the Whale Caller lands a monstrous “kabeljou”. Saluni uses it to make money charging people to take a picture with it. Soon they make a business of it, catching fish and charging tourists or others to take a  picture with it.

It is the day of an eclipse and Saluni and the Whale Caller fight because he wants to visit the whales. During the eclipse Saluni, upset at the Whale Caller’s obsession, looks directly at the eclipse and goes blind. Now that Saluni is blind the Whale Caller feels guilty and tells her that he will follow her and guide her. Saluni decides to leave town and they travel along the coastline. They meet up with a tiny poacher and continue on their way. After walking for many days they reach the Breede River and after that Swellendam.

The book skips and a  freak wave hits Hermanus causing massive damage. After it is safe the Whale Caller returns to his house and begins to clean up the damage that has been done. Saluni also soon arrives. The two still have not talked and it is revealed that the Whale Caller called her ugly. The book then tells how Saluni got her sight back. She gets mad because the Whale Caller has lied to her about keeping the candle. She then accuses him of lying about other things and they walk the road silently. Saluni then accuses him of not caring and that is when he calls her ugly. After cleaning the house the Whale Caller goes and plays his horn out on the beach and plays it. He notices that Sharisha has been stranded on the beach. An emergency team comes and attempts to push Sharisha back into the water as the Whale Caller helplessly watches. As the Whale Caller watches Sharisha, Saluni watches him. As she watches the attempts to push her back in the water are in vain. Finally the scientists decide to kill the whale. After the whale is killed Saluni is filled with remorse. She feels guilty for Sharisha’s death and the Whale Callers pain and sorrow. She drowns her sorrows in alcohol and goes to visit the Bored Twins. One of the twins hurls a rock at her to keep her from running. It strikes the back of her head killing her. Later the Whale Caller returns to the place of the beaching. He visits Mr. Yod to discover he can no longer hear its voice. The book ends as he names himself the Hermanus Penitent.

==Character Analysis==

'''Whale Caller and Sharisha:''' As the protagonists of the novel, the Whale Caller is characterized as somewhat of a loner who awaits the return of the whale, Sharisha. For a few years now, the Whale Caller has developed an unexpected relationship with Sharisha, as he is in love with a whale. The Whale Caller is able to express his love for Sharisha by playing his kelp horn, which causes Sharisha to swim around the shoreline, making the Whale Caller content. The Whale Caller is aroused by Sharisha’s reaction to the kelp horn, and considers Sharisha to be an intimate partner. This strains his relationship with Saluni who struggles to create intimacy with the Whale Caller since he is preoccupied with Sharisha. Ultimately though, the Whale Caller remains faithful to Sharisha and appeasing Saluni, until their deaths at the end of the novel.
 
'''Saluni:''' Classified as the ‘village drunk,’ Saluni always seems to lurk around town seeking the Whale Caller’s attention. She constantly references the fact that she is a ‘love child’ and therefore deserves the affection and admiration she was denied of as a child. Saluni however is forced to compete for the Whale Caller’s love with the whale, Sharisha.  Saluni is able to create intimate moments with the Whale Caller, and in an attempt to fully capture the Whale Caller’s heart, she constantly confronts Sharisha, asking the whale to die or leave the Whale Caller. While never successful, she seeks affection from the Bored Twins on her semi-regular visits to their home. At the end of the novel though, Saluni is tragically murdered by the Bored Twins, whom she had tended to throughout the novel.
 
'''Bored Twins:''' Feral twins who are the daughters of two farm laborers’. Given their mental state, Saluni visits them during the day while their parents are in the fields. The Bored Twins have beautiful singing voices, which comfort Saluni during her times of depression. Saluni tries to record the twins’ voices for a recording company, but their mother is afraid that their voices will be stolen, forcing the twins to distance themselves from Saluni. At the end of the novel, as Saluni is leaving the twins’ house, they try to stop her by throwing rocks at her head, but they take it too far and accidentally kill her. Mda foreshadows Saluni’s death earlier in the novel when the twins would torture frogs and snakes, preparing the reader for the psychopathology of the murder.
 
'''Mr. Yodd:''' Dwells in a grotto with rock rabbits. Throughout the novel, the Whale Caller and Saluni turn to Mr. Yodd for confession. The Whale Caller confesses his love for Sharisha, and his concern that she might not return from her migration, while Saluni expresses her want to dispose of Sharisha in order to capture the Whale Caller’s love. During confessions, Mr. Yodd taunts the Whale Caller and Saluni by occasionally laughing, causing discomfort and self-mortification for both the Whale Caller and Saluni.

==Themes==

'''Complexities of Love for Nature''' – Throughout the novel, The Whale Caller is infatuated with a southern right whale that he has named Sharisha.  This is a complicated relationship because when one loves nature (something such a forest) one does not think that it can love us back, but in this case, Sharisha seems to respond to the Whale Caller’s affection.  Mda makes the reader think about how the relationship with nature changes as we think of nature as being able to love us back; this complication affects the Whale Caller’s relationship with Saluni. For example, when the Whale Caller and Saluni are about to consummate their relationship, “…images of whales interfere at that moment of excitement and he goes limp” (74). This means that the Whale Caller is constantly thinking of Sharisha, even during his most intimate moments with Saluni. The Whale Caller also longs for Sharisha when she is away on migration. This love for Sharisha symbolizes the love normally only shared between two people.

'''Jealousy''' – The theme of jealousy is a prominent one in throughout the novel. The jealousy is mainly coming from Saluni and she is showing that jealousy towards Sharisha because Sharisha seems to get most of The Whale Caller’s attention. Saluni mentions the love triangle between The Whale Caller, Saluni, and Sharisha; Saluni does not want this triangle to exist. Saluni says “I can tell you I am not going to be part of any triangle. The fish must go!” (81). Saluni constantly tries to get the Whale Caller farther and farther away from Sharisha. For example, when they start their journey, Saluni wants them to take the side roads, that are away from the ocean, so that The Whale Caller does not think about Sharisha.

'''Betrayal'''- Throughout the novel, there are references to betrayal among the major characters in the novel. Saluni always shows affection towards the Bored Twins and they do likewise, but there are times when they don’t. Ultimately, the Bored Twins betray her, which leads to her tragic death. Saluni starts running to go back to The Whale Caller and the twins try to slow her down by throwing rocks at her. When they see that this works, they make a game out of it and they continue throwing stones at her until they realize that she is no longer moving nor breathing.

'''Blind Following''' – Throughout the novel, there are times in which people blindly follow others, without knowing the final destination and without knowledge of the purpose of the journey. After being blinded by the sun, Saluni goes on an adventure with The Whale Caller, and she literally blindly follows him wherever he leads her. This blind following represents Saluni’s thinking that her life is now pointless. She has lost her chance to be a Hollywood star and she believes that she has also lost The Whale Caller to Sharisha. During her journey, she made no progression and in the end, she returns the same person as she left.

==Hermanus==

[[Hermanus]] is the town where most of the story ''The Whale Caller'' takes place. It lies along the [[Walker Bay]] off the south coast of the [[Western Cape]]. Its fame comes from its great vantage points to watch [[Southern Right Whales]] during the spring and winter. Hermanus holds an annual Whale Festival at the end of September. Hermanus has what is believed to be the world's only Whale Crier. His job is to blow his kelp horn to announce where whales have been spotted.

'''The Women's Building''' is a women-led [[non-profit]] arts and education [[community center]] located in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, which advocates self-determination, [[gender equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="Women's Building"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women's Building Homepage|url=http://www.womensbuilding.org/|publisher=San Francisco Women's Centers, Inc.|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has served as an event and meeting space since 1979, when it was purchased by the San Francisco Women's Center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The building is shielded from rising real estate costs in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission district]] because that group has owned the building since 1995.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/More-than-a-Building-Women-s-Building-director-2634783.php|title = More than a Building / Women's Building director Teresa Mejia on what shelter really means|last = Whiting|first = Sam|date = May 15, 2005|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-story building rents to multiple [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] and serves over 20,000 women a year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://missionlocal.org/2014/05/womens-building-turns-35/|title = Women’s Building Turns 35|last = Huber|first = Bridget|date = May 30, 2014|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was built in 1910 and was originally known as '''Turn Hall''' because it was part of the [[Turners|Turnverein]] exercise movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = San Francisco Landmarks|last = Accardi|first = Catherine|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 9780738595801|location = |page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2018.

== Building history ==
[[File:San Francisco Womens Building.jpg|left|thumb|The Women's Building in 1998/1999.]]

The San Francisco Women's Center began in 1973. By 1974, it hired its first full-time employee and had moved into a small storefront office. In 1976, its difficulty in locating a venue for the national conference on Violence Against Women it was organizing with other women's groups led it to search for a permanent space. Through 1978 and 1979, it raised funds to put down an initial $10,000 deposit, and then a $115,000 first payment towards the $535,000 purchase price of the building at 3543 18th Street.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt696nb1jq/entire_text/|title = Guide to the San Francisco Women's Building/Women's Centers Records, 1966, 1972-2001|date = 2002|accessdate = March 7, 2015|website = |publisher = Online Archive of California|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tracy Gary, one of the organizers of the Violence Against Women conference, and co-founder of the Women's Building, along with co-founder Marya Grambs and Women's Building staff member Carmen Vázquez, were interviewed in 1982 by Julia Randall for KPFA for the building's 3rd birthday. The women discuss the difficulties of the early years and how the building was being used in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Julia Randall|first=Host; Ginny Z.

In the first year of operation, the Women's Building was targeted by two attacks: an arson fire that caused $50,000 worth of damage,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and a pipe bomb set off on the front steps of the building.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1997, the Women's Building underwent a major renovation prompted by mandatory seismic retrofitting. In the course of that effort, it evicted the Dovre Club, a bar that had been in the corner of the building on 18th and Lapidge Streets since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-tale-of-two-bars/Content?oid=2133807&amp;showFullText=true|title = A Tale of Two Bars|last = Davis|first = Lisa|date = January 8, 1997|work = SF Weekly|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original owner of that bar had an oral agreement with the Women's Center that the bar could stay in place during his lifetime; after his death in 1997, the bar made an effort to stay in place but ultimately relocated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Mural ==
[[File:Women's Building - mural on side 2.JPG|thumb|Part of the mural on the side of the building, in 2015]]

Painted by seven [[women artists]] including, [[Juana Alicia]], [[Miranda Bergman]], [[Edythe Boone]], [[Susan Cervantes|Susan Kelk Cervantes]] (cofounder of [[Precita Eyes|Precita Eyes Muralists Association]]), Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez along with their helpers and volunteers in 1994, the mural titled ''MaestraPeace'' covers both the outside of The Women's Building as well as the interior entrance hall and stairway.&lt;ref name="Historical Sites"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Sites and Points of Interest in San Francisco|url=http://www.noehill.com/sf/landmarks/sf178.asp|publisher=NoeHill in San Francisco|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It features images of feminine icons from history and fiction, and the names of more than 600 women written in calligraphy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://missionlocal.org/2012/09/painters-scale-womens-building-to-restore-the-maestrapeace-mural/|title = Painters Scale Women’s Building to Restore the “MaestraPeace” Mural|last = Hoke|first = Mateo|date = September 13, 2012|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the San Francisco Women's Center, "This spectacular mural is a culmination of a multi-cultural, multi-generation collaboration of seven women artists, and a colorful work of art that sings to our community." &lt;ref name="Women's Building"/&gt;

[[File:The Women's Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Women's Building]]

Many of the original artists returned to the building for an update in 2000, an expansion to the inside of the building in 2010, and a major $130,000 restoration in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.fogcityjournal.com/wordpress/4914/womens-strife-upheld-in-mural-restoration/|title = Women’s Strife Upheld in Mural Restoration|last = Hernandez|first = Peter|date = August 1, 2012|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That last restoration included a treatment process designed to preserve the colors of the mural for another 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition''''' debuted in 2017 as a part of the [[Waywords and Meansigns]] project setting [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' to music. The Opendoor Edition features over 100 artists and musicians performing unabridged passages of ''Finnegans Wake.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Allison Meier |url=https://hyperallergic.com/369778/setting-the-puzzling-language-of-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-to-music/ |title=Setting the Puzzling Language of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to Music |website=Hyperallergic |date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open edition, participants are invited to contribute to the Opendoor Edition on an ongoing basis.

The genres represented in the Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition are quite diverse, ranging from metal and industrial to folk and jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maria Schurr |url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/waywords-and-meansigns-recreating-finnegans-wake-premiere/ |title=Waywords and Meansigns - Recreating Finnegans Wake (premiere) |website=PopMatters|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the tracks are [[experimental music|experimental]]; some recordings adhere to fairly traditional song formats while others offer audiobook-like readings with [[ambient music|ambient]] accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Gallagher |url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2017/04/waywords-meansigns-finnegans-wake/ |title=Preview &amp; Interview: Waywords and Meansigns – Finnegans Wake to Music |website=Folk Radio UK |date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[Waywords and Meansigns]] project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged. They released two unabridged editions of the text, in [[Waywords and Meansigns#First edition|2015]] and [[Waywords and Meansigns#Second edition|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Allison Meier |url=https://hyperallergic.com/369778/setting-the-puzzling-language-of-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-to-music/ |title=Setting the Puzzling Language of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to Music |website=Hyperallergic |date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300 people have been involved in Wayords and Meansigns since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/listen/opendoor-edition |title=Opendoor Edition |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition features contributors from 15 different countries in what was called "an all-star cast of weirdos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=It's Psychedelic Baby|url=http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/04/all-star-cast-of-weirdos-record-james.html|title=All star cast of weirdos record James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake” |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music is often experimental; the musicians' only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audio from the project is distributed freely online under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]].

Contributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of "musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake-heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/contact/get-involved/ |title=Get Involved |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists participating in the Opendoor Edition include: [[Krzysztof Bartnicki]]; [[Martyn Bates]]; [[John Wolf Brennan]]; [[Neil Campbell (musician)|Neil Campbell]]; Tim Carbone of [[Railroad Earth]] and Lou Rogai of [[Lewis &amp; Clarke]]; Joe Cassidy of [[Butterfly Child]]; [[Hayden Chisholm]]; [[S.A.

''[[The Guardian]]'' has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations |title=Finnegans Wake - the book the web was invented for |website=The Guardian |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] has called the project "wonderfully innovative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |website=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
