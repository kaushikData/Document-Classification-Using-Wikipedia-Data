'''Adarsana''' refers to the real non-seeing of objects which already exist; it refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things. This term figures prominently in the [[Yoga]] school of thought, and in [[Jain philosophy]].

==Meaning==
'''Adarsana''' or ''adarshan'' in [[Sanskrit]] as an adjective means latent or invisible, and as a noun it means non-vision, disregard, non-appearance, neglect, latent condition disappearance, not-seeing. It also means ''agyan'' and ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. Vaidyanath Shastri citing Sl. 2.25 and Sl. 3.55 of Vyasa Bhashya writes that by understanding the non-seeing of objects that exist one understands the seeing of those objects and comes to know about the reality of them. ''Darsana'' means seeing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasana-tattva-viveka|author=Vaidyanath Shastri|publisher=Urmila Devi Shastri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb0MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Pāṇini|Panini]], in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] (Sutra 1.1.60 and 61), has given its meaning as - disappearance, invisibility, elision of an object, which fact is denoted by ''luk'', ''shlu'' and ''lup''; ''lup'' refers to real non-seeing which already exists. In other words, Adarsana refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtadhyayi of Panini|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSDakY97XckC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ayurveda]], the term, ''adarsana'', means visual errors and blindness that results in not seeing the objects that already exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ayurveda Kriya Sarira|author=Yogesh Chandra Mishra|publisher=Chaukhmaba Publications|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WvHFWXI2aEC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Puranas]], ''Adarsana'' is the mind-born mother it is so said because the act of seeing and the act of not seeing or non-seeing is an activity of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bal Ramayan|author=Krishnadutta Bharadwaj|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmqe3AGz5fUC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;lr=&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
The term, ''adarsana'', as a technical term in [[Yoga]] referring to ignorance or absence of knowledge, figures prominently in the discussions pertaining to the ''Sadhanapada'' of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. [[Patanjali]] systemised the [[Yoga]] [[philosophy]] or Yoga- darsana propounded by Acarya [[Hiranyagarbha]] which is the practical application of [[Samkhya]] principles earlier systemised through twenty two sutras by [[Kapila]]. ''Vyasa-bhasya'' which is Vyasa’s commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has been commented upon by [[Vachaspati Misra]] and Vigyanabhikshu. Vyasa states that liberation consists precisely in the cessation of the mind which cessation occurs by the disappearance of the cause of misconception or ''adarsana'' while adding that correct vision of reality ([[darsana]]) stops or sublates misconception which is the cause of bondage. Vyasa explains that ''adarsana'' is the particular conjunction of ''avidya'' in relation to the inward individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Silence Unheard|author=Yohanan Grinspon|publisher=SUNY Press|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1EQrFx0zCIC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on Sadhanapada of Yoga Sutras elaborately discusses and explains the concept of adarsana. Therefore, ''Adarsana'' or wrong conception or contrary knowledge is that contact of the [[Purusa]] with the [[Guna]]s in which the ''Gunas'' serve as objects of ''Purusa''. The modification of the mind in the shape of experience of pleasure and pain is ''adarsana''. ''Adarsana'' ceases on attainment of discriminative knowledge that gradually leads to ''[[Kaivalya]]'' or liberation. It is also known as the power which manifests as knowing (''darsana''), or as the characteristic of both the knower (''Purusa'') and the knowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Darsana of Patanjali|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyB4NbDYQ18C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application as per Yoga School of thought==
The Yoga School of [[Hindu]] Philosophy considers ''Adarsana'' as the sway i.e. proneness to ''Gunas'', which sway lasts till the ''Gunas'' are activeand that it is non-production of the primary mind. The primary mind is that which ceases to function after presenting the objects of experience and discernment to the owner, the Seer. The mind that ceases to function when right knowledge and aversion to objects of enjoyment through renunciation takes place is the primary mind. This school of thought also views ''Adarsana'' as the existence of experience and liberation in a latent state as the latency of ''Avidya'' or wrong knowledge or want of discrimination which is the cause of alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' and its co-existing ''adarsana''.  ''Adarsana'' is ''[[Pradhana]]'' which has a dual nature i.e. it is static and also fluctuating and it is the cognitive faculty because ''Pradhana'' has the tendency to fluctuate and which tendency is stored as potential energy, ''adarsana''. Thus, this school considers ''Adarsana'' to be the characteristic of both ''Pradhana'' and ''Purusa'' as a particular form of cognition, as all knowledge except discriminatory knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on [[Yoga Sutra]] II.23 tells us that ''adarsana'' is the failure to see or ignorance (''avidya''). Patanjali in his ''Yoga Sutra'' II.24 does explain that the cause of identification (''samyoga'') of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the experiencer, with ''[[Prakrti]]'', the object of experience, i.e. bondage, is ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Wicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''adarsana'' ceases, the alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' that causes misery ceases and there is complete cessation of bondage for all time, the state of aloofness of ''Purusa'' and non-occurrence of future contact with the ''Gunas'' ensues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, [[Dharmakirti]], the [[Buddhist]] philosopher, states that pervasion cannot be founded on the observation of ''[[darsana]]'' (co-presence) or the observation of ''adarsana'' (co-absence) which is the view held also by the [[Caravaka]]s and the [[Jain]]s, because identity and causation are the only acceptable grounds of pervasion, unless two things are related in one of these ways, there can be no necessity and no pervasion, and non-difference implies essential identity in spite of the difference in cognitive contents of the two expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Definition and Induction|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0reCO392BAC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxtJUYPUB8rhrAeD5YC4DQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain belief==

In [[Jainism]], the term, ''adarsana'', indicates the condition of mental unease and the suffering of loss of faith resulting from the failure in achieving the desired highest goal after long ''[[sadhana]]'', ''[[tapas]]'' etc., which negative feeling does not affect one who has transcended anger, violence, jealousy, waywardness, bad or evil intentions, untruth, and who is disciplined and adopting the ''Brahmacharya Dharma'' has forsaken his household or family-life, all desires for possession of things and readily donates whatever is possessed by him. The overcoming of this negative feeling is called ''Adarsana-vijay''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pracheen Bharatiya Dharm Evam Darshan|author=Shivswaroop Sahay|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQXqEUyr6t4C&amp;pg=PT199&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other application==
According to [[Baudhayana]], [[Aryavarta]] lies west of Kalakavana, east of Adarsana, south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the [[Vindhyas]]. Dharamsutra II.2.16 speaks of ''Vinasana'' as Adarsana, the western boundary of Aryavarta &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Ancient Geography Vol. 1|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43Fzt-G_-XYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhlJUcahDcWPrgebuIGgCA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''Albert Borgmann''' (born 1937) is a [[Germany|German]]-born [[American philosopher]], specializing in the [[philosophy of technology]]. He was born in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]], and is a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Montana]]. In 2013 Borgmann received the [[Golden Eurydice Award]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thepowerofinformation.eu/programme&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
''[[Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life]]'' (1984) contributed to the emerging philosophical discussions of issues surrounding modern technology. Following a [[Heidegger]]ian viewpoint, Borgmann introduced the notion of the [[device paradigm]] to explain what constitutes technology's essence loosely based on Heidegger's notion of [[Gestell]] (enframing). The book explores the limitations of conventional ways of thinking about technology and its social context, both liberal democratic ideals and Marxist lines of thought.

''Crossing the Postmodern Divide'' (1992) is a techno-religious book characterized in terms of [[hyperreality]] and [[hyperactivity]]. Hyperactivity is usually described as a pathological syndrome of the child and [[workaholic]], and associated with the familiar symptoms of stress and overwork. Borgmann extends the concept of hyperactivity to society as a whole, and defines it as "a state of mobilization where the richness and variety of social and cultural pursuits, and the natural pace of daily life, have been suspended to serve a higher, urgent cause" (p.&amp;nbsp;14). [[Christopher Lasch]] sees this as a kind of militarization of society – "the suspension of civility, the rule of the vanguard, and the subordination of civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, critics such as [[Douglas Kellner]] have challenged Borgmann's distinction between the real and hyperreal and his denigration of hyperreality as problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kellner |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Kellner |title=Crossing the Postmodern Divide with Borgmann or Adventures in Cyberspace |date=14 Dec 1997 |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/ed253a/newDK/borg.htm |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118063127/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/ed253a/newDK/borg.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2010 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Real American Ethics'' (2006), distancing himself from both conservative and liberal ideology, Borgmann explores the role of Americans in the making of American values, and proposes new ways for ordinary citizens to improve the country, through individual and social choices and actions.&lt;ref name="Country"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=203877

|title=Borgmann, Albert Real American Ethics: Taking Responsibility for Our Country. 232 p. 6 x 9 2006|date=2006-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Borgmann's work has also influenced Catholic theologians, who typically interpret Borgmann's work in support of the position that technology is something to be overcome and that religion (i.e. Roman Catholicism) is to be humanity's saving grace.&lt;ref name="Taming"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Wood  | first = David  | title = Albert Borgmann on Taming Technology: An Interview  | journal = The Christian Century   | pages = 22–25  | date = August 23, 2003  | url = http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2901  | accessdate = 2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other Christian writers such as [[Marva Dawn]] have drawn on Borgmann's notion of the device paradigm to develop a critique of the church in its capitulation to commodification where worship, for example, becomes a device to attract and please.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]
'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral courage|moral practice]] of concern for [[happiness]] of other [[human kind|human beings]] and/or animals, resulting in a [[quality of life]] both [[material]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]]. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In Hindu / Sanathana Dharma (whose philosophy is "inclusive", i.e includes, and welcomes everybody), where the dictum "Vasudaiva Kutumbakam" (the world is ONE FAMILY) is in force, always, "others" means "EVERYONE", unconditionally.

In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

In a common way of living, it doesn't deny the singular nature of the subject, but realizes the traits of the individual [[personality]] in relation to the others, with a true, direct and personal [[interaction]] with each of them. It is focusing both on a single person and the whole [[community]]. In a (not only) Christian practice, it is the law of love direct to the ego and his neighbour.

The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "[[alterity|other people]]" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''"true"'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as "benefits".

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

==Scientific viewpoints&lt;!--linked from 'Evolution of morality'--&gt;==
===Anthropology===
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage called "Note on alms". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Compare [[altruism (ethics)|Altruism (ethics) – perception of altruism as self-sacrifice]].
* Compare [[alms|explanation of alms in various scriptures]].

===Evolutionary explanations===
{{Main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}
[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|upright|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name="AEP1"&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness.

The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead of a "Wall Street Game."&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N |url=https://www.academia.edu/17949833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important.

* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245271476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name="AEP2"&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt.

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Helping the [[Homelessness|homeless]] in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01 |last1=Brown |first1=S.L. |last2=Brown |first2=R.M. |year=2006 |title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships |url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230521/http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-14 |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |pages=1–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/Talk/Document/StLouis2011TelmoFIN.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]].''

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/[[septal region]]. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite news

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the [[University of Southern California]] neuroscientist [[Antonio R. Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that When confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with "end-justifies-the-means" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: "Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?"&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;

In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a [[University of Oregon]] economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: "egoists" and "altruists". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered "egoists" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.&lt;ref name="neurons"/&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism,'' which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;["Altruism." International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. 87-88. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 April 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name="batson3"&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name="prosocial"&gt;[Batson, C.

New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.&lt;ref name="noaltruism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maner | first1 = J.

He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=" baston2"&gt;[Batson, C., Ahmad, N., &amp; Stocks, E.

New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis'' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svetlova|first1=M.|last2=Nichols|first2=S.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name="prosocial"/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Bruckman | first2 = Amy S. | year = 2004 | title = The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation | url = | journal = Journal of the Learning Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi = 10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.4881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.&lt;ref name="moodandgenerosity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Underwood|first1=B.|last2=Froming|first2=W.

Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.&lt;ref name="volunteer5"/&gt; For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).&lt;ref name="overwhelmed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=C.|last2=Meisenhelder|first2=J.|last3=Ma|first3=Y.|last4=Reed|first4=G.|year=2003|title=Altruistic Social Interest Behaviors Are Associated With Better Mental Health|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=65|issue=5|pages=778–785|doi=10.1097/01.PSY.0000079378.39062.D4|pmid=14508020|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.7780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.".&lt;ref name="gratitude"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimai|first1=S.|last2=Otake|first2=K.|last3=Park|first3=N.|last4=Peterson|first4=C.|last5=Seligman|first5=M.

===Sociology===
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503051933/http://asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm |date=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Thulin EW, Bicchieri C. I’m so angry I could help you: Moral outrage as a driver of victim compensation. Social Philosophy &amp; Policy, 2016, 32: 146-160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathological altruism===
[[Pathology|Pathological]] altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book ''[[Pathological Altruism]]''.

Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199738571.do&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" ([[Dalai Lama]]).&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003223717/http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;br&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.

===Jainism===
{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]]
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of ''[[Ahimsa]]'' – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy ([[Brahmacharya]]);
# [[Non-possession]] or non-materialism (Aparigraha);
The "great vows" ([[Mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" ([[Anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''Siddha'' ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.

===Christianity===
[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name="Neusner2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or ''We love the creature, because of The Creator.'' For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of [[selfless service|"seva]]," or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in Sihkism. &lt;ref name=DictofSikhism&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism/page/n38 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism |publisher=''Curzon Press''|author=Cole, W. Owen and Sambhi, Piara Singh |pages=38-39, 84 |date=1990|accessdate=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy.&lt;ref name=GobindSingh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthesikh025030mbp/page/n7 |title=A History Of The Sikhs |publisher=''Oxford University Press''|author= Joseph Davey Cunningham |date=1918 |page=ix |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or "Manushyattva". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or "Punya" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or "Paapa" and will led them to heaven or "Swarga" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.

[[Swami Vivekananda]], the legendary Hindu monk, has said -"Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

However the very well known and popular text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; "nishkaama karma" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

==Genetics==
The genes [[OXTR]], [[CD38]], [[COMT]], [[DRD4]], [[DRD5]], [[IGF2]], [[GABRB2]] have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3871336 | pmid=24132092 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2013.0395 | volume=9 | title=Genes underlying altruism | year=2013 | journal=Biol Lett | page=20130395 | last1 = Thompson | first1 = GJ | last2 = Hurd | first2 = PL | last3 = Crespi | first3 = BJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollard case==
He has publicly objected to the sentence of spy [[Jonathan Pollard]] on procedural and substantive grounds while acknowledging his guilt of espionage.

On November 5, 2013, he personally wrote a letter about Pollard to President Obama. He stated, "Others have pointed out that Pollard is the only person ever 
sentenced to life imprisonment for passing information to an ally, without intent to harm America, a crime which normally carries a sentence of 2-4 years; and that this disproportionate sentence in violation of a plea agreement was based ''not on the indictment'' but on a memorandum that was never shared with the defense.  This is not how American Justice is supposed to work." He continues to state that his plea like DCI James Woolsey, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, and former Senator Dennis DeConcini are based on his thorough knowledge of the case. Codevilla concludes that "having been intimately acquainted with the materials that Pollard passed and with the "sources and methods" by which they were gathered, I would be willing to give expert testimony that Pollard is guilty of neither more nor less than what the indictment alleges."

In an interview to the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', Codevilla stated, "The story of the Pollard case is a blot on American justice," The life sentence "makes you ashamed to be an American."&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.jonathanpollard.org/2013/110513.jpg,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/pollard-defenders-vindicated/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/119711/pollard-defenders-vindicated&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Diodorus of Aspendus]] was one of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zhmud | first =Leonid | translator-first1=Kevin| translator-last1=Windle | translator-first2=Rosh | translator-last2=Ireland | title =Pythagoras and the Early Pythagoreans| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | date =2012 | pages =132 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=of-ghBD9q1QC | isbn = 9780199289318 | accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived around the 4th or 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="poaw"&gt;{{cite book | last =Curnow | first =Trevor| title =The Philosophers of the Ancient World: An A-Z Guide | publisher =A&amp;C Black | date =2006 | pages =38 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=E82oRzHYLhMC | isbn = 9781849667715 | accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point Aresas had to flee Crotone, from people hostile to Pythagoreanism. He may have been the last head of the school in an unbroken line from Pythagoras; on the other hand Neoplatonist philosopher [[Iamblichus]] mentions Aresas as having "re-established" the school, implying a direct lineage might have been broken.&lt;ref name="poaw"/&gt;

Some attribute to Aresas a work "about Human Nature," of which a fragment is preserved by [[Stobaeus]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Stobaeus]], ''Eclogues'' i. p. 847, ed. Heeren&lt;/ref&gt; but others suppose it to have been written by the Pythagorean philosopher [[Aesara]].

Some sources conflate Aresas with an "Aresandrus of Lucania", though this "Aresandrus" is otherwise unknown, and modern scholars consider this an error.&lt;ref name="poaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Horky | first =Philip Sidney | title =Plato and Pythagoreanism | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | date =2016 | pages =128 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=EXkRDAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9780190465704| accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Creme''' (5 December 1922 − 24 October 2016) was a Scottish artist, author, [[esotericist]], and editor of ''[[Share International]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://share-international.org/background/bcreme/bc_main.htm|title=Benjamin Creme: A Messenger of Hope|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He asserted that the [[second coming]] prophesied by many religions would come in the form of Maitreya the World Teacher. ''[[Maitreya]]'' is the name [[Buddhists]] use for the future [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], but Creme claimed that Maitreya is the teacher that all religions point towards and hope for. Other names for him, according to Creme, are the [[Christ]], the [[Imam Mahdi]], [[Krishna]], and the [[Messiah]].  Creme claimed Maitreya is the "[[Avatar]] for the [[Age of Aquarius|Aquarian Age]]", is omniscient and omnipresent, and has lived in London since 19 July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://share-international.org/index.htm|title=Share International Index|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102002835/http://www.share-international.org/index.htm|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Niebuhr, Gustav|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D71F39F933A15754C0A960958260|title= New Millennium, Great Expectations|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 July 1996|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
At the age of thirteen Creme began painting, inspired by the work of Rembrandt. In order to become a painter he left school at sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandgallery.com/artist_bio.php?mainId=65|title=Benjamin Creme, b. 1922, A Selected Chronology|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen, Creme said, he became interested in the [[occult]], when he read ''With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet'' by [[Alexandra David-Neel]]. From 1957 to 1959 Creme was the Vice-President of the [[Aetherius Society]], a [[UFO religion]] based largely on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)| Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980 , p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David V. Barrett|Barrett, David V.]] ''[[The New Believers]]'' 2001 {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}, page 347-349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stelling.nl/simpos/aetherius.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Esoteric Groups — Aetherius Society:|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511022617/http://www.stelling.nl/simpos/aetherius.htm|archivedate=11 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he met [[George Adamski]] and Creme said he could personally vouch for the authenticity of Adamski's [[UFO]] contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Creme became a follower of the Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]] and her teachings on [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Assigned mission by his Master==
Creme said that he was first contacted [[telepathy|telepathically]] by his [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] in January 1959, when Creme was asked to make tape recordings of his messages.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Creme first began to speak publicly of his mission on 30 May 1975, at the [[Friends Meeting House]] on [[Euston Road]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin (ed.). ''Messages from Maitreya the Christ''. Amsterdam: Share International Foundation 1981&lt;/ref&gt; His central message announced the emergence of a group of enlightened spiritual teachers who could guide humanity forward into the new [[Aquarian Age]] of peace and brotherhood based on the principles of love and sharing. At the head of this group would be a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One":  the Christ to the Christians, the [[Imam Mahdi]] to the [[Muslims]], the [[Messiah]] for [[Jews]] and the [[5th Buddha]] ([[Maitreya]]) for [[Buddhists]].

== Predictions 1982 &amp; later ==
[[Image:Si cover 2008small.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Creme's magazine ''[[Share International]]'', featuring one of his artworks]]

In the spring of 1982 Creme placed advertisements in newspapers around the world saying, "The Christ is now here." According to Creme, the Christ, whom he also called Maitreya, would announce his existence on worldwide television broadcasts.  Creme stated in these newspaper advertisements that the [[Second Coming of Christ]] would occur on Monday 21 June 1982 (the [[summer solstice]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} On 14 May 1982 Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles. More than 90 reporters attended and heard Creme announce that Maitreya was living within the Asian community in the [[Brick Lane]] area of London. Creme presented the reporters with a challenge: if the media made a serious attempt to seek Maitreya in London, he would reveal himself to them. Afterwards, Creme wrote, "It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya."&lt;ref&gt;[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1982, Creme made a number of additional predictions and announcements about the imminent appearance of Maitreya, based on his claims of receiving telepathic messages from a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master of Wisdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Creme said that in January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, this statement was withheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alcuinbramerton.blogspot.com/2016/04/christ-and-jesus-at-bbc-london-1986.html] Alcuin Bramerton: '''Christ and Jesus at the BBC''' - London 1986 BBC misses biggest story in English history. UK church establishment rejects Second Coming of Christ. Why did the BBC, the Queen and the Church of England bishops choose to ignore the Second Coming of Christ in 1986?&lt;/ref&gt; 

Creme wrote, "On 26 February 1987 Maitreya gave an interview to the major American television company, Cable News Network (CNN). He was interviewed under His ordinary, everyday name, and did not call Himself the Christ. He did say, however, that, among other names, He was known as Maitreya. A group of His closest associates journeyed to the United States to arrange further interviews[...]" The CNN interview was made available for possible showing in 26 of a promised 29 countries in Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa and the Middle East, but was not broadcast in the United States. The CNN office in Atlanta explained that they could not see a framework in which to present the interview.&lt;ref&gt;Maitreya's Mission Vol. II (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Creme made similar announcements that there would be imminent global TV broadcasts from Christ/Maitreya, though with far less media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Canada NewsWire|date=December 2, 1997|title=British Futurist Says 'World Teacher'... will be interviewed on a major American network before the end of the year. This will be followed by appearances on other networks around the world and...will lead to a global satellite hook-up where Maitreya can speak to all people simultaneously -- in their own language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creme stated that when the "Day of Declaration" occurred "The [[Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)|Christ]] will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite. All those with access to television will see ... [his face]. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously. While the Christ is speaking... [everyone will feel far more love than they've ever felt before, that massive outpouring of love will cause] hundreds of thousands of 'miracle' cures [to] take place simultaneously."&lt;ref&gt;''Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission I'' 1986 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2010 Creme announced that Maitreya had given his first interview on American television. Soon afterwards several people in the [[United States]], working from Creme's predictions, concluded that the British-American economist and author [[Raj Patel]] was Maitreya. After newspaper articles spread this story around the world Creme responded that Raj Patel was not the coming World Teacher in an article in ''The Guardian'' under the headline "Raj Patel is Not Maitreya, But the World Teacher is Here — and Needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Raj Patel is Not Maitreya, But the World Teacher is Here – and Needed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/20/raj-patel-maitreya-world-teacher|author=Benjamin Creme|date=30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme, who claimed that the time was now very near for Maitreya's emergence, apparently did not receive any money for his work or royalties from his 14 books, and for more than 30 years he gave lectures around the world by invitation only. A worldwide network of volunteers worked with Creme to give his views to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Times |date=3 June 1982 |page=6 |author=The Tara Press |title=Advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme died in October 2016 at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;http://omtimes.com/2016/10/benjamin-creme-passed-away/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crop circles and UFOs==
During an interview in 2006 Creme confirmed his views on the importance of [[crop circles]]: "The [[UFO]]s have an enormous part to play in the security of this planet at the ecological level. [The crop circles are part of] a new science that will give us energy directly from the sun. Oil will become a thing of the past. No one will be able to sell energy in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sacramento News &amp; Review|title=Signs of the Times: Crop Circles, Weeping Madonnas and the Strange Esoteric World of Benjamin Creme|author=R.V. Scheide|date=30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme gave his explanation as to how crop circles are made by UFOs in his magazine: "The crop circles are there to draw attention to the fact that the [[Nordic aliens|Space Brothers]] are there. They are amazing constructions. They are made in seconds by the 'ships' of the Space Brothers. They are complex and beautiful constructions which cannot be made in any other way. They appear all over the world, but the majority are in the South of England. Why? Because Maitreya is in London."&lt;ref name=SI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2009/2009-07.htm|title=Share International July / August 2009|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409071736/http://share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2009/2009-07.htm|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions and Responses==
Sceptics ridiculed the story presented by Benjamin Creme and took issue with the possibility that his predictions might have come true.&lt;ref&gt;"Francis Wheen's Diary". ''The Independent'' 27 January 1991: "Alas and alack, on the great issue of the day poor Mr Maitreya seems to have stubbed his toe rather badly. After Saddam sent his tanks across the border last August Maitreya suggested that a mystical power and force in nature will make Iraq withdraw totally and unconditionally from Kuwait. In November his message was unequivocal: The Gulf Crisis: Maitreya has made it clear from the beginning that there will be no war."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kiwis Prove to Aussies They're Not That Gullible". ''The Evening Post'' 4 December 1995. "But it's not just the eruptions at issue. Benjamin Creme, based in London and a five-time visitor to New Zealand as ambassador for Maitreya, the saviour he claims is awaited by all religions, has extended the connection. John O'Donnell of the New Zealand Transmission Meditation Network said Mr Creme had told him the 5.9 South Island quake on Friday, November 24 had been caused by the fourth French atomic test two days before. Nobody has yet predicted plagues of locusts, frogs, flies, rivers of blood or other disasters for the fifth and subsequent tests."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rosenbaum (15 August 2005). [http://www.bookrags.com/news/voices-in-our-head-where-is-good-old-20050814-moc/ "Voices in Our Head: Where is Good Old American Weirdness?"], New York Observer&lt;/ref&gt; Some others have treated Creme's story with interest and are waiting to see what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.share-international.org/av/v_tv_interviews.htm|title=TV interviews with Benjamin Creme|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989 and 1991 Creme's magazine ''Share International'' published a series of forecasts given to two journalists{{who|date=March 2012}} by an associate of Maitreya, which the magazine claimed had come about with uncanny accuracy. These forecasts were purported to have included the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], the [[fall of the Soviet Union|ending of Communist rule in the Soviet Union]], the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|ending of Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], the release of [[Terry Waite]], the premature resignation of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2007/s2606_30%20years_small.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Coming of Maitreya, the World Teacher |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/background/miracles/mi_main.htm |title=Signs and Miracles |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2005/bc_2005.pdf |format=PDF |title=Compilation of Comments on World Events by Benjamin Creme in the Year 2005 as Published in Share International Magazine |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] sources and other detractors accused Creme of being part of a satanic conspiracy and placed him among a number of “[[antichrist]] potentials".&lt;ref&gt;[[David V. Barrett]], ''[[The New Believers]]'', 2001 {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}, page 349&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4712">'''Cecil Alec Mace''' (22 July 1894 &amp;ndash; 7 June 1971) usually cited as '''C.A. Mace''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] and industrial [[psychologist]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news
| author       =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| title        = Professor Alec Mace| newspaper    = The Times| location     = London, England| date         = 9 June 1971| page         = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his work on monetary incentives and goal setting theory.

==Life==
Mace was born on 22 July 1894 to Mary and Walter Mace in Norwich, England.&lt;ref&gt;MACE, Cecil Alec’, ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U156976, accessed 23 Dec 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; He left home at 18 for [[Cambridge University]], intending to study for holy orders. However, instead he chose to read Moral Sciences at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]]. He studied under the philosopher [[G.E. Moore]]. The British psychologist [[Charles Samuel Myers]], who started the first experimental psychology laboratory in Cambridge, was another mentor.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Mace who shared Moore's pacifism, refused to fight. Instead he was sent to Dartmoor prison where he studied the psychological effects of imprisonment. Following the war, he was appointed Lecturer in Philosophy and Psychology at the [[University of Nottingham]]. He married Marjorie Lebus in 1922 and they had two sons.

In 1925, he joined [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews University]] to start an experimental psychology laboratory. He introduced the first courses in experimental psychology and set up a laboratory in 1927.

In 1932, he became a Reader a [[Bedford College, London]]. He worked under the direction of Professor [[Beatrice Edgell]], the first woman President of the [[British Psychological Society]].

During World War II, Mace was appointed a Head of Psychology at [[King's College, London]]. The department was transferred to Birkbeck in 1944 and Mace became the first Birkbeck Chair of Psychology, a position he retired from in 1961. Mace died on 9 June 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimemin|first1=Sylvia|title=C.A. Mace 1894-1971|journal=Occupational Psychology|date=1971|volume=45|issue=3/4|pages=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Mace's work on ''Incentives: Some Experimental Studies'' (1935) discredited the notion that workers are primarily incentivized by money. He also stated that people have a "will to work." In 1935, he conducted the first empirical studies of [[goal setting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a779939894 Cecil alec mace: The man who discovered goal-setting], by Paula Phillips Carsona; Kerry D.

His most influential books were Sibylla; or the Revival of Prophecy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mace|first1=C.A.|title=Sibylla; or the Revival of Prophecy|date=1927|publisher=Kegen Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Psychology of Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mace|first1=C.A.|title=The Psychology of Study|date=1969|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre de Recherche en Épistémologie Appliquée''' (CRÉA, Paris) — the Center for Research in Applied [[Epistemology]] — conducts research in humanities and the social sciences.  It was founded in 1982 as a center for [[cognitive science]] and epistemology as part of the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris.

From the beginning it focused on two areas:
# modeling the self-organization of [[complex system]]s related to cognition, economics and social phenomena, and
# the [[philosophy of science]], in particular the epistemology of cognitive science.

Over 20 researchers, as well as post-doctoral fellows, Ph.D. students, and visiting scholars work on interdisciplinary topics related to cognitive science, including [[cognitive neuroscience]] and cognitive economics, [[cognitive linguistics]], epistemology, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and on [[mathematical model]]s related to [[dynamic systems theory]], [[control theory]], and [[logic]].  They explore both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

The CREA lab was shut in December 2011.

The '''conflict model''' of [[criminal justice]], sometimes called the '''non-system perspective''' or '''system conflict theory''', argues that the organizations of a criminal justice system either do, or should, work competitively to produce [[justice]], as opposed to cooperatively.

==History==
System conflict theory argues that worries over fame, promotions, [[Wiktionary:wage|wage]]s, and success cause the criminal justice system to conflict with itself. This perspective argues that there is no true system and points to the role of [[adversarial process]]es, in particular, which are seen to be basic to the "system", and the fact that many criminal justice organizations habitually share as little information as possible.

This school of thought is followed both by groups which argue that the conflict model is the reality of criminal justice, but the consensus model is the ideal; and groups which argue that the conflict model is both the reality and the ideal.

[[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]] has argued that [[clearance rate]]s demonstrate the reality of the Conflict Model by encouraging [[police]] to focus on appearing to do their job, rather than on actually doing their job. This is a comparable argument to that regarding [[standardized test]]ing, and "[[teaching to the test]]". Skolnick noted one incident where police coerced a man to confess to over 400 [[burglary|burglaries]] so that they could have a high rate of crime solving (clearance).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

[[File:CILII697.JPG|thumb|200px|Inscription II 697 in the CIL: in the wall of a building in [[Cáceres, Spain]].]]
The '''''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum''''' ('''''CIL''''') is a comprehensive collection of ancient [[Latin]] [[inscription]]s. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving [[epigraphy]] of [[classical antiquity]]. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The ''Corpus'' continues to be updated in new editions and supplements.

CIL also refers to the organization within the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey.

==Aim==
The ''CIL'' collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the [[Roman Empire]], ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time—most of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the ''CIL'' is Latin.

==Beginnings==
In 1847 a committee was created in [[Berlin]] with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was [[Theodor Mommsen]]&lt;ref name="CILhistory"&gt;See the CIL site under External links below.&lt;/ref&gt; (who wrote several of the volumes covering [[Italy]]). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1853.

==Current status==
The ''CIL'' presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices.&lt;ref name="CILhistory"/&gt; The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the [[Roman Republic]]; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to [[milestone]]s. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the ''Carmina Latina Epigraphica'' (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume "Index of Numbers", correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Andreas|editor-last=Fassbender|year=2003|series=CIL Auctarium Series Nova|title=Index Numerorum|volume=Erster Band, Zweiter Band|isbn=3-11-017936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] continues to update and reprint the ''CIL.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''David Patterson Ellerman''' (born March 14, 1943) is a philosopher and author who works in the fields of economics and political economy, social theory and philosophy, and in mathematics.  He has written extensively on [[workplace democracy]] based on a modern treatment of the labor theory of property and the theory of [[inalienable rights]] as rights based on de facto inalienable capacities.

== Education ==
His undergraduate degree is in philosophy from  [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1965), and he has master's degrees in Philosophy of Science (1967) and in Economics (1968), and a doctorate in Mathematics (1971) all from [[Boston University]].

== Career ==
He has been in and out of teaching in economics, mathematics, accounting, computer science, and operations research departments in various universities (1970–90), co-founded the Industrial Co-operative Association in Massachusetts in the 1980s, founded and managed a consulting firm in East Europe (1990-2), and worked in the [[World Bank]] from 1992 to 2003 where he was an economic advisor to the Chief Economist ([[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Nicholas Stern]]).  Now he is a visiting scholar at the [[University of California]] in Riverside.

== Current research ==
In his 2007 article on "The Role of Capital in Capitalist Firms," Ellerman achieved a significant breakthrough in analyzing the basic production function of economics in terms of the logic of his labor theory of property.  The latter approach has been extensively developed by Ellerman as an explanation and justification for worker-owned firms in co-operative business models and co-operative economics.  In addition to his older work in political economy, property theory, and theory of inalienable rights, he has returned to work in the mathematical sciences by developing partition logic (the dual to ordinary Boolean subset logic) and a related approach to information theory. Currently he is developing these ideas to provide an interpretation of quantum mechanics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2492">'''Earl Dorchester Hanson''' was born in Northern [[India]] to Methodist Missionaries.  He attended an American-run [[missionary]] school, Woodstock School, in [[Mussoorie]] in the Western Indian [[Himalaya]]s, along with his siblings.  He is the older Brother of [[Edith Hanson]] and younger brother of [[Robert M. Hanson]] After serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]] in [[World War II]], he graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] and earned a Ph.D. in [[biology]] in 1954 from [[Indiana University]].

In an academic career that spanned nearly 40 years, Professor Hanson was one of the first to advocate ethical training of young scientists. He also urged improved development of scientific teaching for nonscientists, with an emphasis on how [[genetic engineering]] could affect society. Toward that end, he founded and was the chairman of the Science in Society program at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1967, he was chairman of the national [[Commission on Undergraduate Education in the Biological Sciences]].

Mr. Hanson, a professor of biology, concentrated on [[intracellular genetics]]. He was the author in 1981 of the widely used textbook, "Understanding Evolution." He also was the author of "The Origin and Early Evolution of Animals" (1977) and of more than 50 research articles.

==Honored for Teaching==

He was regarded as a popular and first-rate teacher, winning the [[Harbison Award for Distinguished Teaching]] in 1970.

Much of his activity in recent years involved educating nonscientists about contemporary problems and possibilities in biology and other fields.

He was on the [[Yale University]] faculty from 1954 to 1960, when he joined the Wesleyan faculty. He was elected a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/obituaries/earl-d-hanson-66-wesleyan-professor-and-science-leader.html New York Times], obit.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Essence-Function''' (體用, Chinese pinyin: ''tǐ yòng'', Korean: ''che-yong''), also called '''Substance and Function''', is a key concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] and other Far-Eastern philosophies. ''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is relative or concrete reality, the concrete manifestation of ''Essence''. Ti and yong do not represent two separate things, such as Absolute Reality and Concrete Reality. They are always two, flexibly-viewed aspects of a single thing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acmuller.net/articles/2016-06-tiyong-critical-review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=July 2017}}

==Etymology==
* ''Essence'', [[:wikt:體|體]] (ti), Korean pronunciation 체, or ''CHE'': body; shape, form; entity, unit; style, fashion, system; substance, essence; theory (as opposed to practice).{{r|group=web|Sheik}} 
* ''Function'', [[:wikt:用|用]] (yong), Korean pronunciation 용, or ''YONG'':use, employ, apply, operate; exert; use; effect; finance; need; eat, drink.{{r|group=web|Sheik2}}

Together they form the phrase 體用 ti-yong, 체용 che-yong, ''Essence-Function''.

''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is manifest or relative reality, the discernible effects or manifestations of ''Essence''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} ''Essence-Function'' describes the interplay between the two: although Absolute Reality is the ultimate reality, the relative reality nevertheless also exists, as is evident from concrete reality. The relationship between these two realms is espressed in such schemata as the [[Five Ranks]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]]. Various terms are used for "absolute" and "relative".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}

The tree forms a metaphor for ''Essence-Function'', with the roots being ''Essence'' and the branches being ''Function''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} According to Muller "the most important application of t'i-yung thought [...] is to the human being, where the human mind is seen as "essence," and one's words, thoughts and actions are seen as "function."{{sfn|Muller|1999|p=4}}

According to Sung-bae Park the concept of ''essence-function'' is used by East Asian Buddhists "to show a non-dualistic and non-discriminate nature in their [[Kensho|enlightenment experience]]," but does not exclude notions of subjectivity and objectivity.{{sfn|Park|1983|p=147}} According to Sung-bae Park, the terms "essence" and "function" can also be rendered as "body" and "the body's functions," which is a more personal and less abstract expression of nonduality.{{sfn|Park|2009|p=11}}

==Origins and application of the concept==

===China===
The t'i-yung developed in the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (220–265) – [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Chin]] (265–420) period of Chinese history, when "Unification of the [[Three teachings|Three Teachings]]" ideology was domimant, striving for a theoretical reconciliation of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The t'i-yung concept was first known as ''pen-mo'' ("primary-last" or "primary-subordinate"), and developed into t'i-yung. In the initial development of the theory, "thinkers considered one of the three philosophies as 'the primary' or 't'i' and the others as 'the last' or 'yung,' insisting that their own philosophy was superior to the others."{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=139}} However, although the theory was used to arrange the three teachings hierarchically, it also confirmed their inner unity.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=139–144}}

The concept developed with [[Chinese Buddhism|the introduction of Buddhism in China]], adapting Buddhist philosophy to a Chinese frame of reference. One of the core [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhist doctrines is the [[Two Truths doctrine]], which says that there is a relative truth and an ultimate truth. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Phenomenal reality is relative real or true: one can make factual statements about concrete or manifest reality, but those statements have a relative trueness, since everything that exists changes, and is bound to dissolve again. Ultimately everything is empty, [[sunyata]], of an underlying unchanging essence.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata itself is also "empty," 'the emptiness of emptiness', which means that ''sunyata'' itself does not constitute a higher or ultimate "essence" or "reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}} The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]]  and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} 

When Buddhism was introduced to China, the two truths doctrine was a point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} The doctrines of [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Sunyata]] were understood as akin to [[Tao|Dao]] and the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}}  It took the Chinese world several centuries to realize that sunyata has another meaning.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

Based on their understanding of the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths. The idea that ultimate reality is present within the daily world of relative reality melded well with Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as [[Nagarjuna]] does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}

The notions appear already in the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|Zhongyong]]'' (''Doctrine of the Mean'') attributed to [[Zi Si]] (481–402 BCE), the grandson of [[Confucius]]. The first philosopher to systematically use the ti-yong schema was [[Wang Bi]] (226–249) in his commentary to [[Daodejing]], chapter 22, when he discussed the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relation between non-being (''wu'') and being (''you''). Subsequently, the notion has been borrowed from the [[Neo-Daoist]] philosophy to other schools of Chinese philosophy, including [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] and other schools of Buddhism, and [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]], and served as a basic tool of interpretation. With these schools it has travelled to Korea, Japan and Vietnam, and has been developed there.

The ''[[Awakening of Mahayana Faith]]'', a key text in Chinese Buddhism, also employs ''Essence-Function''. Although attributed to [[Aśvaghoṣa]] (?80-?150 CE), and traditionally thought to have been translated [[Paramartha]] (499–569),{{sfn|Tarocco|2008}} in 553, many modern scholars now opine that it was actually composed by Paramartha or one of his students.{{sfn|Grosnick|1989}}

The concept was employed by Confucian reformers of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] at the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s (1644 to 1912) rule in China, in the phrase "Chinese learning for essence, Western learning for application".{{refn|group=note|({{zh|t=中學為體，西學為用|s=中学为体，西学为用|p= zhōng xué wéi tǐ, xī xué wéi yòng}}}} The belief was that China should maintain its own Confucian style of learning to keep the "essence" of society, while at the same time using Western learning for "practical application" in developing its infrastructure and economy.{{sfn|Spence|1999|pp=225–226}}

===Korean Buddhism===
''Essence-Function'' is an essential element in the philosophy of [[Wonhyo]] (617–686 CE).{{sfn|Muller|1995|pp=33–48}} Wonhyo developed t'i-yung theory into its most influential form in his commentary on the ''Ta ch'eng ch'i hsin lun'' (''Treatise on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith''). This scripture proclaims the non-duality of the phenomenal or mundane world and the ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''.{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=163}} Wonhyo saw the ''Treatise'''s treatment of ''t'i-yung'' as a way of harmonizing the thought of Madhyamika and Yogacara. For Wonhyo, ''t'i'' corresponds to Madhyamika's ultimate truth and ''yung'' to its conventional truth, and these, in turn, are the two gates of Yogacara's one-mind.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=164–166}}

[[Chinul]] (1158–1210) and [[Kihwa]] (1376–1433) also employ and develop this idea of Essence-Function in their writings in particular ways.{{sfn|Muller|1995}} [[Wonch'uk]] (613–696) employed the conceptual and analytical tool, Essence-Function, as an exegetical, hermeneutical and syncretic device.

'''Franz von Baader''' (27 March 1765&amp;nbsp;– 23 May 1841), born '''Benedikt Franz Xaver Baader''', was a [[German people|German]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[philosopher]], [[theology|theologian]], [[physician]] and [[mining engineering|mining engineer]]. Resisting the [[empiricism]] of his day, he denounced most [[Western philosophy]] since [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] as trending into [[atheism]] and has been considered a revival of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] school. He was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked. Today he is thought to have re-introduced theological engagement with [[Meister Eckhart]] into academia and even [[Christianity]] and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 189 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Benedikt Franz Xaver Baader{{sfn|Abashnik|2010}} was born in [[Munich]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], on 27 March 1765.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} He was the third son of Joseph Franz von Paula Baader{{refn|group=lower-alph|His first name is spelled "Josef" in some records.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}}} (15 September 1733&amp;nbsp;- 16 February 1794) and Maria Dorothea Rosalia von Schöpf (25 October 1742&amp;nbsp;- 5 February 1829),{{sfn|Hoffman|1857|pp=1–3}}{{sfn|Grassl|1953|pp=474}}{{refn|group=lower-alph|In some records her middle name is spelled "Rosalie."

She was a daughter of Johann Adam von Schöpf (1702 - 10 January 1772).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}}} who were married on 23 May 1761. In 1775, Franz's father Joseph became the court physician of [[Maximilian III Joseph]],{{sfn|Hoffman|1857|p=3}} the [[elector of Bavaria|elector]] of [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. (The elector died two years later.) Franz' two older brothers were both distinguished men. His brother Clemens Alois Andreas Baader{{refn|group=lower-alph|In some records, Clemens's middle name is spelled "Aloys" or "Aloysius".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}}} (8 April 1762&amp;nbsp;- 23 March 1838) was an author, and his brother Joseph Anton Ignaz Baader (30 September 1763&amp;nbsp;- 20 November 1835) was an [[engineer]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1857|pp=4–5}} Franz studied [[medicine]] at [[Ingolstadt]] and [[Vienna]], and for a short time assisted his father in his medical practice.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} However, Franz soon discovered that life as a physician did not suit him, and he decided to become a mining engineer instead.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} He studied under [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], travelled through several of the mining districts in north Germany, and resided in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|England]] from 1792 to 1796.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}}

In England, Franz von Baader became acquainted with the [[empiricism]] of [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and [[William Godwin]], which was extremely distasteful to him.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} But he also came into contact with the mystical speculations of [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]], and above all those of [[Jakob Böhme]], which were more to his liking.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} In 1796, he returned to Germany and, in [[Hamburg]], became acquainted with [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|F. H. Jacobi]], with whom he became close friends.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}} He also came into contact with [[Friedrich Schelling]], and the works he published during this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher. Yet Baader is no disciple of Schelling, and he probably gave more than he received.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=173}}{{refn|group=lower-alph|On Baader's influence on and friendship with Schelling and the reasons for their eventual break with one another, see [[Marie-Élise Zovko|Zovko]].{{sfn|Zovko|1996|pp=86-139, 191-269, 270-312}}}} Their friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader's denunciation of modern philosophy in his letter to the [[Russian Empire|tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] entirely alienated Schelling.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|pp=173–174}}

All this time, Baader continued to apply himself to his profession.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} He gained a prize of 12,000 [[Bavarian gulden|gulden]] (≈117&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] [[silver]]) for his new method of employing [[sodium sulfate]] instead of [[potash]] in the making of [[glass]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} From 1817 to 1820, he held the post of superintendent of mines and was raised to the rank of nobility for his services.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} He retired in 1820, and thereafter published one of the best of his works, ''Fermenta Cognitionis'' in 6 parts from 1822 to 1825.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} In it, he combats modern philosophy and recommends the study of Böhme.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} In 1826, when the new university was opened in Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy and speculative theology.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} He published some of his lectures there in 4 parts from 1827 to 1836 under the title ''{{lang|de|Spekulative Dogmatik}}''.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} In 1838, he publicly opposed the interference of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in civil matters and, in consequence, was interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of religion during the last three years of his life.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}}  He died on 23 May 1841.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} He is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]] in Munich.

==Philosophy==
It is difficult to summarize Baader's philosophy, for he expressed his deepest thoughts in obscure [[aphorism]]s or mystical symbols and analogies.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zeller |first=Eduard |author-link=Eduard Zeller |title=Ges. d. deut. Phil. |pp=732, 736 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctrines are mostly expounded in short detached essays, in comments on the writings of Böhme and St-Martin, or in his extensive correspondence and journals.{{sfn|Giles |1911|p=88}} However, there are salient points which mark the outline of his thought. Baader starts from the position that human reason by itself can never reach the end it aims at and maintains that we cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church, and tradition. His point of view may be described as [[Scholasticism]], since like the Scholastics he believed that theology and philosophy are not opposed but that reason has to make clear the truths given by authority and revelation.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} In his attempts to draw the realms of faith and knowledge still closer, however, he approaches the mysticism of [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Paracelsus]], and Böhme.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Our existence depends upon God's cognition of us.{{sfn|Giles |1911|p=88}}{{refn|group=lower-alph|In [[Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|cogitor ergo cogito et sum}}''. ("I am thought of, therefore I think and am."){{sfn|Giles |1911|p=88}} See also [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s ''[[cogito ergo sum]]''.}} All self-consciousness is at the same time God-consciousness, and all knowledge is knowing with, consciousness of, or participation in God.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}}

==Theology==
Baader's philosophy is thus essentially a form of [[theosophy (history of philosophy)|theosophy]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} God is not to be conceived as mere abstract Being ({{lang-la|substantia}}) but as the primary [[will (philosophy)|Will]] at the basis of all things and an everlasting process or activity (''{{lang|la|actus}}'').{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} This process functions as a self-generation of God, in which we may distinguish two aspects—the immanent or esoteric and the eminent or exoteric.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Only insofar as the "primitive will" thinks or is conscious of itself can it distinguish knower and known, producer and produced, from which proceeds the power to become spirit.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} God has His reality only insofar as He is absolute spirit.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} The [[Trinity (Christianity)|Trinity]] (called ''{{lang|la|Ternar}}'' in Baader) is not a given but is rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place through the eternal and impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists beside through not distinct from the "primitive will".{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Personality and concrete reality is given to separate aspects of this Trinity through nature, which is eternally and necessarily produced by God.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} These aspects of existence do not occur successively within time but occur ''{{lang|la|[[sub specie aeternitatis]]}}'' as necessary elements of the self-evolution of divine Being.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Its "nature" is not to be confused with the [[nature]] of [[Creation (mythology)|Creation]], which is an unnecessary, free, and non-temporal act of God's love and will which cannot be speculatively deduced but must be accepted as a historic fact.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}}

Created beings were originally of three orders: the intelligent or [[angel]]s; the non-intelligent material world; and [[humans|man]], who mediated between them.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Angels and man were endowed with [[free will (theology)|freedom]]. The [[Fall of Man|Fall of Adam]] and [[Fallen angel|Lucifer]] were historic facts which were possible, though not necessary.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Baader considered the angels to have fallen through a desire to ascend to equality with God (i.e., [[pride]]) and man through permitting himself to sink to the level of nature (via the [[seven deadly sins|various bodily sins]]).{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Baader considered that the world as we know it—with [[time]], [[space]], and [[matter]]—only began after the fall of mankind and was created as a gift from God permitting humanity the opportunity for [[redemption (theology)|redemption]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Baader developed theories of [[physiology]] and [[anthropology]] over a number of works based upon this understanding of the universe, but in the main coincides with the ideas of Böhme.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} Principally, he traces the adverse effects of various [[sin]]s and advocates the restoration of natural harmonies by its removal.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}}

His system of [[ethics]] rejects the idea that obedience to moral laws alone (as in [[Kantianism]]) is enough. Instead, though humanity has lost the ability to accomplish this on its own, it is necessary to realize and participate in our place in the divine order.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} As [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] is required for such a realization, no ethical theory neglecting sin and [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] is satisfactory or even possible.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=174}} [[Good works|Mere works]] are never sufficient, but [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s healing virtue must be received, chiefly through [[prayer]] and the [[Catholic Sacraments|sacraments of the church]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|pp=174–175}}

Baader was regarded as among the greatest speculative theologians of 19th-century [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and influenced, among others, [[Richard Rothe]], [[Julius Müller (theologian)|Julius Müller]], and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}}

==Politics==
Baader argued that two things were requisite in the [[state (polity)|state]]: common submission to the ruler (without which there would be [[civil war]] or [[invasion]]) and inequality of rank (without which there would be no [[government|organization]]).{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}} As Baader considered God alone to be the true ruler of mankind, he argued that loyalty to a government can only be secured or given when it was truly Christian;{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}} he opposed [[despotism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]] equally.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}} His [[utopia|idea state]] was a civil community ruled by the [[Catholic Church]], whose principles opposed both passive and irrational [[pietism]] and the excessively rational doctrines of [[Protestantism]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}}

==Gender issues==
One of Baader’s central ideas is his concept of [[androgyny]]:
{{quote|The Androgyne is the harmonious fusion of the sexes, resulting in a certain [[asexuality]], a synthesis which creates an entirely new being, and which does not merely juxtapose the two sexes 'in an enflamed opposition' as the [[hermaphrodite]] does. }}
Following the literal wording of the first of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'s [[Creation of Man|two accounts of the creation of man]], Baader says that Man was originally an androgynous being. Neither man nor woman is the "image and likeness of God" but only the androgyne. Both sexes are equally fallen from the original divinity of the androgyne. Androgynism is man's likeness to God, his supernatural upsurge. Hence it follows that sexes must cease and vanish. From these positions Baader interpreted the sacrament of marriage as a symbolic restitution of angelic bisexuality: 
{{quote|The secret and the sacrament of true love in the indissoluble bond of the two lovers, consists in each helping the other, each in himself, towards the restoration of the androgyne, the pure and whole humanity. }}
Ultimately Christ's sacrifice will make possible a restoration of the primal androgyny. Baader believed that primordial androgyny would return as the world neared its end.{{sfn|Dynes|1990|p=57}}

==Works==
Several years after his death, Baader's works were collected and edited by a number of his disciples. This was published in 16 volumes at [[Leipzig]] between 1851 and 1860, organized by topic.{{sfn|Hoffman|1851–1860}} Vol.&amp;nbsp;I dealt with [[epistemology]], Vol.&amp;nbsp;II with [[metaphysics]], Vol.&amp;nbsp;III with [[natural philosophy]], Vol.&amp;nbsp;IV with [[anthropology]], Vols.&amp;nbsp;V &amp; VI with [[sociology|social philosophy]], Vols.&amp;nbsp;VII through X with [[philosophy of religion]], Vol.&amp;nbsp;XI with Baader's [[diary|diaries]], Vol.&amp;nbsp;XII with his commentaries on St-Martin, Vol.&amp;nbsp;XIII with his commentaries on Böhme, Vol.&amp;nbsp;XIV with [[time]], and Vol.&amp;nbsp;XV with his biography and correspondence.{{sfn|Hoffman|1851–1860}} Vol.&amp;nbsp;XVI contained an index to the others, as well as an able sketch of his system by [[Johann Anton Bernhard Lutterbeck|Lutterbeck]].{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}} Valuable introductions by the editors are prefixed to the several volumes.{{sfn|Adamson|1878|p=175}}

[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman2.jpeg|thumb|[[Richard Stallman]] circa 2002, founder of the [[GNU Project]] and the free software movement.]]
The '''free software movement''' ('''FSM''') or '''free/open-source software movement''' ('''FOSSM''') or '''free/libre open-source software''' ('''FLOSS''') is a [[social movement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-03/msg00635.html Richard Stallman on the nature of the Free software movement] in 2008 on emacs-devel mailing list.&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for [[software users]], namely the freedom to run the software, to study and change the software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. Although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] and academia, [[Richard Stallman]] formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the [[GNU Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Announcement of the GNU project
|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman later established the [[Free Software Foundation]] in 1985 to support the movement.

== Philosophy ==
The philosophy of the movement is that the use of computers should not lead to people being prevented from cooperating with each other.  In practice, this means rejecting "[[List of proprietary software for Linux|proprietary software]]", which imposes such restrictions, and promoting [[free software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Use Free Software
|publisher=gnu.org
|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/use-free-software.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ultimate goal of liberating everyone in cyberspace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Stallman interviewed by Sean Daly
|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060625001523547
|publisher=Groklaw
|date=2006-06-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, every computer user. Stallman notes that this action will promote rather than hinder the progression of technology, since "it means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will be avoided. This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the art".&lt;ref name="The GNU Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web
|title=The GNU Manifesto
|publisher=gnu.org
|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the free software movement believe that all users of software should have the freedoms listed in [[The Free Software Definition]]. Many of them hold that it is immoral to prohibit or prevent people from exercising these freedoms and that these freedoms are required to create a decent society where software users can help each other, and to have control over their computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Why free software?
|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html
|publisher=gnu.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some free software users and programmers do not believe that [[proprietary software]] is strictly immoral, citing an increased profitability in the business models available for proprietary software or technical features and convenience as their reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism
|publisher=gnu.org
|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/pragmatic.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While social change may occur as an unintended by-product of technological change, advocates of new technologies often have promoted them as instruments of positive social change." This quote by San Jose State professor Joel West explains much of the philosophy, or the reason that the free source movement is alive. If it is assumed that social change is not only affected, but in some points of view, directed by the advancement of technology, is it ethical to hold these technologies from certain people? If not to make a direct change, this movement is in place to raise awareness about the effects that take place because of the physical things around us. A computer, for instance, allows us so many more freedoms than we have without a computer, but should these technological mediums be implied freedoms, or selective privileges? The debate over the morality of both sides to the free software movement is a difficult topic to compromise respective opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Software Foundation also believes all software needs [[GNU Free Documentation License|free documentation]], in particular because conscientious programmers should be able to update manuals to reflect modification that they made to the software, but deems the freedom to modify less important for other types of written works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Free Software and Free Manuals
|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html
|publisher=gnu.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the free software movement, the [[FLOSS Manuals]] foundation specialises on the goal of providing such documentation. Members of the free software movement advocate that works which serve a practical purpose should also be free.&lt;ref name="OSS misses the point"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stallman|first=Richard|title=Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html|work=GNU Operating System|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and spreading free software ===
The core work of the free software movement focused on software development. The free software movement also rejects proprietary software, refusing to install software that does not give them the freedoms of free software. According to Stallman, "The only thing in the software field that is worse than an unauthorised copy of a proprietary program, is an authorised copy of the proprietary program because this does the same harm to its whole community of users, and in addition, usually the developer, the perpetrator of this evil, profits from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=FSFE
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building awareness ===
Some supporters of the free software movement take up [[public speaking]], or host a stall at software-related conferences to raise awareness of software freedom. This is seen as important since people who receive free software, but who are not aware that it is free software, will later accept a non-free replacement or will add software that is not free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[Ciarán O'Riordan]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical equality ===
Margaret S. Elliot, a researcher in the Institute for Software at the University of California Irvine, not only outlines many benefits that could come from a free software movement, she claims that it is inherently necessary to give every person equal opportunity to utilize the Internet, assuming that the computer is globally accessible. Since the world has become more based in the framework of technology and its advancement, creating a selective internet that allows only some to surf the web freely is nonsensical according to Elliot. If there is a desire to live in a more coexistent world that is benefited by communication and global assistance, then globally free software should be a position to strive for, according to many scholars who promote awareness about the free software movement. The ideas sparked by the GNU associates are an attempt to promote a "cooperative environment" that understands the benefits of having a local community and a global community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=Mobilization of software developers|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wscacchi/Papers/New/Elliott-Scacchi-Free-Software-Movement.pdf|publisher=Institute for Software Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
A lot of lobbying work has been done against [[software patent]]s and expansions of copyright law.  Other lobbying focusses directly on use of free software by government agencies and government-funded projects.

The [[Venezuela]]n government implemented a free software law in January 2006. Decree No. 3,390 mandated all government agencies to migrate to free software over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/professional_services_venezuela/
|title=Free software liberates Venezuela
|publisher=[[Free Software Magazine]] n°10
|date=2006-02-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressmen [[Edgar David Villanueva]] and Jacques Rodrich Ackerman have been instrumental in introducing free software in [[Peru]], with bill 1609 on "Free Software in Public Administration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Free_Software_in_Public_Agencies |title=An English translation of the Free Software bill proposed in Peru }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident invited the attention of Microsoft Inc, Peru, whose general manager wrote a letter to Villanueva. His response received worldwide attention and is seen as a classic piece of argumentation favouring use of free software in governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org.pe/resmseng.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829215908/http://www.gnu.org.pe/resmseng.html|archivedate=2007-08-29|title=Peruvian Congressman Edgar Villanueva writing to Microsoft about free software.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there have been efforts to pass legislation at the state level encouraging use of free software by state government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Open source's new weapon: The law?
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The free software movement has been extensively analyzed using economic methodologies, including perspectives from [[heterodox economics]]. Of particular interest to economists is the willingness of programmers in the free software movement to work, often producing higher-quality  than commercial programmers, without financial compensation. In his 1998 article "The High-Tech Gift Economy," [[Richard Barbrook]] suggested that the then-nascent free software movement represented a return to the [[gift economy]] building on [[hobby|hobbyism]] and the absence of economic [[scarcity]] on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbrook |first1=Richard |date= 1998|title=The High-Tech Gift Economy |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/631/552|journal=First Monday: Peer-Reviewed Journal on the Internet |volume=13 |issue= 12|access-date= July 22, 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; E. Gabriella Coleman has emphasized the importance of accreditation, respect, and [[honour]] within the free software community as a form of compensation for contributions to projects, over and against financial motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (2013), p. 116-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist Johan Söderberg has argued that the free software movement represents a complete alternative to [[Capitalism]] that may be expanded to create a post-work society. He argues that the combination of a manipulation of intellectual property law and [[private property]] to make goods available to the public and a thorough blend between labor and fun make the free software movement a [[communism|communist economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Söderberg (2007), p. 153-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subgroups and schisms ==
Like many social movements, the free software movement has ongoing internal conflict between the many FOSS organizations ([[Free Software Foundation|FSF]], [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]], [[Debian]], [[Mozilla Foundation]], [[Apache Foundation]] etc.) and their personalities.

{{main article|Open-source software movement}}
Although commercial free software was not uncommon at the time (see [[Cygnus Solutions]] for example), in 1998 after an announcement that [[Netscape]] would liberate their popular Web browser, a strategy session was held to develop a stronger business case for free software which would focus on technology rather than politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, [[Eric Raymond]] and [[Bruce Perens]] founded the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) to promote the term "[[Open source software license|open source software]]" as an [[alternative term for free software]]. OSI wanted to address the perceived shortcomings in ambiguous "free software" term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold.

The latter became the view of people like Eric Raymond and Linus Torvalds, while Bruce Perens argues that open source was simply meant to popularize free software under a new brand, and even called for a return to the basic ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some free software advocates use the term [[free and open-source software|free and open-source software]] (FOSS) as an inclusive compromise, drawing on both philosophies to bring both free software advocates and open-source software advocates together to work on projects with more cohesion. Some users believe that a compromise term encompassing both aspects is ideal, to promote both the user's freedom with the software and also to promote the perceived superiority of an open-source-development model. This eclectic view is reinforced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of [[List of OSI approved software licences|OSI-approved licenses]] and self-avowed open-source programs are also compatible with the free software formalisms and vice versa.&lt;ref name="OSS misses the point" /&gt;

While some people prefer to link the two ideas of "open-source software" and "free software" together, they offer two separate ideas and values. This ambiguity began in 1998 when people started to use the term "open-source software" rather than "free software". People in the community of free software used these separate terms as a way to differentiate what they did. Richard Stallman has called open source "''a non-movement''", because it "''does not campaign for anything''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/28/gnu-founder-stallman-open-source-is-not-free-software/|title=GNU founder Stallman: 'Open source is not free software' - SiliconANGLE|last=Gillin|first=Paul|date=2016-04-28|work=SiliconANGLE|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open source addresses software being open as a practical question as opposed to an ethical dilemma. In other words, it focuses more on the development. The open-source movement ultimately determines that non-free software is not the solution of best interest but nonetheless a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/6/28491-why-open-source-misses-the-point-of-free-software|title=Why 'Open Source' Misses the Point of Free Software {{!}} June 2009 {{!}} Communications of the ACM|last=Stallman|first=Richard|website=cacm.acm.org|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSS misses the point" /&gt;

On the other hand, the free software movement views free software as a moral imperative: that proprietary software should be rejected for selfish and social reasons, and that only free software should be developed and taught to cope with the task of making computing technology beneficial to humanity. It is argued that whatever economical or technical merits free software may have, those are byproducts stemming from the rights that free software developers and users must enjoy. An example of this would be the unlikelihood of free software being designed to [[Malware|mistreat or spy on users]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html|title=Free Software Is Even More Important Now|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=www.gnu.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the benefits purveyed by the open-source movement have been challenged both from inside and outside the free software movement. It is unclear whether free and open-source software actually leads to more performant and less vulnerable code, with researchers [[Robert L. Glass|Robert Glass]] and [[Benjamin Mako Hill]] providing statistical insight that this is usually not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Regarding the meaning and misunderstandings of the word ''free'', those who work within the free software camp have searched for less ambiguous terms and analogies like "[[Gratis versus libre|free beer vs free speech]]" in efforts to convey the intended semantics, so that there is no confusion concerning the profitability of free software. The loan adjective [[Gratis vs Libre|''libre'']] has gained some traction in the English-speaking free software movement as unequivocally conveying the state of being in freedom that free software refers to. This is not considered schismatic; ''libre'' is seen as an alternative explanatory device. In fact, free software has always been unambiguously referred to as "''libre software''" (in translation) in languages where the word ''libre'' or a [[cognate]] is native. In India, where free software has gained a lot of ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bohannon|first1=Mark|title=India adopts a comprehensive open source policy|url=https://opensource.com/government/15/8/india-adopts-open-source-policy|website=opensource.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the unambiguous term ''swatantra'' and its variants are widely used instead of "free".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Truscello|first=Michael James Anthony|title=The Technical Effect: Free and Open Source Software and the Programming of Everyday Life|date=2005|publisher=University of Waterloo|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1144881|place=Waterloo, Ont., Canada, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|url=http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol15_1/Truscello-GC.pdf|title=Free as in Swatantra: Free Software and Nationhood in India|last=Truscello|first=Michael|date=2007|work=Wilfrid Laurier University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free software movement rebuts that while "free" may be prone to confuse novices because of the duplicity of meanings, at least one of the meanings is completely accurate, and that it is hard to get it wrong once the difference has been learned. It is also ironically noted that "open source" isn't exempt of poor semantics either, as a misunderstanding arise whereby people think source code disclosure is enough to meet the open-source criteria, when in fact it is not.&lt;ref name="OSS misses the point" /&gt;

The switch from the free software movement to the open-source movement has had negative effects on the progression of community, according to Christopher Kelty who dedicates a scholarly chapter to the free software movements in "Theorizing Media and Practice". The open-source movement denies that selectivity and the privatization of software is unethical. Although the open-source movement is working towards the same social benefits as the free software movement, Kelty claims that by disregarding this fundamental belief of the free software advocates, one is destroying the overall argument. If it can be claimed that it is ethical to limit the internet and other technology to only users who have the means to use this software, then there is no argument against the way things are at the moment; there is no need to complain if all morality is in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Stallman and Torvalds ===
The two most prominent people associated with the movement, [[Richard Stallman]] and [[Linus Torvalds]], may be seen as representatives of the value based versus apolitical philosophies, as well as the GNU versus Linux [[coding style]]s. In the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] the FSF argues for the term GNU/Linux because GNU was a longstanding project to develop a free operating system, of which they assert the kernel was the last missing piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html |title=Linux and GNU - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Should principles be compromised? ===
[[Eric Raymond]] criticises the speed at which the free software movement is progressing, suggesting that temporary compromises should be made for long-term gains. Raymond argues that this could raise awareness of the software and thus increase the free software movement's influence on relevant standards and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html |title=ESR's "World Domination 201", on the need for more compromise by the free software movement |publisher=catb.org|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]] |date=2006-07-01 |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Stallman, on the other hand, sees the current level of compromise as a greater cause for worry.&lt;ref name="pragmatism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/use-free-software.html|title=RMS on the progress of the movement and his worry about compromise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libervis.com/article/richard_stallman_on_world_domination_201 |title=Richard Stallman on "World Domination 201" |quote=I cannot agree to that compromise, and my experience teaches me that it won't be temporary. ... What our community needs most is more spine in rejection of non-free software. It has far too much willingness to compromise. ... To "argue" in favor of adding non-free software in GNU/Linux distros is almost superfluous, since that's what nearly all of them have already done.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How will programmers get paid? ===
{{main article|Business models for open-source software}}
Stallman said that this is where people get the misconception of "free": there is no wrong in programmers' requesting payment for a proposed project.  Restricting and controlling the user's decisions on use is the actual violation of freedom.  Stallman defends that in some cases, monetary incentive is not necessary for motivation since the pleasure in expressing creativity is a reward in itself.&lt;ref name="The GNU Manifesto" /&gt; On the other hand, Stallman admits that is not easy to raise money for FOSS projects.&lt;ref name="LAS300RMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=radmjL5OIaA&amp;t=0h53m46s|work=GNU/LAS s20e10 |title=Interview with Richard Stallman |publisher=[[Linux action show]] |quote=[[Richard Stallman|RMS]]: ''I’m not gone to claim that I got a way to make it easier to raise money to pay people who write free software. We all know, that to some extent there are ways to do that, but we all know that they are limited, they are not as broad as we would like.'' |accessdate=2014-08-22 |date=2012-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Viral" licensing ===
The free software movement champions [[copyleft]] licensing schema (often pejoratively called "[[viral license]]s"). In its strongest form, copyleft mandates that any works ''derived'' from copyleft-licensed software must also carry a copyleft license, so the license spreads from work to work like a computer virus might spread from machine to machine. These licensing terms can only be enforced through asserting copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== License proliferation and compatibility ===
{{main article|Comparison of free and open-source software licenses}}
FOSS [[license proliferation]] is a serious concern in the FOSS domain due to increased complexity of [[license compatibility]] considerations which limits and complicates source code reuse between FOSS projects.&lt;ref name="proliferationimpact"&gt;[https://fossbazaar.org/content/osi-and-license-proliferation/ OSI and License Proliferation] on fossbazar.com by Martin Michlmayr ''"Too many different licenses makes it difficult for licensors to choose: it's difficult to choose a good license for a project because there are so many. Some licenses do not play well together: some open source licenses do not inter-operate well with other open source licenses, making it hard to incorporate code from other projects. Too many licenses makes it difficult to understand what you are agreeing to in a multi-license distribution: since a FOSS application typically contains code with different licenses and people use many applications which each contain one or several licenses, it's difficult to see what your obligations are."'' (on August 21st, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The OSI and the FSF maintain own lists of dozens of existing and acceptable FOSS licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html license-list]&lt;/ref&gt; There is an agreement among most that the creation of new licenses should be minimized at all cost and these created should be made compatible with the major existing FOSS licenses.

'''Gerald Gunther''' (May 26, 1927 - July 30, 2002) was a prominent constitutional law scholar and a Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] from 1962 until his death in 2002.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2002/august7/guntherobit-87.html "Leading constitutional law scholar Gerald Gunther dead at 75"].

==Early life and education==

Gerald Gunther was born on May 26, 1927, in Usingen im Taunus, Germany, where his family had worked as butchers for over three centuries.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt; Gunther entered primary school during the same year in which [[Adolf Hitler]] gained power. In school, Gunther experienced virulent anti-Semitism; a Nazi schoolteacher labeled Gunther "Jew-pig" and segregated him from his classmates.&lt;ref name=GeraldGunther&gt;Casper, Gerhard. [http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/480409.pdf "Gerald Gunther"]. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. Vol. 148, No. 4. December 2004. Retrieved 28 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially hesitant to leave Germany, Gunther's family fled for the United States in 1938, only a few hours after witnessing the destruction of their town synagogue.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Goldman, Ari. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/01/us/gerald-gunther-legal-scholar-dies-at-75.html "Gerald Gunther, Legal Scholar, Dies at 75"]. ''The New York Times''. 1 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in America, Gunther's family settled in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt;

Gunther attended [[Brooklyn College]], where he graduated with an A.B. in 1949.&lt;ref name=StanfordNews&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/95/950328Arc5306.html "Gerald Gunther, law professor, honored by Duquesne University"]. Stanford News Service. 28 March 1995. Retrieved 28 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He then received an M.A. in public law and government from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and an LL.B., ''magna cum laude'', from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1953, where he was an editor of the ''Harvard Law Review''.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=StanfordNews/&gt;

==Career==

From 1953 to 1954, following his graduation from Harvard, Gunther clerked for Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and from 1954 to 1955, for [[Chief Justice Earl Warren]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. As later revealed by Warren, Gunther played a central role in the writing of the Court's landmark ruling in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (II).&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

After a year in private practice at a Wall Street law firm, Gunther joined the faculty of [[Columbia Law School]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; At Columbia, Gunther mentored future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. According to Ginsburg, Gunther helped to secure her clerkship with Judge [[Edmund L. Palmieri]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] "by pressuring every judge in the Southern District" to hire her.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Gunther also advised Ginsburg on how to broaden constitutional protections to women when she was a lawyer with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]],&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; and in July 1993, Gunther testified for Ginsburg at her Senate confirmation hearings.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt;

In 1962, Gunther left Columbia for Stanford Law School, where he became the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law in 1972, taking emeritus status in 1995 (though he continued to teach until his death).&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt; At Stanford, Gunther, who was motivated by his childhood experiences in Nazi Germany, became an outspoken defender of civil liberties, particularly the right to freedom of speech.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Luna, Claire. [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/02/local/me-gunther2 "Gerald Gunther, 75; Stanford Law Lecturer, Scholar"] ''Los Angeles Times''. 2 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Gunther famously defended the freedom of speech rights of American Nazis,&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; and in 1988, Gunther opposed a Stanford University ban on expressions of racial or religious intolerance.&lt;ref name=GeraldGunther/&gt; Recalling his own experiences with anti-Semitism, Gunther spoke of "the need to walk the sometimes difficult path of denouncing the bigot’s hateful ideas with all my power, yet at the same time challenging any community’s attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law."&lt;ref name=GeraldGunther/&gt;

In addition to his prolific scholarship on constitutional law, first amendment law, and the U.S. Supreme Court, Gunther spent 22 years researching and writing his influential 818-page biography of Judge Learned Hand, titled ''Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Gunther's biography earned him numerous awards, including the Triennial Book Award of the Order of the Coif and the Erwin N. Griswold Triennial Prize from the Supreme Court Historical Society.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt;

Gunther was ultimately awarded five honorary degrees, as well as the Learned Hand Medal for Excellence in Federal Jurisprudence from the Federal Bar Council in 1988, the Richard J. Maloney Prize for Distinguished Contributions to Legal Education from the Order of the Coif in 1990, and the Bernard E. Witkin Medal from the State Bar of California in 1995.&lt;ref name=StanfordReport/&gt; In 1987, in a survey of lawyers conducted by the ''[[National Law Journal]]'', Gunther was voted as the most qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

'''Gwenaëlle Aubry''' (born April 2, 1971) is a French [[novelist]] and [[philosopher]].

==Biography ==
She studied at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in the Rue d'Ulm and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].
She graduated with the Doctor of Philosophy.  She lectured in ancient philosophy, at the [[Nancy 2 University]], from 1999 to 2002, a research fellow at [[CNRS]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://upr_76.vjf.cnrs.fr/Membres/Aubry/Aubry.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evene.fr/celebre/biographie/gwenaelle-aubry-26459.php|title=Gwenaëlle Aubry|work=Evene.fr|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She taught philosophy at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://annuaire.univ-paris4.fr/annuaire/web/index.cgi?nom=&amp;prenom=&amp;pole=UFR+Philosophie+et+sociologie&amp;service=none&amp;people=both&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her work ==
She has published several books and articles on ancient philosophy and its contemporary reception, and translated [[Plotinus]].

She is the author of five novels: ''The Devil spotter'' is the story, haunted by the figure of Persephone, of the passion of a teenager for a mature man; ''The Detached'' was the story told by 'a young woman, Margot, distant sister of Florence Rey, from the prison where she is incarcerated. She says her love for Peter, her experience of rebellion and radical rejection. The voice of this prisoner, which still resounds in isolation, is a story about prison, bereavement and deprivation.

Resident of the [[Villa Medici]] in 2005, she wrote a novel on the ugliness in our lives, through the inner monologue of an ugly woman on the aesthetic discourse of indifference of the beautiful and the ugly. Following this, she composed an anthology, ''The (dis) taste of ugliness''.

She adapted for [[France Culture]], a radio play of ''The Death of Virgil'', by [[Hermann Broch]].

In 2009, she won the [[Prix Femina]] for ''Personne'', a story about her father who suffered from [[manic-depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/20091109/15796/femina-2009-lhommage-de-gwenaelle-aubry-a-son-pere| title=Femina 2009: l'hommage de Gwenaëlle Aubry à son père| author=Ludovic de Foucaud| work=La Nouvel Obs| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112012244/http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/20091109/15796/femina-2009-lhommage-de-gwenaelle-aubry-a-son-pere| archivedate=2009-11-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihály András Vajda''' (born 1935) is a Hungarian leftist intellectual who took part in the debates surrounding the development of [[national socialism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], and the state of capitalism in the latter half of the 20th century. Involved in politics in his home country of Hungary, Vajda was expelled along with several other scholars from the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers Party]] in 1973 due to allegedly representing views that were "opposed to Marxism–Leninism and to the policy of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/35-4-246.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Vajda was one of the original members of [[Georg Lukács]]'s "[[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]]",&lt;ref&gt;Fu Qilin, [http://the.sagepub.com/content/94/1/106.extract "On Budapest School Aesthetics: An Interview with Agnes Heller"], ''Thesis Eleven'', Vol. 94, Issue 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian theorists who began as [[neo-Marxist]]s but moved on to what they called [[post-Marxist]] and also [[Postmodern philosophy|post-modern]] perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.praksis.org/13abs7.html&lt;/ref&gt; Writing primarily in Hungarian, but with many works translated into English, Vajda's works treat such themes as the past and future of state socialism in Europe and fascism as a mass phenomenon. Vajda continues to draw, like other members of the original Budapest School, from a Marxist legacy in seeking to examine the state of contemporary liberal society. Recently,{{When|date=July 2011}} he has been involved in a controversy concerning critical remarks made respecting the Hungarian government, and specifically government policies that challenged free media. In a notable show of support for Vajda and his colleague fellow Hungarian theorist [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]] wrote a public appeal in defense of Vajda and Heller, insisting that "We are concerned about the political and professional fate of our Hungarian colleagues... Under the nationalist government, which has used its two-thirds majority to erode the Hungarian constitution, they are again exposed to political persecution."&lt;ref&gt;Aufruf von Habermas and Nida-Rümelin, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/aufruf-von-habermas-und-nida-ruemelin-schuetzt-die-philosophen-1.1050449 "Schützt die Philosophen!"], ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 24 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/01/translation-of-habermas-and-nida-r%C3%BCmelin-on-the-hungarian-situation.html "Translation of Habermas and Nida-Rümelin On the Hungarian situation"], ''New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science'', 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1973, the members of the [[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]] as ideological dissenters lost their jobs and were banned from publication. Some of the members of the group left Hungary whole, Mihály Vajda went as a visiting professor to different universities in different countries: first at the [[University of Bremen]] (Germany), then at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York next to the [[Trent University]] in [[Peterborough]] in Canada and finally (already after his rehabilitation in Hungary) to the [[University of Siegen]] (Germany). Only in 1989 he was officially rehabilitated in Hungary and appointed to the chair of philosophy at [[University of Debrecen|Kossuth Lajos University]] in [[Debrecen]], where he was from 1996 to 2000 Director of the Institute of Philosophy, as well. He was appointed to a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 2002. In 2004 he took the [[Franz Rosenzweig]] visiting professor at the [[University of Kassel]].

{{nihongo|'''Hajime Nakamura'''|中村 元|Nakamura Hajime|extra=November 28, 1912 – October 10, 1999{{sfn|Takasaki|2000}}}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], [[Indologist]], [[philosopher]] and [[academic]] of [[Vedic and Sanskrit literature|Vedic]], [[Hindu texts|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist scriptures]].

==Biography==
Nakamura was born in [[Matsue]] Shimane Prefecture, Japan. In 1943 he graduated from the Department of Literature at [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] on a study on "The History of Early Vedanta Philosophy" under the supervision of Prof. Hakuju Ui.{{sfn|Takasaki|2000}} In 1943 he succeeded Prof. Ui and was appointed Associate Professor of Tokyo Imperial University.{{sfn|Takasaki|2000}}

He was a professor there from 1954 to 1973. After retiring from Tokyo University, he established Toho Gakuin (The Eastern Institute, Inc.) and lectured on philosophy to the general public.

==Academic studies==
Nakamura was an expert on [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and among his many writings are commentaries on [[Buddhist scriptures]]. He is most known in Japan as the first to translate the entire Pali Tripitaka into Japanese. This work is still considered the definitive translation to date against which later translations are measured. The footnotes in his Pali translation often refer to other previous translations in German, English, French as well as the ancient Chinese translations of Sanskrit scriptures.

Because of his meticulous approach to translation he had a dominating and lasting influence in the study of Indic philosophy in Japan at a time when it was establishing itself throughout the major Japanese universities. He also indirectly influenced the secular scholastic study of Buddhism throughout Eastern and Southern Asia, especially Taiwan and Korea. Japan, Korea, Taiwan and recently China is the only area in which all major scriptural languages of Buddhism (Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit and Pali) are taught and studied by academics of Indic philosophy.

Nakamura was influenced by the [[India]]n philosophy of Buddhism, [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese and [[Western philosophy|West]]ern thought. He made remarks on the problem of [[bioethics]].

Nakamura published more than 170 monographs, both in Japanese and in Western languages, and over a thousand articles.{{sfn|Takasaki|2000}}

'''''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity''''' ({{lang-de|Hegels Ontologie und die Grundlegung einer Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit}}) is a 1932 book about the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and his theory of [[historicity]] by the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]. The book, influenced by the work of the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], received positive reviews upon its publication in English translation in 1987. It is considered essential for understanding Marcuse's later intellectual development.

==Background==
''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' was originally intended to be Marcuse's ''Habilitationsschrift'', which would have earned him the right to teach in German universities. Some accounts claim that the work was rejected as a ''Habilitationsschrift'', while others suggest that it may never have been submitted, due to Marcuse realizing that he would never be permitted to teach in [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=ix–x}}

==Summary==
Marcuse attempts to reinterpret the works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, including ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) and the ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812), and "to disclose and to ascertain the fundamental characteristics of historicity", the factors that "define history" and distinguish it from other phenomena such as nature. He also discuses other works of Hegel such as ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' (1801), the ''Philosophy of Nature'' portion of the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'' (1817), ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'' (1837), and ''[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]''. Other topics considered include Hegel's relationship to philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and the work of the philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Marcuse acknowledges the influence of [[Martin Heidegger]] on his work.{{sfn|Marcuse|1987|pages=1–5, 9, 17–18, 49, 183}}

==Publication history==
''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' was first published in German in 1932 under the title ''Hegels Ontologie und die Grundlegung einer Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit''. In 1968, an unrevised version was published in German under the title ''Hegels Ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit''. An Italian translation was published in 1969 by La Nuova Italia, and a French translation was published in 1972 by [[Les Éditions de Minuit]]. In 1987, the book appeared for the first time in English, in a translation by the philosopher [[Seyla Benhabib]] published by [[MIT Press]] as part of the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought.{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=iv, ix, xxxvi}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' received positive reviews from Brent Nelson in ''[[Library Journal]]'' and H. N. Tuttle in ''Choice''.{{sfn|Nelson|1987|page=151}}{{sfn|Tuttle|1988|page=1568}}

Nelson wrote that the book "shows little of the Marcuse who became a popular [[New Left]] theorist" but would nevertheless "be of interest to students of 19th- and 20th-century philosophy." He noted that the work, "highly technical in its vocabulary", had a helpful glossary.{{sfn|Nelson|1987|page=151}} Tuttle described the book as "Marcuse's most important and certainly his most fundamental work" and "a philosophical classic", and recommended it "without qualification to advanced undergraduates and graduate students." He considered it less ideological than Marcuse's later writings, but essential for understanding Marcuse's ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955) and ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964).{{sfn|Tuttle|1988|page=1568}}

===Academic journals===
''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' received a mixed review from the philosopher [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung''.{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=xxx–xxxi}} The book's English translation received a positive review from the sociologist [[George E. McCarthy]] in ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1988|page=262}} The translation was also reviewed by K. R. Dove in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' and discussed by Adam Sitze in ''[[Theory and Event]]''.{{sfn|Dove|1989|pages=419–420}}{{sfn|Sitze|2017|pages=828–852}}

Adorno noted that the work advanced an interpretation of historicity that departed from Heidegger's views, moving from the "meaning of Being" toward the disclosure of beings, from fundamental ontology toward the philosophy of history, and from historicity toward history. In Adorno's view, this made Marcuse's work both significant and vulnerable to criticism. He noted that Marcuse did not ask if the question of the "material constitution of historicity" is compatible with an ontological investigation or whether the question must lead to a materialist theory of society and history.{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=xxx–xxxi}} McCarthy wrote that the book was "one of those rare jewels which has remained hidden from the English-speaking world for over fifty years" and "an extremely important work for understanding the foundations of Marcuse's own intellectual perspective and his later theoretical developments". In his view, it "recaptures the heart of Hegel's philosophical vision of reality, indirectly shows its importance for social theory, and breathes life into the most difficult of Hegel's writings."{{sfn|McCarthy|1988|page=262}} Sitze argued that the book was "part of Marcuse's dispute with Martin Heidegger" and "revolves around an antithesis to life that is neither death nor unlivability, but paralysis."{{sfn|Sitze|2017|pages=828–852}}

===Evaluations in books===
Jean-Michel Palmier criticized ''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' in his work ''Herbert Marcuse et la Nouvelle Gauche'' (1973).{{sfn|Palmier|1973|pages=42–98}}

Benhabib commented in her introduction to the work that it was the culmination of a period of Marcuse's intellectual development in which he espoused views that have been referred to as "Heideggerian Marxism", "phenomenological Marxism", or "existential Marxism". She maintained that it is crucial for understanding Marcuse's relationship to Heidegger, for "illuminating his highly original and creative reading of Hegel", and for assessing his Hegelian form of critical Marxism. She credited Marcuse with providing "detailed and careful commentary on Hegel's ''Logic'' and ''Phenomenology of Spirit''", but noted that the work might have an "initially daunting character for the contemporary reader." She attributed its neglect in the literature on Marcuse and [[critical theory]] to the fact that it does not refer explicitly to [[Karl Marx]] and [[historical materialism]], and argued that Marcuse, influenced by both Dilthey and Heidegger, did not succeed in the resolving the tensions between their approaches. She suggested that Marcuse might have been attempting to respond to a criticism of Hegel made by Heidegger in ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), according to which Hegel's phrase that "Spirit falls into time" obscures the fact that Spirit is already in time. She noted that Marcuse's work has "met with some skepticism" as an interpretation of Hegel, and that the centrality of the term "historicity" to Hegel's concerns has been questioned. Though defending the term's relevance to Hegel, she maintained that Marcuse's failure to define it "adds to the obliqueness if not the obscurity of some of his intentions."{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=ix–xxvii}}

She praised other parts of Marcuse's work, calling his discussion of the dialectic of work and recognition "brilliant". Though pointing to similarities between Marcuse's views and Heidegger's, she noted that there were also differences, and that a "Heideggerian objection" to Marcuse's work would be "that it contains no clear distinction between the "world-historical" dimension and the "historicity" proper to [[Dasein]]. She suggested that Heidegger might have rejected it as a ''Habilitationsschrift'' had the opportunity to do so arisen. She disputed [[Robert B. Pippin]]'s view that the work provides the basis for many elements of a full critical theory, but also rejected Palmier's view that the work was made obsolete by Marcuse's subsequent study on Hegel, ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941). She criticized Marcuse for the style of his work in the original German, and for failing to properly describe the role of narrativity in human existence, but argued that ''Eros and Civilization'' (1955) continues his interest in historicity and helped make up for the deficiencies of his earlier work.{{sfn|Benhabib|1987|pages=xxviii–xl}}

===Other views===
Russell Rockwell discussed ''Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'' in a conference paper delivered at the 2003 meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]]. He considered the book a major work on Hegel, and noted that it presented a more thorough investigation of the social relevance of Hegel’s absolute idea than did Marcuse's subsequent work ''Reason and Revolution'' (1941), the discussion in the latter work being an abbreviated version of that in the former.{{sfn|Rockwell|2003|pages=1–19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''Jean-Jacques Pelletier''' (born 1947) is a [[French Canadian]] philosophy professor and author. Pelletier was a long-time [[philosophy]] teacher with the [[Lévis-Lauzon]] post-secondary school, but is best known in several media as an author of [[French language|French-language]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, some of which have an element of [[fantasy]]. Many of his works have received critical acclaim, as his short story "La Bouche barbelée" won a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/Radio-Canada]] contest in 1993.

Pelletier has had several other works published as well, and his works ''Blunt - Les treize derniers jours'' and ''La Chair disparue'' were published as serials in the popular [[Montreal]] magazine ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' in 1997&amp;ndash;1998.

''La Chair disparue'' was chosen for inclusion in the French version of ''[[Canada Reads]]'', broadcast on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]] in 2005, where it was defended by [[pianist]] [[Alain Lefèvre]].

==Life==
John Bulwer was born in [[London]] in 1606 and continued to work and live in the city until his death in October 1656 when he was buried in [[St Giles in the Fields]], [[Westminster]].  He was the only surviving son of an [[apothecary]] named Thomas Bulwer and Marie Evans of [[St. Albans]]. On her death in 1638 John Bulwer inherited some property in [[St Albans]] from which he derived a small income.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J (1996). John Bulwer and his Italian sources. In Mirko Tavoni (Ed.), Italia ed Europa nella linguisticadel Rinascimento, Atti del convegno internazionale, 20–24 March 1991, Ferrara, p.420&lt;/ref&gt;  Although information about his education is unclear, there is evidence that he
was probably educated in Oxford as an unmatriculated student in the 1620s. His known friends had nearly all been educated there and he supported [[William Laud]] and the High Church party during the Civil
War.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J. (1996a) John Bulwer and his Italian sources. In Mirko Tavoni (Ed.), Italia ed Europa nella linguisticadel Rinascimento (Atti del convegno internazionale,
Ferrara, 20–24 March 1991) p419-420&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in his life, between 1650 and
1653, he acquired a Medicinae Doctor (M.D.) at an unknown
European university.
In 1634 he married a woman known only as the "Widow of Middleton" who predeceased him.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J (1996).  John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) place in the history of the deaf. Historiographia Linguistica, 23, 1/2, p2.&lt;/ref&gt;  No children from this marriage are known to have been born.  Later in life Bulwer would adopt a girl named Chirothea Johnson, and, as he states in his will "bred her up from a child as my own".  She may have been deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J (1996). John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) place in the history of the deaf. Historiographia Linguistica, 23, 1/2, p34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dekesel, K (1992).

== Published works ==

During the [[English Civil War]] Bulwer stopped working as a physician and concentrated on his study and writing. All his written works were created between 1640 and until around 1653. In total Bulwer published five works, all of which were either early examples or the first of their kind.&lt;ref name="Geen, R 2002 pp. 275-299"&gt;Geen, R &amp; Tassinary L G (2002). The mechanization of emotional expression in John Bulwer's Pathomyotomia (1649), in The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 115, No. 2, (Summer, 2002), pp. 275-299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, S (1995).

== ''Chirologia'' and ''Chironomia'' ==

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644.]]

'''''Chirologia''': or the naturall language of the hand. Composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing gestures thereof. Whereunto is added '''Chironomia''': or, the art of manuall rhetoricke. Consisting of the naturall expressions, digested by art in the hand, as the chiefest instrument of eloquence.'' London: Thomas Harper. 1644.

Although issued as a single volume ''Chirologia'' and ''Chironomia'' have different pagination. Bulwer always referred to them as separate works but over time they have come to be seen as a single volume. [[Francis Bacon]] had described gestures as "Transient Hieroglyphics" and suggested that [[Gesture]] should be the focus of a new scientific enquiry, Bulwer was the first to undertake the task. For Bulwer Gesture was a universal character of Reason. &lt;blockquote&gt;
[The hand] “speaks all languages, and as universal character of Reason is generally understood and known by all Nations, among the formal differences of their Tongue. And being the only speech that is natural to Man, it may well be called the Tongue and General language of Human Nature, which, without teaching, men in all regions of the habitable world doe at the first sight most easily understand”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Chirologia'' is often cited as Bulwer’s link to later Deaf studies because it focuses on hand gestures &lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J. (1996b) John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) place in the history of the deaf. Historiographia Linguistica, 23, 1/2, p4&lt;/ref&gt; which have come to be seen as the domain of deaf communication. In fact the book only mentions the deaf in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1644). ''Chirologia: or the naturall language of the hand. Composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing gestures thereof. Whereunto is added Chironomia: or, the art of manuall rhetoricke. Consisting of the naturall expressions, digested by art in the hand, as the chiefest instrument of eloquence''. London: Thomas Harper. 1644. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed it was Nature's recompense that deaf people should communicate through gesture, "that wonder of necessity that Nature worketh in men that are born deafe and dumb; who can argue and dispute rhetorically by signes" (page 5). The handshapes described in ''Chirologia'' are still used in [[British Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles. D (1988)'' A Beginners Guide; BBC British Sign Language'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Bulwer does mention [[fingerspelling]] describing how "the ancients did...order an alphabet upon the joints of their fingers...showing those letters by a distinct and grammatical succession", in addition to their use as [[mnemonic]] devices Bulwer suggest that manual alphabets could be "ordered to serve for privy ciphers for any secret intimation" (''Chironomia'', p149). 
''Chirologia'' is a compendium of manual gestures, citing their meaning and use from a wide range of sources; literary, Religious and Medical.&lt;!-- Ancient Greeks, Renaissance Europe, Biblical and commentaries --&gt; ''Chironomia'' is a manual for the effective use of Gesture in public speaking.

== Philocophus ==

[[File:Bulwer1648fr Philocophus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Frontispiece from Philocophus 1648|Frontispiece engraving from Philocophus showing a deaf man "hearing" music by [[bone conduction]] through the teeth.]] 

'''''Philocophus''': or, the deafe and dumbe mans friend. Exhibiting the philosophicall verity of that subtile art, which may inable one with an observant eie, to heare what any man speaks by the moving of his lips. Upon the same ground, with the advantage of an historical exemplification, apparently proving, that a man borne deafe and dumbe, may be taught to heare the sound of words with his eie, &amp; thence learne to speake with his tongue. ; By J. B. surnamed the Chirosopher''  London: Humphrey Moseley 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted by the British Deaf History Society {{ISBN|1-902427-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulwer was the first person in Britain to discuss the possibility educating deaf people, and the novelty of the idea, and seeming impossibility, is shown when Bulwer tries to persuade "some rational men" to support the establishment of a "new Academy", to them "the attempt seemed paradoxical, prodigious and hyperbolical; that it did rather amuse than satisfy their understanding" (from the introduction). To persuade these "knowing men" of "the philosophical verity of this Art" (the education of the deaf) he sets out in this volume to explain the theory and [[empirical evidence]] for its possibility. Some evidence comes from the account given by Sir [[Kenelm Digby]] of a meeting between the Prince of Wales and a deaf Spanish nobleman, Don Luis Velasco. As well as drawing heavily on this account, he also collects information about deaf people living in Britain at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648). Philocophus: or, the deafe and dumbe mans friend. Exhibiting the philosophicall verity of that subtile art, which may inable one with an observant eie, to heare what any man speaks by the moving of his lips. Upon the same ground, with the advantage of an historical exemplification, apparently proving, that a man borne deafe and dumbe, may be taught to heare the sound of words with his eie, &amp; thence learne to speake with his tongue. ; By I. B. sirnamed the Chirosopher London: Humphrey Moseley. p106-109&lt;/ref&gt; Through observations that some deaf people can "hear" the vibrations produced by musical instruments by bone conduction through the teeth, Bulwer came to believe that the body had a commonwealth of senses, for instance the eye could be used to perceive speech by lip-reading.&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648). Philocophus: or, the deafe and dumbe mans friend. Exhibiting the philosophicall verity of that subtile art, which may inable one with an observant eie, to heare what any man speaks by the moving of his lips. Upon the same ground, with the advantage of an historical exemplification, apparently proving, that a man borne deafe and dumbe, may be taught to heare the sound of words with his eie, &amp; thence learne to speake with his tongue. ; By I. B. sirnamed the Chirosopher London: Humphrey Moseley. from the unnumbered introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathomyotomia ==

'''''Pathomyotomia''', or a Dissection of the significant Muscles of the Affections of the Mind. Being an Essay to a new Method of observing the most important movings of the Muscles of the Head, as they are the neerest and Immediate Organs of the Voluntarie or Impetuous motions of the Mind. With the Proposall of a new Nomenclature of the Muscles.'' London: Humphrey Moseley. 1649

This was the first substantial English language work on the muscular basis of emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, S. (1995). Towards a universal language of motion: Reflections on a 17th century muscle man. In: Susan Leigh Foster Choreographing History. Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press p26&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to present a new and more intuitive system for naming the muscles of the face. A system in which muscles would be named after the passions they were used to express. It would be 200 years before similar ideas would surface in French anatomist and electrophysiologist [[Duchenne de Boulogne]]'s ''Mecanisme de la Physiognomie Humaine'' (1862).
The other observation of Duchenne that Bulwer foreshadowed was that the contraction of the [[orbicularis oculi]] (the muscle encircling the eye) accompanies genuine smiles of happiness but does not occur in deceptive or non-joyful smiles.

== Anthropometamorphosis ==

'''''Anthropometamorphosis''': Man Transform’d, or the Artificial Changeling. Historically presented, in the mad and cruel Gallantry, foolish Bravery, ridiculous Beauty, filthy Fineness, and loathesome Loveliness of most Nations, fashioning &amp; altering their Bodies from the Mould intended by Nature. With a Vindication of the Regular Beauty and Honesty of Nature, and an Appendix of the Pedigree of the English Gallant.'' London: J. Hardesty. 1650

''Anthropometamorphosis'' was Bulwer's final and most popular work, reprinted at least three times in his lifetime. First in 1650, the second edition of 1653 was much enlarged and illustrated with woodcuts. A third edition "printed for the use and benefit of Thomas Gibbs, gent" was a reissue of the second edition retitled "A view of the People of the whole World". The title literally means ‘humanity-changing’. It could be seen as another work influenced by Francis Bacon, an Anomatia Comparata, a comparison of all the peoples of the world, and in its attack on the cosmetic it does echo Bacon. It is one of the first studies in comparative cultural anthropology&lt;ref&gt;Montserrat, D (1998) Changing Bodies, Changing Meanings: Studies on the Human Body in Antiquity. Routledge, p2&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with a strong tone of social commentary, "Almost every Nation having a particular whimzey as touching corporall fashions of their own invention" (page 5), Bulwer describes how people modify their bodies and clothes but later commentators have interpreted this ostensible apolitical work as a coded piece of political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, W. E  (1999)in Wonders, Marvels and Monsters in Early Modern Culture, Associated University Press, p192&lt;/ref&gt; A political commentary against the artificial (in Bulwer's eyes) [[regicidal]] State, and a call to the return to the "natural" form of governance with the King as the symbolic head of the body of England. Bulwer’s politics are indivisible from his other thinking, for him Nature was a Monarch, "sovereignty delegated from God".&lt;ref name="Burns, W. E 1999 p195"&gt;Burns, W. E  (1999)in Wonders, Marvels and Monsters in Early Modern Culture, Associated University Press, p195&lt;/ref&gt; "The beauty of the Universe consists in things perfect and permanent" (p25) ruled over by the monarch, Nature. Although Bulwer does not make any direct reference to the political events in England his approach to the monstrous body echoes the themes of the polemical literature of the time, especially in its focus on the head. The main body of the text consists of 23 sections, of which 15 are concerned with deformations or modifications to the head or face.&lt;ref name="Burns, W. E 1999 p195"/&gt; The book ends with Bulwer stating that he is going to stop writing and return to working as a physician. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Until now obeying the sacred impulse of the genius operating upon our intellectual complexion, while my mind was carrying me into new things, I executed works not of supererogation, but supplemental to the advancement of sciences. In which I seem to have merited something from the republec of letters (i.e. Literary public): "Of the making of many books there is no end, and the reading of them is a weariness to the flesh" (Eccles xii.12): From now on I shall apply myself entirly to providing for my own health and the health of others. Other things will be done by other lovers of human nature. THE END.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J (1996). John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) place in the history of the deaf. Historiographia Linguistica, 23, 1/2, Translation from Latin by Wollock, J p31-32&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Manuscripts and other works==

In addition there are two surviving unpublished manuscripts held at the [[British Library]]:

'''Philocophus, or the '''Dumbe mans academie''' wherein is taught a new and admired art instructing them who are borne Deafe and Dumbe to heare the sound of words with theire eie and thence learne to speake with theire Tongue:' illustrated with engraved plates shewing the different portions of the hands.'' (Held under Sloane 1788 at the British Library).

This manuscript shows that Bulwer was the first person in England to acquire and translate [[Juan Pablo Bonet]]'s ''Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos'' ("Summary of the letters and the art of teaching speech to the mute") because it contains images cut and pasted directly from Bonet's book as well as commentary on the methods described therein.&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, Jeffrey (1996) John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) place in the history of the deaf. Historiographia Linguistica, 23, 1/2, 1–46.&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript is usually referred to as the ''Dumbe mans academie'' to differentiate it clearly from the earlier published work also entitled ''Philocophus''.

The other manuscript held is entitled '''''Vultispex criticus, seu physiognomia medici'''''. A manuscript on [[Physiognomy]].

There are also a selection of works that are now lost including one study, entitled ''Glossiatrus'', on [[speech disorders]] and another, ''Otiatrus'' on [[hearing disorders]].&lt;ref name="Geen, R 2002 pp. 275-299"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollock, J (1996).

{{Italic title}}
{{Christian mysticism}}
In [[Christian theology]], '''''kenosis''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang|el|κένωσις}}, ''kénōsis'', lit. [the act of emptying]) is the 'self-emptying' of Jesus' own will and becoming entirely receptive to [[God|God's]] divine will.

The word {{lang|el|ἐκένωσεν}} (''ekénōsen'') is used in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] [http://interlinearbible.org/philippians/2-7.htm 2:7], "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jesus]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; made himself nothing ..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NIV}} ([[New International Version|NIV]]) or "...[he] emptied himself..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NRSV}} ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]), using the verb form {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty". 

==Etymology and definition==
Etymology is from Greek {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty out". The Liddell–Scott [[Greek–English Lexicon]] gives the following simplified definition simplified for the noun:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fnwsis&amp;highlight=empty κέν-ωσις , εως]&amp;nbsp;— A. emptying, depletion, {{lang|el|οὐχὶ πεῖνα καὶ δίψα}} . . {{lang|el|κενώσεις τινές εἰσι}} . . ; [[Plato]] [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 585b, cf. Philebus 35b, [[BGU, Berliner griechische Urkunden|BGU]]904.13 (ii A.D.):&amp;nbsp;—poet. {{lang|el|κενέωσις}} , “{{lang|el|πόντου κ. ἀνὰ πέδον}}” [[Pindar]] Fragments 107.12: metaph., emptiness of life “{{lang|el|κένωσις βίου}}” [[Vettius Valens]] 190.30; “{{lang|el|κ. τοῦ γιγνώσκειν}}” [[Iamblichus]] De communi mathematica scientia, 11.
2. (Medical), emptying, evacuation, [[Hippocrates]] Aphorisms 3.8, interpolated in Dsc.2.50; {{lang|el|κ. τῶν οἰκείων}}, [opposite ''katharsis'' {{lang|el|κάθαρσις τῶν ἀλλοτρίων}}], [[Galenus]] 18(2).134. b. depletion, low diet, [opposite ''plerosis'' {{lang|el|πλήρωσις}}, [[Hippocrates]] VM9, cf. Art.49; {{lang|el|κ. σίτου}} ib.50. 3. (of the moon) waning, [opposite ''plerosis'' {{lang|el|πλήρωσις}}], [[Epicurus]] Epistles 2p.40U.&lt;/ref&gt;
# emptying, depletion, emptiness (of life) (e.g. [[Vettius Valens]])
# depletion, low diet, as opposed to ''plerosis'' fullness (e.g. [[Hippocrates]])
# waning (of the moon) (e.g. [[Epicurus]])

==New Testament usage==
The New Testament does not use the actual noun ''kénōsis''&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians (ed. Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort) in I Corinthians, chapter 9: ... {{lang|el|γάρ μοι μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἢ&amp;nbsp;– τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς '''κενώσει'''. ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα, ἀνάγκη}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the verb form ''kenóō'' occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus is said to have "emptied himself", which is the starting point of Christian ideas of kenosis.

[[John the Baptist]] displayed the attitude when he said of Jesus, "He must become greater; I must become less." (Jn 3:30).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://padretex.com/?p=27 |title=The Initial Movement of the Eucharist |author=Fr. J.

==In Christology==

===Kenotic ethic===
The '''kenotic ethic''' is the [[ethic]] of [[Jesus]], considered as the ethic of [[sacrifice]]. The Philippians passage urges believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying. In this interpretation, Paul was not primarily putting forth a theory about God in this passage, rather he was using God's humility exhibited in the incarnation event as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jay Oord]] ''Defining Love: A Philosophical, Scientific, and Theological Engagement'', Brazos Press, 2010. 1-58743-257-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oord. T.J. "Essential Kenosis" in ''The Nature of Love: A Theology'', Chalice Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-082720828-5}} pp. 149,155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John of the Cross===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
In [[Christian theology]], ''kenosis'' is the concept of the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the [[Incarnation]], and an indication of the nature of God's activity and will. [[Mystical theology|Mystical theologian]] [[John of the Cross]]' work "[[Dark Night of the Soul]]" is a particularly lucid explanation of God's process of transforming the believer into the icon or "likeness of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Kavanaugh, O.C.D; Otilio Rodriguez, O.C.D]] ''The collected Works of St. John of The Cross'', ICS Publications, 1991. pp. 353-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox Mystical Theology of the East emphasises following the example of Christ. Kenosis is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God.  The [[Poustinia]] tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is one major expression of this search.

Kenosis is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, it has moreover to do with [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]], namely to do with the Holy Spirit. Kenosis, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual [[epiklesis]] and self-denial of one's own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a kenosis of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God's saving work through [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]; becoming holy by grace.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P16.HTM#N5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis never concerns becoming like God in essence or being, which is [[pantheism]]; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his [[Essence-Energies distinction|Energies]]. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine [[Essence-Energies distinction|Essence and Energies]]. Kenosis therefore is a paradox and a mystery since "emptying oneself" in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. Kenosis in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over kenosis. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the [[hypostatic union]]) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of kenosis or ekkenosis.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of
God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
Another perspective is the idea that God is self-emptying. He poured out himself to create the [[cosmos]] and the [[universe]], and everything within it. Therefore, it is our duty to pour out ourselves. (This is similar to C.S. Lewis's statement in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that a painter pours his ideas out in his work, and yet remains quite a distinct being from his painting.)

===Roman Catholicism===
[[Pope]] [[Pius XII]] in 1951 wrote ''[[Sempiternus Rex Christus]]'', in which he condemns a particular interpretation of [[Philippians]] in regards to the kenosis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is another enemy of the [[Chalcedonian Definition|faith of Chalcedon]], widely diffused outside  the fold of the Catholic religion. This is an opinion for which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians (ii, 7), supplies a basis and a shape. This is called the  kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ. It is a wicked invention, equally to be condemned with the [[Docetism]] opposed to it. It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations. 'With the entire and perfect nature of man'—thus grandly St. [[Leo the Great]]—'He Who was true God was born, complete in his own nature, complete in ours' (Ep. xxviii, 3. PL. Liv, 763. Cf. Serm. xxiii, 2. PL. lvi, 201).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_pi12sr.htm Sempiternus Rex Christus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unitarianism===
Since some forms of [[Unitarianism]] do not accept the personal [[pre-existence of Christ]] their interpretations of Phil. 2:7, and the concept of "kenosis", Christ "emptying" himself, take as a starting point that his "emptying" occurred in life, and not before birth. However, as [[Thomas Belsham]] put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Belsham ''American Unitarianism: or A Brief history of the progress and present state of the Unitarian Churches in America'' 1816 p. 119 "In answer to the inquiry ; when was it, after entering on bis publick ministry, that Christ emptied himself of the form of God, and look on him the form of a servant and the fashion of a man?"&lt;/ref&gt; Belsham took this to be at the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], whereas [[Joseph Priestley]]&lt;ref&gt;Belsham, op. cit., p. 119 citing Priestley's ''Letters'' p139&lt;/ref&gt; took this to be in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when Christ did not resist arrest. The [[Christadelphian]] Tom Barling considered that the "emptying" of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ's character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the [[temptations of Christ]] and his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Barling ''The Letter to the Philippians'' CMPA Birmingham 1957 p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
The equivalent to kenōsis in Gnostic literature is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. At the request of his disciples, "Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. S. Mead (translator) : ''Pistis Sophia''. (lib. 1, cap. 6) ) http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ps/ps010.htm (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; There are parallels to this voluntary withdrawal of the incarnate deity's light in the literatures of other religions also, such as in Daoism, where when the incarnate deity "Crane Boy" came to the world of humans in his incarnation as Han Xiangzi, he "concealed his auspicious light, left the underworld, and returned to the world of humans."&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng (translated by Philip Clart) : ''The Story of Han Xiangzi''. University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2007. {{ISBN|0-295-98690-5}}. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ma''''' ([[wiktionary:間|間]]) is a Japanese word which can be roughly translated as "gap", "space", "pause" or "the space between two structural parts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/aa082097.htm  Japanese language definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/jgard/msg100248139141.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfj-online.org/journalPages/MFJ38/iimura.html&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial concept is experienced progressively through intervals of spatial designation.  In Japanese, ''ma'', the word for space, suggests interval.  It is best described as a consciousness of place, not in the sense of an enclosed three-dimensional entity, but rather the simultaneous awareness of form and non-form deriving from an intensification of vision.

Ma is not something that is created by compositional elements; it takes place in the imagination of the human who experiences these elements.  Therefore, ma can be defined as experiential place understood with emphasis on interval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/V3613/ma/ MA The Japanese Spatial Expression] [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ma has also been described as "an emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled", and as "the silence between the notes which make the music"&lt;ref&gt;https://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. Isaac Stern's comment below).


Other illustrations appear in this old poem:

''Thirty spokes meet in the hub,''
''though the space between them is the essence of the wheel;''

''Pots are formed from clay,''
''though the space inside them is the essence of the pot;''

''Walls with windows and doors form the house,''
''though the space within them is the essence of the house''&lt;ref&gt;https://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html&lt;/ref&gt;.


==Word==
{{Off topic}}
Among [[List of English words of Japanese origin|English loanwords of Japanese origin]], both ''Ma (negative space)'' and ''[[Ken (architecture)]]'' are written with the same character [[wikt:間|間]].

This Japanese ''[[kanji]]'' "Chinese character" 間 graphically combines [[wikt:門|門]] "door" and [[wikt:日|日]] "sun". The earlier [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] [[wikt:閒|閒]] was written with [[wikt:月|月]] "moon" rather than "sun", depicting "A 門 door through the crevice of which the 月 moonshine peeps in".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Karlgren]], ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'', Paul Geunthner, 1923, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverse Japanese pronunciations of 間 include ''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'' Sino-Chinese readings (from ''jian'' 間 or [[wikt:间|间]] "room; between; gap; interval") of ''kan'' "interval; space; between; among; discord; favorable opportunity" or ''ken'' "six feet"; and ''[[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]]'' native Japanese readings of ''ai'' "interval; between; medium; crossbred", ''aida'' or ''awai'' "space; interval; gap; between; among; midway; on the way; distance; time; period; relationship", or ''ma'' "space; room; interval; pause; rest (in music); time; a while; leisure; luck; timing; harmony".&lt;ref&gt;John H. Haig, ''The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary'', Tuttle, 1997, p. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in the West==
In his 2001 book ''The Art of Looking Sideways'', [[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]] discusses the importance of exemplifying "[[Negative Space|space]]" as a substance:
{{quote|
Space is substance. [[Cézanne]] painted and modelled space. [[Giacometti]] sculpted by "''taking the fat off space''". [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]] conceived poems with absences as well as words. [[Ralph Richardson]] asserted that acting lay in pauses... [[Isaac Stern]] described music as "''that little bit between each note - silences which give the form''"... The Japanese have a word (ma) for this interval which gives shape to the whole. In the West we have neither word nor term. A serious omission.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Looking Sideways''. by Alan Fletcher. Page 370. Published by Phaidon, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7148-3449-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Derrick de Kerckhove]] described Ma as: “the complex network of relationships between people and objects”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ve7_jMQPysC&amp;pg=PA157 de Kerckhove, Derrick, "The Skin of Culture," in "Marshall McLuhan: Theoretical elaboration", Volume 2, Taylor &amp; Francis 2005.  p 157.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">'''James Martin Hollis''' (14 March 1938 – 27 February 1998) was an English [[Rationalism|rationalist]] philosopher.

Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', Tim O'Hagan, an Emeritus Professor at the [[University of East Anglia]] argued that central to Hollis's rationalism was "the epistemological unity of mankind", the view that "some beliefs are universal ... There are, because there have to be, percepts and concepts shared by all who can understand each other." This rationalism, of Hollis, was in its early formulations strongly influenced by [[P. F. Strawson|Peter Strawson]] and applied to understanding and explaining the approach of the social sciences.&lt;ref name=IndepObit&gt;Timothy O'Hagan, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-martin-hollis-1149574.html Obituary: Professor Martin Hollis], ''[[The Independent]]'', Wednesday, 11 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Martin Hollis was the son of a diplomat, and nephew of the MI5 director-general [[Roger Hollis]]. Educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]], he did [[national service]] in the [[Royal Artillery]] before reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[New College, Oxford]] from 1958 to 1961. From 1961 to 1963 he studied at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] on a [[Harkness Fellowship]], encountering [[sociology]] in California and the work of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[John Rawls|Rawls]] at Harvard, and meeting his future wife Patricia Wells,&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt; subsequently [[Baroness Hollis of Heigham]].

Returning to England, Hollis worked from 1963 to 1966 at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]. "Sent to [[Heidelberg]] to learn German, he returned to find himself posted to [[Moscow]]. This was the last straw for a rational man, who was already moonlighting in Oxford, giving philosophy tutorials at New College and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]. He left the FCO."&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt; Appointed to a philosophy post at the new [[University of East Anglia]] in 1967, he remained in Norwich until his death. In 1972 he became Senior Lecturer, and in 1981 Professor. From 1980 to 1987 he was editor of ''[[Ratio (journal)|Ratio]]''.  He combined teaching and research with an increasing level of university administration, becoming Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1992. For ten years he was also a Norwich [[Justice of the Peace|JP]].&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

Hollis was also a keen player of games. He was a [[chess]]-player of a very{{fact|date=September 2017}} high standard, played competitive [[contract bridge|bridge]], and was also interested in designing new games. All of this was not just a hobby but derived from his interest in rationality and choice, and the paradoxes that rationality throws up, something he increasingly explored in his later work. He was also fond of puzzles, especially creating logic puzzles, and published them prolifically in a variety of publications including ''Cogito'' and [[New Scientist]]. (A collection of the latter was published as ''Tantalizers'' in 1970.)

There are a number of '''masonic manuscripts''' that are important in the study of the emergence of [[Freemasonry]]. Most numerous are the ''Old Charges'' or ''Constitutions''. These documents outlined a "history" of masonry, tracing its origins to a biblical or classical root, followed by the regulations of the organisation, and the responsibilities of its different grades. More rare are old hand-written copies of ritual, affording a limited understanding of early masonic rites. All of those which pre-date the formation of Grand Lodges are found in Scotland and Ireland, and show such similarity that the Irish rituals are usually assumed to be of Scottish origin. The earliest Minutes of lodges formed before the first Grand Lodge are also located in Scotland. Early records of the first [[Grand Lodge]] in 1717 allow an elementary understanding of the immediate pre-Grand Lodge era and some insight into the personalities and events that shaped early 18th century Freemasonry in Britain.

Other early documentation is included in this article. The Kirkwall Scroll is a hand painted roll of linen, probably used as a floorcloth, now in the care of a lodge in [[Orkney]]. Its dating and the meaning of its symbols have generated considerable debate. Early operative documents and the later printed constitutions are briefly covered.

==Old Charges==
[[File:Grand Lodge MS No 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Introduction to Grand Lodge Manuscript no 1|Introduction to Grand Lodge Manuscript no 1]]
The '''Old Charges''' of the masons' lodges were documents describing the duties of the members, part of which (the charges) every mason had to swear on admission. For this reason, every lodge had a copy of its charges, occasionally written into the beginning of the minute book, but usually as a separate manuscript roll of parchment. With the coming of Grand Lodges, these were largely superseded by printed constitutions, but the [[Grand Lodge of All England]] at York, and the few lodges that remained independent in Scotland and Ireland, retained the hand-written charges as their authority to meet as a lodge. Woodford, Hughan, Speth and Gould, all founders of [[Quatuor Coronati Lodge]], and Dr Begemann, a German Freemason, produced much published work in the second half of the nineteenth century, collating, cataloguing, and classifying the available material. Since then, aside from the occasional rediscovery of another old document, little has been done to update the field.
&lt;ref name ="Prescott"&gt;Andrew Prescott, ''The Old Charges Revisited'', from Transactions of the Lodge of Research No. 2429 (Leicester), 2006, [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott07.html Pietre-Stones Masonic Papers], retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest, the Regius poem, is unique in being set in verse. The rest, of which over a hundred survive, usually have a three part construction. They start with a prayer, invocation of God, or a general declaration, followed by a description of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]] (logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), extolling [[Geometry]] above the others. There follows a history of the craft, and how it came to the British Isles, usually culminating in a general assembly of masons during the reign of [[King Athelstan]]. The last part consists of the charges or regulations of the lodge, and the craft of masonry in general, which the members are bound to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;A. F. A. Woodford, preface to William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of the York Legend===

The earliest masonic documents are those of their early employers, the church and the state. The first claimed by modern Freemasons as the lineal ancestors of their own ''Charges'' relate to the self-organisation of masons as a fraternity with mutual responsibilities. From the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] to the [[Elizabeth I|Elizabethan]] period, that is from about 1425 to 1550, surviving documents show the evolution of a legend of masonry, starting before the flood, and culminating in the re-establishment of the craft of masonry in [[York]] during the reign of King [[Athelstan]].

====Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem====
[[File:Regius-Manuskript.jpg|thumb|Halliwell Manuscript]]
The '''Halliwell Manuscript''', also known as the '''Regius Poem''', is the earliest of the ''Old Charges''. It consists of 64 vellum pages of [[Middle English]] written in rhyming couplets. In this, it differs from the prose of all the later charges. The poem begins by describing how [[Euclid]] "counterfeited geometry" and called it masonry, for the employment of the children of the nobility in [[Ancient Egypt]]. It then recounts the spread of the art of geometry in "divers lands." The document relates how the craft of  masonry was brought to England during the reign of [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] (924–939). It tells how all the masons of the land came to the King for direction as to their own good governance, and how Athelstan, together with the nobility and landed gentry, forged the fifteen articles and fifteen points for their rule. This is followed by fifteen articles for the master concerning both moral behaviour (do not harbour thieves, do not take bribes, attend church regularly, etc.) and the operation of work on a building site (do not make your masons labour at night, teach apprentices properly, do not take on jobs that you cannot do etc.). There are then fifteen points for craftsmen which follow a similar pattern. Warnings of punishment for those breaking the ordinances are followed by provision for annual assemblies. There follows the legend of the [[Four Crowned Martyrs]], a series of moral aphorisms, and finally a blessing.&lt;ref name="Regius"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/regius.html Pietre-Stones, ''The Regius Poem, Parallel text with introduction''], retrieved 27th July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SoMoteItBeRegiusMS.gif|thumb|300px|alt=Fifteen articles there they sought and fifteen points there they wrought. Part of Regius Manuscript| ''"Fyftene artyculus þey þer sowȝton, and fyftene poyntys þer þey wroȝton."'' (Fifteen articles they there sought and fifteen points there they wrought.) —Regius MS, ca. 1425-50.]]

The origins of the Regius are obscure. The manuscript was recorded in various personal inventories as it changed hands until it came into possession of the Royal Library, which was donated to the [[British Museum]] in 1757 by [[King George II of Great Britain|King George II]] to form the nucleus of the present [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Quick, ''A Fantasy of the Regius Poem's Origin'', Transactions of A. Douglas Smith, Jr. Lodge of Research #1949, Vol 3 (1993–1997), pp 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the attention of Freemasonry much later, this oversight being mainly due to the librarian David Casley, who described it as "a Poem of Moral Duties" when he catalogued it in 1734. It was in the 1838–39 session of the [[Royal Society]] that [[James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps|James Halliwell]], who was not a Freemason,  delivered a paper on "The early History of Freemasonry in England", based on the Regius, which was published in 1840. The manuscript was dated to 1390, and supported by such authorities as [[A. F. A. Woodford|Woodford]] and Hughan, the dating of [[Edward Augustus Bond]], the curator of manuscripts at the British Museum, to fifty years later was largely sidelined. Hughan also mentions that it was probably written by a priest.&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872, pp 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern analysis has confirmed Bond's dating to the second quarter of the fifteenth century, and placed its composition in [[Shropshire]]. This dating leads to the hypothesis that the document's composition, and especially its narrative of a royal authority for annual assemblies, was intended as a counterblast to the statute of 1425 banning such meetings.&lt;ref name ="Prescott" /&gt;

====Matthew Cooke Manuscript====
The '''Matthew Cooke Manuscript''' is the second oldest of the ''Old Charges'' or ''Gothic Constitutions'' of Freemasonry, and the oldest known set of charges to be written in prose. It contains some repetition, but compared to the Regius there is also much new material, much of which is repeated in later constitutions. After an opening thanksgiving prayer, the text enumerates the [[Seven Liberal Arts]], giving precedence to geometry, which it equates with masonry. There follows the tale of the children of [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]], expanded from the [[Book of Genesis]]. [[Jabal (Bible)|Jabal]] discovered geometry, and became [[Cain]]'s Master Mason. [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] discovered music, [[Tubal-cain|Tubal Cain]] discovered metallurgy and the art of the smith, while Lamech's daughter [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naamah]] invented weaving. Discovering that the earth would be destroyed either by fire or by flood, they inscribed all their knowledge on two pillars of stone, one that would be impervious to fire, and one that would not sink. Generations after the flood both pillars were discovered, one by [[Pythagoras]], the other by the philosopher [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]]. The seven sciences were then passed down through [[Nimrod]], the architect of the [[Tower of Babel]], to [[Abraham]], who taught them to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], including Euclid, who in turn taught masonry to the children of the nobility as an instructive discipline. The craft is then taught to the children of Israel, and from the [[Temple of Solomon]] finds its way to France, and thence to [[Saint Alban]]'s England. [[Athelstan]] now became one of a line of kings actively supporting masonry. His youngest son, unnamed here, is introduced for the first time as leader and mentor of masons. There follow nine articles and nine points, and the document finishes in a similar manner to the Regius.&lt;ref name="Cooke" &gt;{{Wikisource-inline|Matthew Cooke Manuscript}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the majority of the old constitutions, which are written on rolls, the Cooke manuscript is written on sheets of vellum, four and three-eighth inches high and three and three eighth inches broad (112mm x 86mm) bound into a book, still retaining its original oak covers. The manuscript was published by R. Spencer, London, in 1861 when it was edited by Mr. Matthew Cooke — hence the name. In the [[British Museum|British Museum's]] catalogue it is listed as "Additional M.S. 23,198", and is now dated to 1450 or thereabouts, although errors in Cooke's transcription caused it originally to be dated to after 1482. In line 140, ''And in policronico a cronycle p'yned'', Cooke translated the last word as "printed", causing Hughan to give the earliest date as Caxton's Polychronicon of 1482. Later retranslation as "proved" justified the earlier dating. Obvious scribal errors indicate that the document is a copy, and repetition of part of the stories of Euclid and Athelstan seems to indicate two sources. Speth postulated, in 1890, that these sources were much older than the manuscript, a view that remained unchallenged for over a century.&lt;ref name="QCA2.1"&gt;George William Speth, ''Commentary to Cooke Manuscript'', Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, vol II, part I.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent analysis of the [[Middle English]] of the document date it to the same period as the writing, around 1450, implying that the source or sources from which it was copied were almost contemporary with the Cooke, and contemporary with, or only slightly later than the Regius poem. It was probably composed in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], near to the origin of the Regius in Shropshire. The historian Andrew Prescott sees both the Regius and Cooke manuscripts as part of the struggle of mediaeval masons to determine their own pay, particularly after the statute of 1425 banning assemblies of masons. Masons sought to show that their assemblies had royal approval, and added the detail that the King's son had become a mason himself.&lt;ref name ="Prescott" /&gt; At line 603 we find ''For of specculatyfe he was a master and he lovyd well masonry and masons. And he bicome a mason hym selfe.''&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

James Anderson had access to the Cooke manuscript when he produced his 1723 Constitutions. He quotes the final sixty lines in a footnote to his description of the York assembly. The Woodford manuscript, which is a copy of the Cooke, has a note explaining that it was made in 1728 by the Grand Secretary of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]], William Reid, for William Cowper, ''Clerk of the Parliaments'', who had also been Grand Secretary.&lt;ref name="QCA2.1" /&gt;

====Dowland Manuscript====
The '''Dowland Manuscript''' was first printed in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' in 1815. The contributor, James Dowland, wrote "For the gratification of your readers, I send you a curious address respecting Freemasonry which not long since came into my possession. It is written on a long roll of parchment, in a very clear hand apparently in the 17th century, and probably was copied from a MS. of earlier date." This earlier date is still estimated to be around 1550, making the Dowland the second oldest prose constitutions known. The wages mentioned in the text agree with other manuscripts known to originate in the second half of the sixteenth century. Unfortunately, the original is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872, p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The history is similar to that of the Cooke manuscript. In this case we are told that the first charges proceeded from Euclid's instruction of the sons of the Egyptian Lords. The Master Mason at the construction of the [[Temple of Solomon]] is a son of [[King Hiram I|King Hiram of Tyre]] called Avnon. Again masonry diffuses from the Temple and enters [[Saint Alban]]'s England from France. The science suffers in the wars following Alban's death, but is restored under [[Athelstan]]. His son, now named as ''Edwinne'', is the expert geometrician who obtains his father's charter for an annual assembly of masons, that should be "renewed from Kinge to Kinge". The assembly under Edwin is for the first time identified as having occurred at York. The articles and points are now replaced with a series of charges, in the form of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872, p 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of York, and the appearance of the more modern form of the charges after a century of silence in the documentary record, have been linked by Prescott to government policy in from the second half of the sixteenth century, which allowed wage increases for London masons, while attempting rigid wage control in the North of England.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt;

====Grand Lodge No 1====
This manuscript inexplicably appears in Hughan's ''Old Charges'' with a date of 1632, which Speth, the next editor, attributed to the terrible handwriting of [[A. F. A. Woodford|Rev. Woodford]], Hughan's collaborator. It is the first of the charges to bear a date, which is just discernible as 1583, on the 25 December. The document is in the form of a roll of parchment nine feet long and five inches wide, being made up of four pieces pasted at the ends. The [[United Grand Lodge of England]] acquired it in 1839 for twenty-five pounds from a Miss Sidall, the great-granddaughter of [[Thomas Dunckerley]]'s second wife. The handwriting is compatible with the date of 1583, although the language is older, leading [[Henry Jenner]] to propose that it was copied from an original up to a century older. The contents of Grand Lodge 1 tell the same tale as the Dowland manuscript, with only minor changes. Again, the charges take the form of an oath on a sacred book.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Speth, ''Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha'', vol IV, part 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this manuscript and the Dowland we find a ''curious mason'' called Naymus Grecus (Dowland has Maymus or Mamus Grecus), who had been at the building of Solomon's Temple, and who taught masonry to [[Charles Martel]] before he became King of France, thus bringing masonry to Europe. This obvious absurdity has been interpreted by Neville Barker Cryer as a coded reference to [[Alcuin]] of York, possibly from a misunderstanding of one of his poems. In Carmen XXVI is the line,  "Et ''Nemias Greco'' infundat sua poculo Baccho", expressing the wish that Nemias should fill Alcuin's cup with Greek wine. Nemias, or Nehemias, was Alcuin's code name for Eberhard, [[Charlemagne]]'s cupbearer. Cryer presents the possibility that a misunderstanding allowed Nemias Greco to be assumed to refer to the Yorkshire saint and scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Revd Neville Barker Cryer, ''York Mysteries Revealed'', Lewis Masonic, 2006, pp14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later manuscripts===
At this point, the old charges had attained a standard form. What became known as the [[Grand Lodge of All England#York Legend|York Legend]] had emerged in a form that would survive into [[William Preston (Freemason)|Preston]]'s ''Illustrations of Freemasonry'', a work of 1772 which was still being reprinted in the mid nineteenth century. The requirement for every new admission to be sworn to the Old Charges on the bible now meant that every lodge should have its own manuscript charges, and over a hundred survive from the seventeenth century until the period in the eighteenth when their use died out. Describing them all is beyond the scope of a single article, and unnecessary since differences are only in details, such as occasional clumsy attempts to deal with the absence of Edwin, Athelstan's son, from any historical record. Differences also occur in the specifics of the charges and the manner of taking the oath. A very few manuscripts have a separate ''Apprentice Charge''. Families of documents have been identified, and two systems of classification exist.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Speth, ''Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha'', vol I, part 3, p xi&lt;/ref&gt; A few documents deserve special attention.

====Lansdowne====
This document was purchased by the British Government as part of a collection amassed by [[William Petty]], Marquis of Lansdowne.  It was bundled with papers from [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], a prominent Elizabethan politician who died in 1598, and was assumed to belong to the same period.  Analysis of the handwriting places it a hundred years later, and later papers have been found in Cecil's bundle.  Lansdowne is still frequently cited as an Elizabethan document.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt;

====York No 4====
The group of masons calling themselves the ''[[Grand Lodge of All England]] meeting since Time Immemorial in the City of York'' continued to issue written constitutions to lodges, as their authority to meet, until the last quarter of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Neville Barker Cryer, ''The Grand Lodge of All England at York Ritual'', Cornerstone Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  Surviving are York manuscripts numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5 (3 missing), the Hope manuscript, and the Scarborough manuscript, which turned up in Canada.  Of these, York 4 has been the subject of controversy since it was first described in print.  It is dated 1693, and was the first of the Old Charges discovered to have a separate ''Apprentice Charge'', or a set of oaths specially for apprentices.  The controversy was caused by the short paragraph describing how the oath was to be taken. "The one of the elders takeing the Booke / and that hee or shee that is to be made mason / shall lay their hands thereon / and the charge shall bee given".  Woodford and Hughan had no particular problem with this reading, believing it to be a copy of a much older document, and realising that women were admitted to the guilds of their deceased menfolk if they were in a position to carry on their trade.  Other writers, starting with Hughan's contemporary David Murray Lyon, the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, insisted that the "shee" must be a scribal error for ''they'', or a mistranslation of the Latin ''illi'' (they).  Hughan failed to point out that the four lines in question are written in a competent hand in letters twice the size of the surrounding text, but riposted to Lyon that the Apprentice charge in York No 4, Harleian MS 1942, and the Hope manuscript outline the apprentice's duties to his master ''or Dame''.  Modern opinion seems resigned to letting York Manuscript number 4 remain a paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Kidd, ''Haunted Chambers: the Lives of Early Women Freemasons'', Cornerstone, 2009, pp 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, ''The Old Charges of British Freemasons'', London, 1872, pp 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Melrose No 2====
The Lodge of Melrose successfully ignored the Grand Lodge of Scotland for a century and a half, finally joining in 1891 as the Lodge Of Melrose St. John No 1 bis.  The original Melrose constitutions are lost, but a copy was made in 1674 by Andro Mein (Andrew Main).  He appended a copy of a certificate issued to an apprentice by ''"his master frie Mason, in the Year of our Lord 1581, and in the raign of our Soveraign Lady Elizabeth the (22) year"''.  Two other Scottish constitutions, the Kilwinning and the Aberdeen, declare that masons are liegemen of the King of England.  This suggests an English origin of at least some of the Scottish Old Charges.&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, introduction to James Smith, ''History of the Old Lodge of Dumfries'', Maxwell, 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed constitutions===
As the first [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge]] gathered momentum the Rev. [[James Anderson (Mason)|James Anderson]] was commissioned to digest the "gothic constitutions" into a more palatable form. The result, in 1723, was the first printed constitutions. While manuscript constitutions continued to be used in unaffiliated lodges, their condensation into print saw them die out by the end of the century. Anderson's introduction advertised a history of Freemasonry from the beginning of the world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/25/ Anderson's Constitutions] Franklin's reprint, retrieved 22nd June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The York legend was therefore still employed, and persisted through reprints, pocket editions, and [[William Preston (Freemason)|Preston's]] ''Illustrations of Freemasonry''. Anderson's regulations, the second part of the book, followed on a set of charges devised by [[George Payne (Freemason)|George Payne]] during his second term as Grand Master. Both charges and regulations were geared to the needs of a Grand Lodge, necessarily moving away from the simplicity of the originals. When a new Grand Lodge sprang up to carry the older rite, which they saw as abandoned by the "Moderns", their constitutions had a different approach to history. [[Ahiman Rezon]] parodied the old history of the craft, and Anderson's research. The charges and regulations of the [[Antient Grand Lodge of England|Antients]] were derived from Anderson by way of Pratt's Irish Constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Sheppard, Ahiman Rezon, [http://www.antients.co.uk/History%20-%20Ahiman%20Rezon.htm Association of Atholl Lodges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926194347/http://www.antients.co.uk/History%20-%20Ahiman%20Rezon.htm |date=26 September 2013 }}, retrieved 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Almost inevitably, the legendary history disappeared after the union of the two Grand Lodges in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugle.org.uk/about-ugle/book-of-constitutions/ UGLE - ''Book of Constitutions''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121224223505/http://www.ugle.org.uk/about-ugle/book-of-constitutions/ |date=24 December 2012 }} retrieved 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==
While over 100 manuscript 'constitutions' exist, documents detailing actual ritual are much rarer. The earliest, dating from 1696, is the Scottish ''Edinburgh Register House'' manuscript [MS], which gives a catechism and a certain amount of ritual of the Entered Apprentice and a Fellow Craft ceremonies. It was named after the building in which it was discovered, which houses the Scottish National Archives. The ''Trinity College Manuscript'', discovered in Dublin, Ireland, but which is clearly of Scottish origin, has been dated to c.1710, is substantially the same in content. The recently discovered Airlie MS dated 1705 is therefore the second oldest known Scottish stonemasons' rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Although referred to as rituals these manuscripts are also ''aide memoires'', or 'prompt sheets'. They therefore have three functions but for ease of reference they are commonly described as 'rituals'.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The significance of these three rituals lie in the fact that they are 1) of Scottish origin 2) are based on the ceremonies used by Scottish stonemasons and 3) that they pre-date the existence of any Grand Lodge (essentially a 'Head Office'). Collectively they are known as the 'Scottish School'.&lt;ref name="Airlie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Robert L D|last2=Kahler|first2=Lisa Dr.|title=''A New Masonic Catechism: The Airlie Manuscript of 1705''|journal=Ars Quatuor Coronatorum|date=2004|volume=117|pages=83–102|url=http://quatuorcoronati.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh Register House MS===

Presumed to be from a lodge of operative masons, this document contains many features of speculative ritual. Hailed as the world's oldest masonic ritual, the '''Edinburgh Register House''' manuscript of 1696 starts with a catechism for proving a person who has the ''word'' is really a mason. Among other things, the person seeking entry is expected to name their lodge as ''Kilwinning'', attributing the origin to [[Lodge Mother Kilwinning]] in Ayrshire. The first lodge is ascribed to the porchway of [[King Solomon's Temple]], and the form of the lodge outlined in a question and answer session, the form of the answers often being highly allegorical. A ''fellow craft'' is further expected to know and explain a masonic embrace called the ''five points of fellowship''. The second half of the document describes all or part of an initiation ritual as the "form of giveing the mason word".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. D. Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemasons Code'', Rider 2009, pp 55-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airlie MS===

The '''Airlie MS''' was discovered in 2000 by Dr Helen Dingwall whilst undertaking unrelated research in Edinburgh Register House (which gave its name to the MS ritual referred to above) in the National Archives of Scotland. Of all the MSS of the Scottish School only the origins of the Airlie MS (1705) are known with certainty. It is named after the family who owned it - the [[Earl of Airlie|Earls of Airlie]]. Because the ownership and therefore the location of the MS is known it is of immense importance in understanding the origins of Freemasonry before the Grand Lodge era (from 1717). The Airlie MS has been analysed and discussed in considerable detail in Ars Quatuor Coronatorum (AQC), Vol.117.&lt;ref name="Airlie" /&gt;

===Trinity College, Dublin===

Other manuscripts from Scotland and Ireland give early ritual that largely confirm the text of the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. They differ mainly in having the giving of the ''Mason Word'' as the first part of the text, followed by the catechism of the first and second degrees in the form of questions and answers. These include the '''Chetwode Crawley''', the '''Kevan''', and the '''Trinity College''' manuscripts. In the Trinity college text the Mason Word is actually written down as "Matchpin", and appears to be part of an early Master Mason's degree.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kevan Manuscript'', [http://www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/Manuscripts/manuscripts/the_kevan_manuscript.htm The Masonic Trowel], retrieved 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Carr, ''600 years of Craft Ritual'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum vol 81, 1961, [http://www.freemasoninformation.com/masonic-education/history/600-years-of-craft-ritual/ Freemason Information], retrieved 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Chetwode Crawley MS, although discovered in Dublin, Ireland, refers in its catechism to the ''[[Lodge Mother Kilwinning|Lodge of Kilwinning]]'', clearly demonstrating that it is of Scottish origin and is therefore part of the Scottish School referred to above.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David Prof. ''The Origins of Freemasonry - Scotland's Century 1590 - 1710'', page 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hughan, ''The Chetwode Crawlwy MS'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol XVII, 1904, pp91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Haughfoot fragment===

Haughfoot was a hamlet, consisting mainly of a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders near the village of Stow.  It was in this unlikely location that a lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners.  The significance of this lodge lies in the fact that none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges.  The minute book of the lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS.  Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the '''Haughfoot fragment''' is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS.  The 'fragment' was probably retained because the minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haughfoot.co.uk/history.htm Haughfoot Lodge, ''History of the Lodge at Haughfoot''], accessed 1 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graham Manuscript===

The ''Graham Manuscript'', of about 1725, gives a version of the third degree legend at variance with that now transmitted to master masons, involving [[Noah]] instead of [[Hiram Abiff]]. The Graham Manuscript appears to have been written in 1726, and obvious scribal errors within it indicate that it was copied from another document. It turned up in Yorkshire during the 1930s, but its exact origin is unknown, Lancashire, Northumberland, and South Scotland all being suggested. The document is headed ''The whole Institution of free Masonry opened and proved by the best of tradition and still some reference to scripture'', There follows an examination, in the form of the sort of question and answer catechism seen in the earlier rituals. In what appears to be the examination of a Master Mason, the responder relates what modern masons would recognise as that part of the legend of [[Hiram Abiff]] dealing with the recovery of his body, but in this instance the body is that of [[Noah]], disinterred by his three sons in the hope of learning some secret, and the mason's word is cryptically derived from his rotting body. Hiram Abiff is mentioned, but only as Solomon's master craftsman, inspired by [[Bezalel]], who performed the same function for [[Moses]]. The tradition of deriving freemasonry from Noah seems to be shared with [[James Anderson (Freemason)|Anderson]] (see [[#Printed Constitutions|Printed Constitutions]] above). Anderson also attributed primitive freemasonry to Noah in his 1738 constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;H. Poole, ''The Graham Manuscript'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 50, 1936, pp 5-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minutes==
The second [[William Schaw#Masonic Statutes|Schaw Statutes]] of December 1599 having made it compulsory for Scottish lodges to have a secretary, early documentation there is rich in comparison with England, where actual minutes start in 1712 in York, and 1723 in London. Records for the [[Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1]] extend back to the sixteenth century. Minutes from the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]], the [[Antient Grand Lodge of England]], and the [[Grand Lodge of All England]] meeting at [[York]] trace the organisational development and rivalries within eighteenth century English Freemasonry.

===Aitchison's Haven===
The oldest minute book discovered is that of Aitchison's Haven, a location just outside [[Musselburgh]], in [[East Lothian]]. The first entry records Robert Widderspone being made Fellow of Craft on 9 January 1598.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/aitchison-lodge.pdf Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] R. E. Wallace-James, The Book of the Lodge of Aitchison's Haven, 1598-1764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minute Books of this Lodge are now the property of the Grand Lodge of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary's Chapel===
The records of the [[Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1]] extend back to 1598, making them an important historical source as the longest continuous masonic record. David Murray Lyon's history of the lodge, published in 1873, mined the records of Edinburgh's oldest lodge, and produced a history of Scottish Freemasonry. The first entry, on 28 December 1598, is a copy of the first Schaw statutes. The next year, on the last day of July, the first proper minute records disciplinary proceedings against a member who employed a cowan, or unqualified mason. The first entries are terse and not always helpful, expanding as successive secretaries became more conscientious. The records trace the development of the lodge from an operative to a speculative society.&lt;ref&gt;David Murray Lyon, History of the Lodge of Edinburgh, Blackwell, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

===York===
The minutes of the old lodge at [[York]], which later called itself the [[Grand Lodge of All England]], give a glimpse of masonry outside the Grand Lodges of the period. The minutes are erratic, with spaces of some years between some entries. It is often impossible to tell if the minutes are lost, were never taken, or the lodge did not meet at all. They do, however, contain the full text of a speech by the antiquary [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] in 1726, in which he discusses the contemplation of geometry, and the instructive lectures which ought to be occurring in lodges. He used the York legend to claim precedence of his own lodge over all others in England, and being a more careful historian than the compilers of the Old Charges, Edwin the son of [[Athelstan]] became [[Edwin of Northumbria]], adding three centuries to his lodge's pedigree. Later minutes show the lodge adding ritual, and developing a five degree system from a single ceremony where a candidate was admitted and made a Fellow Craft in one evening. The York account of the split between the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] and the Lodge of Antiquity provides a balance to the charged prose of [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston]]. The minutes cease for the final time in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Findel, History of Freemasonry, Tr. from second German edition, Asher &amp; Co, London, 1866, pp168-180&lt;/ref&gt;

===London Grand Lodges===
Minutes of both of the Grand Lodges which finally formed the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] are preserved in their archives. Plans by [[Quatuor Coronati Lodge]] to publish them all were interrupted by the First World War, and only one volume was published, covering the minutes of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] from their first minutes in 1723 to 1739. The first of five volumes of Grand Lodge minutes contained three lists of subscribing lodges and their members, dating from 1723, 1725, and 1730. The lodges are first numbered in John Pine's engraved list of 1729. All three manuscript lists have had lodges added after their compilation, but in spite of this they still trace the development of the first Grand Lodge during a critical period in its development, as it moved from being an association of London lodges to a national institution. No further lists were included in the minutes. They start on 24 June 1723 with the approval of Anderson's constitutions, and the resolution that no alteration or innovation in the "Body of Masonry" could occur without the approval of Grand Lodge. The [[Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch|Earl of Dalkeith]] was then elected as the next Grand Master, but his chosen deputy, [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], was only approved by 43 votes to 42. After dinner the outgoing Grand Master, the [[Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton|Duke of Wharton]], asked for a recount. This being refused, he walked out. Many such human touches are revealed in the minutes, together with the beginnings of masonic charities and discipline of masons and lodges. There are no minutes for the year 1813, and only rough notes from the Antients, leaving a gap in the run-up to union that must be spanned from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, Vol 10, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meetings of the [[Antient Grand Lodge of England|Antients]], as they came to be known, are also missing, but these span only a few months instead of the six years of silence from the older institution. On 5 February 1752 [[Laurence Dermott]] became Grand Secretary, and proper minutes ensued. Although these have still to be published, they have been extensively mined by masonic writers, particularly Bywater's biography of Dermott, which draws verbatim from the minutes. Dermott's style is quirky, occasionally obtuse, and often full of dry humour. Discipline is a frequent subject, collecting dues from delinquent lodges, and the "leg of mutton" masons who admitted men to the [[Holy Royal Arch]] for the price of such a meal without the least idea what the actual ritual was, and claimed to teach a masonic technique for becoming invisible.  The conflict between the two Grand Lodges, while obvious from other contemporary sources, is largely absent from both sets of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Masonic documents==
=== Fabric Rolls of York Minster ===
Records of the operative lodge at [[York Minster]] are included in the rolls relating to the 'fabric' (the building material) of the construction, starting with an undated entry from about 1350–1360, and ending in 1639. Written mainly in Latin until the [[Reformation]], they comprise accounts, letters, and other documents relating to the building and maintenance of the church.&lt;ref&gt;James Raine (ed), ''The Fabric Rolls of York Minster'', Surtees Society, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutes of Ratisbon ===
The Statutes de Ratisbon were first formulated on 25 April 1459 as the rules of the German stonemasons, when the masters of the operative lodges met at Ratisbon (now [[Regensburg]]). They elected the master of works of [[Strasbourg]] Cathedral as their perpetual presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fm-europe.org/Documents-Historiques-Maçonniques/Les-Statuts-de-Ratisbonne-1498.html ''Les Statuts de Ratisbonne''. French translation of 1459 document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525173740/http://www.fm-europe.org/Documents-Historiques-Ma%C3%A7onniques/Les-Statuts-de-Ratisbonne-1498.html |date=25 May 2012 }} retrieved 24 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Strasbourg was already recognised as the Haupthütte, or Grand Lodge of German masons. The General Assembly was held again in 1464 and 1469, and the statutes and society were approved by the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] in 1498. The final form of the statutes regulated the activity of master masons (Meister), with an appendix of rules for companions or fellows (Gesellen), and apprentices (Diener).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compagnonnage.info/compagnons-tailleurs-de-pierre/ratisbonne.htm ''Edition of Statutes of Ratisbon with appendices'' (French Translation)] retrieved 23rd June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations were used for over a century as the Strasbourg lodge operated as a court for the settlement of building disputes. This ended in abuse of power, and the Magistrates removed the privilege in 1620. Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681, and its rule over German operative lodges interdicted at the beginning of the 18th century. While there seems little likelihood that the code affected the emergence of German speculative lodges in the 18th century, they may have had some influence on a few of the English "charges".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gallatin Mackey, ''History of Freemasonry'', The Masonic History Company, 1906, vol 3, p 720-721&lt;/ref&gt;

Other German ordinances are found in the [[Cologne]] records (1396-1800), the [[Torgau]] ordinances of 1462, and the Strasbourg Brother-book of 1563. The Cologne guild comprised both stonemasons and carpenters, and was repeatedly referred to as the ''Fraternity of St. John the Baptist''.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Speth, ''Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha'', vol I, part 3, p xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schaw Statutes===
[[William Schaw]] was master of works to King James VI of Scotland, and was also the general warden of all the lodges of Scottish stonemasons. This meant he was in charge of the erection, repair and maintenance of all government buildings, and also the running of what was already a fraternity of masons, who ensured that all building work was undertaken by properly qualified persons, and also provided for their own sick and the widows of their members. Schaw formalised the working of the lodges in two sets of statutes, set down on 28 December 1598 and 1599. Many now see these as the beginnings of modern Freemasonry. Robert Cooper, the archivist and writer, goes so far as to call Schaw the ''Father of Freemasonry''.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Robert L. D. Cooper, ''Cracking the Freemason's Code'', Rider, 2009, pp 18-27 &amp; 207-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schaw Statutes were issued from [[Edinburgh]], where Schaw seems to have met with representatives of lodges from central and eastern Scotland to formulate these regulatory principles. The 1598 Statute enjoined masons to be true to one another, and live charitably together as becomes sworn brothers and companions of the craft. This shows that there was already an oath involved, and invoked the legal definition of a brother as one to whom another was bound by oath. There followed directives as to the regulation of the craft, and provisions for the masters of every lodge to elect a warden to have charge of the lodge every year, and that the choice be approved by the Warden General. An apprentice had to serve seven years before being received into a lodge, and a further seven before becoming a ''fellow in craft'', unless by consent of the masters, deacons and wardens, and after examination. The term ''Entered Apprentice'' is used for an apprentice who has been admitted to the lodge. The document was circulated to every lodge in Scotland, which caused some degree of upset in Kilwinning. [[Lodge Mother Kilwinning|The lodge in Kilwinning]] claimed to be the oldest lodge in Scotland, and was insulted not to have been represented. They sent Archibald Barclay to a further meeting in 1599, from which issued the second Statute, again on 28 December. In an attempt to paper over the crack created by the first meeting, Edinburgh was declared the first and principle lodge, Kilwinning the second and head lodge. Stirling came third. Kilwinning was given charge of the West of Scotland, and charged to examine their masons in "the art of memory", with fines prescribed for failure. What is being remembered is unspecified, but evidently known to all the masons present. Schaw also insisted that each lodge employ a notary, which resulted in the Scottish lodges starting to keep minutes. The document ends by thanking Archibald Barclay, and looking forward to obtaining the King's warrant for the statutes. Kilwinning, far from being appeased, took no further part in the dealings of Schaw's lodges.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

===Kirkwall Scroll===
The '''Kirkwall scroll''' is a floor cloth which contains many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It hangs on the west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in [[Orkney]], but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18&amp;nbsp;ft 6in long and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by a different set of symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the [[Antient Grand Lodge of England]], the [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]] and the [[United Grand Lodge of England]].  Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be [[Eve]], sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Craven, ''Kirkwall Kilwinning Lodge No 38(2) and its Remarkable Scroll'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 10, 1897, pp79-81 (with notes by G. W. Speth)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodge minutes of 27 December 1785 state; - "Bro. William Graeme, visiting brother from Lodge no 128 Ancient Constitution of England was at his own desire admitted to become a member of this Lodge, and he accordingly signed the articles and Rules thereof". Seven months later he donated a floor cloth to the lodge, now generally assumed to be the Kirkwall Scroll.&lt;ref name="Lomas"&gt;''The Kirkwall Scroll'', [http://www.robertlomas.com/Orkney/scroll.html Robert Lomas website], retrieved 1 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Archivist and Masonic historian Robert Cooper has presented evidence arguing that the scroll was made by William Graeme, or under his direction, and he dates it to the latter part of the 18th century on the basis of a detailed analysis of its symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper RLD ''The Rosslyn Hoax?, Viewing Rosslyn Chapel from a new perspective''; Lewis Masonic 2007 {{ISBN|0-85318-281-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper's contribution was in response to claims of mediaeval origin for the scroll. Andrew Sinclair, a leading proponent of Freemasonry's descent from the [[Knights Templar]], hailed it as a great mediaeval treasure, comparable with the [[Mappa Mundi]] in [[Hereford Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sinclair, ''The Secret Scroll'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; His claim arises from what opponents describe as an optimistic reading of radiocarbon dating, and creative interpretation of the panels. The Tabernacle is claimed to be [[King Solomon's Temple]], with the tents removed in Sinclair's reproduction. Sinclair and his supporters also have trouble with lodge 128 of the Antients. It is variously claimed to be in Yorkshire, or Prince Edwin's Lodge in Bury (a Moderns Lodge constituted in 1803). In 1785, 128 was meeting in the Crown and Feathers, Holborn, [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Smith, ''The Not-So-Secret Scroll - Priceless Relic or Floorcloth?'' [http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/historicalfigures/henrysinclair/kirkwallscroll2.htm Orkneyjar], retrieved 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/lane/record.php?ID=554 ''Lanes Masonic Records  1895''], retrieved 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lomas]], a supporter of the early dating, now sees part of the [[Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]] in one of the altar inscriptions and much of the symbolism. This would place the document to the second half of the Eighteenth century in a conventional history of the Rite, but Lomas believes it to be mid-fifteenth, again based on radiocarbon dates, which make the side panels younger than the central strip.&lt;ref name="Lomas" /&gt; Realistically, agreement on the scroll, its context and symbolism is a long way off.

'''''Modern Man in Search of a Soul''''' is a book of psychological essays written  by Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung]].

==Background==
In the years preceding this publication Jung had experienced several dramatic shifts. After the Bugishu Psychological Expedition throughout Africa with [[George Beckwith (Carl Jung associate)|George Beckwith]], Jung returned to [[Zurich]] and focused on the lecture format of his English seminars at the Psychological Club - eventually attracting a new group of international followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title=Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-316-15938-7 |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to expanding his academic following, Jung's professional psychiatric practice also rapidly grew taking on notable patients like [[Mary Foote]] and [[Thornton Wilder]]. During this period in Zurich Jung struck up a friendship with [[Wolfgang Ernst Pauli]].

In the translators' preface Carl F. Baynes provides some background to the material: 
{{Quotation|With one exception, all the essays which make up this volume have been delivered as lectures. The German texts of four of them have been brought out in separate publications and the others are to be found in a volume [Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart] together with several other essays which have already appeared in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |title=Modern Man in Search of a Soul |year=1933 |publisher=Harvest |location=New York |isbn=0-15-661206-2 |page=translators' preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung's various presentations to the Psychological Club in Zurich in this period, notably his 1932 seminar on [[Kundalini]] yoga, have been widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of [[eastern philosophy|Eastern thought]]. Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model for the development of higher consciousness, and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of [[individuation]].&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;Princeton University Press, Book description to C. G. Jung - "The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga", 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The writing covers a broad array of subjects such as [[gnosticism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[Eastern philosophy]] and [[spirituality]] in general.
The first part of the book deals with
[[Dream interpretation#Jung|dream analysis]] in its practical application, the problems and aims of modern [[psychotherapy]], and also his own theory of [[psychological types]]. The middle section addresses Jung's beliefs about the stages of life and [[Archaic man]].  He also contrasts his own theories with those of [[Sigmund Freud]].

In the latter parts of the book Jung discusses 
[[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychology and literature]] and devotes a chapter to basic postulates of [[analytical psychology]].
The last two chapters are devoted to the
spiritual problem of modern man in [[aftermath of World War I]]. He compares it to the flowering of gnosticism in the 2nd century and investigates how psychotherapists are like the [[clergy]].

'''Nikolai Mikhailovich Amosov''', [[Doctor of Science]], [[Professor]] (December 6, 1913, [[Cherepovetsky District|Olkhovo]], [[Novgorod Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] – December 12, 2002, [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref name=Den1882011/&gt;) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] doctor of Russian origin, heart [[surgery|surgeon]], [[inventor]], best-selling [[author]], and exercise enthusiast, known for his inventions of several surgical procedures for treating [[heart defects]].

Born to [[Russians|Russian]] peasants, Nikolai fought in [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. After the war he moved to [[Kiev]] and in 1965 wrote ''[[The Thoughts and the Heart]]'', selling millions of copies. He was the recipient of multiple awards.

In 2008 Amosov was placed second in their ranking of "our greatest [[:wiktionary:compatriot|compatriot]]s" by the viewers of the TV show [[The Greatest Ukrainians]].&lt;ref name=InterTVTGY&gt;[http://inter.ua/en/news/2008/05/19/2949 Yaroslav the Wise - the Greatest Ukrainian of all times], [[Inter (TV channel)|Inter TV]] (19 May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Amosov was born December 6, 1913. in the village Olkhovo (near [[Cherepovets]]) of [[Vologda Governorate]], [[Russia]] to [[Russians|Russian]] peasants.&lt;ref name=Den1882011/&gt; In 1932 he graduated from Cherepovets Mechanical College, followed by 3 years of work as a shift mechanic at the Arkhangelsk electric power station. In 1939 he graduated from the Arkhangelsk Medical Institute,&lt;ref name=Den1882011/&gt; and in 1940 - with distinction from the All-Union Correspondence Industrial Institute. During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] he was at the front as the leading surgeon of a field mobile hospital PPG-2266.&lt;ref name=Den1882011/&gt; From 1947 to 1952 he worked as chief surgeon of the Bryansk region and at that time he began to be widely engaged in thoracic surgery, he conducted extensive scientific work and in 1953 he presented his doctoral dissertation.

In 1952, Amosov, as a prominent specialist in thoracic surgery, was invited to the Kiev Institute of Tuberculosis, to guide specially created clinic of thoracic surgery.&lt;ref name=Den1882011/&gt;

Here particularly fully revealed his many-sided talent of the surgeon and researcher, physiologist, and engineer, has been particularly fruitful scientific, organizational, practical, educational and social activities.

Amosov was one of the initiators of the widespread introduction into our country surgery for diseases of the lungs, has made a lot of new developments in this problem. His research contributed to improving the treatment of diseases of the [[lungs]]. In 1961, Amosov was awarded [[Lenin Prize]] for the work of lung surgery.

In the future, the main focus of Amosov's work was the heart surgery. In 1955 he was the first in Ukraine began treatment for heart diseases surgically, in 1958, one was one of the first in the Soviet Union to introduce into the practice the method of artificial blood circulation (in 1963), Amosov was first in the Soviet Union to perform the mistral valve replacement, and in 1965 for the first time in the world he created and introduced into practice the anti-thrombotic heart valves prosthesis. Amosov elaborated a number of new methods of surgical treatment of heart lesions, the original model of heart-lung machine. His work on the surgical treatment of heart diseases won a State Prize of Ukraine (1988) gold medals (1967, 1982) and Silver Medal (1978) of the Exhibition of Economic Achievements of the USSR.

The clinic established by Amosov, produced about 7000 lung resections, more than 95000 operations for heart diseases, including about 36,000 operations with extra-corporeal blood circulation.

In 1983 Amosov's cardiac surgery clinic was reorganized in Kiev Research Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery and in the Ukrainian Republican cardiovascular surgical center. Each year, the institute fulfilled about 3000 heart operations, including over 1500 - with extra-corporeal blood circulation. Amosov was the first director of the Institute, and since 1988 - Honorary Director of the Institute.

In 1955, Amosov created and headed the first in the USSR Chair of Thoracic Surgery for the postgraduate studies and later the Chair of Anesthesiology. These Chairs have prepared more than 700 specialists for Ukraine and other republics.

Along with surgery Amosov paid much attention to contemporary problems of biological, medical and psychological cybernetics. From 1959 to 1990 he headed the Department of Biological Cybernetics in the Institute of Cybernetics. Under the leadership of Amosov fundamental studies of the self-regulation of the heart systems were conducted and the issues of machine diagnosis of heart disease were studied, elaboration and creation of physiological models of "internal environment", computer modeling of basic mental functions, and some socio-psychological mechanisms of human behavior were done. Innovative approach, the original views of Amosov were widely recognized in our country and abroad. For his research in the field of Bio-cybernetics in 1978 and 1997 he was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine.

In the [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|1989 Soviet Union legislative election]] he was elected into the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] as an independent candidate in [[Kiev]] (he had declared his support for [[People's Movement of Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iPCPxwubpYUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Mykola+Amosov&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sa8nUYKTDMq80QWV6IH4CA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mykola%20Amosov&amp;f=false The Ukrainian Resurgence] by [[Bohdan Nahaylo]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 1999, {{ISBN|0802079776}} (page 184)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shlapentokh/&gt; Amosov believed that the [[Western society]] should serve as an ideal for the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name=Shlapentokh&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VFqqE5995UC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Nikolai+Amosov&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X7InUc3ME8rL0QXK7IHoCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nikolai%20Amosov&amp;f=false Soviet Intellectuals and Political Power: The Post-Stalin Era] by [[Vladimir Shlapentokh]], [[Princeton University Press]], 1990, {{ISBN|0691094594}} (page 262)&lt;/ref&gt;

Amosov is the author of more than 400 scientific publications including 19 monographs. Some monographs reprinted in the U.S., Japan, Germany and Bulgaria.

40 doctoral degrees and over 150 PhD's of sciences were presented in his Institute, many of them are chiefs of major scientific centers in [[Ukrainian SSR]] and other republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. It is noteworthy that under the leadership of Amosov, one of his disciples [[Victor Skumin]] discovered a previously unknown disease. Now it is called [[:fr:Syndrome de Skumin|Skumin syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0218492313493427 Andrea Ruzza.

N. Amosov was a member of the Presidium of the Board of the Ukrainian Society of surgeons and cardiologists, the International Association of surgeons and cardiologists, the International Association of Surgeons and the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgeons, International Society for Medical Cybernetics, Scientific Council on Cybernetics of Ukraine, member of the editorial boards of a number of domestic and foreign journals.

His scientific work Amosov combined with a great social activity, was a member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] five times.

Amosov is widely known as a writer. His novels and essays "The Thoughts and the Heart", "Notes from the Future", "PPG-2266. Field Surgeon Notes", "The Book of Happiness and Miseries", "Voices of the Times", "Artificial Intelligence", "My Health System" have been repeatedly published in Ukraine and abroad.

[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], identified the Other as one of the conceptual bases of [[intersubjectivity]], of the relations among people.]]

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the terms '''the Other''' and '''the Constitutive Other''' identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the [[self-image]] of a person; as their acknowledgement of [[Reality|being real]]; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Other", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, (1999) p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutive Other is the relation between the [[personality]] (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; it is the relation of [[Essentialism|essential]] and superficial characteristics of [[personal identity]] that corresponds to the relationship between opposite but correlative characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hegel, G.

The condition and quality of '''Otherness''', the characteristics of the Other, is the state of being different from and alien to the [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] of a person and to the [[identity (philosophy)|identity of the Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miller, J.|url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/research/n304.xml|title=Otherness|website=The SAGE encyclopedia of qualitative research methods.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=588–591|doi=10.4135/9781412963909.n304|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[discourse]] of philosophy, the term Otherness identifies and refers to the characteristics of ''Who?'' and ''What?'' of the Other, which are distinct and separate from [[the Symbolic]] order of things; from [[the Real]] (the authentic and unchangeable); from the [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] ([[art]], [[beauty]], [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]); from [[political philosophy]]; from [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s and [[identity (social science)|social identity]]; and from the [[Self]]. Therefore, the condition of Otherness is a person's non-conformity to and with the social norms of society; and Otherness is the condition of [[disenfranchisement]] (political exclusion), effected either by the [[State (polity)|State]] or by the social institutions (e.g. the [[profession]]s) invested with the corresponding socio-political [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Therefore, the imposition of Otherness [[Social alienation|alienates]] the labelled person from the centre of society, and places him or her at the margins of society, for being the Other.&lt;ref&gt;"Otherness", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Othering''' describes the reductive action of labeling a person as someone who belongs to a subordinate social category defined as the Other. The practice of Othering is the exclusion of persons who do not fit the norm of the [[social group]], which is a version of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;"Othering", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[human geography]], to ''other'' an individual identifies and excludes them from the social group, placing them at the margins of society where social norms do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===European philosophy===
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel introduced the concept of the Other as constituent part of human preoccupation with the Self.]]
[[File:Emmanuel Levinas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ethical philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas associated the concept of the Other with the ethical systems proposed in scripture and tradition.]]
The concept of the [[Self]] requires the existence of '''the Other''' as the counterpart entity required for '''defining the Self'''; in the late 18th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of [[self-consciousness]] (preoccupation with the Self),&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 1, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; which complements the propositions about [[self-awareness]] (capacity for introspection) proffered by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 8, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807)

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as a basis for [[intersubjectivity]], the psychological relations among people. In ''[[Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology]]'' (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an ''alter ego'', as an other self. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

In ''[[Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]]'' (1943), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person's life, and not as a radical threat to the [[existence]] of the Self. In that mode, in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel's dialectic of the "[[Master–slave dialectic|Lord and Bondsman]]" (''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'') and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society's treatment and mistreatment of women.

===European psychology===
The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) and the ethical philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with [[The Symbolic|the symbolic order]] of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of [[scripture]] and [[tradition]]; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter (wherein a person is responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysical pure-presence]]. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of [[alterity]]) personified in a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas's analysis of the distinction between "[[the saying and the said]]"; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of [[ethics]] over [[metaphysics]].

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. [[R. D. Laing]]), the Other identifies and refers to [[The unconscious|the unconscious mind]], to [[silence]], to [[insanity]], and to language ("to what is referred and to what is unsaid").&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999 )p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to [[relativism]] if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of [[truth]]. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce [[Ontology|ontological divisions]] of reality: of [[being]], of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and of [[existence]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

===Levinas on ethics===
In ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority]]'' (1961), Emmanuel Levinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the Other person to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute ''[[alterity]]''—the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over ontology in real life.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

From that perspective, Levinas described the nature of the Other as "insomnia and wakefulness"; an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, their Otherness remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

{{quotation|The others that obsess me in the Other do not affect me as examples of the same [[genus]] united with my neighbor, by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block ... The others concern me from the first. Here, fraternity precedes the commonness of a genus. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others. |''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'' (1974), p. 159.&lt;ref&gt;Levinas, Emmanuel. ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===More recent critical theory===
Derrida proposed that the absolute ''[[alterity]]'' of the Other is compromised because the Other is ''other than'' the Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences in the realm of human geography when the Other person is denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse ([[Oriental Studies]]) about Western encounters with non–Western cultures preserves the dominantor–dominated discourse of [[hegemony]], just as misrepresenting the feminine as Other reasserts [[male privilege]] as primary in social discourse.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), the geographer [[Derek Gregory]] said that the responses of U.S. President George W. Bush (2001–2009) to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 reinforced philosophic divisions of connotation and denotation that perpetuated the negative representation of the non-Western Other, when he rhetorically asked the U.S. populace ''Why do they hate us?'' as political prelude to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's rhetorical question led the U.S. populace to make an artificial, Us-and-Them division in the relations between the U.S. and the countries and cultures of the Middle East, which artifice is a basic factor of the perpetual war on [[terrorism]], and is a step away from eradicating the imaginary representations of the Self and the Other created with the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] geographies produced by [[Oriental Studies]]; about which the cultural critic [[Edward Saïd]] said that:

{{quotation|To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and natural—our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.|''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, world system of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]], nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European imperial system of [[Colonialism|colonies]] (settler and economic) in which "the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] and [[Hierarchy|subordination]]."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R.J., ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 4th Edition Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires "provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony]."&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, James L. ''The Modern Middle East: A History'', 2nd ed. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
The imperial conquest of "non-white" countries was intellectually justified with the [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of the Eastern world, which was effected with cultural generalizations that divided the peoples of the world into the artificial, binary relationship of "The Eastern World and The Western World", the dichotomy which identified, designated, and subordinated the peoples of the Orient as the Other—as the non–European Self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 27 January 2016|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of fetishization of people and things is a function of [[Orientalism]], which the colonialist ideologue realises with three actions: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are the same folk); (ii) Feminization (Oriental people are the lessers in the East–West binary relationship); and (iii) Essentialization (a people reduced to the artificial essence of universal, innate characteristics); thus, the praxis of Othering reduced to cultural inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, which then justified colonialism by establishing the West as the superior standard of culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Patheon Books|year = 1978|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific racism of the Other: In the late-19th century, H. Strickland Constable justified anti-Irish racism among white people by claiming similarity between the cranial features of "the Irish-Iberian" man (left) and "the Negro" man (right), as proof that each man is racially inferior to the Anglo-Teutonic man (centre) possessed of the cranial ideal.]]

The practice of Othering was the prevalent cultural perspective of the European imperial powers, which was supported by the fabrications of [[scientific racism]], such as the pseudo-intellectual belief that the size of the cranium of the non–European Other was indicative of the inferior intelligence of the coloured peoples designated as the non-white Other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the United Nations officially declared that the differences among the races were insignificant in relation to the anthropological sameness among the peoples who are the human race. Despite the facts, in the U.S., the artificial distinctions against the Other remain, especially in government forms that ask a U.S. citizen to identify and place him or herself into a racial category, as in the questionnaires of the census bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In practice of Othering, immigrants and refugees  are seen as "illegal immigrants" (from overseas) and "illegal aliens" (from Mexico).

===The subaltern native===
Maintaining an empire requires the [[Cultural imperialism|cultural subordination]] of the Other into the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]] (the colonized people), which facilitates the exploitation of their labour, of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country as a colony of the motherland. To realise those ends, the process of Othering culturally justifies the domination and subordination of the native people, by placing them (as the Other) at the social periphery of the geopolitical enterprise that is colonial imperialism. The colonizer creates the Other with a false dichotomy of "native weakness" (social and political, cultural and economic) against the "colonial strength" of imperial [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be resolved only with the ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' of racialism—the "moral responsibility" that psychologically authorizes the colonialist Self to unilaterally assume a [[civilizing mission]] to educate, convert, and culturally assimilate the Other into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the praxis of [[colonialism]], the native populace constitute the Other whom the colonizers mean to dominate in order to civilise and save them in the course of exploiting the natural and human resources of the natives' homeland.&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"&gt;Mountz, A. (n.d.). ''The Other''. Key Concepts in Political Geography, pp. 328–338. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a colony is a way to dominate and dispose of two groups of people (colonists and colonised) who can be used to define the Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiwash.metronews.ca/other/703349669-703223196|title=WikiWash|website=wikiwash.metronews.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Othering establishes the unequal relationship between the native people and the colonizers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they reduced to inhuman inferiority, as "the Other".&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"&gt;Colonialism. (n.d.). Dictionary of Human Geography, pp. 94–98. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehumanisation of colonialism—the colonist "Self" against the colonised "Other"—is maintained with the false binary-relations of [[Class (social)|social class]] and [[race (human categorization)|race]], of [[sex]] and [[gender]], and of [[nation]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"/&gt; The proper, profitable functioning of a colony features continual protection of such cultural demarcations, which establish and enforce the socio-economic binary relation between "civilized man" (the colonist) and "savage man" (the colonial subaltern).&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"/&gt;

==Sex and gender==
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir applied the concept of The Other to the man–woman binary relation, in critical of the dominator–dominated relation, which historically characterised sexual inequality.]]

The existential philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]'s conception of "the Other" (as a constituent part of [[Self-awareness|self-consciousness]]) to describe a male-dominated culture that represents Woman as the sexual Other in relation to Man. In the cultural context of the Man–Woman binary relation, the sexual Other is a [[minority (philosophy)|minority]], the least-favoured social group, usually the women of the community, because "a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] ''Man'' to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] ''Woman'' represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity" from the first sex, from Man.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949)

In 1957, [[Betty Friedan]] substantiated the ordinate–subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation as social identity. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed, at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves as their roles (wife, mother, manager) in the private sphere. They did not identify their own achievements (career, job, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had conventionally automatically identified themselves as the social Other. Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society's social constructs ([[social class]], [[sex]], [[gender]]), as a human organisation, society holds the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] (social and political) to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and ''Woman'', the non-male Other.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963)

The [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Cheshire Calhoun]] deconstructed the concept of "the Other" as the female-half of the binary-gender relation of the "Man and Woman" concept. [[Deconstruction]] of the word ''Woman''—from subordinate in the "Man ''and'' Woman" relation—conceptually [[Reconstructivism|reconstructed]] the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition ([[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]); independent of the patriarchy who formally realise female subordination with binary-gender usages of the word ''Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarojinisahoo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), Prof. Sarojini Sahoo said that despite equality with men, women possess a discrete identity that is independent of the male definition of ''woman''.]]
In the essay "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), the academic [[Sarojini Sahoo]], agrees with De Beauvoir's proposition that women can be free of social subordination by "thinking, taking action, working, creating, on the same terms as men; instead of seeking to disparage them, she declares herself their equal." Yet counters De Beauvoir that despite having the same human-being status as men, women have a unique sexual [[Gender identity|identity]] different from men. In feminist definition, Women are the Other (but not the Hegelian Other) and are not existentially defined by the demands of Man. Women are the social Other who unknowingly accept subjugation as part of [[subjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com|title=Sense &amp; Sensuality|website=sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the identity of woman is constitutionally different from the identity of man, as human beings, men and women are equal. Hence, the harm of Othering arises from the asymmetric nature of sex and gender roles, which arises accidentally and "passively" from natural and unavoidable [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jemmer, Patrick. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YlN_kz8th4cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Sarojini+Sahoo&amp;ots=EFtjSxyA3q&amp;sig=qa7R The O(the)r (O)the(r)], Engage Newcastle Volume 1 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}) August 2010, Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social-exclusion function of Othering a person or a social group from society, for being different from the norm (of the Self), is understood in the socio-economic functions of gender (a [[social construct]]) and sex (biological reality). In a society where heterosexuality is the social norm, "the Other" refers to and identifies the same-sex orientation, lesbians (women who love women) and gays (men who love men), people identified as "deviant" from the binary socio-sexual norm.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt; Negative usages of "the Other" are applied to the lesbian and gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities to diminish their social status and political power by social Othering to the margins of society. To neutralise Othering, LGBT communities ''queer'' a city, create social spaces, that use the city's spatial and temporal plans to allow the LGBT community free expression of [[social identity]] (i.e. a gay-pride parade); as such, ''queering'' is a political means for the sexual Other to establish their [[reality]] as part of the urban body politic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge==

===Representations===
Regarding the production of [[knowledge]] about the Other, Michel Foucault and the [[Frankfurt School]] identified the process of '''Othering''' as everything to do with the creation and maintenance of imaginary representations—"knowledge of the Other"—in service to geopolitical [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]. The [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of the Other (metaphoric, metonymic, anthropomorphic) are manifestations of the Western cultural attitudes inherent to the European historiographies of the non–European peoples labelled as "the Other". Using analytical discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) the [[dominant ideology]] of the colonialist culture explains the Eastern world to the Western world, using the binary relationship of the European Self confronting the non–European Other from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th-century [[Historiography|historiographies]] of the [[Orient]] as a place, European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studied only what they argued was the [[high culture]]—the languages and literatures, the arts and philologies—of the Middle East as a cultural region, rather than as a geopolitical place inhabited by different peoples and societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; About such cultural misrepresentation, Saïd said that "the Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was, itself, a product of certain political forces and activities. Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilisations, peoples, and localities. Its objective discoveries—the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced positivistically verifiable learning—are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language, and, what is the truth of language?, Nietzsche once said, but":

{{quotation| A mobile army of [[metaphor]]s, [[metonym]]s, and [[anthropomorphism]]s—in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which, after long use, seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.|''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;ref name=Said&gt;Saïd, Edward W. ''Orientalism'', 25th Anniversary Ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202}}}}

Saïd concludes that Nietzsche's perspective might be too [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], but that it draws attention to the fact that, in so far as "the Orient" occurred in the [[Existentialism|existential]] awareness of the Western world, the Orient was a word that later accrued to it a wide field of meanings, associations, and connotations, which did not refer to the real Eastern world, but to the field of study surrounding "the Orient" as a word.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy===
In the Eastern world, the field of [[Occidentalism]], the investigation programme and academic curriculum of and about [[Essentialism|the essence]] of [[Western world|The West]]—i.e. geographic Europe as a culturally homogenous place—did not exist as a counterpart to Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Steven R. "The Historiography of the Modern Middle East: Transforming a Field of Study",  ''Middle East Historiographies: Narrating the Twentieth Century'', Israel Gershoni, Amy Singer, Y. Hakam Erdem, Eds. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006. pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Orientalist practices of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical negationism]], the writing of distorted history about the places and peoples of "The East" continue in the [[postmodern]] era, especially in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice intra-national Othering with fabricated "facts", such as threat-reports about non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to aggravate the character faults of the opponent political parties, which usually are composed of people from the social and ethnic groups identified and designated as the Other in that society.&lt;ref&gt;Sehgal, Meera. "Manufacturing a Feminized Siege Mentality." ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' '''36''' (2) (2007): p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of Othering a person or a social group, by means of an ideal [[ethnocentricity]] (belief that one's ethnic group is the superior group), and the cultural tendency to evaluate and assign [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] to Other ethnicities, which are negatively measured against the ideal standard of the Self—is realised through mundane methods of investigation, such as [[cartography]].&lt;ref name=Fellman&gt;Fellmann, Jerome D., et al. ''Human Geography: Landscapes of Human Activities'', 10th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

Historically, the drawing of maps emphasised and bolstered specific lands and the associated national-identities, the natural resources and cultures of the native inhabitants. In early cartography, the distortion (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of actual places and true distances established the Western cartographer's [[Geopolitics|homeland]] as the centre of the ''mapamundi''; thus British cartographers centred Britain in their maps, and drew the British islands proportionally larger than the true geography might allow. In contemporary cartography, polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by American cartographers, distort real geographic spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia, to emphasise American superiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) and the inferiority of the Russian Other.&lt;ref name=Fellman/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Practical perspectives===
In ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and term within the field of phenomenology; when used as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; when used as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, "the colonizing powers narrated an 'Other' whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize ... [in order to] extract resources through colonization" of the homeland of the people labelled as the Other.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"&gt;Gallagher, Carolyn, Dahlman, Carl T, Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz, Alison, Shirlow, Peter. ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As facilitated by [[Orientalism|Orientalist representations]] of the non–Western Other, [[Colonialism|colonisation]]—the economic exploitation of a people and their land—is misrepresented as being for the material, spiritual, and cultural benefit of the colonised peoples.

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, post-modern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] progress for Man and society. Public knowledge of the [[social identity]] of peoples [[Social class|classified]] as "Outsiders" is ''de facto'' acknowledgement of their being [[reality|real]], and so they are part of the [[body politic]], especially in the cities. As such, "the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] that moves sites once conceived of as 'marginal' to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis" of the [[Intersubjectivity|human relations]] between the Outsiders and the Establishment.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt;

The word [[probability]] has been used in a variety of ways since it was first applied to the mathematical study of [[games of chance]].  Does probability measure the real, physical tendency of something to occur or is it a measure of how strongly one believes it will occur, or does it draw on both these elements?  In answering such questions, mathematicians interpret the probability values of [[probability theory]].

There are two broad categories&lt;ref name=SEPIP&gt;{{Citation

"There are several schools of thought regarding the interpretation of probabilities, none of them without flaws, internal contradictions, or paradoxes." (p 1129) 
"There are no standard classifications of probability interpretations, and even the more popular ones may suffer subtle variations from text to text." (p 1130) 
The classification in this article is representative, as are the authors and ideas claimed for each classification.&lt;/ref&gt; of '''probability interpretations''' which can be called "physical" and "evidential" probabilities.  Physical probabilities, which are also called objective or [[frequency probability|frequency probabilities]], are associated with random physical systems such as roulette wheels, rolling dice and radioactive atoms.  In such systems, a given type of event (such as a die yielding a six) tends to occur at a persistent rate, or "relative frequency", in a long run of trials.  Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies. The two main kinds of theory of physical probability are [[frequency probability|frequentist]] accounts (such as those of Venn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Logic of Chance |last= Venn |first= John |authorlink= John Venn |year= 1876 |publisher= MacMillan |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=es0AAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reichenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The theory of probability, an inquiry into the logical and mathematical foundations of the calculus of probability |last= Reichenbach |first= Hans |authorlink= Hans Reichenbach |year= 1948 |publisher= University of California Press}}  English translation of the original 1935 German.

Evidential probability, also called [[Bayesian probability]], can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence.  On most accounts, evidential probabilities are considered to be degrees of belief, defined in terms of dispositions to gamble at certain odds.  The four main evidential interpretations are the classical (e.g. Laplace's)&lt;ref name=LaPlace /&gt; interpretation, the subjective interpretation (de Finetti&lt;ref name=deF&gt;{{cite book |last1= de Finetti |first1= Bruno |authorlink1= Bruno de Finetti |editor1-first= H.

There are also evidential interpretations of probability covering groups, which are often labelled as 'intersubjective' (proposed by [[Donald A. Gillies|Gillies]]&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillies | first = Donald |authorlink= Donald A.

Some interpretations of probability are associated with approaches to [[statistical inference]], including theories of [[estimation theory|estimation]] and [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]].  The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of "frequentist" statistical methods, such as [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]]. Statisticians of the opposing [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] school typically accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics.  This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.

The terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word "frequentist" is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, "[[frequentist probability]]" is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view "frequentist statistics" as an approach to statistical inference that recognises only physical probabilities.  Also the word "objective", as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what "physical" means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.

{{quote|It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis.|(Savage, 1954, p 2)&lt;ref name=savage /&gt;}}

==Philosophy==
The '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.
[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics.  It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bskyrms/bio/readings/pascal_fermat.pdf Fermat and Pascal on Probability] (@ socsci.uci.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century.  In axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence within the [[philosophy of mathematics]] as are shared by other mathematical statements.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, ''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/colloquium/2001/October/Szabo/angol011008/angol011008.html A Physicalist Interpretation of Probability]'' (Talk presented on the Philosophy of Science Seminar, Eötvös, Budapest, 8 October 2001.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo E. Szabo, Objective probability-like things with and without  objective indeterminism, Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 38 (2007) 626–634 (''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/leszabo/Preprints/lesz_no_probability_preprint.pdf Preprint]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical analysis originated in observations of the behaviour of game equipment such as [[playing card]]s and [[dice]], which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of [[Principle of indifference|indifference]].  This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that "''it will probably rain''", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence.  Likewise, when it is written that "the most probable explanation" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] "is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.

[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.

Though probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from [[evidence-based medicine]], through [[Six sigma]], all the way to the [[Probabilistically checkable proof]] and the [[String theory landscape]].

==Classical definition==
{{Main|Classical definition of probability}}
The first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is now known as the '''classical definition'''. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling [[dice]]) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely.&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.1)

{{Quotation|The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.|Pierre-Simon Laplace|A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities&lt;ref name=LaPlace&gt;Laplace, P. S., 1814, English edition 1951, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities, New York: Dover Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{clear}}
[[Image:Dice.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The classical definition of probability works well for situations with only a finite number of equally-likely outcomes.]]
This can be represented mathematically as follows:
If a random experiment can result in N mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes and if N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of these outcomes result in the occurrence of the event A, the '''probability of A''' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;P(A) = {N_A \over N} &lt;/math&gt;.

There are two clear limitations to the classical definition.&lt;ref name="Spanos"&gt;{{cite book | last = Spanos | first = Aris | title = Statistical foundations of econometric modelling | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 978-0521269124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, it is applicable only to situations in which there is only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a [[coin]] until it rises heads, give rise to an [[Infinity|infinite]] set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.

==Frequentism==
[[Image:Roulette wheel.jpg|left|200px|thumb|For frequentists, the probability of the ball landing in any pocket can be determined only by repeated trials in which the observed result converges to the underlying probability ''in the long run''.]]
{{Main|Frequency probability}}
Frequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as [[aleatory]] probability.  The events are assumed to be governed by some [[randomness|random]] physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see [[determinism]]); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing [[dice]] or spinning a [[roulette]] wheel; an example of the second kind is [[radioactive decay]]. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.

If we denote by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n_a&lt;/math&gt; the number of occurrences of an event &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; trials, then if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to +\infty}{n_a \over n}=p &lt;/math&gt;  we say that ''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(\mathcal{A})=p&lt;/math&gt;.

The frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example “[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf What is the Chance of an Earthquake?]” &lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David and Philip B. Stark (2003)"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?" Earthquake Science and Seismic Risk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjectivism==
[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gambling]] odds reflect the average bettor's 'degree of belief' in the outcome.]]
{{Main|Bayesian probability}}
Subjectivists, also known as '''Bayesians''' or followers of '''epistemic probability''', give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. [[Epistemic]] or subjective probability is sometimes called '''[[Credence (statistics)|credence]]''', as opposed to the term '''chance''' for a propensity probability.

Some examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true, and to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented.

Gambling odds don't reflect the bookies' belief in a likely winner, so much as the other bettors' belief, because the bettors are actually betting against one another.  The odds are set based on how many people have bet on a possible winner, so that even if the high odds players always win, the bookies will always make their percentages anyway.

The use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid [[theory of justification|justifications]] of [[belief]].

Bayesians point to the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]]&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 182) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]]&lt;ref name=deF /&gt; (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the [[laws of probability]] if they are to be [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaynes | first = E. T. | title = Probability theory the logic of science | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0521592710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence casts doubt that humans will have coherent beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kahneman | first = Daniel | title = Thinking, fast and slow | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0374275631 }}  The book contains numerous examples of the difference between idealized and actual thought.  "[W]hen called upon to judge probability, people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability." (p 98)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = William M. | last2 = Meehl | first2 = Paul E. | title = Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal (mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: The clinical-statistical controversy | journal = Psychology, Public Policy, and Law | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–332 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1037/1076-8971.2.2.293 | url = http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030214359/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/167GroveMeehlClinstix.pdf | archivedate = 30 October 2011 | df = dmy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.592 }}  Statistical decisions are consistently superior to the subjective decisions of experts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Bayesian probability involves specifying a [[prior probability]]. This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} associated with an [[urn model]] or a [[thought experiment]].  The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the [[reference class problem]].
The "[[sunrise problem]]" provides an example.

==Propensity==
{{Main|Propensity probability}}

Propensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Martin | title = An introduction to decision theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2009 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0521716543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.

Propensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies.  Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see "single case possible" in the table above).&lt;ref name="de Elía" /&gt; In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the [[law of large numbers]] to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies.  This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss.  This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant ''single-case'' probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a particular [[atom]] at a particular time.

The main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means.  (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.)  At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.

A propensity theory of probability was given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Miller|first=Richard W.| authorlink6=Richard W.

Peirce, however.&lt;ref name="Miller 1975 123–132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haack 1977 63–104"/&gt; Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of "generating conditions".  When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions.  To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity ''p'' of producing the outcome ''E'' means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which ''E'' occurred with limiting relative frequency ''p''.  For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.

A number of other philosophers, including [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] and [[Donald A. Gillies]], have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper's.

Other propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ronald N. Giere]] |title=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |chapter=Objective Single Case Probabilities and the Foundations of Statistics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0049237X |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X09703805 |volume=73 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-444-10491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science.  They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as [[electrical charge]] cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges).  In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.

What roles does physical probability play in science?  What are its properties?  One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value.  David Lewis called this the ''Principal Principle'',&lt;ref name=SEPIP /&gt; (3.3 &amp; 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed.  What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise?  According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.

==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==
{{Main|Probabilistic logic}}

It is widely recognized that the term "probability" is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness.  Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was '''probably''' caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth.  Statements such as "Hypothesis H is probably true" have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) [[empirical evidence]] (E, say) supports H to a high degree.  This degree of support of H by E has been called the '''logical''' probability of H given E, or the '''epistemic probability''' of H given E, or the '''inductive probability''' of H given E.

The differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief.  Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' [[A Treatise on Probability|Treatise on Probability]]&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief.  They are degrees of (partial) [[entailment]], or degrees of [[logical consequence]], not degrees of [[belief]].  (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.)  [[Frank P. Ramsey]], on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is "the logic of partial belief".&lt;ref name=ramsey /&gt; (p 157)  In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply ''are'' degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely ''constrain'' degrees of rational belief.

Another point of disagreement concerns the ''uniqueness'' of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge.  [[Rudolf Carnap]] held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence.  Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value.  Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.

==Prediction==
{{Main|Predictive inference}}
An alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of ''prediction'' – predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century,&lt;ref name="geisser"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC Predictive Inference: An Introduction]'', [[Seymour Geisser]], [[CRC Press]], 1993 {{isbn|0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in [[celestial mechanics]].

The modern predictive approach was pioneered by [[Bruno de Finetti]], with the central idea of [[exchangeability]] – that future observations should behave like past observations.&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti's book,&lt;ref name="geisser" /&gt; and has
since been propounded by such statisticians as [[Seymour Geisser]].

==Axiomatic probability==
The mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on [[probability theory]] and [[probability axioms]] for a detailed treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6433">'''Quasi-realism''' is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:
# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s do not express [[proposition]]s.
# Instead, ethical sentences [[projectivism|project]] emotional attitudes as though they were [[Philosophical realism|real]] properties.

This makes quasi-realism a form of [[non-cognitivism]] or [[expressivism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/projectivism-quasi-realism.html Moral Anti-Realism &gt; Projectivism and quasi-realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-realism stands in opposition to other forms of non-cognitivism (such as [[emotivism]] and [[universal prescriptivism]]), as well as to all forms of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] (including both [[moral realism]] and [[ethical subjectivism]]).

==Overview==
[[Simon Blackburn]] derived quasi-realism&lt;ref name="Ruling Passions 1998"&gt;Ruling Passions (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-824785-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[David Hume|Humean]] account of the origin of our moral opinions, adapting Hume's genealogical account in the light of [[evolutionary]] [[game theory]].   To support his case, Blackburn has issued a challenge, ''Blackburn's Challenge'',&lt;ref&gt;Essays in Quasi-Realism (1993). {{ISBN|0-19-508041-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to anyone who can explain how two situations can demand different ethical responses without referring to a difference in the situations themselves. Because this challenge is effectively unmeetable, Blackburn argues that there must be a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] component in our notions of ethics.

However, argues Blackburn, ethics cannot be entirely realist either, for this would not allow for phenomena such as the gradual development of ethical positions over time.  In his 1998 book, ''Ruling Passions'', Blackburn likens ethics to [[Neurath's boat]], which can be changed plank by plank over time, but cannot be refitted all at once for risk of sinking.  Similarly, Blackburn's theory can explain the existence of rival ethical theories, for example as a result of differing cultural traditions - his theory allows both to be legitimate, despite their mutual contradictions, without dismissing both views through [[relativism]].  Thus, Blackburn's theory of quasi-realism provides a coherent account of [[value pluralism|ethical pluralism]].  It also answers [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]]'s concerns, presented in his [[argument from queerness]], about the apparently [[contradiction|contradictory]] nature of [[ethics]].

Quasi-realism, a meta-ethical approach, enables ethics based on actions, virtues and consequences to be reconciled. Attempts have been made to derive from it a comprehensive theory of ethics, such as [[Iain King]]'s quasi-utilitarianism in his book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;King, Iain (2008). ''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong''. Continuum, p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Criticisms ==
Despite gaining some of the better qualities of the component theories from which it is derived, quasi-realism also picks up vulnerabilities from these different components, too.  Thus, it is criticised in some of the ways that [[moral realism]] is criticised, for example by [[Fictionalism]] (see below); it is also attacked along with [[expressivism]] and other [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive]] theories (indeed it has been regarded by some as a sub-category of [[expressivism]]).

===Fictionalism===
It has been claimed that Blackburn's programme is [[fictionalism|fictionalist]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, by David Lewis, as cited in a 2006 edition of [[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]], accessible [http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/4/315.extract here]&lt;/ref&gt; which he himself disputes. However, there are certainly continuities between both approaches. Blackburn argues that [[fictionalism|moral fictionalism]] is tantamount to us claiming to hold attitudes that we do not really have; that we are in some way insincere. In support of his argument, Blackburn invokes [[John Locke|Locke's]] theory of colour, which defines colours as dispositional (that is, in the eye of the beholder) but in some way reliant upon facts about the world.  Blackburn buttresses these arguments by further examples of quasi-realism in our understanding of the world beyond ethics.&lt;ref name="Truth 2005"&gt;Truth: A Guide (2005) {{ISBN|0-19-516824-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that, though the [[fictionalism|moral fictionalist]] is in some ways having cake and eating it, the quasi-realist has a seemingly even more difficult position to defend. They may feel secure in disagreeing with [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] that talk of [[natural rights]] is "nonsense upon stilts" but they would also argue that such rights could not be said to exist in a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] sense. Quasi-realism captures in some important ways the structure of our ethical experience of the world and why we can assert claims such as "It is wrong to be cruel to children" as if they were facts even though they do not share the properties of facts; namely the inference of independent [[truth-value]]s.

From this position, Blackburn's "way forward" is to re-assert Hume's 'common point of view', or the ethical discourse common to mankind. Blackburn's thought is that though relativists and realists can agree that certain statements are true within a certain discourse, a quasi-realist investigates why such discourses have the structures that they do.&lt;ref name="Truth 2005"/&gt;

=== Frege–Geach problem ===
The coherence of Blackburn's quasi-realism has been challenged most notably by the [[Expressivism|Frege–Geach]] problem, which assert Blackburn's position is self-contradictory.  Advocates of Blackburn's view, however, would contend that quasi-realism in fact provides an antidote to the Frege–Geach problem by placing different moral claims in context. There is an important difference, claim the quasi-realists, between saying ''It is wrong to tell lies'', and ''It is wrong to get your brother to tell lies''.&lt;ref name="Ruling Passions 1998"/&gt; Indeed, say the quasi-realists, the Frege–Geach argument exposes the insensitivity of some [[moral realist]] discourse to the complexity of ethical statements.

'''''Questions of Truth''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] and Nicholas Beale which offers their responses to 51 questions about science and religion. The foreword is contributed by [[Antony Hewish]].

The book was launched at a workshop at the 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Annual Meeting in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml AAAS Annual Meeting 2009 Workshop Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304021809/http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2009/program/schedule/workshops/workshops.shtml |date=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the UK at a discussion at the [[Royal Society]] chaired by [[Onora O'Neill]], in a week when it was also featured on the [[Today Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7918000/7918145.stm Interview with] [[John Polkinghorne]] by [[John Humphrys]] [[BBC]] [[Today Programme]] 2-Mar-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key themes and ideas==
[[File:AAAS Launch workshop1 m.JPG|thumb|upright|Launch at 2009 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Annual Conference with President [[James J. McCarthy]] (standing) and authors]]
The book grew out of questions generated at a website organized to communicate Polkinghorne's ideas. It groups selected questions under seven topics:&lt;ref name="PWorld"&gt;[http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ One Scientist's Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415035123/http://www.questionsoftruth.org/reviews/review-in-physics-world/ |date=April 15, 2009 }} review in ''[[Physics World]]'' April-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Leading Questions'' gives an overview of Polkinghorne's views on nine questions, including science and religion, the existence of God, and atheism.
# ''The Concept and Existence of God'' begins with "Can God's existence be proved?" and addresses ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[omniscience]], [[predestination]] and [[the Trinity]].
# ''The Universe'' considers the [[Big Bang]], the [[Anthropic Principle]] and a [[Theory of Everything]].
# ''Evolution'' starts with "Is evolution a fact or a theory?", discusses [[Intelligent Design]], which is deemed an unfortunate use of language and a theological mistake, and explores whether the mind can be explained by evolution.
# ''Evil'' suggests that "The evil that is not the result of human sin seems to be the result of the workings out of the natural laws of physics and biology" and considers the [[Devil]], cancer and [[Original Sin]].
# ''Human Being'' suggests that [[Adam and Eve]] refer to the first spiritually conscious human beings, that the [[soul]] is something ''logically'' distinct from the body but not a separate physical entity, and that [[conscience]] is "our deepest understanding of right and wrong".
# ''Religion'' begins with "Is atheism a form of faith?", suggests that "For each part of the Bible you have to ask what kind of writing it is and what God is trying to tell us through it", and considers the [[Resurrection]] and that "God will not force us to accept his love ... [but] will save everyone he can - no-one will be excluded because God did not want them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthquestion.com|title=Truth theory|last=Sahgal|first=Gita|date=|website=|publisher=Indian Times|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each question is followed by the responses of Beale and Polkinghorne, sometimes as a single answer and sometimes by the two authors individually. Its three appendixes constitute a third of the book:&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;
* ''Anthropic Fine-Tuning'' draws on [[Martin Rees]]'s book ''Just Six Numbers'' to illustrate the point that if the fundamental constants of physics were slightly different then no intelligent life could exist in the Universe. It then considers [[Multiverse]] ideas and especially [[Lee Smolin]]'s [[Cosmological natural selection]], which, it suggests, has problems from physics and evolutionary dynamics. It also discusses notions of complexity and improbability.
* ''Brain and Consciousness'' suggests that "pretty much everything in the universe has a physical aspect and an informational aspect, neither of which is more foundational than the other", and that informational entities like the [[Mass in B Minor]] cannot be considered as material objects. It proposes that "your body and your mind are different aspects of you", and that the inherent uncertainties of neuron firing mean that the brain is not fully deterministic.
* ''Evolution'' begins by pointing out that since [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] Christians have not taken the Genesis creation accounts "literally", and that key developers of the current theory (e.g. [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Simon Conway-Morris]] and [[Martin Nowak]]) have been Christians, suggesting that there is no conflict between Christianity and evolution, that small genetic changes can have big effects, that [[genetic determinism]] is mistaken, and that there are evolutionary benefits to religion.

==Reviews==

[[Julian Baggini]], writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', said that Polkinghorne has no problems reconciling his faith with his science and suggests that "despite the complexity of some of the scientific issues discussed", the book "is a commendably clear read".  He says "it is a pity that the people most likely to buy this book are those simply seeking intellectual reassurance that their faith is not irrational.  Those who would most benefit from reading it are in fact fundamentalists who think that evolutionary science must be wrong, and overconfident atheists who believe that the religious are manifestly irrational.” &lt;ref name = "FT"&gt;[[Julian Baggini]] "A Twist of Faith: How to reconcile religious belief with science" ''Financial Times'' Life and Arts, p.16, 21 Feb.,'09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]]'s [http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=708#comments additional comments on his talkingphilosophy site and the subsequent discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]] wrote a highly critical review in the ''[[New Humanist]]''. He states that the responses to questions concerning science and religion boil down to three strategies, [[God of the gaps]], [[inference to the best explanation]], and religion and science explain truths in [[non-overlapping magisteria|different domains]]. He considers the first two refutable by undergraduates, and for the third strategy to work, he contends that one has to "cherry-pick which bits of scripture and dogma are to be taken as symbolic and which as literally true" in order to conveniently avoid the possibility of direct and testable confrontation with science. He concludes the review by expressing his outrage at the [[Royal Society]]'s decision to allow its premises to be used for the launch of the book, as in his opinion this amounts to having "the superstitious lucubrations of illiterate goatherds living several thousand years ago given the same credibility as contemporary scientific research."&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;A. C. Grayling: [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1998 Book Review: Questions of Truth]. ''New Humanist'' 124 (2), March/April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Physics World]]'' commends the authors for handling the diverse readership, skeptics and believers, in a "remarkably even-handed way", but laments that concerns with specifics of Christian doctrine may limit the book's appeal; however, scientifically minded readers may find the extensive appendices a good starting point. The reviewer concludes that the book provides valuable insight for those interested in the science and religion debate.&lt;ref name="PWorld"/&gt;

In addition, some periodicals have included brief reviews. &lt;!-- These are all less than a paragraph on the book. --&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, "Many readers will welcome this accessible format, but some may find the blurring of science and theology confusing."&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6612221.html?industryid=47159 Publishers Weekly Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Library Journal]]'' described it as intriguing and a thought-provoking work, and said that [[John Polkinghorne]] was a “a kind of antidote to [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] for the intellectual theist or Christian."&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 Library Journal Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305095840/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6625530.html?industryid=47110 |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Episcopal Life'' says the book offers "some interesting conclusions".&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life 3-Mar-09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312123834/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81827_105251_ENG_HTM.htm |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Sample, reflecting over his interview with Polkinghorne for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that there was much in the book that he found offensive, especially the idea that God needs to remain [[divine hiddenness|hidden]] from his creation lest they be completely overwhelmed, a notion Sample describes as "a bit patronising".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web | work=The Guardian | last=Sample | first=Ian | accessdate=19 January 2010 | date=9 April 2009 | title=Can science be used to prove the existence of God? | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/apr/09/religion-controversiesinscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''scientific method''' is an [[empirical]] method of knowledge acquisition which has characterized the development of [[science]] since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, which includes rigorous [[skepticism]] about what is observed, given that [[Philosophy of science#Observation inseparable from theory|cognitive assumptions]] about how the world works influence how one interprets a [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]]. It involves formulating [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], via [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], based on such observations; [[experiment]]al and measurement-based testing of [[Deductive reasoning|deductions]] drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are ''principles'' of the scientific method, as opposed to a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|last=Newton|first=Issac|work=The Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|publisher=University of California Press|others=Includes "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I.

Though there are diverse models for the scientific method available, in general there is a continuous process that includes observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or [[hypotheses]] about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general [[scientific theory|theory]] may be developed.&lt;ref name="Garland2015"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | title =The Scientific Method as an Ongoing Process | date= 20 March 2015 | last =Garland, Jr. | first =Theodore | publisher =UC Riverside | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160819164005/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | archive-date =19 August 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although procedures vary from one [[Branches of science|field of inquiry]] to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making [[conjecture]]s (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvnb|Galileo|1638}}. His [[thought experiment]]s disprove Aristotle's physics of falling bodies, in ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observation]]s agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karl R. Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', Routledge, 2003 {{ISBN|0415285941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]]. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gauch |first1= Hugh G. |title=Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |edition=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=3 |isbn=978-0521017084 |quote=The scientific method 'is often misrepresented as a fixed sequence of steps,' rather than being seen for what it truly is, 'a highly variable and creative process' (AAAS 2000:18). The claim here is that science has general principles that must be mastered to increase productivity and enhance perspective, not that these principles provide a simple and automated sequence of steps to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"&gt;[[William Whewell]], ''History of Inductive Science'' (1837), and in ''Philosophy of Inductive Science'' (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist [[Lee Smolin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/there-is-no-scientific-method |title=There is No Scientific Method |last1=Smolin |first1=Lee |access-date=2016-06-07|date=May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] (in his ''[[Against Method]]''). Robert Nola and Howard Sankey remark that "For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's debate, the continuation of which can be summed up as yet more of the proverbial deceased equine castigation. We beg to differ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2001 |title=After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend.

Important debates in the history of science concern [[rationalism]], especially as advocated by [[René Descartes]]; [[inductivism]] and/or [[empiricism]], as argued for by [[Francis Bacon]], and rising to particular prominence with [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers; and [[hypothetico-deductivism]], which came to the fore in the early 19th century.

The term "scientific method" did not come into wide use until the 19th century, when other modern scientific terminologies began to emerge such as "scientist" and "pseudoscience" and significant transformation of science was taking place.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; Throughout the 1830s and 1850s, by which time Baconianism was popular, naturalists like William Whewell, John Herschel, John Stuart Mill engaged in debates over "induction" and "facts" and were focused on how to generate knowledge.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In the late 19th a debate over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[antirealism]] was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Achinstein, Peter |title=General Introduction |pages=1–5 |work=Science Rules: A Historical Introduction to Scientific Methods |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0801879432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "scientific method" came to be used prominently in the twentieth century, with no scientific authorities over its meaning despite it popping up in textbooks and dictionaries.&lt;ref name="Thurs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurs|first1=Daniel|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=307–36|chapter=12. Scientific Method}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a steady growth on the concept into the twentieth century, by the end of that century numerous influential philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend had questioned the universality of the "scientific method" and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In particular, Paul Feyerabend argued against there being any universal rules of [[science]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

* [[Leon Lederman]], for teaching [[physics first]], illustrates how to avoid confirmation bias: [[Ian Shelton]], in Chile, was initially skeptical that [[supernova 1987a]] was real, but possibly an artifact of instrumentation (null hypothesis), so he went outside and disproved his null hypothesis by observing SN 1987a with the naked eye. The [[Kamiokande]] experiment, in Japan, independently observed [[neutrino]]s from [[SN 1987a]] at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; This model can be seen to underlie the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|2007|pp=2–3}}: "There is a danger that must be avoided. ... If we wish to do justice to the historical enterprise, we must take the past for what it was. And that means we must resist the temptation to scour the past for examples or precursors of modern science. ...My concern will be with the beginnings of scientific ''theories'', the methods by which they were formulated, and the uses to which they were put; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquitous element in the model of the scientific method is [[empiricism]], or more precisely, epistemologic [[sensualism]]. This is in opposition to stringent forms of [[rationalism]]: the scientific method embodies that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem. A strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of [[empiricism]] in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge; in current scientific practice, however, the use of [[scientific modelling]] and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted. The scientific method is of necessity also an expression of an opposition to claims that e.g. [[revelation]], political or religious [[dogma]], appeals to tradition, commonly held beliefs, common sense, or, importantly, currently held theories, are the only possible means of demonstrating truth.

Different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history, for instance with the ancient [[Stoics]], [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref name=Asmis&gt;Elizabeth Asmis (1985) ''Epicurus' Scientific Method''. Cornell University Press &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;[[Alhazen]] argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them: "How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air. – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}}.
* He demonstrated his conjecture that "light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only" by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}} to prove that light travels in a straight line.
* [[David Hockney]], (2001, 2006) in ''Secret Knowledge: rediscovering the lost techniques of the old masters'' {{ISBN|0142005126}} (expanded edition) cites Alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the [[camera obscura]], which Hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from [[Charles M. Falco]]. ''Kitab al-Manazir'', which is Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'', at that time denoted ''Opticae Thesaurus, Alhazen Arabis'', was translated from Arabic into Latin for European use as early as 1270. Hockney cites Friedrich Risner's 1572 Basle edition of ''Opticae Thesaurus''. Hockney quotes Alhazen as the first clear description of the camera obscura in Hockney, p. 240.
"Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough." – [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn Al-Haytham]] 965 – c. 1040) ''[[Critique of Ptolemy]]'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}. (This quotation is from Alhazen's critique of Ptolemy's books ''[[Almagest]]'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and [https://books.google.com/?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Opticae+thesaurus+alhazen ''Optics'' as translated into English by A.

* The full title translation is from p. 60 of James R. Voelkel (2001) ''Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy'' Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;...an approach which was advocated by Galileo in 1638 with the publication of ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.{{Citation|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|author-link=Galileo|title=Discorsi e Dimonstrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuoue scienze|location=[[Leiden|Leida]]|publisher=Apresso gli [[House of Elzevir|Elsevirri]]|year=1638|isbn=978-0486600994|title-link=Two New Sciences}}, Dover reprint of the 1914 Macmillan translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio of ''Two New Sciences'', [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Accademia dei Lincei|Linceo]] (1638). Additional publication information is from the collection of first editions of the Library of Congress surveyed by {{harvnb|Bruno|1989|pp=261–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was particular development  aided by theoretical works by [[Francisco Sanches]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanches,Limbrick, and Thomson, 1988. ''[[That Nothing is Known]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].

The [[hypothetico-deductive model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003}} p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated in the 20th century, is the ideal although it has undergone significant revision since first proposed (for a more formal discussion, see [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|below]]). Staddon (2017) argues it is a mistake to try following rules&lt;ref name=Staddon2017 &gt;Staddon, J. (2017) ''Scientific Method: How science works, fails to work or pretends to work.'' Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; which are best learned through careful study of examples of scientific investigation. 

===Process===
The overall process involves making [[conjectures]] ([[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original [[conjecture]] was correct.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt; There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003&gt;{{harvnb|Gauch |2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866), "invention, sagacity, [and] genius"&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"/&gt; are required at every step.

====Formulation of a question====
The question can refer to the explanation of a specific [[observation]], as in "Why is the sky blue?" but can also be open-ended, as in "How can I [[Drug design|design a drug]] to cure this particular disease?" This stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments, personal scientific observations or assertions, as well as the work of other scientists. If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed. When applying the scientific method to research, determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster and Powers (2005), Translational and Experimental Clinical Research, Ch. 1. [https://books.google.com/?id=C7pZftbI0ZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Translational+and+Experimental+Clinical+Research Link.] This chapter also discusses the different types of research questions and how they are produced.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothesis====
A [[hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]], based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question, that may explain any given behavior. The hypothesis might be very specific; for example, Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] or [[Francis Crick]]'s "DNA makes RNA makes protein",&lt;ref&gt;This phrasing is attributed to [[Marshall Nirenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; or it might be broad; for example, unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans. A [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Definition of terms|statistical hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]] about a given [[statistical population]]. For example, the population might be ''people with a particular disease.'' The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people. Terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are [[null hypothesis]] and [[alternative hypothesis]]. A null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false; for example, that the new drug does nothing and that any cure is caused by [[Luck|chance]]. Researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false. The alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome, that the drug does better than chance. A final point: a scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.

====Prediction====
This step involves determining the logical consequences of the hypothesis. One or more predictions are then selected for further testing. The more unlikely that a prediction would be correct simply by coincidence, then the more convincing it would be if the prediction were fulfilled; evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known, due to the effects of [[hindsight bias]] (see also [[postdiction]]). Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other. (These statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using [[Bayes' Theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Note: for a discussion of multiple hypotheses, see [[Bayesian inference#Informal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testing====
This is an investigation of whether the real world behaves as predicted by the hypothesis. Scientists (and other people) test hypotheses by conducting [[experiment]]s. The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observations]] of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. If they agree, confidence in the hypothesis increases; otherwise, it decreases. Agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true; future experiments may reveal problems. [[Karl Popper]] advised scientists to try to falsify hypotheses, i.e., to search for and test those experiments that seem most doubtful. Large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors, especially through the use of appropriate [[scientific control]]s. For example, tests of medical treatments are commonly run as [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind tests]]. Test personnel, who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are [[placebo]]s, are kept ignorant of which are which. Such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects. Furthermore, failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false. Experiments always depend on several hypotheses, e.g., that the test equipment is working properly, and a failure may be a failure of one of the auxiliary hypotheses. (See the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]].) Experiments can be conducted in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]], at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars (using one of the working [[Mars rover|rovers]]), and so on. Astronomers do experiments, searching for planets around distant stars. Finally, most individual experiments address highly specific topics for reasons of practicality. As a result, evidence about broader topics is usually accumulated gradually.

====Analysis====
This involves determining what the results of the experiment show and deciding on the next actions to take. The predictions of the hypothesis are compared to those of the null hypothesis, to determine which is better able to explain the data. In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] such as a [[chi-squared test]] may be required. If the evidence has falsified the hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the experiment supports the hypothesis but the evidence is not strong enough for high confidence, other predictions from the hypothesis must be tested. Once a hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence, a new question can be asked to provide further insight on the same topic. Evidence from other scientists and experience are frequently incorporated at any stage in the process. Depending on the complexity of the experiment, many iterations may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer a question with confidence, or to build up many answers to highly specific questions in order to answer a single broader question.

===DNA example===
[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|link=|alt=]]
The basic [[#Elements of the scientific method|elements of the scientific method]] are illustrated by the following example from the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]:
* ''[[#DNA-characterizations|Question]]'': Previous investigation of DNA had determined its chemical composition (the four [[nucleotides]]), the structure of each individual nucleotide, and other properties. It had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] in 1944,&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.
* ''[[#DNA-hypotheses|Hypothesis]]'': [[Linus Pauling]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure.&lt;ref&gt;October 1951, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=40}}:"That's what a helix should look like!" Crick exclaimed in delight (This is the Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theory of the transform of a helix).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[#DNA-predictions|Prediction]]'': If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;June 1952, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"&gt;Watson did enough work on [[Tobacco mosaic virus]] to produce the diffraction pattern for a helix, per Crick's work on the transform of a helix. pp. 137–38, Horace Freeland Judson (1979) ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"&gt;–
Cochran W, Crick FHC and Vand V. (1952) "The Structure of Synthetic Polypeptides. I. The Transform of Atoms on a Helix", ''[[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Crystallogr.]]'', '''5''', 581–86.&lt;/ref&gt; (and independently by Stokes). This prediction was a mathematical construct, completely independent from the biological problem at hand.
* ''[[#DNA-experiments|Experiment]]'': [[Rosalind Franklin]] crystallized pure DNA and performed [[X-ray diffraction]] to produce [[photo 51]]. The results showed an X-shape.
* ''[[#DNA-iterations|Analysis]]'': When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"&gt;Friday, January 30, 1953. Tea time, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=52}}: Franklin confronts Watson and his paper – "Of course it [Pauling's pre-print] is wrong. DNA is not a helix." However, Watson then visits Wilkins' office, sees [[photo 51]], and immediately recognizes the diffraction pattern of a helical structure. But additional questions remained, requiring additional iterations of their research. For example, the number of strands in the backbone of the helix (Crick suspected 2 strands, but cautioned Watson to examine that more critically), the location of the base pairs (inside the backbone or outside the backbone), etc. One key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis, but to build a physical model.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"&gt;"The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|p=167}} Page 168 shows the X-shaped pattern of the B-form of [[DNA]], clearly indicating crucial details of its helical structure to Watson and Crick.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 52 dates the Franklin-Watson confrontation as Friday, January 30, 1953. Later that evening, Watson urges Wilkins to begin model-building immediately. But Wilkins agrees to do so only after Franklin's departure.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Crick then produced their model, using this information along with the previously known information about DNA's composition and about molecular interactions such as [[hydrogen bonds]].&lt;ref name="SameShape"&gt;Saturday, February 28, 1953, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=57–59}}: Watson found the base pairing mechanism which explained [[Chargaff's rules]] using his cardboard models.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery became the starting point for many further studies involving the genetic material, such as the field of [[molecular genetics]], and it was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1962. Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.

===Other components===
The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo Galilei]] (1638) ''[[Two new sciences]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replication====
If an experiment cannot be [[Reproducibility|repeated]] to produce the same results, this implies that the original results might have been in error. As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of [[Observational error|experimental error]]. For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fyysika.ee/vorgustik/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Reconstruction-of-Galileo-Galilei.pdf|title=Reconstruction of Galileo Galilei's experiment – the inclined plane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====External review====
The process of [[peer review]] involves evaluation of the experiment by experts, who typically give their opinions anonymously. Some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers, especially if the field is highly specialized. Peer review does not certify correctness of the results, only that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter). If the work passes peer review, which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|scientific journal]]. The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Two new sciences'', there are three 'reviewers': Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati, who serve as foil, antagonist, and protagonist. Galileo speaks for himself only briefly. But note that Einstein's 1905 papers were not peer reviewed before their publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data recording and sharing====
Scientists typically are careful in recording their data, a requirement promoted by [[Ludwik Fleck]] (1896–1961) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleck|1979|pp=xxvii–xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not typically required, they might be requested to [[Data sharing|supply this data]] to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific inquiry==
Scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain [[knowledge]] in the form of [[Scientific theory|testable explanations]] that scientists can use to
[[Predictability|predict]] the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study, and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease). The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it frequently can be, and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives. The most successful explanations – those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances – are often called [[scientific theories]].

Most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time, sometimes across different domains of science.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community. In general, explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic, and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence. Often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time, or combined explanations to produce new explanations.

Tow sees the scientific method in terms of an [[evolutionary algorithm]] applied to science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Of great significance is the evolutionary algorithm, which uses a simplified subset of the process of natural evolution applied to find the solution to problems that are too complex to solve by traditional analytic methods. In essence it is a process of accelerated and rigorous trial and error building on previous knowledge to refine an existing hypothesis, or discarding it altogether to find a better model. [...] The evolutionary algorithm is a technique derived from the evolution of knowledge processing applied within the context of science and technology, itself an outcome of evolution.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties of scientific inquiry===

Scientific knowledge is closely tied to [[empirical]] findings, and can remain subject to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new experimental observation incompatible with it is found. That is, no theory can ever be considered final, since new problematic evidence might be discovered. If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence. The strength of a theory can be argued{{by whom|date=December 2016}} to relate to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles.

Theories can also become subsumed by other theories. For example, Newton's laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets   [[#Another example: precession of Mercury|almost perfectly]]. However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory ([[Theory of relativity|relativity]]), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of [[light]] by [[gravity]]. Thus, in certain cases independent, unconnected, scientific observations can be connected to each other, unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"&gt;{{harvnb|Brody |1993|pp= 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"/&gt;

Since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them, and thus be able to explain more than previous ones, successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"/&gt; For example, the theory of [[evolution]] explains the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life on Earth]], how species adapt to their environments, and many other patterns observed in the natural world;&lt;ref name="Hall08"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Hall |editor1-first = B.K. |editor2-last = Hallgrímsson |editor2-first = B. |title = Strickberger's Evolution |year = 2008 |edition = 4th |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn = 978-0763700669 |url = http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |page = 762 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120628101715/http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |archivedate = 2012-06-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracraft05"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last= Cracraft | editor1-first= J. | editor2-last= Donoghue | editor2-first= M.J. |title = Assembling the tree of life | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 592 | isbn = 978-0195172348 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6lXTP0YU6_kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Assembling+the+tree+of+life#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; its most recent major modification was unification with [[genetics]] to form the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

===Beliefs and biases===
[[File:Jean Louis Théodore Géricault 001.jpg|thumb|Flying gallop as shown by this painting ([[Théodore Géricault]], 1821) is [[Falsifiability|falsified]]; see image below]]
[[File:The Horse in Motion high res.jpg|thumb|[[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Muybridge's photographs]] of ''The Horse in Motion,'' 1878, were used to answer the question whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science.]]

Scientific methodology often directs that [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] be tested in [[Scientific control|controlled]] conditions wherever possible. This is frequently possible in certain areas, such as in the biological sciences, and more difficult in other areas, such as in astronomy.

The practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance, and to a degree, personal bias. For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in [[confirmation bias]]; this is a [[heuristic]] that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe).

A historical example is the belief that the legs of a [[Horse gallop|galloping]] horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touches the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters. However, the first stop-action pictures of a horse's gallop by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] showed this to be false, and that the legs are instead gathered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}} p. 166 shows how the 'flying gallop' image propagated from China to the West.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new, surprising statements (see [[appeal to novelty]]), which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=940"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;"A myth is a belief given uncritical acceptance by members of a group ..." – Weiss, ''Business Ethics'' p. 15, as cited by Ronald R. Sims (2003) ''Ethics and corporate social responsibility: why giants fall'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldhaber and Nieto published in 2010 the observation that if theoretical structures with "many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure .. becomes increasingly hard to overturn".&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. {{harvnb|Taleb|2007|p=72}} lists ways to avoid the narrative fallacy and confirmation bias.&lt;/ref&gt; For more on the [[narrative fallacy]], see also {{harvnb|Fleck|1979|p=27}}: "Words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them. ... Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized. ... Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed, it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it." Sometimes, these have their elements assumed [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']], or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them. [[Donald M. MacKay]] has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;
The scientific method requires testing and validation [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] before ideas are accepted.

==Elements of the scientific method==
There are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry. The [[scientific community]] and [[philosophers of science]] generally agree on the following classification of method components. These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of [[natural science]]s than [[social science]]s. Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below.

The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Godfrey-Smith|first1=Peter|title=Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226300627|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k23egtSWrb8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=Thomas A.|title=The Philosophy Behind Physics|date=1993|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin; New York|isbn=978-3540559146|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zmHrCAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions:&lt;ref name="Kuhn50"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226458113|edition=50th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books/aout/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.html?id=3eP5Y_OOuzwC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galison|first1=Peter|title=How Experiments End|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226279152|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Experiments_End.html?id=DN-9m2jSo8YC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)
* Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)
* Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory)
* Experiments (tests of all of the above)

Each element of the scientific method is subject to [[peer review]] for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do ([[#Dimensions of practice|see below]]) but apply mostly to experimental sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology). The elements above are often taught in [[education|the educational system]] as "the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based education]] paradigm, the stage of "characterization, observation, definition, ..." is more briefly summed up under the rubric of a Question&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." – {{harvnb|Einstein|Infeld|1938|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow,
but is rather an [[#Evaluation and improvement|ongoing cycle]], constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's ''Principia''. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, the vanishingly small, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work.

A linearized, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:&lt;ref&gt;Crawford S, Stucki L (1990), "Peer review and the changing research record", "J Am Soc Info Science", vol. 41, pp. 223–28&lt;/ref&gt;

# Define a question
# Gather information and resources (observe)
# Form an explanatory hypothesis
# Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] manner
# Analyze the data
# Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
# Publish results
# Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 back to 3 again.

While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Gauch|2003}}, esp. chapters 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; it should also be noted that a number of philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, including [[Paul Feyerabend]], claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced.

===Characterizations===
The scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation. (The ''subjects'' can also be called [[:Category:Lists of unsolved problems|''unsolved problems'']] or the ''unknowns''.) For example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] conjectured, correctly, that [[St. Elmo's fire]] was [[electrical]] in [[nature]], but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also [[logical consequence|entail]] some definitions and observations; the [[observations]] often demand careful [[measurements]] and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences]], such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require specialized [[scientific instrument]]s such as [[thermometer]]s, [[Spectrometer|spectroscopes]], [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[voltmeter]]s, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement.

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Uncertainty====
Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [[uncertainty]]. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations. Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken.

====Definition====
Measurements demand the use of ''[[operational definition]]s'' of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or "idealized" definition. For example, [[electric current]], measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of "mass" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its [[natural language]] usage. For example, [[mass]] and [[weight]] overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in [[mechanics]]. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [[units of measurement|units of measure]] which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s first paper on [[Special relativity|relativity]] begins by defining [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] and the means for determining [[length]]. These ideas were skipped over by [[Isaac Newton]] with, "I do not define [[time in physics#Galileo: the flow of time|time]], space, place and [[motion (physics)|motion]], as being well known to all." Einstein's paper then demonstrates that they (viz., absolute time and length independent of motion) were approximations. [[Francis Crick]] cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Francis (1994), ''The Astonishing Hypothesis'' {{ISBN|0684194317}} p. 20
&lt;/ref&gt; In Crick's study of [[consciousness]], he actually found it easier to study [[awareness]] in the [[visual system]], rather than to study [[free will]], for example. His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them.

====DNA-characterizations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; The [[DNA#History of DNA research|history]] of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a classic example of [[#Elements of the scientific method|the elements of the scientific method]]: in 1950 it was known that [[genetic inheritance]] had a mathematical description, starting with the studies of [[Gregor Mendel]], and that DNA contained genetic information (Oswald Avery's ''transforming principle'').&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"/&gt; But the mechanism of storing genetic information (i.e., genes) in DNA was unclear. Researchers in [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg's]] laboratory at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] made [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]] pictures of various [[molecule]]s, starting with [[crystal]]s of [[salt]], and proceeding to more complicated substances. Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific method#DNA-hypotheses|..''2. DNA-hypotheses'']]

====Another example: precession of Mercury====
[[File:Perihelio.svg|thumb|right|[[Apsidal precession|Precession]] of the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (exaggerated)]]

The characterization element can require extended and extensive study, even centuries. It took thousands of years of measurements, from the [[Chaldea]]n, [[India]]n, [[History of Iran|Persian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Arabs|Arabic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet [[Earth]]. Newton was able to include those measurements into consequences of his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. But the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s [[orbit]] exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), as Leverrier pointed out in 1859. The observed difference for Mercury's [[Apsidal precession|precession]] between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to [[Albert Einstein]] as a possible early test of his theory of [[General relativity]]. His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory. The difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century.

===Hypothesis development===
{{Main article|Hypothesis formation}}

A [[hypothesis]] is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.

Normally hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]]. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [[inductive reasoning]], [[Bayesian inference]], and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that "there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |title=The World as I See It |date=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], borrowing a page from [[Aristotle]] (''[[Prior Analytics]]'', [[Inquiry#Abduction|2.25]]) described the incipient stages of [[inquiry]], instigated by the "irritation of doubt" to venture a plausible guess, as ''[[abductive reasoning]]''. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a "flash of inspiration", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [[Michael Polanyi]] made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.

[[William Glen (geologist and historian)|William Glen]] observes that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glen|1994|pp=37–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived "truth", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.}}

In general scientists tend to look for theories that are "[[Elegance|elegant]]" or "[[beauty|beautiful]]". In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, they here refer to a theory in accordance with the known facts, which is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. [[Occam's Razor]] serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.

To minimize the [[confirmation bias]] which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, [[strong inference]] emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Platt&gt;[[John R. Platt]] (16 October 1964) [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/146/3642/347 Strong Inference] ''Science'' vol '''146''' (3642) p. 347 {{doi|10.1126/science.146.3642.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-hypotheses====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[Linus Pauling]] proposed that DNA might be a [[triple helix]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The structure that we propose is a three-chain structure, each chain being a helix" – Linus Pauling, as quoted on p. 157 by Horace Freeland Judson (1979), ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was also considered by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=49–50}}: January 28, 1953 – Watson read Pauling's pre-print, and realized that in Pauling's model, DNA's phosphate groups had to be un-ionized. But DNA is an acid, which contradicts Pauling's model.
&lt;/ref&gt; and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. So, the race was on to figure out the correct structure (except that Pauling did not realize at the time that he was in a race) ''[[#DNA-predictions|..3. DNA-predictions]]''

===Predictions from the hypothesis===
{{Main article|Prediction in science}}

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s, by [[reasoning]] including [[deductive reasoning]]. It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.

It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown. Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true. If the outcome is already known, it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while [[Scientific method#Hypothesis development|formulating the hypothesis]].

If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense. A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible. For example, while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation, there is no known experiment that can test this hypothesis. Therefore, science itself can have little to say about the possibility. In future, a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science.

====DNA-predictions====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], and others hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure. This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
June 1952. as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.
&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"/&gt; (and independently by Stokes). The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.

In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the [[double helix]] structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]], writing, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 68: ''Nature'' April 25, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#DNA-experiments|'' ..4. DNA-experiments'']]

====Another example: general relativity====
[[File:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[gravitational lensing|Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field]]]]

Einstein's theory of [[General Relativity]] makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [[space-time]], such as that [[light]] bends in a [[gravitational field]], and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [[Arthur Eddington]]'s observations made during a 1919 [[solar eclipse]] supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;In March 1917, the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] announced that on May 29, 1919, the occasion of a [[total eclipse]] of the sun would afford favorable conditions for testing Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]]. One expedition, to [[Sobral, Ceará]], [[Brazil]], and Eddington's expedition to the island of [[Principe]] yielded a set of photographs, which, when compared to photographs taken at [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] and at [[Greenwich Observatory]] showed that the deviation of light was measured to be 1.69 [[arc-second]]s, as compared to Einstein's desk prediction of 1.75 [[arc-second]]s. – Antonina Vallentin (1954), ''Einstein'', as quoted by Samuel Rapport and Helen Wright (1965), ''Physics'', New York: Washington Square Press, pp. 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
{{Main article|Experiment}}

Once predictions are made, they can be sought by experiments. If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable. Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed, when compared to a [[crucial experiment]]. If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to [[#Evaluation and improvement|further testing.]] The [[experimental control]] is a technique for dealing with observational error. This technique uses the contrast between multiple samples (or observations) under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same. We vary the conditions for each measurement, to help isolate what has changed. [[Mill's canons]] can then help us figure out what the important factor is.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill|Mill, John Stuart]], "A System of Logic", University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, 2002, {{ISBN|1410202526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Factor analysis]] is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.

Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes. It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a [[double-blind]] study or an archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Even taking a plane from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Paris]] is an experiment which tests the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamical]] hypotheses used for constructing the plane.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of [[Hipparchus]] (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]] can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815 CE), [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]] (853–929) and Alhazen (965–1039).&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]], ''De Motu Stellarum'' [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation from Arabic to Latin in 1116]], as cited by "Battani, al-" (c. 858–929) ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th. ed. Al-Battani is known for his accurate observations at al-Raqqah in Syria, beginning in 877. His work includes measurement of the annual precession of the equinoxes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-experiments====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; Watson and Crick showed an initial (and incorrect) proposal for the structure of DNA to a team from Kings College – [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Maurice Wilkins]], and [[Raymond Gosling]]. Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content. Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed [[Photo 51|X-ray diffraction images]] which showed an [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/photo51/ X-shape] and was able to confirm the structure was helical.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"/&gt; This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure. [[Scientific method#DNA-characterizations|''..1. DNA-characterizations'']]

===Evaluation and improvement===
The scientific method is iterative. At any stage it is possible to refine its [[accuracy and precision]], so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

====DNA-iterations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; After considerable fruitless experimentation, being discouraged by their superior from continuing, and numerous false starts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 53: The weekend (January 31 – February 1) after seeing photo 51, Watson informed Bragg of the X-ray diffraction image of DNA in B form. Bragg gave them permission to restart their research on DNA (that is, model building).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 54: On Sunday February 8, 1953, Maurice Wilkes gave Watson and Crick permission to work on models, as Wilkes would not be building models until Franklin left DNA research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 56: [[Jerry Donohue]], on sabbatical from Pauling's lab and visiting Cambridge, advises Watson that textbook form of the base pairs was incorrect for DNA base pairs; rather, the keto form of the base pairs should be used instead. This form allowed the bases' hydrogen bonds to pair 'unlike' with 'unlike', rather than to pair 'like' with 'like', as Watson was inclined to model, on the basis of the textbook statements. On February 27, 1953, Watson was convinced enough to make cardboard models of the nucleotides in their keto form.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Crick were able to infer the essential structure of [[DNA]] by concrete [[model (abstract)|modeling]] [[DNA#History of DNA research|of the physical shapes]] of the [[nucleotide]]s which comprise it.&lt;ref name="SameShape" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Suddenly I became aware that an [[adenine]]-[[thymine]] pair held together by two [[hydrogen bond]]s was identical in shape to a [[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] pair held together by at least two hydrogen bonds. ..." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|pp=194–97}}.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 57 Saturday, February 28, 1953, Watson tried 'like with like' and admitted these base pairs didn't have hydrogen bonds that line up. But after trying 'unlike with unlike', and getting [[Jerry Donohue]]'s approval, the base pairs turned out to be identical in shape (as Watson stated above in his 1968 ''Double Helix'' memoir quoted above). Watson now felt confident enough to inform Crick. (Of course, 'unlike with unlike' increases the number of possible [[codon]]s, if this scheme were a [[genetic code]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; They were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by [[Linus Pauling]] and by [[Rosalind Franklin]]'s X-ray diffraction images. [[Scientific method#DNA example|..''DNA Example'']]

===Confirmation===
Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] was killed by [[ball lightning]] (1753) when attempting to replicate the 1752 kite-flying experiment of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;
See, e.g., ''Physics Today'', '''59'''(1), p. 42. [http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_1/42_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1 Richmann electrocuted in St. Petersburg (1753)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect against bad science and fraudulent data, government research-granting agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]], and science journals, including ''Nature'' and ''Science'', have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before. [[Scientific data archiving]] can be done at a number of national archives in the U.S. or in the [[World Data Center]].

==Models of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]], and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Hypothetico-deductive model===
The [[hypothetico-deductive model]] or method is a proposed description of scientific method. Here, predictions from the hypothesis are central: if you assume the hypothesis to be true, what consequences follow?

If subsequent empirical investigation does not demonstrate that these consequences or predictions correspond to the observable world, the hypothesis can be concluded to be false.

===Pragmatic model===
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
In 1877,&lt;ref name=Fixation&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=The Fixation of Belief |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=1–15 |wslink=The Fixation of Belief}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless.&lt;ref name=Doubt&gt;"What one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt; but a man should train himself to doubt," said Peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography; see Ketner, Kenneth Laine (2009) "Charles Sanders Peirce: Interdisciplinary Scientist" in ''The Logic of Interdisciplinarity''). Peirce held that actual, genuine doubt originates externally, usually in surprise, but also that it is to be sought and cultivated, "provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself, and no counterfeit nor paper substitute"; in "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99, see [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/484/mode/1up p. 484], and [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491]. (Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 438–63, see 443 and 451).&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.&lt;ref&gt;But see [[Scientific method and religion]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The scientific method – the method wherein inquiry regards itself as [[Fallibilism|fallible]] and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that slow, stumbling [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]] can be dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment in practical matters, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105–22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref name=F.R.L.&gt;" ... in order to learn, one must desire to learn ..." – Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 135–40, {{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |title=Eprint |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive – eventually – at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.&lt;ref name=Fixation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vital&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, in paragraph 582, from 1898:
{{quote|... [rational] inquiry of every type, fully carried out, has the vital power of self-correction and of growth. This is a property so deeply saturating its inmost nature that it may truly be said that there is but one thing needful for learning the truth, and that is a hearty and active desire to learn what is true.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peirce, rational inquiry implies presuppositions about truth and the real; to reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the real is discoverable and independent of our vagaries of opinion. In that vein he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators ''would'' reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points.&lt;ref name=How&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=286–302 wslink==How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation. That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community. Thus, his theory of inquiry boils down to "Do the science." Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.&lt;ref name=4Incapacities&gt;Peirce (1868), "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55, and elsewhere. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/conseq/cn-frame.htm ''Arisbe'' Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; As inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle" since it depends on a standpoint that is, in a sense, unlimited.&lt;ref name=Chances&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 12, pp. 604–15, see pp. [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/618/mode/1up 610–11] via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 645–68, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 142–54.

The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Paying special attention to the generation of explanations, Peirce outlined the scientific method as a coordination of three kinds of inference in a purposeful cycle aimed at settling doubts, as follows (in §III–IV in "A Neglected Argument"&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders|date=1908 |title=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God |journal=Hibbert Journal |volume=7 |pages=90–112 |wslink=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God}} with added notes. Reprinted with previously unpublished part, ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 434–50, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; except as otherwise noted):

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]]'' (or ''retroduction''). Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths.&lt;ref name=PAP&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena for an Apology to Pragmatism)" (Manuscript 293, not the like-named article), ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' (NEM) 4:319–20, see first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its [[testability]]&lt;ref name=SuitableTest&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application (L75, 1902), ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 37–38: {{quote|For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested by experiment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Peirce (1902), Carnegie application, see MS L75.329330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:
{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce calls [[Pragmaticism|his pragmatism]] "the logic of abduction".&lt;ref name=LogAbduc&gt;Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; His [[pragmatic maxim]] is: "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".&lt;ref name=How /&gt; His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects – a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, and incomplexity.&lt;ref name=20Qs&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, p. 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]]''. Two stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, theorematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Inductive reasoning|Induction]]''. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general&lt;ref name=How /&gt;) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead;&lt;ref name=ProbInduc&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Probability of Induction", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18, see [https://books.google.com/?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 718] ''Google Books''; [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted often, including (''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 669–93), (''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 155–69).&lt;/ref&gt; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probation: direct inductive argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on [[weighting]]s of qualities or characters;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905 draft "G" of "A Neglected Argument"), "Crude, Quantitative, and Qualitative Induction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 755–60, see 759. Find under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/induction.html Induction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|or on statistics]], or on countings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentential Induction. "...which, by inductive reasonings, appraises the different probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Science of complex systems==
Science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[systems theory]] and [[scientific modelling]]. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] studies such systems;&lt;ref name=Crutchfield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/chaos/talks/CSTheorySFIRetreat.pdf|title=James  (2003) "Complex Systems Theory?"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Gell-Mann]] interconnects these topics with [[message passing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2808634 Review of ''The Quark and the Jaguar'', by Murray Gell-Mann (1994)]
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGSXGMpA0pY Murray Gell-Mann, "What the ''Quark and Jaguar'' is about" – Youtube clip]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse, interconnected systems and large data sets. In particular, practices used within [[Big data]], such as [[predictive analytics]], may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2008) [http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2008/anderson2008a.pdf The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientiﬁc Method Obsolete]. Wired Magazine 16.07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication and community==
{{see also|Scientific community|Scholarly communication}}

Frequently the scientific method is employed not only by a single person, but also by several people cooperating directly or indirectly. Such cooperation can be regarded as an important element of a [[scientific community]]. Various standards of scientific methodology are used within such an environment.

===Peer review evaluation===
Scientific journals use a process of ''[[peer review]]'', in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three, and usually anonymous) fellow scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. In certain journals, the journal itself selects the referees; while in others (especially journals that are extremely specialized), the manuscript author might recommend referees. The referees may or may not recommend publication, or they might recommend publication with suggested modifications, or sometimes, publication in another journal. This standard is practiced to various degrees by different journals, and can have the effect of keeping the literature free of obvious errors and to generally improve the quality of the material, especially in the journals who use the standard most rigorously. The peer review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of "[[groupthink]]" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research.&lt;ref&gt;. Brown, C. (2005) Overcoming Barriers to Use of Promising Research Among Elite Middle East Policy Groups, Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality, Select Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation and replication===
{{Main article|Reproducibility}}
Sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors during their experiments, veer from standard methods and practices ([[Pathological science]]) for various reasons, or, in rare cases, deliberately report false results. Occasionally because of this then, other scientists might attempt to repeat the experiments in order to duplicate the results.

====Archiving====
Researchers sometimes practice [[scientific data archiving]], such as in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals. In these cases, detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses and source code can be preserved in order to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to [[Reproducibility|reproduce the result]]. These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery.

====Data sharing====
When additional information is needed before a study can be reproduced, the author of the study might be asked to provide it. They might provide it, or if the author refuses to [[data sharing|share data]], appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research.

====Limitations====
Since it is impossible for a scientist to record ''everything'' that took place in an experiment, facts selected for their apparent relevance are reported. This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned. For example, [[Heinrich Hertz]] did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results. The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed in order to select and report the experimental conditions. The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.

===Dimensions of practice===
{{Further information|Rhetoric of science}}

The primary constraints on contemporary science are:
* Publication, i.e. [[Peer review]]
* Resources (mostly funding)
It has not always been like this: in the old days of the "[[gentleman scientist]]" funding (and to a lesser extent publication) were far weaker constraints.

Both of these constraints indirectly require scientific method – work that violates the constraints will be difficult to publish and difficult to get funded. Journals require submitted papers to conform to "good scientific practice" and to a degree this can be enforced by peer review. Originality, importance and interest are more important – see for example the [http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/get_published/index.html author guidelines] for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].

Smaldino and McElreath 2016 have noted that our need to reward scientific understanding is being nullified by poor research design and poor data analysis, which is leading to false-positive findings.&lt;ref name=Smaldino2016&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The natural selection of bad science|journal = R.

==Philosophy and sociology of science==
{{See also|Philosophy of science|Sociology of science}}
===Analytical philosophy===
Philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method, at what separates [[Demarcation problem|science from non-science]], and the [[Research ethics|ethic]] that is implicit in science. There are basic assumptions, derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist, that form the base of the scientific method – namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1936, 1956) One may say "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility." From the article "Physics and Reality" (1936), reprinted in ''Out of My Later Years'' (1956). 'It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the setting up of a real external world would be senseless without this comprehensibility.'&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions from [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] form a basis on which science may be grounded. [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[falsifiability|falsificationist]], and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science, but each has also itself been criticized. More generally, the scientific method can be recognized as an idealization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Kuhn]] examined the history of science in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method. His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.

[[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have done extensive work on the "theory laden" character of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on [[Situated cognition|the conceptual framework of the observer]], using the concept of [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; and Feyerabend&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, Paul K (1960) "Patterns of Discovery" The Philosophical Review (1960) vol. 69 (2) pp. 247–52&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the pioneering significance of his work.

Kuhn (1961) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations, and that the "route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward". This implies that the way in which theory is tested is dictated by the nature of the theory itself, which led Kuhn (1961, p.&amp;nbsp;166) to argue that "once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]], "The Function of Measurement in Modern Physical Science", ''ISIS'' 52(2), 161–93, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-modernism and science wars===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] similarly examined the history of science, and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process. In his book ''[[Against Method]]'' he argues that scientific progress is ''not'' the result of applying any particular method. In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science. Thus, if believers in scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be 'anything goes'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend, Paul K.]], ''Against Method, Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'', 1st published, 1975. Reprinted, Verso, London, 1978.
&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms such as his led to the [[strong programme]], a radical approach to the [[sociology of science]].

The [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy. This ongoing debate, known as the [[science wars]], is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and [[Scientific realism|realist]] camps. Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (note that this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, [[Scientific realism|realists]] in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality. Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], following the anthropological fieldworks in an academic scientific laboratory by [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar]], [[Karin Knorr Cetina]] has conducted a comparative anthropological study of two scientific fields (namely [[Particle physics|high energy physics]] and [[molecular biology]]) to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of "[[epistemic cultures]]", in contradiction with the idea that a so callled "scientific method" is unique and a unifying concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39539508|title=Epistemic cultures : how the sciences make knowledge|last=(Karin)|first=Knorr-Cetina, K.|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674258932|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=39539508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of chance in discovery===
{{Main article|Role of chance in scientific discoveries}}
Somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been ''stumbled upon'', rather than sought out. This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.&lt;ref name=DunbarLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M.E. Gorman, R.D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technical Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] is credited with the famous saying that "Luck favours the prepared mind", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context. Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.'''&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;''' This is what [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls "Anti-fragility"; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of [[human error]], human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough – it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Anti-fragility&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Kevin Dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments. These unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they ''think'' is an error in their method. Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. The highly controlled, cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors. At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise.&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with mathematics==
Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against [[observable]]s. A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps. Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is ''known'' from what is ''unknown'' at each stage of discovery. Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be ''[[falsifiable]]'' (capable of disproof). In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proven; at such a stage, that statement would be called a [[conjecture]]. But when a statement has attained mathematical proof, that statement gains a kind of immortality which is highly prized by mathematicians, and for which some mathematicians devote their lives.&lt;ref&gt;
"When we are working intensively, we feel keenly the progress of our work; we are elated when our progress is rapid, we are depressed when it is slow." – the mathematician {{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=131}} in the section on 'Modern [[heuristic]]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other.&lt;ref&gt;
"Philosophy [i.e., physics] is written in this grand book – I mean the universe – which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth." – Galileo Galilei, ''Il Saggiatore'' (''[[The Assayer]]'', 1623), as translated by [[Stillman Drake]] (1957), ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' pp. 237–38,
as quoted by {{harvnb|di Francia|1981|p=10}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technical concept of [[time]] arose in [[science]], and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic. But today, the [[Poincaré conjecture]] has been proven using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see [[Ricci flow]]).

Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure. [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper, ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', is a very well known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. In fact, some observers (including some well known mathematicians such as [[Gregory Chaitin]], and others such as [[Where Mathematics Comes From|Lakoff and Núñez]]) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science.

[[George Pólya]]'s work on [[problem solving]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} 2nd ed.
&lt;/ref&gt; the construction of mathematical [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], and [[heuristic]]&lt;ref&gt;
George Pólya (1954), ''Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics'',
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
George Pólya (1954), ''Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Reasoning''.

&lt;/ref&gt; show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail, while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps.

In Pólya's view, ''understanding'' involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; ''analysis'', which Pólya takes from [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=142}}
&lt;/ref&gt; involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, [[working backward from the goal]], and devising a plan for constructing the proof; ''synthesis'' is the strict [[Euclid]]ean exposition of step-by-step details&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=144}}
&lt;/ref&gt; of the proof; ''review'' involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], when asked how he came about his [[theorem]]s, once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through [[Constructivism (mathematics)|systematic palpable experimentation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1991}} p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction, criticism and revision as principles for improving their work.&lt;ref&gt;See the development, by generations of mathematicians, of [[Euler's formula for polyhedra]] as documented by {{Citation|first=Imre| last=Lakatos|year=1976|title=Proofs and refutations|authorlink=Imre Lakatos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0521290388| title-link=Proofs and refutations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In like manner to science, where truth is sought, but certainty is not found, in ''Proofs and refutations'' (1976), what Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of [[informal mathematics]] is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no [[counterexample]] has yet been found. Once a counterexample, i.e. an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those [[axiom]]s were [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], i.e. [[logical truth|logically true]], by [[string rewriting system|rewriting]] them, as did Poincaré (''Proofs and Refutations'', 1976).)

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on Polya's idea of [[heuristic]]s. In ''Proofs and Refutations'', Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical '[[thought experiment]]s' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre (Worrall &amp; Zahar, eds. 1976) ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with statistics ===

The scientific method has been extremely successful in bringing the world out of medieval thinking, especially once it was combined with industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Nathan; Luther Earle Birdzell; Mitchell, Glenn William. ''How the West grew Rich''. Popular Prakashan, 1986. [http://vedpuriswar.org/Book_Review/Economics/How%20the%20West%20grew%20rich.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the scientific method employs statistics as part of its arsenal, there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods. This is described in a popular 2005 scientific paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" by [[John Ioannidis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Most Published Research Findings Are False|journal = PLoS Medicine|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1549-1277|pmc = 1182327|pmid = 16060722|volume = 2|issue = 8|pages = e124|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|first = John P.A.|last = Ioannidis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular points raised are statistical ("The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.") and economical ("The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.") Hence: "Most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields" and "As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and poststudy probability for true findings." However: "Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds," which means that *new* discoveries will come from research that, when that research started, had low or very low odds (a low or very low chance) of succeeding. Hence, if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge, research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield most new discoveries.

In [[literary theory]], '''textuality''' comprises all of the attributes that distinguish the communicative content under analysis as an object of study.  It is associated with [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]].

==Explanation of Textuality==
Textuality is not just about the written word; it also comprises the placement of the words and the reader’s interpretation. There is not a set formula to describe a text’s textuality; it is not a simple procedure. This summary is true even though the interpretation that a reader develops from that text may decide the identity and the definitive meanings of that text. Textuality, as a [[literary theory]], is that which constitutes a text in a particular way. The text is an indecidable (there is an inexistence of an effective or "strict" method of writing or structure).

==Aspects of textuality==
Being textual includes innumerable elements and aspects. Each and every form of text and text in that form of literature embraces and consists of its own individual and personal characteristics; these may include its personality, the individuality of that personality, the popularity, and so on. The textualities of the text define its characteristics. However, the characteristics are also closely associated with the structure of the text ([[Structuralism]]). Peter Barry's discussion of textuality notes that "its essence is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation – they have to be seen in the context of the larger structures they are part of".&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, Peter, ''Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', 3rd ed., Manchester University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7190-6268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To form an opinion, criticise, or completely interpret a text you would first have to read the complete literary work as a whole, this enables the reader to make supported judgements on the personality and individuality of the text. The text is always hiding something. Although the reading may define and the interpretation may decide, the text does not define or decide. The text rests as operationally and fundamentally indecidable. Roger Webster frequently uses metaphors of ‘weaving’, ‘tissue’, ‘texture’, ‘strands’, and ‘filiation’ when talking about the structure of texts&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Roger, ''Studying Literary Theory: An Introduction'', 2nd ed. St.Martin's Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-340-58499-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also agrees that "instead, the text is a surface over which the reader can range in any number of ways that the text permits."

Textuality is a practice. Through a text’s textuality, it makes itself mean, makes itself be, and makes itself come about in a particular way. Through its textuality, the text relinquishes its status as identity and affirms its condition as pure difference. In indifference, the text "dedefines" itself, etches itself in a texture or network of meaning, which is not limited to the text itself. Barry&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; describes this as a "structuralist approach to literature, there is a constant movement away from the interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger, [[abstract structure]]s which contain them".

A different view of textuality has been put forward by [[Rein Raud]], according to whom textualities are "ordered sets of texts of different status that are related to each other and come with pre-arranged modes of interpretation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5095-1125-9|location=Cambridge|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A textuality consists of base-texts, "those that define a textual community and form a part of the necessary cultural competence of its members"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Poility|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5095-1125-9|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;, result-texts, "bids that have just been accepted and entered circulation, as well as those that have done so some time ago but are still being considered recent arrivals by their recipients"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5095-1125-9|location=Cambridge|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mediated by an operational memory, "a shared (and internally contradictory) mental space of the cultural community and its various subgroups where texts are produced and processed"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5095-1125-9|location=Cambridge|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which contains different kinds of knowledge, standards and codes shared to different extent by the carriers of the culture. According to Raud, this model is complementary to a model of cultural practices, in which the production, distribution and transmission of meaning is regarded in the context of individual participation and activity, while a textuality is necessarily shared and perceived by its carriers to be an objective, albeit constructed, reality.

==The concept of "text"==
The word "text" arose within structuralism as a replacement for the older idea in [[literary criticism]] of the "work," which is always complete and deliberately authored.&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Greene, Roland, ed.-in-chief, ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', Princeton University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13334-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A text must necessarily be thought of as incomplete, indeed as missing something crucial that provides the mechanics of understanding.  The text is always partially hidden; one word for the hidden part in literary theory is the "[[subtext]]."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

The concept of the text in ''structuralism'' requires a relatively simple relationship between language and writing.  [[Jacques Derrida]], a leading post-structuralist, questions this relationship, aiming his critique primarily at [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who, he claims, does not recognize in the relationship between speech and writing "more than a ''narrow'' and ''derivative'' function."&lt;ref name="Gibberish"&gt;Derrida, Jacques, ''De la Grammatologie'', translated as ''Of Grammatology'' by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]],1976 corrected edition, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8018-5830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Derrida, this approach requires putting too much emphasis on speech: 
:"Saussure confronts the system of the spoken language with the system of phonetic (and even alphabetic) writing as though with the telos (purpose) of writing."

==Summation==
Barry says that "one of structuralism's characteristic views is the notion that language doesn’t just reflect or record the world: rather, it shapes it, so that ''how'' we see is ''what'' we see".&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; This is closely linked to "[[post-structuralism]]" which is in fact, closely linked also to textuality. And Barry believes that the "post-structuralist maintains that the consequences of this belief are that we enter a universe of radical uncertainty…".&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Derrida further states:
:"This [[teleology]] leads to the interpretation of all eruptions of the nonphonetic within writing as transitory crises and accidents of passage, and it is right to consider this teleology to be a Western [[ethnocentrism]], a premathematical [[primitivism]], and a [[Formalism (literature)|preformalist]] [[intuitionism]]."&lt;ref name="Gibberish" /&gt;

In short, textuality is an individual and uncertain skill that will always be read and interpreted in texts in different ways, by different people, and at different times. It is a literary tool that can never be defined like an exact science and that will always be influenced by the writer's life, such as, their upbringing, education, culture, age, religion, gender, and multiple other persuading factors.

==Textuality in the Media==
'''Textuality''' can be seen, heard, read, and interacted with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Each of the three forms of ''[[Media (communication)|Medium]]'': [[printing|print]], [[electronic publishing|electronic]], and [[Speech|oral]], have a different form of '''Textuality''' that reflect the way the sensory modalities are stimulated.

'''Thanksgiving after Communion''' is a spiritual practice among Christians who believe in the [[Real Presence]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in the  [[Holy Communion|Communion bread]], maintaining themselves in [[prayer]] for some time to thank [[God]] and especially listening in their hearts for guidance from their Divine guest. This practice was and is highly recommended by [[saint]]s, [[theologian]]s, and [[Doctors of the Church]].

==Basis of the practice==
[[Image:Johnchrysostom.jpg|thumb|left|200px|St. John Chrysostom: "When we have received the precious Body of Jesus Christ, we should take care not to lose its heavenly flavor by turning too soon to the cares and business of the world."&lt;ref name="Muller"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Eucharist/blessed-eucharist7.htm|title=THE BLESSED EUCHARIST|last=Fongemie|first=Pauly|website=www.catholictradition.org|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In John 6:51, Jesus is quoted as saying, "I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world." According to Catholic doctrine, bread is [[Transubstantiation|transubstantiated]] into the "[[Blessed Sacrament|Body and Blood]], Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ." The same holds true for the wine, which in Catholic doctrine is also "the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ".

Pope John-Paul II in ''Inaestimabile Donum'' (Instruction Concerning Worship of the Eucharistic Mystery) emphasized the importance of adoration and prayer after Holy Communion.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/thanksgiving-after-holy-communion.html|title=Thanksgiving After Holy Communion|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The faithful are to be recommended not to omit to make a proper thanksgiving after Communion. They may do this during the celebration with a period of silence, with a hymn, psalm or other song of praise, or also after the celebration, if possible by staying behind to pray for a suitable time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adoremus.org/2007/12/31/Inaestimabile-Donum/|title=Inaestimabile Donum|last=31|first=The Editors December|last2=2007|date=2007-12-31|website=Adoremus Bulletin|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverence is that virtue which inclines a person to show honor and respect to God. According to [[Francis Arinze|Francis Cardinal Arinze]], prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, &lt;blockquote&gt;Thanksgiving after Mass has traditionally been greatly esteemed in the Church for both the priest and the lay faithful. The missal and the breviary even suggest prayers for the priest before and after the Eucharistic celebration. There is no reason to believe that this is no longer needed. Indeed in our noisy world of today, such moments of reflective and loving prayers would seem indicated more than even before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adoremus.org/2003/12/15/Cardinal-Arinze-The-Reverence-due-to-the-Holy-Eucharist/|title=Cardinal Arinze: The Reverence due to the Holy Eucharist|last=15|first=The Editors December|last2=2003|date=2003-12-15|website=Adoremus Bulletin|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]]  in ''[[Sacramentum Caritatis]]'' referred to the "precious time of thanksgiving after communion," urging everyone to preserve the importance of Communion as  "a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus in the sacrament." He recommended that during this time "it can also be most helpful to remain recollected in silence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html Pope Benedict XVI, Sacramentum Caritatis,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114000910/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html |date=January 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Michael Muller, CSSR, explained the basis thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;When the Blessed Virgin Mary visited St. Elizabeth, the aged Saint was astonished at the condescension of the glorious Mother of God, and said: "Whence is this to me, that the Mother of my God should come to me?" Now, in Holy Communion, it is the Lord Himself that comes to us. To remain indifferent after having received the Blessed Eucharist is to show either a total want of faith or a levity and stupidity unworthy of a reasonable being. ...What a spectacle for the Angels, to see a creature approach that Sacred Host before which they bow in lowliest adoration ... leave the church with as much unconcern as if he had but partaken of ordinary bread!&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Practice of the saints==
St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (+1274) composed a Prayer of Thanksgiving after Communion that became a classic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I thank You, O holy Lord, almighty Father, eternal God, who have deigned, not through any merits of mine, but out of the condenscension of Your goodness, to satisfy me a sinner, Your unworthy servant, with the precious Body and Blood of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that this Holy Communion be not a condemnation to punishment for me, but a saving plea to forgiveness. May it be to me the [[armor of faith]] and the shield of a good will. May it be the emptying out of my vices and the extinction of all lustful desires; and increase of charity and patience, of humility and obedience, and all virtues; a strong defense against the snares of all my enemies, visible and invisible; the perfect quieting of all my evil impulses of flesh and spirit, binding me firmly to You, the one true God; and a happy ending of my life. I pray too that You will deign to bring me, a sinner, to that ineffable banquet where You with Your Son and the Holy Spirit, are to your Saints true light, fulfillment of desires, eternal joy, unalloyed gladness, and perfect bliss. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/AQUINAS.htm|title=EWTN ~ Prayers|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Teresa of Ávila]]
After receiving Communion, many of the saints would spend an extended time of thanksgiving. [[Magdalena de Pazzi]] wrote, "The minutes that follow Communion are the most precious we have in our lives."&lt;ref name="Flynn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedivinemercy.org/news/We-Dont-Just-Receive-2697|title=We Don't Just Receive {{!}} The Divine Mercy Message from the Marians of the Immaculate Conception|website=www.thedivinemercy.org|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Teresa of Ávila]] urged her daughters not to rush out after Mass but to treasure the opportunity for thanksgiving: "Let us detain ourselves lovingly with Jesus," she said, "and not waste the hour that follows Communion."&lt;ref name=Flynn/&gt; [[St. Louis de Montfort]] wrote, "I would not give up this hour of Thanksgiving even for an hour of Paradise."&lt;ref name=Flynn/&gt;
 
[[Philip Neri]] once sent two acolytes with candles to accompany a member of his congregation who had left the church without any adoration after Mass.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The man returned to the church to find out St. Philip's purpose. The Saint answered, "We have to pay proper respect to Our Lord, Whom you are carrying away with you. Since you neglect to adore Him, I sent two acolytes to take your place."

==Length of time==
{{Eucharist}}
According to the [[Baltimore Catechism]], Roman Catholics "should spend sufficient time in Thanksgiving after Holy Communion to show due reverence to the Blessed Sacrament; for Our Lord is personally with us as long as the appearance of bread and wine remains."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
[[Image:Sant'Alfonso Liguori.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Alphonsus Liguori]]
Through the years, the saints have varied in their recommendation as regards the amount of time to be spent in thanksgiving. In this matter, though, it should be noted that daily Communion only became the practice after a decree of Pope [[Pius X]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12137a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Pius X|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of saints referred to an hour of thanksgiving. St. Alphonsus specifically advises everyone to devote at least half an hour to it, if it is at all possible. "There is no prayer more agreeable to God, or more profitable to the soul," said another Doctor of the Church, St. [[Alphonsus Liguori]], "than that which is made during the thanksgiving after Communion."

[[Josemaría Escrivá]] said: "Surely you have nothing so important on that you cannot give Our Lord 10 minutes to say thanks. Love is repaid with love."

==Prayer during thanksgiving==
According to Daniel A. Lord, SJ, thanksgiving after Holy Communion always supposes a "realization of who is present in our hearts: Jesus Christ, God-man, lover of souls, divinely powerful, humanly tender, with grace in His hands and the keenest possible interest in His heart for the one who has just received Him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicpamphlets.net/pamphlets/Thanksgiving%20after%20Holy%20Communion.pdf Lord, Daniel A., "Thanksgiving After Holy Communion", Catholic Pamphlets]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional post-communion prayers include the ''[[Adoro te devote|Adoro te]]'' by Thomas Aquinas,&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; the ''[[Anima Christi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://maronitemonks.org/articles/December2004.pdf Maronite Monks, ''The Gift of Thanksgiving'', Most Holy Trinity Monastery, Petersham, Massachusetts, December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Prayer Before a Crucifix]], and the [[Prayer of Saint Francis]].

===Catholic===
According to Fr. Carlos Belmonte, author of ''Understanding the Mass'',&lt;blockquote&gt;The content of our thanksgiving will be just a continuation of the sentiments and affections we have felt – or tried to foster in ourselves – during the Mass, but perhaps in an atmosphere of greater intimacy this time. Sometimes, acts of faith, hope, and charity addressed to the three divine Persons will spurt from our soul. At other times, we will maintain an intimate dialogue with Jesus, our divine Friend who will purify and transform us. Or perhaps, we will just be sitting still, in silent adoration, in the same manner that a mother watches over her son who has fallen asleep. We should not look for prayers or formulas, if we do not find any need for them. But if we realize they can help us, we should overcome our laziness (say, to open our missal and read the prayers for thanksgiving there), or that subtle kind of vanity which makes us feel humiliated by having to read prayers composed by somebody else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iits.uap.edu.ph/belmonte/37Thanksgiving.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200211/http://iits.uap.edu.ph/belmonte/37Thanksgiving.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the recommended texts for thanksgiving in ''My Daily Psalm Book'', arranged by Joseph Frey, CSSP (1947) is the Canticle of the Three Young men, or ''Trium Puerorum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://landru.i-link-2.net/shnyves/Psalm_Guide2.html|title=Canticle|last=|first=|date=|website=landru.i-link-2.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a traditional canticle that is included in the prayers for thanksgiving in the Roman Missal of 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/PostMissam.html|title=Orationes Post Missam|website=www.preces-latinae.org|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the "Universal Prayer" attributed to [[Pope Clement XI]], which begins: "Lord, I believe in you: increase my faith. I trust in you: strengthen my trust. I love you: let me love you more and more. I am sorry for my sins: deepen my sorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/mcitl/prayers2.html|title=Prayers of the Sacramentary|website=www.christusrex.org|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican===
In the [[Anglican Communion]] and in the [[Anglican Use]], the following post-communion prayer, or a variant of it, is said:

{{quote|Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of thy dear Son. And we most humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.|''[[Book of Common Prayer]]}}

In many Anglican Churches since the 1980s, the following has been a common post-communion prayer:

{{quote|Father of all, we give you thanks and praise that, when we were still far off, you met us in your Son and brought us home.   Dying and living, he declared your love, gave us grace and opened the gate of glory.   May we who share Christ’s body live his risen life; we who drink his cup bring life to others; we whom the Spirit lights give light to the world.   Keep us firm in the hope you have set before us so we and all your children shall be free and the whole earth live to praise your name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.|''[[Common Worship]]}}

===Lutheran===
Among [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] denominations, the following prayer may be said silently following the reception of the Eucharist:

{{quote|Almighty and everlasting God, I thank and praise you for feeding me with the life-giving body and blood of your beloved son Jesus Christ. Send your Holy Spirit that, having with my mouth received the holy Sacrament, I may by faith obtain and eternally enjoy your divine grace, the forgiveness of sins, unity with Christ, and everlasting life; through Jesus Christ my Lord. Amen.|''[[Lutheran Service Book]]}}

===Eastern Orthodox===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] there are various sets of prayers recommended both for [[Eucharistic discipline|Preparation for Communion]] and for Thanksgiving After Communion. The specific form will differ depending upon national jurisdiction.

Through the centuries, several prayers have been composed for this. [[Symeon Metaphrastes]] (probably 10th century) who is venerated by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as a saint, and who is known for his Byzantine hagiography, composed the following Prayer of Thanksgiving after Communion which is found in the ''Hieratikon'', or prayers for the priest.

:O Thou who didst gladly give me Thy flesh for nourishment; who art fire to consume the unworthy: Burn me not, O my Creator, but search out my members. Quicken my reins and my heart. Let Thy flames devour the thorns of all my transgressions. Purify my soul. Sanctify my thoughts. Knit firm my bones. Enlighten my senses. Piece me with Thy fear. Be Thou my continual shield. Watch over and preserve me from every word and deed that corrupt the soul. Purge me and wash me clean and adorn me. Order my ways, give me understanding and enlighten me. Make me the temple of Thy Holy Ghost, and no more the habitation of sin, that as from fire all evil, every passion, may flee from me, who through Holy Communion am become a place for Thy dwelling. I bring unto Thee all the saints to make intercession: The ranks of the heavenly hosts; Thy forerunner; the wise Apostles; and withal Thy pure and holy Mother. Their prayers receive, O merciful Christ, and make Thy servant a child of light. For Thou art our hallowing, Thou only art the brightness of our souls, O gracious Lord: And we rightly give glory to Thee, our Lord and our God, All the days of our life. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monachos.net/library/Simeon_Metaphrastes,_Prayer_of_Thanksgiving_after_Communion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925123103/http://www.monachos.net/library/Simeon_Metaphrastes%2C_Prayer_of_Thanksgiving_after_Communion |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] there are usually a set of five prayers that are recited after the conclusion of the [[Divine Liturgy]].&lt;ref name="pomog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pomog.org/prayers-after-holy-communion-en/|title=Prayers After Holy Communion (EN) – POMOG.org|website=pomog.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy, those who have received Holy Communion will remain behind and pray as the prayers are recited by a [[reader (liturgy)|Reader]]. The priest and other celebrating clergy will usually say the Prayers of Thanksgiving immediately after receiving Holy Communion. However, the deacon who will perform the [[Ablution in Christianity|ablutions]] will wait to say them after he has finished his duties at the [[Table of Oblation]].

Among the prayers said is one by Saint [[Basil the Great]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;O Master Christ God, King of the ages and Creator of all things, I thank Thee for all the good things which Thou hast bestowed upon me, and for the communion of Thy most pure and life-creating [[Sacred Mysteries|Mysteries]]. I pray Thee, therefore, O Good One and Lover of mankind: Keep me under Thy protection and in the shadow of Thy wings; and grant me, even until my last breath, to partake worthily and with a pure conscience, of Thy Holy Things, unto the remission of sins and life eternal. For Thou art the Bread of life, the Source of [[Sacred|holiness]], the Giver of good things; and unto Thee do we send up glory, together with the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.&lt;ref name=pomog/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The prayers usually end with the ''[[Nunc Dimittis]]'' and the [[Troparion]] and [[Kontakion]] of the saint who wrote the Liturgy that was celebrated (John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, [[Gregory Dialogist]] or, rarely, [[James the Brother of the Lord]]). Then the rite ends with a [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] pronounced by the priest.

After the Prayers of Thanksgiving, the communicant should spend the rest of the day in a spirit of [[thanksgiving]], engaging only in activities which are of benefit to the soul. If it is a Sunday or [[Calendar of saints|Holy Day]] he should [[Sabbath in Christianity|rest from labour]].

{{distinguish|Art theory}}

At the broadest level, a '''theory of art''' aims to shed light on some aspect of the project of defining art or to theorize about the structure of our concept of ‘art’ without providing classical definitions, namely definitions formulated in terms of “necessary and sufficient” conditions. 

== Aesthetic response ==

'''Aesthetic response''' or '''functional theories of art''' are in many ways the most intuitive theories of art. At its base, the term "[[aesthetic]]" refers to a type of phenomenal experience and aesthetic definitions identify artworks with artifacts intended to produce aesthetic experiences. Nature can be beautiful and it can produce aesthetic experiences, but nature does not possess the function of producing those experiences. For such a function, an intention is necessary, and thus agency – the artist.

[[Monroe Beardsley]] is commonly associated with aesthetic definitions of art. In Beardsley’s words, something is art just in case it is “either an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic character or (incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of arrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity” (''The aesthetic point of view: selected essays'', 1982, 299). Painters arrange “conditions” in the paint/canvas medium, and dancers arrange the “conditions” of their bodily medium, for example. According to Beardsley’s first disjunct, art has an intended aesthetic function, but not all artworks succeed in producing aesthetic experiences. The second disjunct allows for artworks that were intended to have this capacity, but failed at it (bad art).

[[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] is the paradigmatic counterexample to aesthetic definitions of art. Such works are said to be counterexamples because they are artworks that don't possess an intended aesthetic function. Beardsley replies that either such works are not art or they are “comments on art” (1983): “To classify them [Fountain and the like] as artworks just because they make comments on art would be to classify a lot of dull and sometimes unintelligible magazine articles and newspaper reviews as artworks” (p.25). This response has been widely considered inadequate (REF). It is either question-begging or it relies on an arbitrary distinction between artworks and commentaries on artworks. A great many art theorists today consider aesthetic definitions of art to be extensionally inadequate, primarily because of artworks in the style of Duchamp{{Citation Needed|date=October 2013}}.

==Formalism==
{{main|Formalism (art)}}
The '''formalist theory of art''' asserts that we should focus only on the formal properties of art--the "form" not the "content". Those formal properties might include, for the visual arts, color, shape, and line, and, for the musical arts, rhythm and harmony. Formalists do not deny that works of art might have content, representation, or narrative-rather, they deny that those things are relevant in our appreciation or understanding of art.

==Institutional==

The '''institutional theory of art''' is a theory about the nature of [[art]] that holds that an object can only be(come) art in the context of the [[institution]] known as "the [[artworld]]".

Addressing the issue of what makes, for example, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]" art, or why a pile of [[Brillo]] cartons in a supermarket is not art, whereas [[Andy Warhol]]'s famous ''Brillo Boxes'' (a pile of Brillo carton replicas) is, the art critic and philosopher [[Arthur Danto]] wrote in his 1964 essay "The Artworld":
{{quote|To see something as art requires something the eye cannot descry—an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an artworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danto |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Danto |date=October 1964 |title=The Artworld |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=61 |issue=19 |pages=571–584 |doi=10.2307/2022937}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Robert J. Yanal, Danto's essay, in which he coined the term ''artworld'', outlined the first institutional theory of art.

Versions of the institutional theory were formulated more explicitly by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] in his article "Defining Art" (''American Philosophical Quarterly'', 1969) and his books ''Aesthetics: An Introduction'' (1971) and ''Art and the Aesthetic: An Institutional Analysis'' (1974). An early version of Dickie's institutional theory can be summed up in the following definition of [[work of art]] from ''Aesthetics: An Introduction'':
{{quote|A work of art in the classificatory sense is 1) an artifact 2) on which some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld) has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aesthetics, An Introduction |last=Dickie |first=George |authorlink=George Dickie (philosopher) |year=1971 |publisher=Pegasus |isbn=978-0-672-63500-7 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Dickie has reformulated his theory in several books and articles. Other philosophers of art have criticized his definitions as being circular.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Noël |authorlink=Noël Carroll |editor=Robert J. Yanal |title=Institutions of Art: Reconsiderations of George Dickie's Philosophy |year=1994 |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]] |isbn=978-0-271-01078-6 |page=12 |chapter=Identifying Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==

'''Historical theories of art''' hold that for something to be art, it must bear some relation to existing works of art. The correct extension of ‘art’ at time t (the present) includes all the works at time t-1 and additionally any works created in the elapsed time. For these additional works to be ''art'', they must be similar or relate to those previously established artworks. Such a definition begs the question of where this inherited status originated. That is why historical definitions of art must also include a disjunct for first art: something is art if it possesses a historical relation to previous artworks, or is first art.

The philosopher primarily associated with the historical definition of art is [[Jerrold Levinson]] (1979). For Levinson, "a work of art is a thing intended for regard-as-a-work-of-art: regard in any of the ways works of art existing prior to it have been correctly regarded" (1979, p. 234). Levinson further clarifies that by "intends for" he means: “[M]akes, appropriates or conceives for the purpose of'" (1979, p. 236). Some of these manners for regard (at around the present time) are: to be regarded with full attention, to be regarded contemplatively, to be regarded with special notice to appearance, to be regarded with "emotional openness" (1979, p. 237). If an object isn't intended for regard in any of the established ways, then it isn't art.

==Anti-essentialist==
Some art theorists have proposed that the attempt to define art must be abandoned and have instead urged an '''anti-essentialist theory of art'''. In ‘The Role of Theory in Aesthetics’ (1956), [[Morris Weitz]] famously argues that individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions will never be forthcoming for the concept ‘art’ because it is an “open concept”. Weitz describes open concepts as those whose “conditions of application are emendable and corrigible” (1956, p. 31). In the case of borderline cases of art and ''prima facie'' counterexamples, open concepts “call for some sort of decision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover this, or to close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case and its new property” (p. 31 ital. in original). The question of whether a new artifact is art or not, “is not factual, but rather a decision problem, where the verdict turns on whether or not we enlarge our set of conditions for applying the concept” (p. 32). For Weitz, it is “the very expansive, adventurous character of art, its ever-present changes and novel creations,” which makes the concept impossible to capture in a classical definition (as some static univocal essence).

While anti-essentialism was never formally defeated, it was challenged and the debate over anti-essentialist theories was subsequently swept away by seemingly better essentialist definitions. Commenting after Weitz, Berys Gaut revived anti-essentialism in the philosophy of art with his paper ‘“Art” as a Cluster Concept’ (2000). Cluster concepts are composed of criteria that contribute to art status but are not individually necessary for art status. There is one exception: Artworks are created by agents, and so being an artifact is a necessary property for being an artwork. Gaut (2005) offers a set of ten criteria that contribute to art status:

::(i) possessing positive aesthetic qualities (I employ the notion of positive aesthetic qualities here in a narrow sense, comprising beauty and its subspecies); 
::(ii) being expressive of emotion; 
::(iii) being intellectually challenging; 
::(iv) being formally complex and coherent; 
::(v) having a capacity to convey complex meanings; 
::(vi) exhibiting an individual point of view; 
::(vii) being an exercise of creative imagination; 
::(viii) being an artifact or performance that is the product of a high degree of skill; 
::(ix) belonging to an established artistic form; and 
::(x) being the product of an intention to make a work of art. (274)

Satisfying all ten criteria would be sufficient for art, as might any subset formed by nine criteria (this is a consequence of the fact that none of the ten properties is necessary). For example, consider two of Gaut’s criteria: “possessing aesthetic merit” and “being expressive of emotion” (200, p. 28). Neither of these criteria is necessary for art status, but both are parts of subsets of these ten criteria that are sufficient for art status. Gaut’s definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria to be sufficient for art status, which leads to a highly pluralistic theory of art.

The theory of art is also impacted by a philosophical turn in thinking, not only exemplified by the aesthetics of [[Kant]] but is tied more closely to [[ontology]] and [[metaphysics]] in terms of the reflections of [[Heidegger]] on the essence of modern technology and the implications it has on all beings that are reduced to what he calls 'standing reserve', and it is from this perspective on the question of being that he explored art beyond the history, theory, and criticism of artistic production as embodied for instance in his influential opus: [[The Origin of the Work of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;. This has had also an impact on architectural thinking in its philosophical roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic creation==
Zangwill&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''Aesthetic Creation'', OUP 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the '''aesthetic creation theory of art''' as a theory of “how art comes to be produced” (p. 167) and an “artist-based” theory. Zangwill distinguishes three phases in the production of a work of art:

::[F]irst, there is the insight that by creating certain nonaesthetic properties, certain aesthetic properties will be realized; second, there is the intention to realize the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, as envisaged in the insight; and, third, there is the more or less successful action of realizing the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, an envisaged in the insight and intention. (45)

In the creation of an artwork, the insight plays a causal role in bringing about actions sufficient for realizing particular aesthetic properties. Zangwill does not describe this relation in detail, but only says it is “because of” this insight that the aesthetic properties are created. 

Aesthetic properties are instantiated by nonaesthetic properties that “include physical properties, such as shape and size, and secondary qualities, such as colours or sounds.”(37) Zangwill says that aesthetic properties supervene on the nonaesthetic properties: it is because of the particular nonaesthetic properties it has that the work possesses certain aesthetic properties (and not the other way around).

==What is "art"?==
[[File:Siproeta epaphus Galawebdesign.jpg|thumb|Harmony of colours]]

How best to define the term "art" is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term "art".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Davies, ''Definitions of Art'', Cornell University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in his ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' 1969 "It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident."&lt;ref name="Danto2003"&gt;Arthur Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that vary considerably. Furthermore, it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term "art" has changed several times over the centuries, and has continued to evolve during the 20th century as well.

The main recent sense of the word "art" is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or "[[fine art]]." Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the "finer" things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a [[craft]] instead of art, a suggestion which is highly disputed by many [[Studio Craft|Contemporary Craft]] thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered design instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called [[applied art]]. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', Temple University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Art usually implies no function other than to convey or communicate an idea. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that was not trying to be beautiful could not count as art. The [[cubism|cubists]], [[dada]]ists, [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and many later [[art movement]]s struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to [[Danto]], "Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960's but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well."&lt;ref name="Danto2003"/&gt; Perhaps some notion like "expression" (in [[Benedetto Croce|Croce's]] theories) or "counter-environment" (in [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan's]] theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. [[Brian Massumi]] brought back "beauty" into consideration together with "expression".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression," ''CRCL'', '''24''':3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another view, as important to the philosophy of art as "beauty," is that of the "sublime," elaborated upon in the twentieth century by the [[postmodern]] philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. A further approach, elaborated by André Malraux in works such as ''The Voices of Silence'', is that art is fundamentally a response to a metaphysical question ('Art', he writes, 'is an 'anti-destiny'). Malraux argues that, while art has sometimes been oriented towards beauty and the sublime (principally in post-Renaissance European art) these qualities, as the wider history of art demonstrates, are by no means essential to it.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan. ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps (as in Kennick's theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] fashion (as in [[Morris Weitz|Weitz]] or [[Joseph Beuys|Beuys]]). Another approach is to say that "art" is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This "institutional definition of art" (see also [[Institutional Critique]]) has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider the depiction of a store-bought [[Urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the associations that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. If a poet writes down several lines, intending them as a poem, the very procedure by which it is written makes it a poem. Whereas if a journalist writes exactly the same set of words, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. [[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims in his ''What is art?'' (1897) that what decides whether or not something is art is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). '

Marxist attempts to define art focus on its place in the mode of production, such as in [[Walter Benjamin]]'s essay ''The Author as Producer'',&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Walter, ''Understanding Brecht'', trans. Anna Bostock, Verso Books, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-85984-418-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or its political role in class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjinicolaou, Nicos, ''Art History and Class Struggle'', Pluto Press; 1978. {{ISBN|978-0-904383-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revising some concepts of the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gary Tedman]] defines art in terms of social reproduction of the relations of production on the aesthetic level.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, Gary, Aesthetics &amp; Alienation, Zero Books; 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Classificatory disputes about art}}

==What should art be like?==
Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "On Modernist Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dada]]ist [[Tristan Tzara]] on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. "We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits."&lt;ref&gt;Tristan Tzara, [http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/4115716 "Sept Manifestes Dada."]&lt;/ref&gt; Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.

==The value of art==
Tolstoy defined art as the following: "Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them." However, this definition is merely a starting point for his theory of art's value. To some extent, the value of art, for Tolstoy, is one with the value of empathy. However, sometimes empathy is not of value. In chapter fifteen of ''What Is Art?'', Tolstoy says that some feelings are good, but others are bad, and so art is only valuable when it generates empathy or shared feeling for good feelings. For example, Tolstoy asserts that empathy for decadent members of the ruling class makes society worse, rather than better. In chapter sixteen, he asserts that the best art is "universal art" that expresses simple and accessible positive feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Gracyk, "Outline of Tolstoy's What Is Art?", [http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/tolstoy.outline.htm course web page].&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument for the value of art, used in the fictional work ''[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'', proceeds that, if some external force presenting imminent destruction of Earth asked humanity what its value was—what should humanity's response be? The argument continues that the only justification humanity could give for its continued existence would be the past creation and continued creation of things like a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt painting or a Bach concerto. The suggestion is that these are the things of value which define humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Adams]], ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever one might think of this claim — and it does seem to undervalue the many other achievements of which human beings have shown themselves capable, both individually and collectively — it is true that art appears to possess a special capacity to endure ("live on") beyond the moment of its birth, in many cases for centuries or millennia. This capacity of art to endure over time — what precisely it is and how it operates — has been widely neglected in modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, [http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/Art-and-Time1-4438-4400-4.htm ''Art and Time''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318222226/http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/Art-and-Time1-4438-4400-4.htm |date=18 March 2013 }} Cambridge Scholars, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theory of knowledge''' is a required subject in the [[International Baccalaureate]] Diploma Programme. It is similar to [[epistemology]] courses offered at many universities.

==Course description==
Theory of Knowledge is a course created by the IB organization and must not be conceived as pure epistemology. This course involves a process of exploring and sharing students' views on ''"knowledge questions"'' (an umbrella term for "everything that can be approached from a TOK point of view"), so "there is no end to the valid questions that may arise", "there are many different ways to approach TOK," "the sheer scope of the TOK course is daunting" and "teachers and students need the confidence to go too far outside their traditional comfort zones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=3–4 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers are entitled to select a teaching methodology and course material that will convey the theoretical foundation of essential concepts and may provide an environment in which these concepts can be discussed and debated. The focus of the discussion should not be the differentiation between "right" and "wrong" ideas but on the quality of justification and a balanced approach to the knowledge claim in question.

The TOK course uses a combination, in no particular order ("many entry points and sequences are possible"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=6–35 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ways of knowing'': ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], [[faith]], [[imagination]], [[intuition]], [[memory]], and [[language]]). How do we gain knowledge of the world, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each way in which we learn of the world and our place in it. Until the fall of 2014, there were only four ways of knowing ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], and [[language]], but the IB curriculum then changed to include four other ways of knowing: [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[imagination]], [[faith]], and [[memory]]).
* ''Areas of knowledge'' ([[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[religion|religious knowledge systems]], [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]): their distinct natures and methods of gaining knowledge, the types of claim each makes and the issues to consider (e.g., "How do you know that the scientific method is a valid method of gaining knowledge?", "What is the reason for having historical knowledge, and how is it applied in life?"). The IB originally had six areas of knowledge: [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]. In the fall of 2014, the IB curriculum changed to include two more areas of knowledge: [[religion|religious knowledge systems]] and [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]].
* Factors that transcend individual ways of knowing and areas of knowledge:
** ''Nature of knowing'': what are the differences between information, data, belief, faith, opinion, knowledge and wisdom?
** ''Knowledge communities'': what is taken for granted in a community? How can we decide which beliefs we ought to check further?
** ''Knowers' perspective and applications of knowledge'': how do age, education, culture and experience influence selection of sources and formation of knowledge claims? If you know something, or how to do something, do you have a responsibility to use your knowledge? By using different types of AOK ( Areas of knowledge ) and WOK ( Ways of knowing ) you can then start to write counterclaims and claims in different types of texts.

** ''[[Theory of justification|Justifications]] of knowledge claims'': why should claims be assessed critically? Are [[logic]], [[sensory perception]], [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[memory]], [[consensus]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], and [[self-awareness]] equally reliable justifications? Use of [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]], [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[pragmatism]], and [[consensus]] as [[criteria of truth]].

The TOK course is expected to involve 100 teaching hours over the two years of the Diploma Programme.&lt;ref name="TOK_Guide_p3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=3 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having followed the course, students should be competent to analyse knowledge claims and respond to knowledge issues in the context of different areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, expressing ideas accurately and honestly, using examples from their own experiences as learners and in outside life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=5 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Personal knowledge is the systematic assimilation of shared knowledge acquired in different areas of knowledge through a process that vary within disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Knowledge Guide|last=|first=|publisher=International Baccalaureate Organization|year=2013|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=17-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shared knowledge is the accumulation of bodies of knowledge in different areas of knowledge, the media and society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The Knowledge Framework is a scheme that contains five elements: scope and application, language, methodology, historical development and links to personal knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Assessment==
Theory of knowledge is assessed in two parts: an externally examined 1,200–1,600 word essay and an internally assessed presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=41 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part is scored using assessment criteria (four criteria for the essay and four for the presentation) that describe levels of achievement (e.g., ''"The inquiry explores knowledge issues. Most points are justified; most arguments are coherent. Some counterclaims are considered."'' describes level 5–6 in one of the essay criteria). The total score is converted into a grade from A to E. A similar system is used for the [[extended essay]] and students can gain up to 3 points for the diploma based on the grades achieved for TOK and EE. No diploma is awarded if a candidate fails to submit either the TOK essay or TOK presentation, or receives grade E for either the extended essay or theory of knowledge.

===TOK essay===
For each exam session the IB prescribes 6 essay titles from which students must choose, e.g., ''"All knowledge claims should be open to rational criticism. On what grounds and to what extent would you agree with this assertion?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Core: Diploma requirements – 2 Theory of knowledge |title=2009 Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Program |publisher=ibo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each title raises generic cross-disciplinary questions about knowledge, and the student is expected to consider the issues raised in the title and reach conclusions about them. The essay should put forward claims and counterclaims, linking knowledge issues to areas of knowledge and ways of knowing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=44 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and show evidence of original thinking by the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |title="Help" with IB assessment tasks |accessdate=2009-08-11 |publisher=ibo.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420133851/http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essays over the maximum word count of 1,600 are penalised with a one mark reduction, and any content beyond the 1600th word of the essay is not read by the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ibpublishing.ibo.org/exist/rest/app/tsm.xql?doc=d_0_tok_gui_1304_1_e&amp;part=3&amp;chapter=3|title= Assessment Details|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2013 |website= Theory of Knowledge guide|publisher= [[International Baccalaureate Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TOK presentation===
During the Theory of Knowledge course, students must plan and deliver at least one (in individual or small group, maximum three students) presentation to the class. The topic is based on a real-life situation of interest to the student, e.g. "Reliability of media reporting of science", "What makes something a work of art?" and the presentation is expected to show why the topic is significant, linking it to a relevant main knowledge question (KQ), and discussing those issues and examining the implications of approaching the question from different perspectives, given by WOKs (ways of knowing), taken through one or two of the AOKs (Areas of knowledge). Teachers have wide latitude to help with topic selection and identifying suitable approaches. About ten minutes should be allowed for each presenter, and almost any form is permitted (e.g. debates, games, skits, interviews etc.) except reading an essay aloud. If a candidate reads an essay, they are very likely to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=46–50, 57–60 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://presentationexamples.org/tok-presentation-example/ | title= Theory of knowledge presentation: Tips and Pitfalls | work=presentationexamples.org |date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Thomas Aquinas''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|w|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-it|Tommaso d'Aquino}}, lit. "Thomas of [[Aquino, Italy|Aquino]]"; 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="JPC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Saint Thomas Aquinas|last=Conway|first=John Placid|year=1911|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBV"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Labours of St. Thomas of Aquin: Vol.I|last=Rev. Vaughan|first=Roger Bede|year=1871|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], [[Catholic priest]], and [[Doctor of the Church]]. He was an immensely influential [[List of Catholic philosophers and theologians|philosopher]], [[Catholic theology|theologian]], and [[jurist]] in the tradition of [[scholasticism]], within which he is also known as the '''''Doctor Angelicus''''' and the '''''Doctor Communis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;See Pius XI, ''Studiorum Ducem'' 11 (29 June 1923), AAS, XV ("non modo Angelicum, sed etiam Communem seu Universalem Ecclesiae Doctorem"). The title ''Doctor Communis'' dates to the fourteenth century; the title ''Doctor Angelicus'' dates to the fifteenth century, see Walz, ''Xenia Thomistica'', III, p. 164 n. 4. [[Tolomeo da Lucca]] writes in ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (1317): "This man is supreme among modern teachers of philosophy and theology, and indeed in every subject. And such is the common view and opinion, so that nowadays in the [[University of Paris]] they call him the ''Doctor Communis'' because of the outstanding clarity of his teaching." ''Historia Eccles.'' xxiii, c. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Aquinas'' identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day [[Lazio]], [[Italy]].

He was the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]] and the father of [[Thomism]]; of which he argued that [[reason]] is found in God. His influence on [[Western thought]] is considerable, and much of [[modern philosophy]] developed or opposed his ideas, particularly in the areas of ethics, [[natural law]], [[metaphysics]], and political theory. Unlike many currents in the Church of the time,&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas embraced several ideas put forward by [[Aristotle]]—whom he called "the Philosopher"—and attempted to synthesize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] with the principles of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouthapologia.org/articles/show/125 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913011656/http://www.dartmouthapologia.org/articles/show/125 |archivedate=13 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known works are the ''Disputed Questions on Truth'' (1256–59), the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' (1259–1265), and the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' (1265–1274). His commentaries on [[Scripture]] and on Aristotle also form an important part of his body of work. Furthermore, Thomas is distinguished for his [[eucharistic]] hymns, which form a part of the Church's liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31211/Saint-Thomas-Aquinas&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] honors Thomas Aquinas as a [[saint]] and regards him as the model teacher for those studying for the priesthood, and indeed the highest expression of both natural reason and [[speculative reason|speculative]] [[theology]]. In modern times, under papal directives, the study of his works was long used as a core of the required program of study for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons, as well as for those in religious formation and for other students of the sacred disciplines (philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]).&lt;ref&gt;Code of [[Canon Law]], Can. 252, §3 {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508022209/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM |archivedate=8 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Aquinas is considered one of the Catholic Church's greatest theologians and philosophers. [[Pope Benedict XV]] declared: "This (Dominican) Order ... acquired new luster when the Church declared the teaching of Thomas to be her own and that Doctor, honored with the special praises of the Pontiffs, the master and patron of Catholic schools."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]] Encyclical [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_29061921_fausto-appetente-die_en.html ''Fausto appetente die''] 29 June 1921, AAS 13 (1921), 332; [[Pius XI]] Encyclical ''Studiorum Ducem'' §11, 29 June 1923, AAS 15 (1923), cf. AAS 17 (1925) 574; [[Paul VI]], 7 March 1964 AAS 56 (1964), 302 (Bouscaren, vol. VI, pp. 786–88).&lt;/ref&gt; The English philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] considers Thomas to be "one of the dozen greatest philosophers of the western world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|title=Selected Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192835858|pages=Xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life (1225–1244)===
Thomas was most probably born in the castle of [[Roccasecca]], [[Aquino, Italy|Aquino]], in the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (present-day [[Lazio]], Italy), {{circa|1225}},{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} According to some authors,{{who|date=November 2015}} he was born in the castle of his father, Landulf of Aquino. Though he did not belong to the most powerful branch of the family, Landulf of Aquino was a man of means. As a knight in the service of [[Roger II of Sicily|King Roger II]], he held the title ''[[Knight|miles]]''. Thomas's mother, Theodora, belonged to the Rossi branch of the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] Caracciolo family.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Torrell, ''Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Person And His Work'', CUA press, 2005, p. 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1KUS-cBJmqoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=thomas+aquinas+neapolitan+rossi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rjnI8obBC_&amp;sig=pein7EBD6Mjb6jYxSLcKscX8ARY&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ke8uUPezE8vV4QSztYCIBw&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20aquinas%20neapolitan%20rossi&amp;f=false Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; Landulf's brother Sinibald was [[abbot]] of the first [[Order of St. Benedictine|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Monte Cassino]]. While the rest of the family's sons pursued military careers,&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the family intended for Thomas to follow his uncle into the abbacy;&lt;ref name="stump3"&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; this would have been a normal career path for a younger son of southern Italian nobility.&lt;ref name="schaff-422"&gt;Schaff, Philip (1953). ''Thomas Aquinas'', pp. 422–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five Thomas began his early education at Monte Cassino but after the military conflict between the [[Emperor Frederick II]] and [[Pope Gregory IX]] spilled into the abbey in early 1239, Landulf and Theodora had Thomas enrolled at the ''[[studium generale]]'' ([[University of Naples Federico II|university]]) recently established by Frederick in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Thomas was probably introduced to [[Aristotle]], [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]], all of whom would influence his theological philosophy.&lt;ref name="davies2"&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during his study at Naples that Thomas came under the influence of John of St. Julian, a Dominican preacher in Naples, who was part of the active effort by the Dominican order to recruit devout followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There his teacher in arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music was [[Petrus de Ibernia]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabmann, Martin. Virgil Michel, trans. ''Thomas Aquinas: His Personality and Thought.'' (Kessinger Publishing, 2006), pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castello di Monte San Giovanni Campano 9.JPG|The Castle of [[Monte San Giovanni Campano]]|thumb|left]]

At the age of nineteen Thomas resolved to join the recently founded [[Dominican Order]]. Thomas's change of heart did not please his family.&lt;ref&gt;Collison, Diane, and Kathryn Plant. ''Fifty Major Philosophers.'' 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to prevent Theodora's interference in Thomas's choice, the Dominicans arranged to move Thomas to Rome, and from Rome, to Paris.&lt;ref name="Hampden23"&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while on his journey to Rome, per Theodora's instructions, his brothers seized him as he was drinking from a spring and took him back to his parents at the castle of [[Monte San Giovanni Campano]].&lt;ref name="Hampden23"/&gt;

Thomas was held prisoner for almost one year in the family castles at Monte San Giovanni and Roccasecca in an attempt to prevent him from assuming the Dominican habit and to push him into renouncing his new aspiration.&lt;ref name="davies2"/&gt; Political concerns prevented the Pope from ordering Thomas's release, which had the effect of extending Thomas's detention.&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas passed this time of trial tutoring his sisters and communicating with members of the Dominican Order.&lt;ref name="davies2"/&gt; Family members became desperate to dissuade Thomas, who remained determined to join the Dominicans. At one point, two of his brothers resorted to the measure of hiring a prostitute to seduce him. According to legend, Thomas drove her away wielding a fire iron and two angels appeared to him as he slept and strengthened his determination to remain celibate.&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Thomas Aquinas Diego Velázquez.jpg|right|thumb|[[Diego Velázquez]], Thomas is girded by angels with a mystical belt of purity after his [[Chastity|proof of chastity]]]]

By 1244, seeing that all of her attempts to dissuade Thomas had failed, Theodora sought to save the family's dignity, arranging for Thomas to escape at night through his window. In her mind, a secret escape from detention was less damaging than an open surrender to the Dominicans. Thomas was sent first to Naples and then to Rome to meet [[Johannes von Wildeshausen]], the [[Master General of the Dominican Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris, Cologne, Albert Magnus, and first Paris regency (1245–1259)===
In 1245 Thomas was sent to study at the Faculty of the Arts at the [[University of Paris]], where he most likely met Dominican scholar [[Albertus Magnus]],&lt;ref name="healy2"&gt;Healy, ''Theologian'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; then the holder of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; When Albertus was sent by his superiors to teach at the new ''studium generale'' at Cologne in 1248,&lt;ref name="healy2"/&gt; Thomas followed him, declining [[Pope Innocent IV]]'s offer to appoint him abbot of Monte Cassino as a Dominican.&lt;ref name="stump3"/&gt; Albertus then appointed the reluctant Thomas ''magister studentium''.&lt;ref name="schaff-422"/&gt; Because Thomas was quiet and didn't speak much, some of his fellow students thought he was slow. But Albertus prophetically exclaimed: "You call him the dumb ox, but in his teaching he will one day produce such a bellowing that it will be heard throughout the world."&lt;ref name="stump3"/&gt;

Thomas taught in Cologne as an apprentice professor (''baccalaureus biblicus''), instructing students on the books of the Old Testament and writing ''Expositio super Isaiam ad litteram'' (''Literal Commentary on Isaiah''), ''Postilla super Ieremiam'' (''Commentary on Jeremiah'') and ''Postilla super Threnos'' (''Commentary on Lamentations'').&lt;ref&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1252 he returned to Paris to study for the master's degree in theology. He lectured on the Bible as an apprentice professor, and upon becoming a ''baccalaureus Sententiarum'' (bachelor of the ''Sentences'')&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''The Thought'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; devoted his final three years of study to commenting on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]''. In the first of his four theological syntheses, Thomas composed a massive commentary on the ''Sentences'' titled ''Scriptum super libros Sententiarium'' (''Commentary on the Sentences''). Aside from his masters writings, he wrote ''De ente et essentia'' (''On Being and Essence'') for his fellow Dominicans in Paris.&lt;ref name="stump3"/&gt;

In the spring of 1256 Thomas was appointed regent master in theology at Paris and one of his first works upon assuming this office was ''Contra impugnantes Dei cultum et religionem'' (''Against Those Who Assail the Worship of God and Religion''), defending the [[mendicant order]]s, which had come under attack by [[William of Saint-Amour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = On Evil | author=Aquinas, Thomas |author2=Richard J. Regan |author3=Brian Davies  | publisher=Oxford University Press US | year = 2003 | page = 5 | isbn = 0-19-509183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure from 1256 to 1259, Thomas wrote numerous works, including: ''Questiones disputatae de veritate'' (''Disputed Questions on Truth''), a collection of twenty-nine disputed questions on aspects of faith and the human condition&lt;ref name="stump4"&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; prepared for the public university debates he presided over on [[Lent]] and [[Advent]];&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quaestiones quodlibetales'' (''Quodlibetal Questions''), a collection of his responses to questions posed to him by the academic audience;&lt;ref name="stump4"/&gt; and both ''Expositio super librum Boethii De trinitate'' (''Commentary on Boethius's De trinitate'') and ''Expositio super librum Boethii De hebdomadibus'' (''Commentary on Boethius's De hebdomadibus''), commentaries on the works of 6th-century Roman philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].&lt;ref name="stumpxvii"&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his regency, Thomas was working on one of his most famous works, ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.&lt;ref name="davies4"&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naples, Orvieto, Rome (1259–1268)===
In 1259 Thomas completed his first regency at the ''studium generale'' and left Paris so that others in his order could gain this teaching experience. He returned to Naples where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to [[Orvieto]] as conventual lector he was responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a ''[[studium generale]]''. In Orvieto Thomas completed his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', wrote the ''Catena aurea'' (''The Golden Chain''),&lt;ref name="healy4"&gt;Healy, ''Theologian'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and produced works for [[Pope Urban IV]] such as the liturgy for the newly created [[feast of Corpus Christi]] and the ''[[Contra Errores Graecorum|Contra errores graecorum]]'' (''Against the Errors of the Greeks'').&lt;ref name="davies4"/&gt; Some of the hymns that Thomas wrote for the [[feast of Corpus Christi]] are still sung today, such as the ''Pange lingua, Tantum ergo'', and ''Panis angelicus.'' Modern scholarship has confirmed that Thomas was indeed the author of these texts, a point that some had contested.&lt;ref name="Torrell"&gt;Torrell,  "Saint Thomas Aquinas", pp. 129–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1265 the newly elected [[Pope Clement IV]] summoned Thomas to Rome to serve as papal theologian. This same year he was ordered by the Dominican Chapter of Agnani&lt;ref&gt;''Fr. Thome de Aquino iniungimus in remissionem peccatorum quod teneat studium Rome, et volumus quod fratribus qui stant secum ad studendum provideatur in necessariis vestimentis a conventibus de quorum predicatione traxerunt originem.

Prior to this time the Roman Province had offered no specialized education of any sort, no arts, no philosophy; only simple convent schools, with their basic courses in theology for resident friars, were functioning in Tuscany and the meridionale during the first several decades of the order's life. The new ''studium provinciale'' at [[Santa Sabina]] was to be a more advanced school for the province.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Michèle Mulchahey, "First the bow is bent in study": Dominican education before 1350, 1998, pp. 278–79.

While at the [[Santa Sabina]] ''studium provinciale'' Thomas began his most famous work, the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'',&lt;ref name="healy4"/&gt; which he conceived of specifically as suited to beginning students: "Because a doctor of Catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3:1–2, ''as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat'', our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa theologiae'', I, 1, prooemium:"Quia Catholicae veritatis doctor non solum provectos debet instruere, sed ad eum pertinet etiam incipientes erudire, secundum illud apostoli I ad Corinth. III, tanquam parvulis in Christo, lac vobis potum dedi, non escam; propositum nostrae intentionis in hoc opere est, ea quae ad Christianam religionem pertinent, eo modo tradere, secundum quod congruit ad eruditionem incipientium."&lt;/ref&gt; While there he also wrote a variety of other works like his unfinished ''Compendium Theologiae'' and ''Responsio ad fr. Ioannem Vercellensem de articulis 108 sumptis ex opere Petri de Tarentasia'' (''Reply to Brother John of Vercelli Regarding 108 Articles Drawn from the Work of Peter of Tarentaise'').&lt;ref name="stumpxvii"/&gt; In his position as head of the ''studium'' Thomas conducted a series of important disputations on the power of God, which he compiled into his ''De potentia''.&lt;ref name="davies5"/&gt; Nicholas Brunacci [1240–1322] was among Thomas's students at the [[Santa Sabina]] ''studium provinciale'' and later at the Paris ''studium generale''. In November 1268 he was with Thomas and his associate and secretary [[Reginald of Piperno]], as they left Viterbo on their way to Paris to begin the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;http://aquinatis.blogspot.com/2008/05/vida-de-santo-toms-de-aquino.html Accessed 22 June 2011: "A mediados de noviembre abandonó Santo Tomás la ciudad de Viterbo en compañía de fray Reginaldo de Piperno y su discípulo fray Nicolás Brunacci."  http://www.brunacci.it/s--tommaso.html Accessed 22 June 2011.  http://www.brunacci.it/s--tommaso.html Accessed 22 June 2011: "Per l'acutezza del suo ingegno, dopo aver studiato nella sua provincia, ebbe l'alto onore di accompagnare S. Tommaso a Parigi nel novembre del 1268.

Thomas remained at the ''studium'' at [[Santa Sabina]] from 1265 until he was called back to Paris in 1268 for a second teaching regency.&lt;ref name="davies5"&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure for Paris in 1268 and the passage of time the pedagogical activities of the ''studium provinciale'' at [[Santa Sabina]] were divided between two campuses. A new [[convent]] of the Order at the Church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] had a modest beginning in 1255 as a community for women converts, but grew rapidly in size and importance after being given over to the Dominicans friars in 1275.&lt;ref&gt;Compendium Historiae Ordinis Praedicatorum, A.M.

In the 20th century the college was relocated to the convent of [[Santi Domenico e Sisto|Saints Dominic and Sixtus]] and was transformed into the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].

===Quarrelsome second Paris regency (1269–1272)===
[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli - Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas - WGA10334.jpg|thumb| left|upright=0.7| ''Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas'', "Doctor Communis", between Plato and Aristotle, [[Benozzo Gozzoli]],1471. Louvre, Paris]]

In 1268 the Dominican order assigned Thomas to be regent master at the University of Paris for a second time, a position he held until the spring of 1272. Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of "[[Averroism]]" or "radical [[Aristotelianism]]" in the universities. In response to these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes'' (''On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers''),&lt;ref name="davies5"/&gt; the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.&lt;ref name="stump11"&gt;Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes with some important [[Franciscans]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266–67 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the "blind leaders of the blind". [[Eleonore Stump]] says, "It has also been persuasively argued that Aquinas's ''De aeternitate mundi'' was directed in particular against his Franciscan colleague in theology, [[John Pecham]]."&lt;ref name="stump11"/&gt;

In reality, Thomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [[Siger of Brabant]] teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, ''Reader'', pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [[Etienne Tempier]], issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, ''Against the Averroists'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called Augustinians, were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: ''De virtutibus in communi'' (''On Virtues in General''), ''De virtutibus cardinalibus'' (''On Cardinal Virtues''), ''De spe'' (''On Hope'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Reader'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final days and "straw" (1272–1274)===
[[File:Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Icon of the crucifixion speaking to Thomas Aquinas is depicted on this stained glass window in [[Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio)]]]]
In 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a ''studium generale'' wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased. He chose to establish the institution in Naples, and moved there to take his post as regent master.&lt;ref name="davies5"/&gt; He took his time at Naples to work on the third part of the ''Summa'' while giving lectures on various religious topics. He also preached to the people of Naples every day in Lent, 1273. These sermons on the commandments, the creed, the Our Father, and Hail Mary were very popular.&lt;ref&gt;James Weisheipl, OP ''Friar Thomas D'Aquino: His Life, Thought, and Work.'' (Doubleday, 1974), p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one occasion, at 1273 at the Dominican convent of Naples in the chapel of [[Saint Nicholas]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.desales.edu/~philtheo/loughlin/ATP/Sermons/Nicholas_Essay.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Matins]], Thomas lingered and was seen by the [[sacristan]] Domenic of Caserta to be levitating in prayer with tears before an icon of the crucified Christ. Christ said to Thomas, "You have written well of me, Thomas. What reward would you have for your labor?" Thomas responded, "Nothing but you, Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Guilelmus de Tocco, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iuDhWSLoah8C&amp; ''Ystoria sancti Thome de Aquino de Guillaume de Tocco (1323)''], Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1996, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14663b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14663b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Thomas Aquinas|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this exchange something happened, but Thomas never spoke of it or wrote it down.

On 6 December 1273, another mystical experience took place. While he was celebrating Mass, he experienced an unusually long ecstasy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Because of what he saw, he abandoned his routine and refused to dictate to his ''socius'' [[Reginald of Piperno]]. When Reginald begged him to get back to work, Thomas replied: "Reginald, I cannot, because all that I have written seems like straw to me"&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''The Thought'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; (''mihi videtur ut palea'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Development and Meaning of Twentieth-century Existentialism | author=McBride, William Leon | publisher=Taylor and Francis | year = 1997 | page = 131 | isbn = 0-8153-2491-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Summa Theologica would remain uncompleted. What exactly triggered Thomas's change in behavior is believed by Catholics to have been some kind of supernatural experience of God.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;McInerny, Ralph and John O'Callaghan, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/ Saint Thomas Aquinas]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; After taking to his bed, he did recover some strength.&lt;ref name="-healy7"&gt;Healy, ''Theologian'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1054 the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] had occurred between the [[Latin Church]] following the [[Pope]] (known as the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) in the West, and the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in the East (known as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]). Looking to find a way to reunite the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, [[Pope Gregory X]] convened the [[Second Council of Lyon]] to be held on 1 May 1274 and summoned Thomas to attend.&lt;ref name="nichols18"&gt;Nichols, ''Discovering Aquinas'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Thomas's work for Pope Urban IV concerning the Greeks, ''Contra errores graecorum'', was to be presented.&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to the Council, riding on a donkey along the [[Appian Way]],&lt;ref name="nichols18" /&gt; he struck his head on the branch of a fallen tree and became seriously ill again. He was then quickly escorted to [[Monte Cassino]] to convalesce.&lt;ref name="-healy7" /&gt; After resting for a while, he set out again, but stopped at the [[Cistercian]] [[Fossanova Abbey]] after again falling ill.&lt;ref name="healy8"&gt;Healy, ''Theologian'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The monks nursed him for several days,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, ''Reader'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and as he received his [[last rites]] he prayed: "I have written and taught much about this very holy Body, and about the other sacraments in the faith of Christ, and about the Holy Roman Church, to whose correction I expose and submit everything I have written."&lt;ref&gt;Torrell,  "Saint Thomas Aquinas", p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 7 March 1274&lt;ref name="healy8" /&gt; while giving commentary on the [[Song of Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of levitation===
{{See also|Saints and levitation}}
For centuries, there have been recurring claims that Thomas had the ability to [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]]. For example, [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote that, "His experiences included well-attested cases of levitation in ecstasy; and the Blessed Virgin appeared to him, comforting him with the welcome news that he would never be a Bishop."&lt;ref&gt;[[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote an [http://chesterton.org/gkc/theologian/aquinas.htm Essay on St. Thomas Aquinas], which appeared in [[The Spectator]] 27 Feb. 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation of 1277===
{{see also|Condemnations of 1210–1277}}

In 1277 [[Étienne Tempier]], the same bishop of Paris who had issued the condemnation of 1270, issued another more extensive condemnation. One aim of this condemnation was to clarify that God's absolute power transcended any principles of logic that [[Aristotle]] or [[Averroes]] might place on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts | author=Grant, Edward | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 1996 | pages = 81–82 | isbn = 0-521-56762-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it contained a list of 219 propositions that the bishop had determined to violate the omnipotence of God, and included in this list were twenty Thomistic propositions. Their inclusion badly damaged Thomas's reputation for many years.&lt;ref name="Kung112"&gt;Hans Küng (1994), ''Christian Thinkers'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DoelY_m7Ry4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Hans+Kung++Great+Christian+Thinkers++%22at+first+regarded+as+heresy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=isH_TZT8AtO10AH845XgCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], pp. 112–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] sees the glorified soul of Thomas in the Heaven of the Sun with the other great exemplars of religious wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Enface?Paradiso?10???148?1???0??1?1 |title=''Parad''. x. 99 |publisher=Divinecomedy.org |accessdate=2010-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726001218/http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display%3FEnface%3FParadiso%3F10%3F%3F%3F148%3F1%3F%3F%3F0%3F%3F1%3F1 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]] asserts that Thomas died by poisoning, on the order of [[Charles of Anjou]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display?Enface?Purgatorio?20???151?1???0??1?1 |title=''Purg''. xx. 69 |publisher=Divinecomedy.org |accessdate=2010-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726001228/http://www.divinecomedy.org/divine_comedy.php3?display%3FEnface%3FPurgatorio%3F20%3F%3F%3F151%3F1%3F%3F%3F0%3F%3F1%3F1 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villani (ix. 218) cites this belief, and the ''[[Anonimo Fiorentino]]'' describes the crime and its motive. But the historian [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]] reproduces the account made by one of Thomas's friends, and this version of the story gives no hint of foul play.&lt;ref name="britannica-250"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Thomas Aquinas|year=1911|page=250|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas's theology had begun its rise to prestige. Two centuries later, in 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] proclaimed St. Thomas Aquinas a [[Doctor of the Church]] and ranked his feast with those of the four great Latin fathers: [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]] and [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory]].&lt;ref name="britannica-250"/&gt; At the Council of Trent, Thomas had the honor of having his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' placed on the altar alongside the Bible and the [[Decretals]].&lt;ref name="Kung112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullady"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/columns/guests/brianmullady/thomasaquinas.asp |title=The Angelic Doctor – Thomas Aquinas |author=[http://fatherbtm.com/ Brian Mullady, O.P.] |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007031948/http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/columns/guests/brianmullady/thomasaquinas.asp |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[encyclical]] of 4 August 1879, ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'', [[Pope Leo XIII]] stated that Thomas Aquinas's theology was a definitive exposition of Catholic doctrine. Thus, he directed the clergy to take the teachings of Thomas as the basis of their theological positions. Leo XIII also decreed that all Catholic seminaries and universities must teach Thomas's doctrines, and where Thomas did not speak on a topic, the teachers were "urged to teach conclusions that were reconcilable with his thinking." In 1880, Saint Thomas Aquinas was declared patron of all Catholic educational establishments.&lt;ref name="britannica-250"/&gt;

===Canonization===

When the [[devil's advocate]] at his [[canonization]] process objected that there were no [[miracle]]s, one of the cardinals answered, "''Tot miraculis, quot articulis''"—"there are as many miracles (in his life) as articles (in his [[Summa Theologica|''Summa'']])".&lt;ref name="Mullady"/&gt; Fifty years after Thomas's death, on 18 July 1323, [[Pope John XXII]], seated in [[Avignon]], pronounced Thomas a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A monastery at Naples, near the cathedral of [[St. Januarius]], shows a cell in which he supposedly lived.&lt;ref name="britannica-250"/&gt; His remains were placed in the [[Church of the Jacobins]] in [[Toulouse]] on 28 January 1369. Between 1789 and 1974, they were held in the [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse]]. In 1974, they were returned to the Church of the Jacobins, where they have remained ever since.

When he was canonized, his feast day was inserted in the [[General Roman Calendar]] for celebration on 7 March, the day of his death. Since this date commonly falls within [[Lent]], the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision of the calendar]] moved his [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]] to 28 January, the date of the translation of his relics to [[Church of the Jacobins]], [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liturgy of the Hours'' Volume III, Proper of Saints, 28 January.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Aquinas is honored with a [[feast day]] in some churches of the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Philosophy==
{{Thomism}}
{{Main|Thomism}}

Thomas Aquinas was a theologian and a [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Some would not describe Thomas as a philosopher. See, e.g., Mark D. Jordan, "Philosophy in a ''Summa of Theology''", in ''Rewritten Theology: Aquinas after his Readers'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2006) pp. 154–70. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TS3XmU5mTrgC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Mark+D.+Jordan,+%22Philosophy+in+a+Summa+of+Theology%22,+in+Rewritten+Theology:+Aquinas+after+his+Readers&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never considered himself a philosopher, and criticized philosophers, whom he saw as pagans, for always "falling short of the true and proper wisdom to be found in Christian revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Aquinas|last= Davies|first= Brian|year=2004 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn= |page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, Thomas did have respect for Aristotle, so much so that in the ''Summa'', he often cites Aristotle simply as "the Philosopher", a designation frequently used at that time. Much of his work bears upon philosophical topics, and in this sense may be characterized as philosophical. Thomas' philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general. Thomas stands as a vehicle and modifier of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. It is said that Thomas modified both [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] by way of heavy reliance on the [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Commentaries on Aristotle===
Thomas Aquinas wrote several important commentaries on [[Aristotle]]'s works, including ''[[On the Soul]]'', ''On Interpretation'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. His work is associated with [[William of Moerbeke]]'s translations of Aristotle from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] into [[Latin]].

===Epistemology===
{{see also|Double truth}}

Thomas Aquinas believed "that for the knowledge of any truth whatsoever man needs divine help, that the intellect may be moved by God to its act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-thomas-aquinas/ |title=Blog Archive " Saint Thomas Aquinas |publisher=Saints.SQPN.com |date=22 October 1974 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believed that human beings have the natural capacity to know many things without special [[divine revelation]], even though such revelation occurs from time to time, "especially in regard to such (truths) as pertain to faith."&lt;ref name="Summa I-II Q109a1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q109_A1.html#FS_Q109_A1-p9|title=''Summa'', I–II, Q109a1 |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this is the light that is given to man by God according to man's nature: "Now every form bestowed on created things by God has power for a determined act[uality], which it can bring about in proportion to its own proper endowment; and beyond which it is powerless, except by a superadded form, as water can only heat when heated by the fire. And thus the human understanding has a form, viz. intelligible light, which of itself is sufficient for knowing certain intelligible things, viz. those we can come to know through the senses."&lt;ref name="Summa I-II Q109a1" /&gt;

===Ethics===
{{see also|Christian ethics}}

Thomas' ethics are based on the concept of "first principles of action".&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, p. 727.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'', he wrote:

{{quote|Virtue denotes a certain perfection of a power. Now a thing's perfection is considered chiefly in regard to its end. But the end of power is act. Wherefore power is said to be perfect, according as it is determinate to its act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q55_A1.html#FS_Q55_A1-p8 |title=''Summa'', Q55a1 |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas emphasized that "[[Synderesis]] is said to be the law of our mind, because it is a habit containing the precepts of the natural law, which are the first principles of human actions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conscience-medieval/#BM3 3. Aquinas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, First Part of the Second Part, Question 94 Reply Obj. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas "…all acts of virtue are prescribed by the natural law: since each one's reason naturally dictates to him to act virtuously. But if we speak of virtuous acts, considered in themselves, i.e., in their proper species, thus not all virtuous acts are prescribed by the natural law: for many things are done virtuously, to which nature does not incline at first; but that, through the inquiry of reason, have been found by men to be conductive to well living." Therefore, we must determine if we are speaking of virtuous acts as under the aspect of virtuous or as an act in its species.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Question 94, A.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas defined the four [[cardinal virtues]] as [[prudence]], [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[courage|fortitude]]. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three [[theological virtues]]: [[faith]], [[hope]], and [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:

{{quote|Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason. On the other hand, the object of the intellectual and moral virtues is something comprehensible to human reason. Wherefore the theological virtues are specifically distinct from the moral and intellectual virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q62_A2.html#FS_Q62_A2-p6 |title=''Summa'', Q62a2 |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Aquinas wrote "[Greed] is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/SS/SS118.html#SSQ118A1THEP1 Summa Theologica], Second Part of the Second Part, Question 118, Article 1. Retrieved 26 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Thomas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, [[Natural law|natural]], human, and [[Divine law|divine]]. ''Eternal law'' is the decree of God that governs all creation. It is, "That Law which is the Supreme Reason cannot be understood to be otherwise than unchangeable and eternal."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas Summa Theologica q91 a1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natural law'' is the human "participation" in the ''eternal law'' and is discovered by [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pojman, Louis | authorlink = Louis Pojman | title = Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company | location = Belmont, California | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-534-56138-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natural law'' is based on "[[first principles]]":

{{quote|. . . this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this . . .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q94_A2.html#FS_Q94_A2-p7 |title=''Summa'', Q94a2 |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Whether the natural law contains several precepts, or one only is explained by Thomas, "All the inclinations of any parts whatsoever of human nature, e.g., of the concupiscible and irascible parts, in so far as they are ruled by reason, belong to the natural law, and are reduced to one first precept, as stated above: so that the precepts of the natural law are many in themselves, but are based on one common foundation."&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, Question 94, Second Article Reply Obj.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Thomas among those basic (natural) human values on which all human values are based. According to Thomas, all human tendencies are geared towards real human goods. In this case, the human nature in question is marriage, the total gift of oneself to another that ensures a family for children and a future for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=IV In Sententiae. d. 27 q. 1 a.1|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/snp4027.html|work=Commentary|accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the dual inclination of the action of love: "towards the good which a man wishes to someone (to himself or to another) and towards that to which he wishes some good".&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I–II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the Human Law, Thomas concludes, "...that just as, in the speculative reason, from naturally known indemonstrable principles, we draw the conclusions of the various sciences, the knowledge of which is not imparted to us by nature, but acquired by the efforts of reason, so to it is from the precepts of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that human reason needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws, provided the other essential conditions of law be observed...."
Human law is [[positive law]]: the natural law applied by governments to societies.&lt;ref&gt;Summa,Q.94, A.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural and human law is not adequate alone. The need for human behavior to be directed made it necessary to have Divine law. Divine law is the specially revealed law in the [[scriptures]]. Thomas quotes, "The Apostle says (Hebrews 7.12): The priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law. But the priesthood is twofold, as stated in the same passage, viz, the levitical priesthood, and the priesthood of Christ. Therefore the Divine law is twofold, namely, the Old Law and the New Law."&lt;ref&gt;Summa, Q.94, A.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas also greatly influenced Catholic understandings of [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]]s.

Thomas Aquinas refers to animals as dumb and that the natural order has declared animals for man's use. Thomas denied that human beings have any duty of charity to animals because they are not persons. Otherwise, it would be unlawful to kill them for food. But humans should still be charitable to them, for "cruel habits might carry over into our treatment of human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | contribution = Animals: Peter Singer | contribution-url = http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1995----04.htm | editor-first = Ted | editor-last = Honderich | title = The Oxford Companion to Philosophy | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | pages = 35–36 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, second Part of the Second Part, Question 64. Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas contributed to [[History of economic thought#Middle Ages|economic thought]] as an aspect of ethics and justice. He dealt with the concept of a [[just price]], normally its market price or a regulated price sufficient to cover seller [[costs of production]]. He argued it was immoral for sellers to raise their prices simply because buyers were in pressing need for a product.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica. "Of Cheating, Which Is Committed in Buying and Selling". Translated by The Fathers of the English Dominican Province [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-2.1.2-1st.pdf] Retrieved 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Gordon (1987). "Aquinas, St Thomas (1225–1274)", v. 1, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political order===

Thomas's theory of political order became highly influential. He sees man as a social being that lives in a community and interacts with its other members. That leads, among other things, to the [[division of labour]].

Thomas made a distinction between a good man and a good citizen, which was important to the development of [[libertarian]] theory. That is, the sphere of [[individual autonomy]] was one which the state could not interfere with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first= George S. |author-link= George H. Smith| editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title= Aquinas, Thomas (c. 1225–1274) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n11|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |page= 18 |quote=Individuals, therefore, have a private 'sphere of action which is distinct from the whole.'|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas thinks that [[monarchy]] is the best form of government, because a monarch does not have to form compromises with other persons. Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.

According to Thomas, monarchs are God's representatives in their territories, but the Church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church's doctrines and determinations.

Following Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''.

Thomas Aquinas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are "human" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.

In his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' Thomas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as "the first principle of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Aquinas | first1 = Thomas | title = Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas | chapter = Question 75, Article 1 | volume = Second and Revised Edition | editors = Literally Translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province | year = 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as "the operation of anything follows the mode of its being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Aquinas | first1 = Thomas | title = Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas | chapter = Question 75, Article 3 | volume = Second and Revised Edition | editors = Literally Translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province | year = 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that "something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body", and "a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Aquinas | first1 = Thomas | title = Summa Contra Gentiles | chapter = 5 volumes. | editors = Translated by Anton C. Pegis et al | publisher=U. of Notre Dame Press | year = 1975 | location = Notre Dame, Ind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul is a "[[substantial form]]"; it is a part of a substance, but it is not a substance by itself. Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.

These distinctions can be better understood in the light of Thomas's understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] ("matter/form") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance—what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Thomas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.

==Theology==
{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}
[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]
Thomas Aquinas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary—or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary—for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas's mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is [[Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit]]. [[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy nature, but perfects it.

===Revelation===
Thomas believed that truth is known through reason ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called "Tradition". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.

Though one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hankey|first1=Wayne|title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=CSU East Bay|isbn=978-0-415-78295-1|pages=134–35|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preserving nature within grace====
Revealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ "according to genus". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).

Faith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.

===Creation===
[[File:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]
As a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the "maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible." Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:

{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated. Hence animals generated from the corruption of inanimate things, or of plants, may have been generated then.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP072.html#FPQ72OUTP1 ''Summa Theologica''], ''On the Work of the Sixth Day, Reply to Objection 5'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Tommaso - Super Physicam Aristotelis, 1595 - 4733624.tif|thumb|''Super Physicam Aristotelis'', 1595]]
Additionally Thomas considered [[Empedocles]]'s theory that various mutated [[species]] emerged at the dawn of Creation. Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':

{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the 'ox-progeny', i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Physics2.htm#14 Physica], ''Book 2, Lecture 14'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Just war===
{{See also|Just War}}
[[Augustine of Hippo]] agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. For example, he routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=28 July 2012 }}, Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, some special characteristics sets apart "war" from "schism", "brawling", and "sedition". While it would be contradictory to speak of a "just schism", a "just brawling" or a "just sedition" (the three terms denote sin and sin only) "war" alone permits sub classification into good and bad kinds. Curiously, however, Augustine does not work up a terminological contrast between "just" and "unjust" war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reichberg |first=Gregory |title=Thomas Aquinas between Just War and Pacificism|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics |date=June 2010 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=219–41 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2010.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt; He laid these out in his historic work, Summa Theologica:
* First, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.
* Second, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====School of Salamanca====
Some 200 years later, the [[School of Salamanca]] expanded Thomas's understanding of [[natural law]] and just war. Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. &lt;!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --&gt; Examples of "[[The Just War tradition|just war]]" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.
* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.
* War to punish a guilty enemy.

A war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.
* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.
* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.
* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is only legitimate as a last resort.

Under this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.

===Nature of God===
Thomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. "Therefore I say that this proposition, "God exists", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).

{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}
{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}

# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.
# 
# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.
# 
# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.
# 
# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}
# 
# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. {{H:title|Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well.|This we call God}}&lt;ref&gt;Summa of Theology I, q.2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the nature of God, Thomas felt the best approach, commonly called the ''[[negative theology|via negativa]]'', is to consider what God is not. This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:
# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;
# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas defined God as the '''Ipse &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi]&lt;/span&gt; subsistens'',' subsisting act of being.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''. See also Online Resources: ''&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi Electronic Journal]&lt;/span&gt;''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# God is infinite. That is, God is not finite in the ways that created beings are physically, intellectually, and emotionally limited. This infinity is to be distinguished from infinity of size and infinity of number.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt;
# God is immutable, incapable of change on the levels of God's essence and character.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
# God is one, without diversification within God's self. The unity of God is such that God's essence is the same as God's existence. In Thomas's words, "in itself the proposition 'God exists' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], for in it subject and predicate are the same."&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of Sin===
Following [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], Thomas defines [[sin]] as "a word, deed, or desire, contrary to the [[Divine law|eternal law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2071.htm#article6 |title=''Summa'', II–I, Q.71, art.6 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the analogous nature of law in Thomas's legal philosophy. Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either "natural law" (that determined by reason) or "divine law" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with "evil" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 ''Summa'', II–I, Q.75, art.1.] "For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing."&lt;/ref&gt;). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.

===Nature of the Trinity===
Thomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term "Trinity" "does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3&lt;/ref&gt; The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit "who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word."

This Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nichols, Aidan | title = Discovering Aquinas | publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | year = 2002 | pages = 173–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===
Thomas's five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being. For God as ''[[prima causa]]'' ("first cause") comes from Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] and asserts that God is the ultimate cause of all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nichols, Aidan | title = Discovering Aquinas | publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | year = 2002 | pages = 80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of Jesus Christ===
In the ''Summa Theologica'' Thomas begins his discussion of Jesus Christ by recounting the biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] and by describing the negative effects of [[original sin]]. The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. "Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, pp. 228–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] "to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |title=''Summa'', III, Q.50, art.1 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]'s views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to [[Saint Paul's]] assertion that Christ, "though he was in the form of God... emptied himself" ([[Philippians]] 2:6–7) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of divine immutability.&lt;ref&gt;"The Profession of Faith of the 318 Fathers", First Council of Nicaea – 325 AD, available at http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum01.htm, §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, "the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself."&lt;ref&gt;ST III.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ "emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature."&lt;ref name="dhspriory.org"&gt;Commentary on Saint Paul's Letter to the Philippians, available at http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm, §2-2.&lt;/ref&gt; For Thomas, "the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty."&lt;ref name="dhspriory.org"/&gt; Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ "emptied himself" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.

In short "Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''". Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, pp. 241, 245–49. Emphasis is the author's.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I answer that, The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in two ways. First as it is in itself, and thus it is altogether simple, even as the Nature of the Word. Secondly, in the aspect of person or hypostasis to which it belongs to subsist in a nature; and thus the Person of Christ subsists in two natures. Hence though there is one subsisting being in Him, yet there are different aspects of subsistence, and hence He is said to be a composite person, insomuch as one being subsists in two.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4002.htm#article4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Echoing [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], he said that "The only begotten Son of God...assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Weigel |first = George |authorlink = George Weigel |title = The Truth of Catholicism |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |year = 2001 |location = New York City |page =9 |url = |isbn = 0-06-621330-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal of human life===
Thomas Aquinas identified the goal of human existence as union and eternal fellowship with God. This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.

The goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature "because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision]." Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of heretics===
Thomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the Albigensian Crusade. In the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'', he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.

On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but "after the first and second admonition", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 ''Summa'', II–II, Q.11, art.3.])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century, which had a limited prison capacity. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.

Simple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas's point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas's suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a "secular tribunal" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics "deserve... death" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life ("For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&amp;version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Although the life of a heretic who repents should be spared, the former heretic should be executed if he relapses into heresy. Thomas elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:&lt;blockquote&gt;In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.

For this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For [[Jews]], Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Michael (December 1995), [http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics "Aquinas and the Heretics"], ''First Things''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic and its practitioners===
Regarding magic, Aquinas wrote that

* only God can perform miracles, create and transform (''[[Summa contra gentiles]]'' 102), 
* angels and demons ("spiritual substances") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments (ibid.,103), 
* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid.,105), 
*"demons" are intellective substances who were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.(ibid.,106-108), 
*if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake (''[[Summa theologica]]'' I, 114, 4).

A mention of witchcraft appears in the [[Summa theologica]]e&lt;ref&gt;[[Summa theologicae]] Supplement, q38 art 2 ''Whether a spell can be in impediment to marriage''. Note this Supplement was written or compiled by others after Aquinas' death&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that the Church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.

Under the ''[[canon Episcopi]]'', church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion. Thomas Aquinas was instrumental in developing a new doctrine that included the belief in the real power of witches{{Disputed inline|date=August 2018}}. This was a departure from the teachings of his master [[Albertus Magnus]] whose doctrine was based in the ''Episcopi''.&lt;ref&gt;GL Burr, ''Selected Writings'' ed. LO Gibbons (New York, 1943) p. 173-4.Original essay (1890) available [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ZUlAQAAMAAJ here].&lt;/ref&gt; The famous fifteenth century witch-hunter's manual, the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', also written by a member of the Dominican Order, begins by quoting Aquinas ("Commentary on Pronouncements" Sent.4.34.I.Co.) refuting{{Disputed inline|date=August 2018}} the ''Episcopi'' and goes on to cite Aquinas over a hundred times.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Kramer, ''Malleus Maleficarum'', trans. Christopher Mackay (Cambridge, 2009) 91-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters of the witch phobia that followed often quoted Aquinas more than any other source.&lt;ref&gt;Burr(1943)p.174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thoughts on afterlife and resurrection===
A grasp of Thomas's psychology is essential for understanding his beliefs around the afterlife and resurrection. Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter—which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also only comes into existence in the material body.

Human beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.

Resurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas's soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.

Thomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, "If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=461, 473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Aquinas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Thomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas's account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Thomas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.

==Modern influence==
[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]
Many modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas's [[virtue ethics]] as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian "sense of duty" (called [[deontology]]). Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] (especially in her book ''Intention''), Thomas's [[principle of double effect]] specifically and his theory of intentional activity generally have been influential.

In recent years the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' titled "Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas".

[[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[Mont Saint Michel and Chartres]]'' ends with a culminating chapter on Thomas, in which Adams calls Thomas an "artist" and constructs an extensive analogy between the design of Thomas's "Church Intellectual" and that of the gothic cathedrals of that period. [[Erwin Panofsky]] later would echo these views in ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'' (1951).

Thomas's aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers. Joyce refers to Thomas's doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA570#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'', James Joyce, Wordsworth 1992 edition, Introduction and Notes by Jacqueline Belanger, 2001, p. 136, note 309: "''Synopsis Philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae''  This appears to be a reference to ''Elementa Philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis'', a selection of Thomas Thomas's writings edited and published by G. M. Mancini in 1898. (G)"  https://books.google.com/books?id=C_rPXanc_HAC&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed 3-6-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).

==Russell's criticism of Thomas as philosopher==
Twentieth century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Thomas's philosophy stating that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Russell|1967|p= 463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, "St. Thomas Aquinas", Allen &amp; Unwin, London; Simon &amp; Schuster, New York 1946, pp. 484–.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism is illustrated with the following example: According to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage "on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment."&lt;ref name="Russell 1967 462"&gt;{{harv |Russell|1967|p= 462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, "No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged."&lt;ref name="Russell 1967 462"/&gt; It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as noted above,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's introduction of arguments and concepts from the pagan [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.  

[[Anthony Kenny]] suggests that Russell is failing to reflect on what philosophers, himself included, actually do: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book ''Principia Mathematica'' takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life. &lt;ref&gt;''Aquinas on Mind'', New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04415-4}}, 11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renzi, p. 42: https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed 4-24-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical edition of Thomas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1882–1903), the so-called [[Leonine Edition]].
Most of his major works have now been edited, the ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'' in nine volumes during 1888–1906, the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' in three volumes during 1918–1930.

[[Abbé Migne]] published an edition of the ''Summa Theologiae'', in four volumes, as an appendix to his ''[[Patrologiae Cursus Completus]]'' (English editions: [[Joseph Rickaby]] 1872, J. M. Ashley 1888).

Electronic texts of mostly the Leonine Edition are maintained online by the [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/ Corpus Thomisticum] (corpusthomisticum.org) by Enrique Alarcón, [[University of Navarra]], and at [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/20_50_1225-1274-_Thomas_Aquinas,_Sanctus.html Documenta Catholica Omnia].

Benhayon also claims that his daughter, Simone, a swimming teacher, is the reincarnation of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrivateEye"&gt;{{cite news|title=Quacks in the system|date=February 7, 2014|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1359|location=UK|pages=33|lay-url=https://archive.fo/249hg/c7fdb1f96c488d5b46c5de2968a8142c7fe3652b.jpg|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serge Benhayon devised Universal Medicine's healing practices based on the belief that disease is caused by energetic disharmony resulting from ill choices made in this and previous lifetimes. Benhayon teaches that there are two types of energy: [[prana]] ({{lang-sa2|प्राण}}, {{IAST|prāṇa}}; [[Sanskrit]] for [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]) and fire.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt; Most forms of established wisdom, knowledge and belief, as well as most music and certain foods are believed to contain prana, which he regards as evil.&lt;ref name="MOprana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/concerns-raised-over-prana-treatment|title=Concerns raised over 'prana' treatment|author=.|date=July 30, 2012|work=The Medical Observer|accessdate=February 1, 2015|location=Australia|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prana is to be rejected or cleared to be replaced with "fiery energy" which emanates from the "Atmic womb of God". Universal Medicine healing modalities and products, including teas, herbal elixirs, creams and laminated healing symbol postcards, aim to clear prana.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that people who abuse their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as children with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/disabled-jibe-appalling-former-mayor-slams-healer/3564026/|title=Disabled jibe 'appalling': Former mayor slams UM 'healer'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 1, 2018|work=Northern Star|language=en|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims disabilities such as [[Autism]] and [[Down syndrome]] are karma for past life sins. He has also controversially stated on many occasions that sexual abuse, including that towards children, is karma from past lives and the universe attempting to stop a person from continuing to make non-loving choices.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He also teaches that illness is caused by the [[Spirit possession|possession]] of the body by evil spirits, and is reported to have told a terminally ill patient that an evil spirit had entered her liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that for western secular women "the ultimate rape is rejection".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On race he writes that skin color evolution was a conscious choice and that Asians chose yellow skin, "yellow signifies the intellect" and the "pursuit of a lighter complexion arose when [[Black skin|Black]] (sic) became erroneously identified with the [[Darkness#Religion|Darkness]] (sic)."&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He taught his followers that if their children misspent their inheritance, or if they set conditions on their donations to UM, their "kidney energy" could be harmed in the next life.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-05/universal-medicine-cult-preyed-on-cancer-victim-jury-finds/10381432|title='We've been vindicated': Relief as jury finds 'socially dangerous cult' preyed on cancer victim|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=November 5, 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0pa_da3_9Y|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say Universal Medicine places unreasonable pressure on followers to adhere to a severely restricted diet and to avoid most exercise for fear those things might "infect their spiritual alignment" and lead to poor health.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt; After reviewing a diet chart from Universal Medicine, the Professor of Public Health at the University of Wollongong and former president of the Public Health Association of Australia Heather Yeatman said it was “a public health issue” when children were placed on such restrictive diets: “If a child is not having dairy or cereals they are likely to be low in energy intake and there could be the risk of stunting if children are not getting enough energy. It is critically important there is a balanced diet, especially at the weaning stage because it can impact overall growth and cognitive development. It’s a public health issue.” This came after the report of a baby of UM member parents was hospitalised due to diet-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/news-story/0bda4d34cca49375f852c4053fe4cc32|title=Court rules Universal Medicine founder is running a ‘harmful cult’|last1=Hansen|first1=Jane|date=October 21, 2018|work=The Sunday Telegraph|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.cultnews101.com/2018/10/court-rules-universal-medicine-founder.html|lay-source=republished}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benhayon's "esoteric connective tissue therapy" is said to improve the patient's energy flow by "allowing the pulse of the lymphatic system to symbiotically correspond with the body's own ensheathing web". Prof. John Dwyer describes the existence of a lymphatic pulse as "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; Universal Medicine also provides counselling services to parents, body awareness education workshops to young women&lt;ref name="MOYWCA" /&gt; as well as cardiosacral pulse and craniosacral readings.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt;

In November 2014 Universal Medicine's treatments were highlighted in a [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliamentary]] Inquiry report by the Health Care Complaints Committee which states:
:"While there is little anecdotal evidence to suggest actual harm caused by these treatments, concerns were raised that patients may forego seeking proper medical advice and care. Two patients who were undergoing therapies at Universal Medicine were independently diagnosed with cancer and bronchiectasis respectively, and required proper medical intervention in order to be properly treated."&lt;ref name="HCCC"/&gt;

Universal Medicine lobbied the local [[Don Page (politician)|NSW MP for Ballina Don Page]] to have these unfavourable comments removed from the Parliamentary Inquiry Report.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied" /&gt;

Most books burnt were on [[Chinese medicine]], [[kinesiology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]] and other [[alternative healing]] modalities, all of which Benhayon had decreed "prana"&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode" /&gt; which he considers "evil".&lt;ref name="MOprana" /&gt;

Serge Benhayon confirms revenue from Universal Medicine provides a living for the whole of the extended Benhayon family. In 2016, he had a taxable income of more than $188,000, and his wife, Miranda, $176,000. Approximately $50,000 of his income came from the Universal Family Trust, which also distributed $129,593 to his daughter Natalie, approximately $100,000 to his son Michael, $59,812 to his son Curtis and a further $34,890 to Curtis' wife Isabella. A further $400,000 went to another company. Benhayon's ex-wife Deborah Benhayon receives a salary as the chief financial officer for UM.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/discarnate-spirits-in-the-courtroom-as-healer-is-cross-examined-20180905-p501u5.html|title='Discarnate spirits' in the courtroom as 'healer' is cross-examined|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=September 5, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate to the value of $5.5 million has been linked to the group, including a $1.75 million property in Brisbane, and a hall valued at $2.3 million.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/lawyer-tells-jury-not-to-believe-conman-from-goone/3534608/|title=Lawyer tells jury not to believe 'conman from Goonellabah'|last1=McKeith|first1=Sam|date=September 26, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/similar/281659665970587|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The breasts are emanators of a quality of DIVINE TRUTH that begins at the heart.

Benhayon's daughter Simone is one of the Trustees of The Sound Foundation in the UK, a second related charitable organisation that Universal Medicine called one of its "two main world headquarters".&lt;ref name="PrivateEye" /&gt; The Sound Foundation was the subject of a 2013 complaint to the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] for England and Wales which found extensive irregularities and resulted in the charity being given a mandatory compliance plan.&lt;ref name="CharityCommission"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stothart|first=Chloe|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/charity-commission-hands-action-plan-health-charity/governance/article/1222011|title=Charity Commission hands action plan to health charity|work=Third Sector|date=November 25, 2013|location=UK|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062918/https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/charity-commission-hands-action-plan-health-charity/governance/article/1222011/|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also attracted attention from a [[National Health Service]] Forum who distanced itself from the group.&lt;ref name="Private_Eye_1361"&gt;{{cite news|title=Good news corner|date=March 7, 2014|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1361|location=UK|pages=32|lay-url=https://archive.fo/EgHFG/9048f56a6c8bf83690f6a3fbd40d70c9d197793d|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benhayon is the father of four children, all who hold positions within the organisation.

Universal Medicine is reported to have received a portion of AUD$709,493 federal funds to provide six public lectures and "counselling services to parents" under a Commonwealth grant scheme applied for by the [[YWCA]]. The Australian Government refused to fully release documents explaining how the funds were used, saying "YWCA raised objections… including that the information does not accurately reflect YWCA’s activities" and could "have an adverse effect on the YWCA by affecting its relationships with other entities and its reputation".&lt;ref name="MOYWCA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaye|first=Byron|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/government-blocks-ywca-documents|title=Government blocks YWCA documents|work=The Medical Observer|date=November 27, 2012|location=Australia|accessdate=January 11, 2015|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, twenty Universal Medicine adherents joined the Australian doctor's reform lobby group, the HPARA, en-mass causing turmoil and a split in the organisation. HPARA chair Dr John Stokes said the UM adherents, who "initially ... all seemed quite impressive and normal," unexpectedly began turning up to meetings and attempted to take over the organisation's social media accounts and board of directors without declaring their UM connections. "Some of them behaved in ways that made me feel quite uncomfortable, where they would come into my personal space," he recalled. Dr Stokes said there were concerns of reprisals and potential legal threats from the UM group, and that he and others expressed concern at HPARA being associated with the cult, but is now confident that no member with links to UM remains in the HPARA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/ahpra-lobby-group-distances-itself-universal-medicine|title=AHPRA lobby group distances itself from Universal Medicine|last=O'Rourke|first=Geir|last2=Smith|first2=Paul|date=October 24, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|publication-place=Sydney NSW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] in April 2018 revealed that [[The University of Queensland]] was investigating conflicts of interest of three of its faculty who were "acolytes" advocating for Universal Medicine. Video allegedly shows four researchers, two of whom are doctors, publicly advocating UM practices. Two more of the nine are presenters for the College of Universal Medicine. [[John Dwyer (medicine)|Professor John Dywer]] stated that: "[They] have let the university down badly in their fervour for promoting the benefits of Universal Medicine's approach to treatments, which have no basis in science, couldn't possibly be effective, and really represent a pre-scientific approach to how the body works and interacts with God and the universe". After receiving a 12-page letter from a third party whistleblower ''The [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' (JMIR) raised "serious concerns" as to the conflict of interest of the authors of the UM related articles it published. The editorial director stated that: "the omission of this conflict of interest, which appears to be highly significant in this case, is a clear violation of our policies"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/international/uq-researchers-accused-of-promoting-dangerous-cult/9663184|title='Cult' Universal medicine practices promoted by researchers, UQ launches investigation|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=April 16, 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=May 3, 2018|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCgY9voDJqM|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doctorportal.com.au/mjainsight/2018/16/the-researchers-the-university-and-the-bizarre-medical-cult/|title=The researchers, the university and the bizarre medical cult|last=Wilcken|first=Hugo|date=April 30, 2018|website=MJA InSight 16|publisher=AMPCo (Australian Medical Association)|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested both articles published in the JMIR should be retracted. JMIR was also "very concerned" when it was revealed that the "original results paper contained large statistical errors inflating the effect sizes" and concluded "the proposed and executed research does not provide any evidence that any Universal Medicine modalities are effective in making people healthier". When the original peer-reviewers of the papers were made aware of the extensive conflicts of interest, they stated they would not have accepted the manuscripts had they been aware of this fact upon submission.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JMIR Editorial Office|date=May 11, 2018|title=Expression of Editorial Concern, Correction of Conflict of Interest and Affiliation, and Data Corrections|url=http://publichealth.jmir.org/2018/2/e53/|journal=JMIR Public Health and Surveillance|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e53|doi=10.2196/publichealth.9932|issn=2369-2960|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018 Universal Medicine was compelled to cancel all their event and hire bookings with [[Ballina Shire Council]], including the Girl to Woman Festival, only days prior to the festival being debated in council chambers. UM took this action after 1,000 people had signed a petition to have the Girl to Woman event barred from [[Lennox Head]] Cultural Centre, and also to avoid becoming embroiled in a council policy motion that adopted child protection measures for future events and hiring "where the Council believes that provision of the service would pose a potential for child abuse". Council's amended policies concerning hiring and the tightening of child protection measures (not mentioning UM or the girl festival) were adopted, but not before UM had publicly criticised council's actions and long-term UM student and advocate Rebecca Asquith (Baldwin)&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; appeared at the council meeting on behalf of the festival urging councillors to oppose the motion.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.echo.net.au/2018/11/universal-medicine-cancels-event-bookings/|title=Universal Medicine cancels all event bookings|last=Shand|first=Asland|date=November 30, 2018|work=Echonetdaily|location=Byron bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/council-adopts-child-protection-measures-for-event/3582731/|title=Council adopts child protection measures for events|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 22, 2018|work=Northern Star|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-northern-star/20181123/281522227134747|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this, NSW Minister for Health, [[Brad Hazzard]], issued a directive for NSW Health to halt all dealings with Universal Medicine after UM-linked individuals and businesses were found to be involved in the annual Positive Adolescent Sexual Health (PASH) conference. The youth health initiative is backed by the [[NSW Department of Health]] and aimed at teens aged 15 years and up. Northern NSW Local Health District chief executive Wayne Jones said that UM members would be removed from the project and NSW Health would: "immediately review engagement and risks of health service involvement with Universal Medicine and discontinue any further association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/um-dealings-halted-by-ministers-directive/3588549/|title=UM dealings halted by minister's directive|last1=Turner|first1=Liana|date=November 28, 2018|work=The Northern Star|access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/cult-members-told-by-minister-to-leave-sexual-health-conference/news-story/1a9ae19e696254730e7b77efd4a52d31|title=‘Cult’ members told by minister to leave sexual health conference|last=Morton|first=Rick|date=November 28, 2018|website=The Australian|publisher=News Corp|archive-url=http://archive.is/kRrPk|archive-date=November 28, 2018|dead-url=y|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electoral district of Lismore|Lismore]] MP [[Thomas George (Australian politician)|Thomas George]] ([[National Party of Australia|Nationals]]) and [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidates for Lismore and [[Electoral district of Ballina|Ballina]], [[Janelle Saffin]] and Asren Pugh, supported the directive by the Health Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/um-affiliates-step-down-as-minister-calls-for-revi/3589564/|title=UM affiliates step down as minister calls for review|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 29, 2018|work=Northern Star|subscription=y|lay-url=http://www.pressreader.com/similar/281655371135910|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier Ms Saffin and ALP candidate for [[Division of Page|Page]] Patrick Deegan had called for an inquiry into UM to ensure that no government resources go toward any organisation regarded as a 'cult', and that government departments and agencies do not endorse, encourage or support the involvement of children and young people in any such organisation. Ms Saffin said: "An inquiry [into UM] would be opportunity to clear the air and to restore faith in our local institutions".

== Australian medical authorities and Dr Samuel Kim ==

Following an investigation by the NSW Medical Council in 2017 a Universal Medicine advocate and affiliated doctor, Samuel Tae-Kyu Kim was reprimanded for referring a patient for esoteric lung massage and chakra puncture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/doctor-found-guilty-over-referrals/3184226/|title=Doctor found guilty over referrals|last=Adams|first=Cathy|date=May 31, 2017|work=Northern Star|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=News Corp|location=Lismore NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; "knowing there was insufficient evidence for their efficacy as treatments for Patient A’s lung condition." The physician, whose clinic is located in the Universal Medicine Clinic in Goonellabah,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.echo.net.au/2017/05/universal-medicine-affiliated-doctor-reprimanded/|title=Universal Medicine affiliated doctor reprimanded|last1=Dobney|first1=Chris|date=May 30, 2017|work=Echonetdaily|accessdate=June 1, 2017|location=Byron Bay NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed chakra puncture is an "internationally recognized therapy", however only practiced by Universal Medicine. The Council heard evidence from a Senior Specialst and thoracic physician, who stated:
:Universal Medicine "affects an attitude which conventional medicine abandoned in the 19th century and this heightens the need to clearly distinguish for patients the difference between conventional medicine and Universal Medicine. Particularly as it is unclear, given it is a relatively new organisation, how Universal Medicine’s training programs are accredited."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The HCCC alleged Dr Samuel Kim had withheld conventional therapy&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Publications/Media-releases/2017/Dr-Samuel-Tae-Kyu-Kim---Unsatisfactory-professional-conduct|title=Dr Samuel Tae-Kyu Kim – Unsatisfactory professional conduct|last=HCCC|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=HCCC|archive-date=July 28, 2017|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728035528/http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Publications/Media-releases/2017/Dr-Samuel-Tae-Kyu-Kim---Unsatisfactory-professional-conduct}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the investigation focussed on his referrals to his now wife Jasna Jugovic (esoteric lung massage) and three "Universal Medicine practitioners" Neil Ringe (chakra puncture), Serge Benhayon (spiritual healing) and Michael Serafin (non-medically trained pharmacist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/31/doctor-rebuked-over-spiritual-healing-group-touting-esoteric-breast-massage|title=Doctor rebuked over 'spiritual healing' group touting 'esoteric breast massage'|last=Robertson|first=Joshua|date=May 31, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigating committee found Kim to lack contrition, and at times to be an unreliable witness and his evidence to be contradictory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following the enquiry, the [[Health Care Complaints Commission|HCCC]] found 5 out of 6 allegations against Dr Kim proven, him "guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct" (which he admits to), and concluded by placing permanent restrictions upon his practice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/250/Decision%20-%20KIM%20Samuel%20Tae-Kyu%20-%20PSC%20-%208%20May%202017.pdf.aspx|title=PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS COMMITTEE INQUIRY.

Dr Kim stood down from the [[Australian Medical Association]] Queensland council in May 2018 after ABC News investigated a second case of professional misconduct where he had shared the entire medical and medication records of a patient with Serge Benhayon without the patient's knowledge. The patient had criticised Universal Medicine in the media and Kim claims he obtained the patient’s verbal consent. The NSW Privacy Commissioner disagreed and found Dr Kim had breached Health Privacy Principles,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelimbic.com/respiratory/thoracic-physician-stands-down-in-dispute-over-links-to-esoteric-group/|title=Thoracic physician stands down in dispute over ‘esoteric’ group|last=Hoffman|first=Tessa|date=May 3, 2018|work=The Limbic|access-date=May 4, 2018|publisher=thelimbic.com|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; violated the patients privacy and its report said it was "unclear ... why it was necessary for Dr Kim to provide such a summary of what appears to be Mr Martin's entire medical history to Mr Benhayon".

== Legal Issues ==
In December 2015 Benhayon appeared at the [[Supreme Court of NSW]] when his sizeable inheritance from the estate of devotee Judith McIntyre was challenged by her children. The breast cancer victim's estate was estimated to be worth $1.1 million, $600,000 of which was intended for Serge Benhayon. A further gift of $800,000 was given to Benhayon by McIntyre three days after executing her will. Justice James Stevenson declined to alter the distribution of the estate and issued a ruling stating that Ms McIntyre "appears to have carefully considered how she should dispose of her estate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/cancer-victims-children-lose-appeal-to-overturn-will-which-bequeathed-majority-of-11m-estate-to-healer/news-story/ebe4db1a431eec20a02844a35d6b9e9d|title=Cancer victim’s children lose appeal to overturn will which bequeathed majority of $1.1m estate to healer|last1=Dale|first1=Amy|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3376253/Children-woman-died-breast-cancer-left-majority-1-1million-estate-health-guru-fail-legal-bid-challenge-will.html|title=Court rejects bid by the two children of a woman who died of breast cancer to get a share of the million-dollar estate she left to a 'health guru' whose followers call him the 'new Messiah'|last1=Noble|first1=Freya|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her death, UM followers had established themselves as Ms McIntyre's nurse, financial planner, the witness to her will, the lawyer who drafted it and its executor.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; In a later unrelated trial, a NSW Supreme Court jury found it was substantially true to say that Benhayon "preys on", "swindles" and "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills"&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/revealed-what-the-jury-said-about-socially-harmful/3553783/|title=REVEALED: What the jury said about 'socially harmful cult'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=October 19, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/similar/281724090530042|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and that he exercised "undue influence" on Ms McIntyre to inherit the bulk of her million-dollar estate.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; 

Emails released by Ms McIntyre’s daughter, Sarah, that were written by Benhayon to her mother during the last few months of her life, claimed that her children were “trying to destabilise you, trying to evoke your sympathy", which was "an attack on the funds that will help The Hierarchy's work on Earth". Benhayon also warned her against publicly revealing donations because evil spirits known as "the Dark Lodge" could "cause serious harm" to donors.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In June 2018 Justice McCallum, of the Supreme Court of NSW, ordered Benhayon to produce photographs and videos of workshops or sessions that relate to the technique of “Deeper Femaleness” which display the “hands on” healing technique practiced by Universal Medicine. He was also ordered to produce a list of donations received, tax returns and other financial statements. The ruling comes as part of an ongoing defamation trial in which Benhayon is suing a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lawyerly.com.au/judge-orders-spiritual-guru-produce-pics-hands-healing/|title=Judge orders spiritual guru to produce pics of ‘hands on’ healing|last=Fredenburgh|first=Cat|date=June 21, 2018|work=Lawyerly|access-date=June 23, 2018|publisher=Lawyerly Media|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-gave-client-ovarian-reading-20180624-p4znf9.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon gave client 'ovarian reading'|last=McClymont|first=Kate|date=June 24, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Benhayon sued a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation in the Supreme Court of NSW over social media posts she had made which he said portray him as: delusional, dishonest, a sexual predator and the leader of a "socially harmful cult". Rockett described Benhayon as a “sleazebag guru” and accused him of performing a "sleazy ovarian reading" on her during a treatment session, inappropriately touching her, and engaging in inappropriate conduct towards women. Rockett argued the defences of truth and honest opinion in connection to her social media postings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-not-a-cult-leader-court-20180904-p501mh.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon 'not a cult leader': court|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=September 4, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/self-styled-healer-serge-benhayon-leads-socially-harmful-cult-jury-20181010-p508ux.html|title=Self-styled healer Serge Benhayon leads 'socially harmful cult': jury|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=October 15, 2018|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 7 week trial, which began in September 2018, Benhayon described himself as a "teacher and practitioner" and also a "business owner". He said his teachings, which are offered as courses, were derived "from the tradition known as the ageless wisdom". He claimed the ageless wisdom had a "very strong lineage that includes the divine messengers", including Hermes, Plato, Pythagorasm, Jesus and Muhammad. He told the court that he "had an understanding", which was stronger than a belief, that in one of his many past lives he was Leonardo da Vinci&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; and Pythagoras&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;. Benhayon told Ms Rockett's barrister, Mr Molomby QC, that he could sense discarnate spirits in the courtroom who were nine feet tall, had no feet, and a "crevasse" where the nose was meant to be. He declined to count them and denied this was because he couldn't really feel their presence, saying "I could [count] if I wanted to but it's not something I practise and it's not something I'm allowed to do".&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/serge-benhayon-defamation-spirits-in-the-courtroom|title=This Faith Healer Suing For Defamation Says He's The Reincarnation Of Leonardo Da Vinci|last1=Sainty|first1=Lane|date=September 5, 2018|work=Buzzfeed News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Under cross-examination, Benhayon also stated that people who abused their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as disabled children. He agreed that during a Sacred Esoteric Healing course - level 1, that he had said that the Roman emperor Nero continues to reincarnate as an autistic child, while other authority abusers reincarnate as children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theherald.com.au/story/5630505/reincarnation-evidence-given-by-nsw-healer/|title=Reincarnation evidence given by NSW healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=September 6, 2018|work=Newcastle Herald|publisher=Australian Community Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-person jury completed answers to 58 pages of questions, primarily in Ms Rockett's favour and against Mr Benhayon. They found it was substantially true to say he led a "socially harmful cult", made "bogus healing claims", "intentionally indecently touched" clients, and as Ms Rockett claimed, that there were "reasonable grounds to believe" Mr Benhayon intentionally sexually preyed upon her and other clients during treatment sessions. It was also found substantially true to say Mr Benhayon was the leader of Universal Medicine, "a group which to his knowledge makes false claims about healing that causes harm to others", that he had an "indecent interest in young girls as young as ten whom he causes to stay at his house unaccompanied",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children",&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; "is dishonest", "is sexually manipulative of his cult followers", and "has persuaded followers to shun loved ones who won’t join his cult".&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/jury-declares-universal-medicine-leader-exploitative-charlatan|title=Jury declares Universal Medicine leader an exploitative charlatan|last=Smith|first=Paul|last2=Wright|first2=Jocelyn|date=October 16, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substantial truth findings by the jury were that he "vilifies people with disabilities", "exploited children by having them vouch for UM's dishonest healing practices",&lt;ref name="Byron_Echo" /&gt; "engages in bizarre sexual manipulation to make money for his business", "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills",&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/defamation-loss-for-universal-medicine-founder/3550048/|title=Spiritual healer 'leader of socially harmful cult': Jury|last=AAP|date=October 15, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/defamation-loss-for-nsw-spiritual-healer/news-story/ac8ef1934de9f0b26f474d27a2738b10?nk=a1e1a4580aa332c2cb6193e38afdfebd-1539593422|title=Defamation loss for NSW spiritual healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=October 15, 2018|work=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; "dishonestly promotes fraudulent ideas of karma for self-gain", "denigrates life and glorifies death"&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and "is a hypocrite because his Esoteric Healing has death as its goal."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The ''Northern Star'' also reported further substantial truth findings that "Serge Benhayon is the leader of a socially harmful cult that is paternalistic to women", "engages in inappropriate conduct towards women", "instructed students at Universal Medicine training workshops to touch the genitals of victims of sexual assault", "has engaged in bullying to stop Esther Rockett exposing that he is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children" and "is not a fit person to hold a Working with Children Certificate".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

The jury found allegations that Benhayon was "delusional",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; had "a propensity to touch girls inappropriately", "groped the genitals of various women under the guise of treating them" or "instilled fear and guilt in children to get them to do his bidding"&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; were not substantially true or upheld, instead they were covered by Rockett's qualified privilege.&lt;ref name="Serge_Activity" /&gt; Serge Benhayon has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Other privacy and confidentiality issues ==

An ex-patient and [[Health Care Complaints Commission|HCCC]] complainant,&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; who was vilified on Universal Medicine websites said the organisation accuses "everyone else of [[cyberbullying]] while embarking on a systematic, online pack hunt". Numerous students of the organisation unknown to the complainant have openly disputed her medical conditions online. Benhayon has defended the group’s right to do so.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt;

The former Queensland mental health commissioner was scathing of Universal Medicine after the UM "Facts Team" breached privacy and published an ex-UM client's full name, image and schizophrenia diagnosis online after he criticised them. Prior to the outing in 2018 the man had been anonymous. The former commissioner Lesley van Schoubroeck said:
:it is "entirely inappropriate for any organisation, particularly one purporting to be a health organisation, to publicly reveal identifying information of anyone's diagnosis, be it mental health or physical health" and "people with schizophrenia suffer stigma and discrimination in the workplace and in the community".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
When interviewed by the ABC the ex-client expressed concern about his future job prospects due to the privacy breach.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Vigyan Bhairav Tantra===
The ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra|Vigyan Bhairav Tantra]]'' is a chapter from the ''Rudrayamala Tantra''. It was introduced to the west by [[Paul Reps]], a student of [[Lakshman Joo]]. Reps brought the text to wider attention by including an English translation in his popular book ''Zen Flesh, Zen Bones''. Cast as a discourse between the god [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]], it briefly presents 112 meditation methods or centering techniques (''[[dharana]]''s).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reps, ''Zen Flesh, Zen Bones, A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings'' ({{ISBN|0-8048-0644-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zen Studies Society''' was established in 1956 by Cornelius Crane to help assist the scholar [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] in his work and to help promulgate [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Western countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 197&lt;/ref&gt;.   It operates both [[New York Zendo Shobo-Ji]] in New York City and [[Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-Ji]] in the Catskills area of New York State. Influenced by the teachings of [[Soen Nakagawa]] Roshi and [[Nyogen Senzaki]], ZSS is one of the oldest organizations dedicated to the practice of Rinzai Zen in the United States.   

The institution came under the leadership of [[Eido Tai Shimano]] in 1965.  Allegations of sexual and financial improprieties surfaced regarding Shimano, causing controversy in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tworkov, 192&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 Shimano and his wife resigned from the board of directors following the revelation of his relationship with a female student, amid accusations that this was only the latest in series of such affairs.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news
